3,"How common is it for men to call, text, or Facetime each other just to casually talk?


I remember arguing with a 24 year-old female associate where she thinks it's common for guys to call, text, or Facetime each other every day just to have a conversation. She based this on guys she know, which also led her to think that women have higher sex drives then men because the guys she know have a lower drive than their significant others. I should mentioned though that she's adverse to people being called ""weird"" or not ""normal"" due to her childhood experiences of being a social outcast from being thought of as the weird girl. 

Given that I'm a guy, my experiences have told me otherwise that male friendships are more activity based(with psychological studies even stating this). We may call it each other, but most of the time it's to set up or plan something. Sometimes we do talk over the phone, but it's only when something serious happens. When we do text it's usually because it's something profound or hilarious or to make plans to hang out later.

Otherwise I always thought this[ Family Guy scene was accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTidDRR8Scg). "

10,"How did you handle realizing you may not like your parents for who they are?


As I’ve started to think of my parent more as a person rather than my parent and spending time with them as such, I’ve began to doubt if I like them as a person. It’s conflicting because the love and support are unwavering but their behavior and seemingly lack of social awareness makes me uncomfortable and not enjoy our time together.

14,"What’s up with nudes?


I don’t understand why so many guys ask random women for nudes when they can access virtually the same thing (visually speaking) on the internet without having to go through the process of asking someone and potentially causing an issue with them. It seems like a simple alternative to me. When there’s professional porn stars and people that post sexual content online, why harass women for nudes? What’s the appeal? "
15,"What types of ""red flags"" do you see in yourself, and how do you go about correcting it?


There's quite a few posts about seeing ""red flags"" in other people (former SOs), but what about recognizing these red flags in yourself? And if you did, how did you go about correcting this behaviour? "
16,"I just watched a couple park their car in the fire lane, throw on the hazards, and head inside to do some shopping. The car was still there 25 minutes later when I left. What's the best way to handle this in the future?


Asking as a general question. I'd like to just call and get them towed, but there's no guarantee that the car will still be there when the tow truck arrives. And I'd like to just handle it instead of getting anyone in the store involved because this is a busy place and the staff is usually swamped. "
17,"How did you find out your girlfriends ring size?


Sup everyone first time posting and wanted to know how you guys found out your girls ring size. Im thinking of taking her out to eat while getting her hammered, giving her the D and when she's asleep use the adjustable ring sizer I have. I appreciate all responses."
18,"What do you think would happen to the dating landscape if the average guy put as much effort into his appearance as the average girl?


This is something I've been thinking about lately. I've seen nothing to counter out the feeling in my head that, on average, as guys we are not putting nearly as much effort into how we dress &amp; look as girls do.

There seems to be a lot of factors holding back guys from experimenting as they grow up with what 'works' for them visually, whereas it's expected of women to want to do that. 

People online can say it doesn't work like that but where I've grown up any guy who put very much effort into his hair or dress sense was asking to get teased or mocked for possibly being gay and among kids anything that makes you stand out is going to be inviting mockery. 

It's funny how self-destructive this is for us guys since it's a fact that being well put together is a huge help for getting attention from the ladies.

22,"Genuinely happy guys of Reddit, how do you do it?


I’ve always been a neutral and dry person for as long as I can remember. It’s caused me to have a close to nonexistent social life and a crippling mentality. Most of it had to do with my upbringing but now that I’m aware of the issue, I’m in the driver’s seat now. But I have no idea how to go about making the change.

Don’t mean to treat this place like a shrink office, just lost atm and need clarity. 

Thanks in advance dudes
