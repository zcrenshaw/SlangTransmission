For me it would be no showers after 10pm; not exactly a strange rule because the bathroom was next to the bedrooms. But even now when I live alone I feel a little weird taking a late night shower."
1,"How do you ""dirty talk"" your woman? [Serious] NSFW


I'm 33 with a rather healthy sex life. My gf of 5 yrs always wants dirty talk in the bed. So I attempt to do so because it noticeably improves her experience. I always feel like an idiot, or like I'm saying the same thing over and over. So what exactly do you say? I need some pointers and new ideas. Thanks in advance for any help."
2,"Guys/Gals of Reddit. How can I politely tell my GF that I don't enjoy her BJ's


The title pretty much says it all. I love my GF, she is smart, sexy, she has an amazing personality,and will.go above and beyond to do things for me. I frankly don't believe I deserve her, but one thing I hate is her blowjobs, first time she did it, it was horrible, but I attributed that to nervousness or inexperience, so I lied to her and told her it was amazing, that was a profound mistake. This has been going on for about a year and I just can't take it anymore. I have rejected her overtures, but she is persistent as hell. I don't know what to do. I need some good sound advice."
3,"What's the female equivalent of ""being a gentleman"" when dating?


So the last guy I dated was *extremely* gentlemanly from the moment I met him and won me over straight away (I'm a girl). Stuff like offering to pay for my Uber home (he didn't have his car and it would have cost $100), piggybacking me when my feet hurt, giving me his jacket, offering to pay for all my food and anything I even glanced at in a shop, making sure I was taken care of at all times. 

This got me thinking, how should a girl act to similarly impress a guy they're chasing, or doesn't it work like that? I don't think ""being a lady"" and simply having good manners has the same effect."
4,"How to stop cumming quickly when girlfriend is too attractive?


Been with this girl for about 3 months. Is it normal that I can’t last for more than about 2 minutes at most. We’ve tried a lot of different positions and most just make it worse. It’s extremely embarrassing. I know she’s getting fed up but she’s trying to save my feelings by not saying anything. She has a very high sex drive so I know this is affecting her. This has never happened before, only with her. "

8,"Men who exclusively text through Snapchat even though you have a girl’s number, why?


This has been happening to me(F) a lot lately and it’s happened a few times over the years. A guy will have my number and get my Snapchat, only to exclusively text me through Snapchat even though it’d be (I would think) much easier to just text. These guys I’m talking about are definitely single too, so it’s not like they need the conversation to go away immediately. 

I’m wondering because they do NOT make the conversations sexy. They just initiate regular conversations, and even if I engage in it for a long time, it doesn’t get there. 

Why not just regularly text??? I don’t remember what I said a lot of times so I don’t want a conversation that keeps disappearing. Also I don’t post on Snapchat a lot so it’s not like they’re getting pictures of me or seeing “stories” of what I’m up to. "

So, I frequent this food establishment and have had the same sever the last several times I have been there.

I am wanting to ask her if she is seeing anybody and I would like to know if there is an acceptable way to do this?

A couple ideas I have are to wait until she brings the credit slip back to add tip and sign.

a) Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? (if yes) Are you seeing anyone?

b) Would you be interested in getting drinks with me next week?

Thoughts?"

16,"Men of Reddit: How do I improve my self-worth when I can see I'm failing compared to most guys my age?


Ok, so here's why I think I'm failing as a man (I'm 27, just for context):

* I have suffered from social anxiety since I was 18 and it still isn't better yet. It has hampered my life in many ways: I have 2 acquaintances in the world and that's it. Most guys have several friends of both sexes.
* My job is to write blog posts from home. Not only do I earn very little for this work ($1000-1500 per month) but it also completely isolates me. Most guys my age are well-established in careers they enjoy, earning great money, with co-workers whom they drink with regularly and eat lunch with. 
* I traveled alone to south-east Asia when I was 23 for 6 weeks, I lived in Australia when I was 25 for 3 months, and I have lived on and off in Thailand for the last 3 years. However, during none of those experiences have I made any long-term friends or even socialized really. I met some people, but nowhere near as much as your average guy who has done all that traveling. 
* I've never had muscles or a six-pack in my life. I've been skinny fat since 16. I can't find anything better to do with myself than drink alcohol. 
* I've had sex with only two women in my whole life, and outside of those relationships, I've never been on a date. Most guys in their late 20s have experience to the extent they've slept with probably 10 women but at least 5. 

As you can see, my self-worth is rock bottom. I constantly compare myself to guys my age, both guys I'd see on social media and my hypothetical idea of what a guy my age should have achieved. If anyone has advice for improving my self-worth and getting out of this painfully negative mindset I'd appreciate it. 

As I edge towards 30, I'm consumed with the thought that I've fucked up my youth in a state of isolation and anxiety. And what most horrifies me is the thought of never recovering.

Thanks for any advice."

Ah missionary, while having a wide range of sexual positions is good, you’ll always end up doing the tried and true missionary position from time to time.
