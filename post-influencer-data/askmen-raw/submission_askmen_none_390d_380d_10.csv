I think mine was *""A man always has to know how to go without.""* Really helped me to not develop a scarcity mentality and not obsess over things I desired."
1,"What has your SO done recently that pissed you off?


I just gotta vent guys.

My wife, I love her death, but the other day she made my blood boil.

She's a school nurse so she has the whole summer off. I'm a lawyer so I'm obviously still working every day. The other day she slept in until noon, as she has nearly every other day this summer. Also like most other days this summer, she put on her pjs and just watched tv most of the day. On this particular day I was having a fairly overwhelming day at the office, just juggling a bunch of different crap 9 hours straight. So much so that when she woke up and texted me to ask how my day was going, I only had time to respond ""busy busy."" It was that kinda day.

I finally get off and deal with my commute home which I absolutely hate most days (NYC to jersey). I walk up to our apartment (a 4 floor walk up) and open the door. She comes over to greet me and before I can even take my wallet out of my pocket she begins to ask if I can take the garbage out. She goes ""oh can you take...actually never mind you can take the trash out later.""

Are.you.fucking.kidding.me. You've been home all day doing nothing. We have no kids. You know I had a busy day and you know I hate my commute home.

I immediately responded ""why didn't *you* take it out??"" She responds in that jeez ok kinda tone ""ok so I'll take it out later...""

Fucking hell. I immediately jumped in the shower and cursed her out to myself to avoid confrontation.

Sigh. Anyway, anyone else wanna vent?"
2,"How can I make sure that I always have an extremely low resolution camera available at all times just in case I see a UFO, Bigfoot, Chupacabra, or the like?


My phone has a 20 megapixel camera which is just way too high. I was thinking about maybe getting a disposable camera and putting scotch tape over the lense to keep in my pocket, but I'm totally open to other ideas. "
3,"I'm 23 and my dad just died suddenly, what do I do?


I'm not sure what this post is for besides asking ""what do I do?"" I live across the country(new job), I'm flying home today for my mom and to set up the funeral, but how do I support my mother through this when I have to fly back to work next week? She forms but has already said she can't afford the house without my dad,   her support system down there is non-existent-he was the charismatic one, she's quiet and has much less real connections..and I'm not even close to being ok because I forgot to call the night before he died(Idk if I can forgive myself). It was a sudden death, he wasn't sick and was just 58.. idk what to do"

5,"How to create instead of just consuming?


I was watching the footy the other day and I realised I have hobbies and mates and I occupy myself but I never actually create anything of my own. I read books, watch football, go out with mates, but I have no creative pursuits and I have no idea where to start"

11,"How do I hold myself accountable and make myself get off my ass and do what I need?


I have a severe problem with procrastinating. It's awful. I've been planning to start working out since July. I put off bills. I don't talk to anyone because I just put off replying. I intend to do it all, then the moment passes and I say ""I'll do it tomorrow"" or ""in just a bit"" or whenever and that day never comes. And then it goes on and on and on and I need to change, but I have no clue how. 

How can I make myself do what I say I need to do? Don't just say ""you gotta do it, that's all"" because if it were that easy I'd be fit and not on Reddit right now. Can anyone give me advice? I don't want to procrastinate my life into ruins."
12,"Do guys ever think ""That girl is too much for me?"" If yes, how so and why?


Female here. Ever since I was a teenager, I sometimes find myself criticizing the way I am. Before it was more about how I was thinking enough, but no that I'm in my mid 20s, I sometimes think that I might be ""too much"" for a man. Things like:

""I'm too sarcastic""
""I'm too independent""
""I'm too loud""
""I'm too mean/blunt/honest""

Sure, there are times when I say that I'm not enough in other ways but I find myself thinking ""I'm too much"". I will always remember when two of my guy friends said that I was ""too independent and not girly enough"" to attract a certain guy.

Curious if men actually think this about some women (""That girl is too much so I don't wanna date her""). Share examples and walk me through why you came to that conclusion. No examples? Just send over your thoughts ;) "

14,"What are your thoughts on your significant other being able to track your location?


Long distance (I guess it matters a bit here) Girlfriend of 8 months casually brought up FindMyFriends and tried pushing enabling my location for her. Am I in the wrong to think that this is just over the top?"

16,"Men of Reddit, what is the stigma with single women who are over 30, have never had kids and have never been married?


In your opinion, is there something “wrong” with us, or is it all circumstantial?

I feel that in the current dating world I am either seen as a threat or a unicorn. Sadly, it’s seemingly more of the former. "
17,"The AskMen Book Club: It Begins...


After the positive response to the previous [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/984tm1/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_starting_an_raskmen/) the mods have agreed to let us have a book club. This thread is an introduction to the club and will hopefully answer any questions you may have about it.

**Why** are we doing this? Because books are cool, that's why. More seriously, I am hoping that we will use this club to read books that are of particular interest to men and discuss the issues they may raise or just how awesome they are. Hopefully we will all discover some exciting books that we wouldn't otherwise have read.

**Who** can take part? Anyone subscribed to this subreddit, irrespective of their gender. You don't have to read every single book and are free to come and go as you please.

**What** will be reading? Books that interest men. This could be for many reasons, such as: the intrinsic manliness of the story, badass male characters, an author that was an interesting man, explorations of masculinity or issues that are relevant to men.  We will primarily read fiction, with the occasional non-fiction work as well. The only rule is that the book must be written by a man.

**When** will this take place? Every Monday, starting today.

**Where** will this take place? In a weekly thread started by me in this subreddit.

**How** is this going to work? Each month we will have a new book to read. September's book is **Casino Royale** by Ian Fleming. This means that as it the first book, you all have more than a month to read it. We can talk about the books in the weekly threads. At least one thread a month will be given over to book suggestions/choosing future books/discussing how to improve the club etc.

You can use this thread to ask any further questions you have about the book club, offer suggestions about the running of it, or point out something I've overlooked.

TL;DR: AskMen has a book club now and you're all welcome. The first book is **Casino Royale** by Ian Fleming. There will be weekly threads every Monday where we can chat about the books."

19,"What if I’m alone forever? It happens to a lot of men right?


I just don’t compete well against other males, and as far as reproduction goes it’s a competitive world out there. I don’t see being in a relationship in the cards for me. This makes me really sad, thinking of being forever alone. How do I come to terms with this and remain happy?"
20,"Guys who have been asked by women to buy them a drink, why did you say ""No""?


So a long time ago, maybe a year or two ago, I was at a bar with some friends. I'm having a good time, buying my homies drinks when a girl walks up to me. She was sort of cute. Maybe a 6 really. She wrapped her hands around me and said, ""Hey how about you buy me a drink"". I looked at her, then I looked at the drinks that I ordered probably 4 minutes ago. I grabbed them, looked back at her and said, "" nahh"". 

Proceed to hand my homie a drink and was called an asshole by the same women. I didn't know this girl and the only interaction was her buying me a drink. So of course I said no. 

So men, why did you say no? "

23,"Any boring guys here who landed a relationship? What’s your secret?


When I say boring, I really mean boring. 

I’m introverted as fuck. I have no hobbies. I work and then I sleep all day. If I’m not sleeping I’m watching ants Canada on YouTube. What a great conversation starter right? 

*hiiiii I sit at home all day and watch some guy keep 100 ant farms in his bedroom*

Other than that I have no hobbies or interests.  I hate going out. My family is a bunch of alcoholics so I despise drinking. I used to like video games but now The only game I play anymore is an “idle” game where you literally just leave the app open and it progresses itself. That’s how lazy and boring I’ve become. 

The best people for me are people who do 99% of the talking because since I do absolutely nothing with my life I have absolutely nothing to talk about. But this is a flaw for me because women mistake that as me being uninterested in them past a friendship. And I have yet to find a Women in their 20s that wants to date someone who acts like a retired old man. 

How the fuck does someone like me meet someone and not die alone? "
