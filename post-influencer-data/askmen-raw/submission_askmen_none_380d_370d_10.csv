0,"Ive been seeing this girl for 2 weeks now and I don’t really know her name. How do I casually learn her name at this point?


I met this girl when I was completely smashed. We had a good time and we’ve seen each other multiple times since. However, I don’t quite remember this girls name and I feel terrible. I suck at learning names and I’ve gotten to the point where if you tell me your name I don’t even try to remember it. But since me and her hit it off, this way of thinking has backfired completely. 

Whenever I see her I say stuff like “hey, girl!” or things that dance along the lines of greeting you but not acknowledging your name. I fear that sooner or later this charade will come to an end and I’d really like to not lose her because I’m super into her. 

I’ve contemplated on asking her how to spell her name, or maybe even asking what her last name is. So far searching her number into Facebook and Google has not yielded anything conclusive. All I know is that she’s Columbian and I think she has a Spanish name. Possible Felicia, but I’d hate to guess it and be wrong.

Should I come out and ask her what her name is and risk the back lash or can I play ignorance that I don’t speak Spanish and it didn’t really stick? "

2,"How do women's vaginas feel different during penetrative sex?


Forget peniz size. Let's talk about vaginas.

I'm a woman and this post was inspired by another post I recently made about penis size. 

There is always so much talk about penis size, and yes women do discuss it amongst themselves (bigger doesn't always mean better) but where's the open discussion about vaginas?

I want to know the ins and outs (pun intended) of vagina size / wetness / tightness / shape and so on. 

Do women really feel that different inside? What makes sex more or less enjoyable?
What does it feel like in there?

I know not all sex is heterosexual (duh) but I am curious specifically about the whole penis in vagina thing. 

Women who have sex with women are still welcome to share their insights though (I'm bisexual myself).

Thanks!

HELLO!

We've recently noticed an influx of questions starting with ""what do you think of"" followed by absolutely anything.

And by ""we"" I mean [me](https://i.imgur.com/pyjDSP3.jpg) and by ""recently"" I mean LITERALLY ALWAYS. From now on, questions that start with ""what do you think of"" falls under frequently asked and all of them will be [send to gulag](https://i.imgur.com/cba2Apj.jpg).

the one and only answer to the question ""What do you think of this/that/him/her/men/women/women with a bit of fat/women with no fat/people who use apostrophes in plural/men who drink/men who don't drink/a 18 year old virgin/a 20 year old virgin/a guy who hasn't had sex yet/a guy who hasn't kissed anyone yet/a guy who is literally dead/The downfall of the Soviet Union/guys with short dicks/guys with long dicks/girls with small boobs/girls with big boobs/the death of Josip Broz and dissolution of Yugoslavia/women who use sex toys/women who don't etc etc ETC""

is ""nobody cares"" but after that, ""SOME LIKE IT AND SOME DON'T"". The [one and only answer](https://i.imgur.com/eXM8zLC.png) possible, ever.

As such, there is absolutely NO POINT in posting these questions.

From now on, these kind of questions will be treated as Frequently asked, and maybe also as a yes/no question and [WILL BE REMOVED](http://i.imgur.com/qOW9uSJ.gifv) by automoderator. In case you think your question still has any kind of merit, feel free to message the moderators about it.

6,"How do you start seeing yourself as a sexual being (and getting others to see you as such)?


The idea of me even making a move on a girl just seems completely alien and undoable, let alone being in a relationship or having sex.  Like it doesn't apply to my life. I think most people around me have similar thoughts about me, which is frustrating because I do in fact want to be sexual.   
  
I assume I'm not alone in feeling like this; has anybody ever found themselves in this mindset before, and how'd you get out of it?

7,"How do you find a girl that shares similar values/belief/maturity?


I am 25 and back in college. I joined the military shortly after high school and ive done a lot and seen a lot of things. I have no problem communicating, being social, dressing well, or being in shape. Im alright in the looks as well.

But I just feel so much older and annoyed by everyone around me (boys and girls) even ones close to my age. I cant go out drinking at bars every other night like a LOT of them do, and I feel like a lot of people are not at the same stage in life as I am. The 20 somethings Ive tried talking to still wont work and live with their parents and want to be treated like princesses that get everything handed to them (boys and girls). And Ive tried the tinder thing and its been pretty horrible. Even without tinder people just want to keep being one upped with everything. Well you need a funnier pick up line than that, you need to take me on a better date than last week, you need to buy the more expensive alcohol this time, or whatever it is. One girl after the first time getting coffee told me (along these lines) ""you need to make at least 80k, have a car and another for me, and..."" listed a few things off. I couldnt stop but think ""what are you bringing to the table?"" 

It doesnt help that I have ""boring"" hobbies. Does anyone have any advice? Sorry if this was against the rules, I read a lot of the frequently asked questions also and did not see it.

TLDR: How to find someone more mature with similar values. "

""Quitting your job with 0 dollars and nothing lined up is a GREAT idea!"" ""Yes, you should absolutely invade Russia in the winter!"") but since you're a lucky fuck it worked out great. "

14,"Introverted guys of reddit: How do you accept yourself in an extroverted society that emphasizes having friends, constant partying, and casual sex?


I'm 28 and heavily introverted. I can't help but feel a lack of acceptance of myself and my introverted ways. I feel like an alien in a society that emphasizes extroverted traits. I feel guilty about not being the guy who has lots of friends, who parties all the time. Who has lots of casual sex. Who works in an extroverted office with meetings, lunches, and after work drinks with co-workers.

I don't even know if I want these things or if I should want them because they seem more fun. Extroverts just seem to have infinitely more fun and exciting lives by virtue of meeting so many people. All that stuff is effortless for them but hard for me."
15,"My boyfriend works a difficult labour job and comes home exhausted. What are some next-level creative things I can do to help him relax when he gets home?


He works his ass off at a very tough early morning construction job and comes home sore, banged up, and pretty tired. He is the love of my life, he's always sweet and funny and in a good mood no matter how shitty his day was. He never complains, he does his share of the housework and pitches in to help cook the meals (I do most of the cooking because I love doing it and I'm better at it anyway haha) and goes out of his way to make my life easier which I am in awe of. I'm always amazed that he has the emotional and physical energy to do this despite his demanding job and I just love and appreciate him so much for working so hard and pushing through and I want to show him in some tangible ways. 

We take pretty good care of each other and we're loving and nurturing for one another. We show affection a lot and tell each other how much we appreciate each other all the time. I do plenty of the usual suspects to show my appreciation and help him relax: take care of the housework while he plays video games or naps, foot/bag rubs, bake his favourite snacks, enthusiastic and regular sexytime, sporadic ""just because"" texts throughout his day, etc.

But what are some more creative, outside-the-box ways I can show him that I appreciate him and make his life after his long-ass day of work that much better? "

18,"How common is it for men to *never* feel sexually desired? (Even men who have a normal history of dating and relationships)


Just wondering if I'm an anomaly. I would say I have a pretty normal dating history - mid-twenties right now with 2 LTRs under my belt and several short term dating experiences. But even though I've received glowing reviews from all of these women, I have not once felt they were giving me that type of animalistic desire you see in movies. Straddling me passionately, kissing me like a starving tigress, jumping my bones as soon as I get home from work, etc.

It always feels like I have to put all the passion into the relationship and she just passively reciprocates by laying there. And occasionally when I ask for it she'll be ""active"", but again only when it's directly requested.

I've tried doing things like self-improving, maintaining stellar hygiene, eating pussy all the time, etc. But none of it seems to matter.

Is this a common experience among men, or is it something about me in particular? What is your experience with this stuff?"
