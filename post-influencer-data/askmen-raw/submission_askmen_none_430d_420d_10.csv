1,"I may have accidentally sexually harassed a coworker and I need to know how to solve this. We go back to work on Monday.


I was heading to the finance department yesterday, just before ending the day,  to get some clarification on something. I was walking behind a female employee who is around my age. I actually didn't recognize her but she definitely works for the company. Her phone rang, she went to answer it, apparently it was in her boob cuz she reached in there, but then dropped it as she pulled it out and she bent over to get it.

I don't know if she knew I was behind her or not but she bent over too quickly for me and her ass went straight into my crotch and on instinct I grabbed her waist/side of the butt so I didn't fall over. I wobbled to the side and smacked into the ball and we locked eyes....I froze then chuckled nervously and walked on.

Later in the evening, I randomly thought of the incident and have been paranoid that she thinks I grabbed her lower area on purpose. I swear on my life it was instinct. I need to know how to handle this. If she goes to HR on Monday, they will believe whatever she says and I will lose my career. I cannot lose my career. I worked hard to get where I am at and I cannot get this out of my head. I was thinking of showing up early and waiting for her to pull in so I can apologize. Is that the smart thing to do or is that stalker ish?

How do I handle this? If I lose my job I will lose my life."

4,"Dating profiles: What's the female equivalent to holding a fish?


Hey dudes!

I hear all the time about stereotypical men's dating profiles (holding a fish, quoting The Office, ""this is not my baby,"" etc). What is the equivalent to that in women's profiles? Or even if it isn't particularly annoying, what do you see over and over again? 

Alternately, is there anything you'd personally want to see more of that you rarely or never do? Can go for pics, bios, etc.

Post which app(s) you're on please! Thanks!"

8,"How do you deal with not having many friends or a girlfriend in your life?


Just trying to make the most of my life. I'm 35 and mostly all i do is play video games, work, read occasionally, and go to the movies by myself. I have a few friends in my city but they are pretty much fake friends who never initiate contact or try to hang out with me (when i try to hang with them or ask to hang with them they are always busy). I definitely would like to get laid again at some point in my life but not having any luck with that right now. Also, most of my attempts at making friends lately have failed. Some of the friends i just mentioned who dont really talk to me I met through Meetup. 

I just want to enjoy my life. I don't have much fun on the weekends. I live in a big city. I am stuck at a shitty job I hate right now because for the last few years I have been trying to leave it, but my applications constantly get turned down (I work at a warehouse but trying to get into sales ). My point is i just got to make the most of my off time. "

17,"[UPDATE] I may have accidentally sexually harassed a co-worker. How do I solve this? **Outcome**


This is an update to Saturday's thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8yteal/i_may_have_accidentally_sexually_harassed_a

I appreciate all of the advice and support. I went ahead and emailed HR and my boss Saturday afternoon. To HR I requested an important meeting and to my boss I let him know I had to meet with HR Monday morning. My boss called me and i ended up explaining the situation to him. He got a little paranoid but said I should be okay. 

So this morning I met with the HR manager. I explained the situation and my concern. She said she appreciated me going to them first. I couldn't really read her and she didn't  say much nor ask many questions. She sent me to the VP of HR whom I never met as she got the job just a few months ago. I explained the situation once more but this woman was a bit out of line. She started grilling me, asking why I didn't grab something else which I told her I couldn't I mean it was in a narrow hall and the situation happened in just seconds. She had a ""hmmph"" type of attitude but said nothing would be done anyways unless the woman complained.

I asked if there was a camera in the hall and she said she wasn't sure but that she would check and get back to me later. She got back to me, via email, and said she reviewed video with security and found no issue. Here's the shit: she said she'll make note in my file. Make note in my file? Why is there a file to begin with for nothing? I was a bit intimidated to ask that so I just thanked her.

Why is there now a file on me? Is this gonna count as some documented incident to pile up on me if I ever got in some heat? What should I do from here?"

21,"Why is doing repetitive grind in game for nothing more gratifying than doing repetitive thing in work where you actually earn money?


I don't even play games now but when I think back the days when I do, grinding Diablo 2 or raiding in WoW, I can't seem to fully comprehend why that, working (boring job) and gaming (Grind type of game), these two essentially same boring activities felt so different? Why is it that a boring game can provide instant gratification but a boring job can't? "
