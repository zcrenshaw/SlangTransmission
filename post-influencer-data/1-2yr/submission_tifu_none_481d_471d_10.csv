"TIFU by getting Google to ban our entire company while on the toilet


**TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

Preface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won't be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It's safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

I have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. 

As a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: ""Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

Recently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

About an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

One of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. 

The afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.

Eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

Anyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?

Yeah...

So it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions.

So yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved."
"TIFU by setting my wifi hotspot to ""Bomb Detonator""


Title says most of it.  I was at a tech conference today.  I like to broadcast random WiFi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the Planet Fitness  I thought it would go over well as a joke.  I mean, who hasn't seen ""FBI Surveillance Van"" as a network?

*Holy fuck.*  **Do not do this!!!**

Cops got called.  I got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  They asked a lot of questions.  They had to make sure I'm not a threat.  I cooperated fully.  I have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  I was told I wasn't being charged.  I was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

Flash forward two hours and I go to log into my work email on my phone.  Huh.  Password failed.  Huh, again.  Ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  Pull out the laptop, remote into my work PC.  Go to log in.  ""Your account has been disabled. Contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later I get the text message.

*You are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today’s events surrounding you being removed from the &lt;venue&gt;. You are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. We will contact you when the investigation is complete.*

tl;dr: Immature joke kills career, film at 11.

"TIFU by flipping off my four year old neighbor.


I'm a salty fucker. I'll admit that from the jump. I can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He's a little fucking hellion. 

His hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work. I got so sick of being stared at by this little troll, so I flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as I was getting into my car. He immediately started screaming and crying. As I drove off, I felt...weirdly satisfied. Seriously, it was the most fulfilled I'd felt in WEEKS. So, I immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. Each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. It made me bitterly happy.

This morning, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw the demon child in the window again...giving me THE STARE...and I flipped him off. Only this time I heard the bellow of ""HEY FUCKER!"". The kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and I didn't see him. I sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the car. I got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

I'm at my girlfriend's place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. Kind of dreading going back; thinking that I'll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.

TL;DR: I've been flipping off my nasty little four year old troll of a neighbor for almost a week now. His daddy caught me doing it this morning and now I'm probably gonna get my ass beat."
"TIFU by unzipping my balls


Not sure if this disqualified me but it actually happened a few minutes ago. Just before my shower I decided to do a bit of manscaping on the ol’ vagina miner. Grabbed the dedicated clippers and went to town knocking back some of that Kentucky fescue when I spotted one slightly angry looking follicle. Positionally, we’re talking less on Alvin and moreso on the chipmunks. As any sane person would do, I grabbed some tweezers with the intention of yanking the little shit out (the hair not the dick). I squeezed the hair with my tweezers, and being the baby I am, gave it a fast tug. And because the universe is a cold-hearted bitch, it turned out that this hair wasn’t your standard ingrown. Nah. This greedy fiber decided it wasn’t enough to coil up in a small ball and just uncoil like your grandmother’s knitting yarn. Instead, it chose to grow at a near 90° to my taco bender so when I gave it that sweet tug of justice it split open my hog like FedEx shipping envelope. And so here I stand with one hand clutching toilet paper against my angry inch while the other types this out to you fine dimes. Hope you have a great Saturday and can manage to keep your favorite penis in better shape than I have. 

TL;DR - Yanked an ingrown hair that happened to be growing sideways and sliced open my testicles like a bag of off-brand cereal. "
"TIFU by whistling at my wife.


What you need to know:

My wife and I live on the 6th floor of a condo complex and the weather has been fantastic. Lots of people are taking to the balconies to get some sun and relax.  We also have a small market just below where we do our grocery shopping.

Here's the Fuck Up.

My wife needed a few things and I took this time to enjoy a beverage outside.  As I sat there drinking I noticed her come out of the store so I let out a short whistle.  Think cartoon wolf with eyes bulging and tongue rolling out.  But she didn't hear it. So I upped my game, placed my fingers in my mouth and let out the loudest cat call I could muster.

Wife didn't hear me, but the young lady sun tanning on her balcony did. Looked at me in disgust and went inside.

I will now avoid the elevator and the balcony for eternity.

TLDR: tried to whistle at my wife, unintentionally came off as creepy to my neighbor."
"TIFU by accidentally playing the USSR Communist national anthem for Vietnam Veterans.


I play in the Orchestra at my High School, and we're currently working in small ensembles. We get to choose the music we play, and one group member found an arrangement that overlays the USSR national anthem with ""Canon in D"" by Pachabel. 

Some parts of it just sound like Canon, but others are exclusively dedicated to the USSR melody. You can't miss it.

We were rehearsing in a room directly next to the MP, one door over. We played it repeatedly for a solid 30 minutes whilst cracking communism jokes, having a good time. 

When it was time to leave, we went to the MP to access the building exit. I was the last one in after my classmates who were humming the melody to themselves as they walked through the MP had left.

I looked over, and it turned out that 2 American Vietnam war veterans had been setting up an assembly the entire time. They said nothing, but the bewildered/slightly pissed off looks I got confirmed that they heard the entire thing.

Here's the kicker- about 80% of the kids in the group are East Asian, and could easily passed for Vietnamese. I feel lucky we didn't give the poor guys flashbacks.

Tl;Dr
My small ensemble consisting of mostly Vietnamese-looking kids played the Communist national anthem as loud as possible whilst cracking jokes about it, not knowing that 2 Vietnam veterans were next door and hear the entire thing."
"TIFU by sharing my YouTube bomb videos with my entire school. Resulting in the ATF being notified. I


Obligatory didn't happen today but it's a story that needs to be shared with reddit. So we'll have to travel back to October 2008.

I grew up in a small town about 50 miles north of NYC. It's a quaint tourist town for folks to visit from the city. We had one building for grades K-12. I spent all 13 years with the same 40 kids in my grade. By my senior year we had become a bit stir crazy in our tiny town. So what else do we do other than make some bombs right?

I'll admit I wasn't alone in this adventure and I wasn't the brains behind the operation either. I was simply the friend with the video camera. My friend Jay was the genius who received a perfect score on the physics SAT's and came up with the idea to blow some shit up. I trusted him enough to whip together some explosives. We also brought in a third friend Connor. He helped Justin make the devices since he had his dad's wood shop to his disposal.

So the three of us started tinkering around with some different methods and landed on one cheap and effective explosive powder. We made our first bomb and it was fantastic! Boredom was certainly cured. We went deep into the woods at night and lit it off at an abandoned quarry. I went home and uploaded the video so I could show all my friends at school the next day. They loved it! So we made another bomb and another video. Went to school and proudly showed everyone we could. Our parents and teachers even saw it and got a good laugh. It was a silly video. We were clearly some high school kids goofing around and not radical terrorists. Well we though it was clear.

Skip ahead a week later, the day before Halloween. I'm sitting in art class when I get a call from my mom. She never calls during school so I step outside to take the call. She seemed panicked and told me to leave the campus and walk to her lawyers office. I was confused and couldn't understand what was happening. It wasn't until she said Jay and Connor had been picked up by the police on their way to school, that it clicked in my head. I immediately left and began to walk out of school. I get a few feet from the perimeter of the property as a police cruiser rolls up and puts me in the back of the car. 

I'm 17 and scared out of my mind. My thoughts were racing around my head. They were actually stalking the school and waiting for me. How much trouble was I in? Well the officer brings me to the small station in man street and sits me down in small interrogation room and tells me I'll have to wait for the ATF to finish up with my friends at some other locations. Dammit I'm fucked. An hour went by and eventually the federal agents arrive with the entire town P.D., the county Sheriff's office, and one guy from Homeland Security. This was my all time most frightening moment. Some of the guys were nice. A couple of them seemed pissed. I was told that I had committed a class D felony and could be facing some jail time. So I spewed out every little detail of our bomb making adventures from start to finish.

After getting my story they tell me it checks out with my two friend's as well. Apparently an anonymous person reported us saying we were going to blow up the school or police station. So an investigation was launched into our suspicious activities about a week earlier. They had been watching us for days. When I left school each day I had noticed a nice tinted out Dodge Charger parked two doors down that was never there. I only had 3 homes on my end of the street so it was pretty obvious to spot but I thought nothing of it. Yup, that was the cops tailing me to school.

Well after telling me I'm clear they all begin sharing stories of bombs they made as kids, and warning me how burns are so much worse than bullet wounds. They seemed to reminisce in the old days and talked about how everything has changed post 9/11.

My parents showed up and brought me home but the entire slew of officers followed us since they had to ""search"" the place. I told them about my pot which they flushed. They took my computer since it had all of the footage I took. It was pretty cool telling my teacher I couldn't hand in my paper because my computer was seized by the government. Nobody at school seemed to care. My principal even asked me not to take down the videos until he got home so he could watch them.

A week or two later the ATF agent who I was in charge of the investigation personally brought back my computer. He wound up staying for a couple of hours and gave me a big father like talk about adulthood and becoming a man. It was an odd way to end this whole story but from what I can remember he gave me some solid advice. He then told me to take down the videos and left. I never took down the videos.

TL;DR Made some bombs and uploaded the explosion to YouTube. ATF launched investigation into me and my friends to only discover we're just bored high school teenagers and not terrorists."
"TIFU - I’ve been buying the wrong shoes my whole adult life


I’ve never had a pair of shoes professionally fitted in my life, however I’ve recently developed joint issues and decided to stop buying cheap shoes and invest in one (or two) really good pairs from a store that was a bit more expensive but that would last and have a deliciously plump interior. 

All my current shoes were painful and just weren’t cutting it. All from Kmart or Big W, and typically just shopped for by grabbing my size.

Wallet cringing, I go to said pricier store and they do the whole walking-digital-mapping-sorcery. Up pops a whole bunch of things I don’t understand (arch height, ratios, colour coding), but one line I do get; “size 6.5-7”

Like an idiot, I open my gob and correct it/her; “No, I wear an 8”

Indulgent sales staff dutifully fetched an 8.... and they fit like all the others I own. In my mind, just fine. However shoe-lady, pokes and proclaimed they were too big. Eh? Cue her producing a size 7.... and they fit, perfectly. Like, heavens-opening-orgasmic perfectly.

She asks me to put on my old shoes I came in with (size 8’s), and poked at them a bit, felt my toes, and informs me that a large contributing factor to my current shoes not being comfortable, is because they don’t fit.

TLDR: I’ve been fucking up for my whole adult life, buying the wrong size shoe, which is uncomfortable. "
"Tifu by not knocking [NSFW]


Throwaway obviously, yada yada. Obligatorily, wasn't today, this actually happened yesterday and my son has yet to say anything other than, ""Yes,"" and, ""No,"" to me since this happened.

My son has always been quiet as a teenager. Instead of the usual grumpy teen, I got lucky, and he decided to just avoid me for most of his early to mid teenage years. I was alright with this and basically allowed it, with some exception, knowing that my teenage years were hell and not wanting that for him, I allowed him to separate into his own little world.

I have known about his masturbation and sexuality since it first became common, around age 12 or 13, when I walked in on him masturbating. I was calm and understanding, and I simply dropped it, not wanting to stir anything.

Wel, turns out I didn't learn my lesson. 3 weeks ago my son turned 16 and he's been much less confined to his room since. He's spent more time with me, watching movies, and even tolerating his little sister. I had grown to be slightly less avoiding over the 3 weeks, knowing that he was ok with actually speaking with me. Here comes the fuck up.

Yesterday, around noon, I began to walk towards my son's room, wanting to invite him to eat with his sister and me out on the porch. I was making a small lunch for us and seeing his happiness near us made me eager to have him try it. I skipped knocking, resching for the handle and twisting without regard, taking a step in the door and looking up to see an image I will never forget. 

Imagine this. He was standing in front of his computer screen, a belt around his neck tight, one hand pulling it into the air choking himself, his other hand on his penis jerking vigorously. And on the screen in front of him, some sort of milf x son porno, his small speaker quietly playing, ""Mommy, mommy please."" And to top it all off, when he looked over at me, instead of screaming, or jumping, he stared me in the eye, his face bright red from the belt, and blew his load. Directly onto his computer screen.

Without saying a word I rushed out of the room, slamming the door and speedwalking out of the hallway, stopping and leaning against a wall. He didn't come out of his room for 6 hours, and even when he did, he grabbed a bag of chips and returned to his room, surely extremely embarrassed. 

I feel bad, but also, that door has a lock. Kind of his fault. But whatever. It was horrifying. I may have scarred him for life. God I really hope we can recover from this, I hate the idea of this ruining our relationship. So yeah, there you go.

Tl:Dr - Walked in on my 16 year old son choking himself and hardcore mastrubating to milf porn, and all he did was finish in front of me."
"TIFU by eating pistachios in the dark


Obligatory this didn't happen today, but about 6 months ago. I was doing some grocery shopping and a bag of Wonderful pistachios caught my eye. I love me some pistachios so in the cart they went. Later that night I'm sitting on the couch watching TV i nthe dark when I get a hankering for some hard work followed by salty nuts in my mouth. Good thing I had just purchased the perfect snack for that. I grab the bag and get crackin'. After a few I get a weird one, it was a little bit soft and had an off putting taste. Sometimes they get burned or whatever and don't taste right so I thought nothing of it and kept chomping down. I got a few more bad nuts and thought to myself, damn Wonderful is off their game they burned all of these 'stachios. Then I bite into one and its also soft, but this one had a really weird ""hairy"" texture and an awful taste. I spit it out and finally decided to turn on the lights. I examined the remnants of my spit out snack and I see what looks like a spider's nest inside the pistachio. I break it apart further and to my surprise(or non-surprise at this point) a small worm looking thing that had been living in there, baked to a crisp. I started opening more nuts and examining them in the light. About half had these dirty little fuckers embedded in them. By my estimation I had eaten approximately a handful of baked zerglings thinking they were just burned pistachios. After much vomiting, I did some research and apparently they were likely navel orange worms, a field pest that infest pistachios. I was thoroughly grossed out and still cannot eat pistachios, but at least it seems that eating them isn't harmful.  
  
[This isn't my picture, but it looked very similar to this](https://i.redd.it/hkvbv1462ery.jpg)  
  
  
TLDR; Ate pistachios in the dark, got more than I bargained for and ate a good amount of baked worms."
