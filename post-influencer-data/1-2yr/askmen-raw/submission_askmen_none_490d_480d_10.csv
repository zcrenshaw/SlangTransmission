0,"Guy (22m) I (19f) have been seeing recently , refuses to clean himself properly because it’s “emasculating”. He thinks this is completely normal. What are your thoughts?


Okay so I began seeing a guy about three months ago. He was very sweet and kind and we hit things off very quickly. I first noticed that when I went over to his place , it stunk very badly. It smelt like old dirty clothes that hadn’t been washed in weeks, I was very upfront in telling him that it was an unpleasant smell and he should probably take care of it. I seemed to only notice the smell when I was at his place so I assumed it was that he just did not do a great job at cleaning. One night we were kissing and I was very very in the mood. I was about to go down on him when I reached just about at his belly button I got a horrible whiff of something. I didn’t want to be rude and didn’t know how to address the situation. I continued kissing him for another 10 minutes and then just suggested that we cuddled. My thoughts were maybe that he hadn’t showered before I came over and because he goes to the gym regularly he was probably just very sweaty. Again , I completely over looked it. Another time we were about to hook up when I pulled his pants down it smelt like straight ass and sweat. I have him a handjob and said that I had a mouth sore and didn’t want anything to happen. At this point I began to get irritated and tried to figure out how I would address the situation. The last straw was when I suggested that we shower together (so I could make sure he was showering before we had sex, as up to this point I assumed the stench was coming from him not showering after the gym) We kisses and hugged and I hopped in the shower first. As he took off his clothes his back was to me and that’s when I saw what appeared to be dried poop residue?? I don’t even know what to call it. I figured he did not wipe correctly and I said “we aren’t gonna have sex until you make sure you’re spotless” and he said “ what do you mean?” I said “ make sure you clean your ass because it doesn’t look like you finished wiping earlier” he then said he did wipe but he’s not gonna get “all the way in there because that’s not right” I was very confused and he continued explaining “ no man is putting anything that deep in their crack unless their gay, it’s emasculating” I got out the shower and he acted like he had not clue as to why I was upset. His “argument” just sounded ridiculous. He kept assuring me that he doesn’t know any guy who is gonna put anything in that far in there and what not. I was just disgusted and I left. I have not talked to him in two days and I am thinking about just ghosting him. Is this kind of thing normal? Yes I know all guys are not like this but is this type of mindset unusual to see or are many guys like this to a degree? 

Tldr: guy I have been seeing refuses to wipe his ass properly because it’s gay and emasculating apparently. Is this unusual to see from a guy ?"

3,"Let’s be honest, why are you NOT a good catch?

4,"For guys who didn’t have much success before, what did you do/change to start attracting women?


I find it amazing how hard it is. I’m a laid back guy who lifts weights, is fairly smart, full time professional, and 25 years old. Not overweight, 6’0, I take are of myself and have no problem being social. Yet  I attract very few women  "
5,"Men with no friends, how is life going?


I am 22y I just realized that I have never had real friends, someone I can rely on. "
6,"What should 'being in love' make you feel?


And what do you feel with your SO?"
7,"What does it feel like for a man if a woman tightens her vaginal muscles during sex?


I can’t really think of a better way to put my question lol. Here’s the deal, I’m kind of self conscious about whether I’m “tight enough” down there. It’s not a huge issue, my man still cums and has never said anything about it but I’m aware I’m not as tight as some women are. So it’s kind of become habit for me to tighten my muscles during sex. Sometimes on purpose and sometimes I just tense up. It didn’t occur to me until last night that it might not feel good to men? Or he might know exactly what I’m doing and know that I’m clearly self conscious about this. 







So, can you tell when your partner is tensing up during sex? Do you like it, or does it help tightness at all on your end? "
8,"When did you have to cut a person you cared for out of your life?


I just finished a conversation where I cut out a friend who I deeply cared for but she didn't put in as much effort and I just couldn't take it anymore. 

How about you guys? "
9,"How do you differentiate a natural fading of lust in a LTR from an actual and irreparable lack of sexual desire that would be fatal for the relationship?


I broke up with my girlfriend because I couldn’t imagine a life with her given my current lack of sexual desire for her. I’ve found her to be an objectively beautiful person but I’ve never craved sex with her, yet I found myself craving sex with other women at work, on the subway, etc. 

I understand that it’s common for men to be attracted to other women, and that it’s common for lust to fade in a LTR, but what led me to dump her was that my lust for her wasn’t particularly strong to begin with and my desire to find a woman for whom I have an initial, strong sexual connection was flooding my thoughts with both longing and with enormous guilt. This breakup has been particularly difficult for me because everything else about her was exactly what I’ve longed for in a partner - compassion, caring, enthusiasm, support, intelligence, maturity, and a tremendous moral grounding. It seems so silly to end my relationship purely on “there’s no lust here” but it felt like such a massive missing piece for me. "
10,"Do you get envious when you see bigger more lengthy decks?


I feel really self conscious about not having a bigger deck. My girlfriend is always saying that she wishes my deck was bigger so her friends can come over and sit on it. She always goes on and on about my neighbors having these huge decks and always wanting to sit on their decks. Should I get rid of her or be proud of my small deck?"

13,"Is it normal to want a clean slate on your life when you lose your Dad?


My Dad is old as. I don't know if I have a day with him or 20 years. But one thing is for sure, is I just want to wipe the slate clean on my entire life and start again. Its like without him shielding me from the world I have realised how much of an idiot I have lived. I wish I listened to him a hell of a lot more and I feel like a let down on every level. I feel weaker, vulnerable, and like I have lived like a fool for far to long. Im not going to lie, it makes me feel almost suicidal. I have fallen short of every standard he set for me. I wish I got married and had kids before he got this old. I wish I realised he was the only one my entire life that truly had my back and 70&amp;#37; of my friends were fake. Im 26 but I am realising just how much I knew nothing about the world. He had everything right. He had so much life experience. And I feel like I will never amount to being the man he was, simply because he made things easy for me. He is a great man, and I am a 26 year old selfish, unemployed lost cause. I feel broken from my own mistakes. Is this normal? Is it part of grief? My friends all wonder what happened to me. I used to be the most care free, egotistical prick. But they loved me for it. But I find myself cutting them all off because thats not who I want to be anymore"
14,"Have you guys ever faced rejection from a girl that you were great friends with? How did you handle it?


I've been friends with this girl for about a year and today I finally decided to tell her about my feelings towards her. She didn't feel the same way. 

I just feel like complete shit right now."
15,"So, if no contact with an ex does nothing to get her off your mind, then what?


It's been 6 months away from a girl that I've only dated for a 2 month period, haven't talked to her since Christmas Eve, but thinking of her and what could've been have been a daily occurrence since. 

Tried to date again, this online dating, then forced going to a couple meetups for interests, movies and dinners by myself but I have no desire to, feels fake and I just rather be sleep or not exist if she wasn't a part of it. "

19,"Men who have wives or girlfriends, how much failure in the dating game did you go through before you met the right woman for you?


I’m 35. I rarely get responses on dating sites. I feel like I need to start approaching more women in person but I got to work on my fear of rejection. I have had minimal success with women but when I did have success in the past it was with women I met in person but been a hell of a long time since I approached a woman in person. Last time I did it was someone I worked with. I have this much older woman at my job that I like but I’m kinda embarrassed by the age difference so I have hesitated to ask her out. But you can’t win the game if you don’t step on the court...so I gotta get over myself."

I'm a single 27 year old guy in a big city who's getting tired of the bar scene. I'm finding there's a lot more time on the weekends when you're not sleeping half the day. I go to the gym and hiking, not sure what to do other than that though.

Single guys, what are your weekend like these days?"
22,"As a guy what are some basic skincare techniques I should know


So I’ve never been super concerned with my appearance. Decided it’s something I should start putting some effort into and face is a good place. My skin isn’t bad, but it’s got a few blemishes, some noticeable pores, etc.  I’ve seen posts on Reddit talking about using moisturizer and exfoliating your face, but I don’t really know what that all means.
