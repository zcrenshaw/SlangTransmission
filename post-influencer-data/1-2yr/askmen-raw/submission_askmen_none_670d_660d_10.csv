0,"My best friend died this morning. I really need advice on how to tell his mother.


I just found out my best friend died this morning. He was rushed to the hospital this morning and later died. His fiance has asked me to pick up his mother at the airport later this afternoon. His mother as of this writing, has just taken off to fly to visit myself, my best friends fiance and her son. She doesn't know her son has died and I'm not sure what the best action is when I pick her up at the airport.

I found out he died after I texted his mother that I'll pick her up.  What should I do? What should I say? 

The mother knows her son has been in and out of the hospital for the past several weeks. She's going to be devastated that her other son has died."

5,"Fellas, how should a complete coward deal with a ""scary movie date""


Got asked out to watch a scary movie by a girl I've been talking to, and I want to accept, but I have absolutely no stomach for horror movies. Gorey action flicks are fine for some reason, but the minute you put on the ring I have to close my eyes and cover my ears. I'm guessing that she asked me on this date because it would be a good excuse for me to hold her close or something, but in reality I would probably be on the ground in a fetal position by the end. Have any other cowards had to deal with this situation? I feel like just owning up to it, seeing as that would take less courage than watching the movie, but I also feel like pussying out on a movie wouldn't be the most attractive thing to do early in a relationship."

Hey everyone! I've just started going out with this amazing girl. She's a vegetarian (and no, she doesn't mind that I eat meat), and I want to show I'm attentive to her and make her some amazing dishes, but I'm sort of lost. Do you fine gentleman have any recipes you can share?

Edit: hey everyone! Thanks for all the amazing recipes. I can't wait to try them all."

12,"When have you found out a friend wasn't actually the good guy/girl in their relationship stories after all?


So, after years of thinking my friend's wife had anxiety problems and always needed our friend to stay home or cancel plans, I found out it was the opposite. I was finally talking to her over drinks and she said, ""I'm an introvert, but he's the actual shut in who likes staying home. I just told him he could use me as his excuse if he didn't want the other guys to give him a hard time about leaving early."" So, turns out our friend was always bailing because he wanted to and not because his wife had any problems with him being out. Kinda funny, but now we're giving him a hard time about it. Just made me rethink how many guys pretended to be on a leash when they were really just trying to get some ""me time"" away from the guys.

So, guy or girl, when has a relationship dynamic suddenly flipped in who was the good cop and who was the bad cop?"

14,"Would you tell a girl why you're rejecting her if you reject her?


Like maybe you friendzone your friend or rejecting some girl, would you tell her why? And how would you do it? Would you be blunt and tell her that her boobs are too small or would you be kind and tell her that you're just not interested in dating at the moment?"

I'm 6'1 and I'm sometimes jealous how jacked short dudes get at much lighter weights and how much easier advanced gymnastics/calisthenics moves are for them. Also, they fill out shirts/clothing nicer. Also, they can lift more cuz their arms/legs have to go shorter distances. "
18,"What is the reason for smelling women's hair?


Men I've dated in the past did this, and my husband does it all the time. We're about to get it on and then I hear him take a huge wiff by my ear. And its not to be confused with deep breathing from arousal. 

I'd ask him why, but I dont wanna make him feel weird or embarrassed. "
