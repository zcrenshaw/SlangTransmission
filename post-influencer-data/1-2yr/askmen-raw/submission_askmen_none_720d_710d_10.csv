1,"What's the smoothest thing a girl has said/done to you?


I was cuddling with a girl watching the game of thrones season 7 finale. Right near the end her earing started poking my shoulder so I let her know.  She said ""they're little foxes you want to see?"" So I turn over to look at the earings and she darts up and steals a kiss."
2,"How do guys check out a girls cleavage? Do you notice it?


I recently went on a first date with a guy I had been texting for a month and a half. 
We went on a coffee date and I wore a slight low cut top that, quite frankly, made my tits look great. 

I'm honestly a lot more modest, but my friend practically bullied me into wearing HER shirt, and honestly I felt really good. A little shy, but sexy.

Date lasted two hours of and consisted of laughs and some deep  personal talk. 

However I was really impressed that he didn't look, or at least he was REALLY discreet, because I didn't see his eyes stray once. Or I'm just oblivious as fuck, which is true.

Edit: because I have to fucking clarify that my 'impressed' was a disappointing impressed, okay? Stare at my tits dude, I wanna know if they're nice!

Update: he definitely noticed. Just got back from second date and it was brought up, he noticed, and enjoyed it, but was a gentlemen about it."

5,"Men of AskMen, when was the last time you self checked for testicular cancer?


I was diagnosed on Wednesday with testicular cancer, and had my left nut removed Friday. 

I'm only 27, so don't think you're immune because you're young and in shape. It can happen to anyone. You don't have to be old, you don't have to be out of shape. Take the 30 seconds to feel your testicles even just once a month...but just check yourself. 

edit: I posted this a few times in the comments, but figured I should post it here in the topic.

8,"[Serious] Men of Reddit, when do you stop pursuing a girl?


I have a steadfast rule that if they cancel on me twice, without a reason, I stop pursuing. What's your rule?

Edit: thanks for all the responses. If there is one thing from reading most (almost all) the post is I need more self respect. "
9,"How many times can one man hear “it’s not you, it’s me” before he starts to thinks maybe it is him?


I’ve gotten it several times in the course of my dating career, but the last time hurt the most. It wasn’t a long relationship, but things were said on both sides that lead me to believe that it was going to last longer than it did. I’m not normally one to cry and grieve, but goddamn, this one hurt. I’m looking for advice on the posted topic and also how not to slip into the “all women are whore and liars and cheats” trap. Thanks in advance, brothers. 


EDIT: Consensus seems to be that it was/is me. Guess the next step is getting one/all of them to tell what exactly I did wrong. This’ll be a fun journey. Regardless, thanks brothers. 

EDIT: I guess my next question is, how long  (if ever) do I wait until I ask just what I did wrong?"
10,"why is twerking supposed to be sexy?


i'm a straight guy, and i know twerking is supposed to be sexy and appeal to men, and that's why there is twerking in soooo many music videos, but i just find it funny at it's best and gross at it's worst.

do you actually find twerking to be sexy? "

I’m at the age (24) where it feels like all my friends are getting married/in a committed relationship. The other half is frantically taking whatever they can get so they don’t end up single forever. It’s starting to freak me out. 

So guys who were single past 25 and now have a girlfriend/SO, what’s your story? "

17,"[UPDATE: GOING ON A THIRD DATE!]I am going on a second date and i have no clue what im doing or what ill be doing. Im freaking out.


Guys -
last night i posted this a couple days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/72xrbb/i_am_going_on_a_second_date_and_i_have_no_clue/ &lt;---- (TLDR- I am 30, never had a girlfriend) I was freaking out on my second date and given all the great advice, you guys were right! I had written down some initial questions that I thought were good topics and that just sorta just kept the whole night going. I was being myself and we just had a lot of things to talk about and not once did we have an awkward silence. we went out to dinner (i paid), walked around the neighborhood pretending to be lost so we can just keep talking, and we end up getting dessert (she paid).

* At the end we gave each other hugs since we both had work tomorrow. We were texting and i think she's interested in a third date!
* how do i seal the deal? 
* I want to ask her to be my gf, is it too soon or wait until after the third date? 
* how do i even ask her out?

18,"My dog of 15 years just passed away. I feel like shit. What can I do to cheer myself up?


Ive lived alone for the past 2 years, and last night my dog passed away. I look forward to walking in the door and him attacking me with excitement. Now when I go home today that won’t happen. What are some things that will take my mind off of it? 

EDIT: thank you all for your thoughts. Oddly enough a bunch of strangers telling me it will be ok is more comforting than my own family. I would like to thank each of you for your comments, but I’m at work now and I know when I get home it will be tough. "
