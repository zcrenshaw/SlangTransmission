Walking back from class just now, I saw the flash/flashlight on this girls phone was on. Now, I could see this bright light burning from 20 yards away across the street.  

She cross the street ahead to my side and as I approached her, I pointed to her phone, which was in her hand down by her side. I said ""Your flashlight is turned on"" in about the most neutral tone of voice I've ever used.

Y'all, I'm pretty sure this poor gal either misheard or misinterpreted EVERYTHING about that statement. She gives me the weirdest look I have ever personally experienced, gives a muffled ""thanks?"" and hustles off down the street about as fast as she could without breaking into a dead sprint.  I stood there dumbstruck for about 10 seconds while a guy standing a few feet away about busts his ass laughing, gives me a shrug and says ""you tried, man."""

5,"Guys of reddit, how would you feel dating a girl with no friends?


Pretty simple^ I moved, am an introvert and haven't made any friends here. I work full time and am usually happy on my own but would like a boyfriend to go out with etc. I'm nervous a dude would drop me as a ""loser"" if he found out while we were dating so I've been serial dating as of late.

Honestly, I'm just content not being as social as other people I suppose? I have acquaintances etc. 

Edit: Guys hush why is this on the front page doe.
Now all the men know."

7,"How do you end your phone calls with your mates?


I keep seeing on Reddit that one thing guys don't really receive is any form of appreciation or complements during their lives and in their friendships. I've started ending my phone calls with my friends with a cheery ""love you bro"" at the end. At the start my friends would think it was silly and laugh a bit and then hang up with a short goodbye, but over time they've gotten into saying it back. 

So I have to ask: am I being weird ending my phone calls like that? How do you end your phone calls?"

9,"Losing my libido, girlfriend taking it personally, what do?


I'm 26, we used to have sex every day almost without fail for the past 4 years.

Lately I've just totally been losing interest. I'm not jerking it or anything, my own desire has dropped to more like every other night, if that. Sometimes she'll be blowing me and I'll just totally go soft and then she feels like it's her fault that she's not attractive anymore or something.

I'm just tired all the time nowadays. When I feel like it, I really feel like it and there's totally no problems, but when I don't I just have a really tough time getting into the mood and staying there.

Anyone have any experience navigating this kind of thing? It's clearly hurting her self esteem and I really am trying."

I get quite a big squirt of urine after the normal flow has stopped. But I use quite a lot of muscle force so I want to check I'm not breaking myself."

14,"How do you become the kind of person people actually want to talk to?


Most of the conversations I have with people are pretty one sided where it gets to the point that I could write a book about the other person's life whereas they probably couldn't tell me my last name.

I was told that it might be that I don't talk about myself enough but I get some pretty shitty looks when I do, even though  it's relevant. People never want to ask me questions about myself. I don't think I'm boring - like I have a lot in common with most people and even when I don't I'll act interested in whatever they want to talk about. 

Ngl this has been fucking with me lately because it's just so hard to stay enthusiastic about people who dont seem to care about me at all. Uni so far's been tough and I miss having friends who actually gave a shit"
15,"I just found out my parents are getting a divorce after 32 years of marriage. What do I do?


My sister just broke the news to me over Skype an hour or so ago. I’m taking the rest of the day off work to digest what is happening.

My parents don’t want me to know what happened because I live overseas and my sister told me not to tell them I know what’s happening.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel numb and I feel like this is just a dream. What do I do? 

Edit: I'm 26 years of age 

Second edit: Thanks you all so much! This sub is great"
