1,"I have to put my dog down tomorrow. What can I do for him for today...his last day on earth?


- I... I just got back from the vet and I have to put my best lad of 16.5 years since I'm 7 years old down to rest in peace. He cannot walk or even stand up (so taking him outside for walk is out of the question). I was preparing for this subconsciously of course, but the real downward spiral happened so quick it's tough to absorb (I don't know if I've fully absorbed it yet) - it's only been the past week that he has been suffering and now I know for sure it's time.
- Any ideas for a dog that can't walk or stand up anymore? (edit: so far he's had an egg mcmuffin and went to the vet)

Edit: Thank you all, truly, your comments helped a lot. He got some sun, he got some breeze, he got every creature comfort and finally tons of snuggle. He has lived a great life full of love and excitement and now seems very much at peace. Thanks again."

My girlfriend and I have a relatively good relationship, problem is, we don't talk much. Ive been out of town for a month now, and even though we don't live together, we do get to see each other when we are in town and free. Anyways, while ive been out of town, ive made a new female friend (completely platonic) and we are able to talk for hours, no problem. This has made me realize that my girlfriend and I barely talk, as we have nothing to talk about.

How much does this affect your relationship in your experience? "

8,"Men of reddit, what would your girlfriend/fiancée/wife do if she found out you look at porn?


Hello all,

A little back story to my question. I'm a 23 y/o male and my fiancée is 27 y/o female, she is beautiful and I love her to death, we get along great for the most part, I honestly do 100% believe she is my soul mate. We have been together for 4 years and engaged for 8 months. 

well a few weeks ago, for some odd reason, my fiancée went through my phone without permission while I was in the shower. Not a big deal as I'm very loyal and wouldn't cheat on her. Sorta pissed me off that she invaded my privacy like that but whatever. Anyways, she comes into the bathroom while I'm showering and flips her shit and says things are over between us and took my ring and threw it across the bathroom. I, of course, got out to see what the hell her problem was, and she said she went through my internet history and seen I was looking at porn. nothing weird or anything just your regular porn, and me looking at porn is not a regular thing, just when she is working the odd night shift or something. It never effected our sex life, I give her plenty of sex... like everyday twice a day... we only miss a few days when she is on her period, (that's her choice not mine) so it's not like I'm watching porn and not fucking her...

Anyways to wrap this up, I talked to her when we got home from work and she was calmed down and we worked everything out, but she requested that I never look at porn again or she would leave me? I blindly agreed to this just trying to avoid further fighting and a potential break up with the love of my life. But I feel like that's a bit unreasonable and stupid. And she also told me she will be checking my internet history on a regular basis from now on to make sure I'm not looking at porn. Which makes me even more pissed off...

So basically my question is, have any of you ever experienced this with ur s/o? And am I not in my right to be pissed off over this situation? 


Edit: so many comments so here is my reply to everyone... just so everyone knows, my fiancée is a wonderful, smart (she is graduating from med school next year and has one of the highest grades in her graduating class...), caring woman. beautiful in everyway. and I agree, this is a huge red flag that needs to be addressed immediately but am I going to trash a 4 year relationship just because one day someone flips there shit? NO! the childish thing would be to leave her over this, and not communicate my feelings with her, which will be done tonight after work. my fiancée is a reasonable person most of the time, im not sure what happened the other night and why she would pull a stunt like that but its not like her, my girlfriend has been treated extremely bad by friends, ex boyfriends and even family members so yes, she has some underlying issues to sort out, which we will work on... TOGETHER... and if that means I need to go to therapy with her then so be it.

And no, I am not a beta male or an idiot OR a roll over and kick me kind of guy, I'm 6'2 200 pound trained marital artist that is a red seal diesel tech and if any of you know what that is, its a very mentally and physically demanding job i.e not for weak, basically what im trying to say is no regular person would EVER get away with treating me like that, but I love this woman and I know this isn't a normal thing for her to do so I let it go, as would plenty of you guys and girls for your s/o who you love... also, we still have a year and ahalf before we tie the knot so that's leaves us lots of time to talk about our issues and concerns. thank you everyone for your posts. I read through most of them and think everyone has made a very valid points all of which I have taken into consideration except a few key board warriors.

9,"What do you think of a young man choosing a low paying career that he is passionate about?


First of all, holy shit I had to think of a way to phrase this for like an hour without the auto moderator deleting it because it didnt like the title. Anyway, I'm 19 years old, and don't know what I want to do for a career. Currently not in college. All I know is I don't want to work at the typical corporate job where I sit at a desk all day and have no passion for what I do, but stick with it because of the money. I want to enjoy my job, and be passionate about it even if it doesn't pay very much. I'm talking about jobs such as actor, artist, police officer, firefighter, park ranger, soldier, graphic designer, animator etc, to just list some examples. However, i've seen that lots of these men who have these type of careers, as they get older, they wish they had instead gotten a nice boring white collar,  highpaying, corporate desk job instead. They start to favor stability and comfort, and just want something to pay the bills and then go home to their family.  I'm worried that if I choose the former option, I will end up like one of those people as I get a bit older and regret it. At the same time though there are guys who think the exact opposite and wish they chose a career they actually liked. What are your guys' thoughts on this?"
10,"Gamers: how do you find time to focus on your career, have a good relationship with friends/family/SO and still have time to play games?


i grew up playing video games -- diablo 2, counter-strike, warcraft etc. but as i got older and started to focus more on my career, dating, and spending bro time -- ive lost a lot of hours that i would spend playing video games, and i miss it terribly...

how do you do it, and what do you forgo to make time to do what you truly enjoy? playing video games."
11,"Why does depression seem to be a common and almost boasted thing?


To preface this, I don't have depression, I just have existential crises when watching Kurzgesagt videos.  However, all of my friends (we're all nerds in our lower 20's who get together once a month to play D&D, and play online games a lot) have, or at least claim to have depression.  I don't want to undermine the severity of it, but when it seems like I'm the only one that doesn't have it, I don't know how to interpret it.

EDIT: If someone could explain what depression is (like how it makes people feel), that would be great because now I'm interested in clearing up my [definition](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6re8j0/why_does_depression_seem_to_be_a_common_and/dl4e44d/?context=3) I learned a while ago"

It was the glass mug vsauce send out in the curiosity box. Not that I liked the design (which was half gone anyway) that much but it somehow seemed to be perfect for me. 

From all the shit I have to deal with right now this is the smallest and annoyed me the most. "
17,"How do you feel about dating a girl without friends?


Like, I've never been really good with making friends but I do used to have some. Unfortunately they were all backstabbing and it was a emotionally abusive relationship. I eventually ended our friendship. The thing is, the older you get the harder it's to make friends. These were my high school friends and although I kind made some other besides them, they I didn't really worked out, they weren't really friends but acquaintances and i didn't wanna seem needy so I stopped asking them to hang out. Yeah. I'm a 19 y/o girl without friends. I know, guys usually ask this question but haven't seen a girl asking. I'm not crazy or a freak (I guess), just happens not being lucky with making good friends. I always tell myself I don't need people but just because I don't need them doesn't mean I don't want them. I usually do stuff alone and I'm not bothered by it, in fact I don't care about having many friends. A few a fine, tho I'd still appreciate good (non-abusive) company.

to;dr: 19 y/o girl without friends, wanna know if guys think if it's creepy.

Edit: guys, I really don't know how you conclude, that if a girl is friendless she must be boyfriend-obsessed and has nothing else to do. How hard it is to believe,  I actually have hobbies. Besides hobbies I study..."
