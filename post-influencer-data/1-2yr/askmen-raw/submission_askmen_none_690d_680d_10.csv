you start seeing her features in him and you're like ""no homo but you kinda fine too bro"" "
1,"Guys who don't re-rack your weights, what was it like to grow up in a wolf pack?


Also, to my bicep brahs who do curls right BY the dumbell rack (thereby blocking access to the rest of the dumbells), this is why your mothers didn't love you."
2,"Girlfriend is moving in soon, what advice do you have for a guy who's never lived with a girlfriend


We've been together for 6 months and things are going fantastic. She's sweet, mature, has a great sense of humor, lovely, we have similar interests and tastes and we both get along with each others circle of friends and family. She already spends most nights with me and we see each other every day but i've never officially lived with a girlfriend before. We're going to look for another place to rent in January but in the meantime she is moving into my apartment until we decide on another place. What advice/tips would you offer guys like me who have yet to live with a girlfriend before.

Thanks!"
3,"My gym has a female janitor in the men's locker room all the time now. How do you feel about something like this? And about the double standard?


It doesn't particularly bother me, but I was surprised it didn't bother anyone else, including her. It's not like she's just in the corner working on something, either, she's all over the place - all around the locker room sweeping, cleaning the mirror in the bathroom while guys pee, etc. I'm getting changed and looking around and thinking, ""So...everyone is cool with this? Janitor lady? Naked old dude? Okay then.""

And obviously, there are no male workers going in the ladies locker room any time soon. So what do you think about this? Be interested to hear some female perspectives as well."

8,"What is the best pasta shape?


My vote goes out to linguine. All the versatility of spaghetti but prioritising surface area, allowing for more sauce coverage without sacrificing structural integrity that simply having a lower diameter would do (e.g. vermicelli)."
9,"How do I find a prostitute but for hugs?


I'd like to embrace a human being and feel its internal organs breathing, beating, and processing food."
10,"What sex moves do you enjoy from your partner?


Never can hurt to try what others are doing ðŸ˜¬"
11,"What was the last fun conversation you had with a friend?


Need to gather data on how to be human"
12,"25/M, How are you guys approaching dating these days? If you're not dating, how are you living your life to the fullest?


I just had 4 dates lined up in a whole week for the first time ever in my life and two rescheduled/tenatative, one stood me up with the excuse of ""forgot to pay my phone bill"", and the last one was honest about it being a bad time in her life to be seeing people.

14,"How do I explain to a new guy why I'm scared to have sex without freaking him out?


This is weird to ask, but we'll go for it.  I haven't seriously dated in a long time.  There was an event in my past that made me terrified of men/sex (enough said there hopefully).  I finally am in a place where I feel comfortable enough to try dating again.  I didn't think much would come of it because of my emotional issues.  Went on quite a few dates.  Zero interest in any of them.  Recently met a great guy.  Things could not have gone better.  He was/is very understanding of my ""shyness"" as we call it about being physical.  He doesn't know the root cause.  How do I touch on the subject without freaking him out?   I know he wants to sleep with me.  I (think) I want to/am ready to sleep with him but am very scared.  He wants me to come into town next week and stay over.  I know I have to say something so he doesn't think it's lack of attraction if I can't.  Help please.  

Edit.   Thank you so much for all your honest, raw, heartfelt answers.  I feel much more comfortable going into the conversation now.  I'm impressed with the compassion shown in almost all answers.  Thank you!!!!"
15,"How would you feel about a woman wanting to masturbate before sex?


Not sure if this should be here or r/sex.

If a woman rarely orgasms from oral sex but can make herself orgasm easily from masturbation, how would men feel about her masturbating to orgasm before piv as part of foreplay?

Piv sex after an orgasm feel amazing, otherwise it often doesn't feel like anything."
16,"How hard is wall sex?


Recently got a new girlfriend and she has mentioned several times that she really wants to try wall sex.  I'm definitely keen to try it as well.  She's not a particularly heavy person but I'm not the most muscular person out there and was wondering how straining it actually on different parts of your body.

Edit: love the puns guys.  Keep them coming"
17,"To what extent is it fucked up to end a tinder date prematurely?


I'm a college student and matched with this girl on tinder. It was obvious we both wanted to hook up. I ask her if she wants to come over and we meet in front of my building. It turns out she is a 3/10, instead of a 7/10 as her pictures suggest, so I avoid having her come into my dorm by saying, ""I wanna get pizza."" While my order is getting ready she smokes, which is another big turn off for me. When I get the pizza and we walk back towards my dorm I say, ""so I gotta go shower and get ready to go somewhere."" To which she says ""oh, so then why'd you ask me to come over?"" I say, ""Oh well we got some pizza, didnt we?"" Then I say goodbye and she goes in for a hug and I shake her hand.
Honestly, I feel so fucked up. She was well below my standards so I couldnt hookup with her, but I feel bad cuz its not her fault she's ugly. Am I fucked up for doing all this??????
Tl;dr Cute tinder girl=ugly real life girl=no hookup"

19,"[Serious] My best friend died in the hospital last night, he was 29. How can I cope with the sudden and unexpected loss?


We met when I was 9 years old, I am now 28. We bonded over video games and movies. He had struggled with health problems for most of his adult life and no one expected him to take a turn for the worse overnight. He didn't have many friends...I was pretty much all he had and now I feel like I should've done more and been there for him more often. He had the biggest heart of anyone I have met and now I just want my best friend back so I can tell him everything will be alright. I had another good friend die when I was 12 and that was tough but this is a whole different ballgame.

He knew stuff about me that no one else knows and now it feels like a part of me has died with him. I am still in shock. I look at my steam account and see his name there knowing he will never again come online to chat. We had just talked recently about going back and playing through some classic PS2 era games to relive some memories but now that will never come to be.

I guess I just want to hear some stories from people who have lost their best friends/loved ones. How did you cope with the sudden loss if it was sudden? I didn't really get a last chance to tell him that I loved him since he was unconscious the past week but I did constantly remind him when we talked that I would always be there for him. I miss my best friend."
20,"How can you cope with putting your dog down and you weren't able to be with him?


I just had to tell my family to put my best friend of the last 10 years down over the phone. We couldn't do anything as the vet costs would've been over 10k and I could not afford that. I couldn't let my best friend suffer when I could help him out. 

I am cross country and really couldn't be there for him when he needed me most. I was the first person he saw when he was a  very young puppy and I couldn't be there for him at the end. It's really eating at me.  I'm not quite sure how to deal with this right now. Maybe I just wanted to vent. Any advice for how to bring myself back together would be really appreciated right now. "
