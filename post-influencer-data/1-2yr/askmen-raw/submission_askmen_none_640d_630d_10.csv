1,"I caught my wife sleeping with my best friend. How do I move forward?


... In his van in the driveway. She came out, we fought, and we retired to what I thought was separate bedrooms. An hour later she was back in his van naked.

I have six months of school left before I can be independent, we put her through school first, and she's been keeping the family afloat while I studied. We're not legally married, but we own a house together and have a twelve year old daughter. 

Its gonna be an awkward six months. How do I cope?"

5,"What's the best way to approach family boning?


A few recent events have brought me back together with my father, who I haven't interacted with in over 3 years. We have decided that he is going to meet my boyfriend (soon to be husband, hopefully). I have been stressing over how awkward this encounter may be at first, even though I know it's for the best. I already met with him a couple times alone, but I want to really being everybody together, including my older brother who will be there as well. How can I approach this kind of family bonding? What should I say, do, or ask? Has anybody here had experiences like this before? Thank you!"

Mine would grab a new cup every time he drinks water and would just leave the previous cup in some corner of the house. Drives me insane."
8,"Guys who watch camgirls, what is the point?


I never watched a cam girl before but today I was bored, so I logged onto chaturbate.  Between the bored sounding chicks begging for tips to apparently start a vibrator for 3 seconds, to the music in the background being played through a potato, to the weird comment dudes in the chat and the chick constantly reaching over to peck out shit on a keyboard while the guy struggles to keep his dick hard, I totally don't get it.  Wouldn't it be more fun to blow a load to a good porn vid instead."
9,"What's a feature/quality of your SO you secretly find unattractive?


"
10,"Made a mistake in asking about the past sexual history of my girlfriend. Heard things I didn't want to hear. How have you guys recovered from similar situations.


A little back story. My girlfriend and I met on bumble and have been dating for 8 months (we also live together). She told me that she had been on there for a month before we met and I never really though to ask until last night when we got super drunk (I know not an ideal time for such a discussion). So in this conversation she told me she had sex with five different men. A different one every week leading right up until our date. Since then I've sort of withdrawn and can't stop thinking about that. I love her so much and we have a great thing but how have you guys coped with a similar situation? "
