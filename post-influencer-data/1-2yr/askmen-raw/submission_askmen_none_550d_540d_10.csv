1,"What's so great about eating ass?


I'm still hella young and haven't gotten to second base, but I'm just curious why it's such a big deal. Memes often mention how great eating ass is, but it sounds kinda disgusting. For those guys who like to eat ass: why?"
2,"Those of you that stopped actively looking for a girlfriend and decided to just have fun and commit to self-improvement, how did that go?


The plan is, I'm just going to focus on my career and go out on friday night's purely to have fun with friends and drink, maybe get into competitive tennis one day or learn cooking/music, I'm not chasing anymore, I'm just going to stop thinking about women

edit: obligatory wow this blew up, thanks for the replies, I'm reading all of them, my life is a mess right now and I'm struggling to motivate myself to fix it, right now I want to purely focus on getting a good job and getting into shape, basically putting 100% of my time and efforts into myself, I just wanted some motivation to get going, so far the responses are great, I'll keep reading them until this thread dies"
3,"If you ever lived your life in ""auto-pilot"" mode for a while, what came out of it?


I'm 25, without a girlfriend, without a stable job and without a direction in life. I try to do new things, I think I have a good level of discipline, but I seriously lack the motivation, since I realize I can do most things, but they don't engage me, it's not something I see myself doing. Honestly this constant looking for a passion and constantly trying and failing makes me exhausted, so I thought, well, instead of trying hard why not just let things go and see where life takes me? Live my normal life without thinking too much about this and see what happens, where I end up. Have you ever thought about life in this way? How did it go for you?"

6,"How do I develop a thicker skin and not let people get to me?


I am 35. I get sick of being harassed at work about my personal life...about why I’m not married with kids and people constantly suspect that I am gay (actually I am bi). People constantly tell me I need to hurry up and get a girlfriend or wife and have kids. Whenever I bring in food that I cooked to work, people tell me I need to get a wife so I don’t have to cook my own meals or people will make jealous comments about how my meals look (even if it something simple like chicken and rice) .

Also people, especially young people in their early twenties, that I work with will make fun of how I talk or sometimes they will give me shit about keeping to myself. There is one kid that always talks shit about me when I’m sitting across the room  where I can barely hear him and people will look over at me and start laughing but when I ask the kid what exactly he said he just laughs or walks away. When dealing with other people I ask a legit question and get a sarcastic response it really hurts my feelings. I have never been able to handle sarcasm without getting upset because I never know how best to respond to it. 

I had a situation a couple weeks ago where a girl tried to start shit with me in front of one of my bosses by claiming that I bumped into her when I walked by but I was no where near her. She threatened to do something to me if I ever bumped into her again. I got so pissed at her but didn’t raise my voice and I told her , “Lose your fuckin attitude. I don’t have to take shit off you.”

These kind of incidents at work get under my skin so bad that I spend my time off angry as fuck that I have to go back to work and I am constantly on edge because every time I am nice to someone, at work or anywhere else, they try to walk all over me. I have so much anger that I hate people and spend time thinking about how I can really do harm and get revenge on people in gruesome ways.

7,"Men who have successfully transitioned from college to the working world, what things did you do to make your life after college a success?


What advice would you give a young professional who feels uncertain of his future as a man, as a professional, and as an individual.

I'm currently making a pretty low wage, but I have full benefits and room to grow in the company I work for.  I feel like I'm getting into a monotonous groove that results in me feeling tired everyday even though I'm getting at least 7.5-8 hours of sleep on average.  I just feel like after I get back from the gym I have zero time to relax or enjoy myself.  It's get ready for tomorrow, which involves meal prep, and setting out clothes and everything else that comes with prepping for the next day.  I've been told that adult life is all about the slow burn and not giving in to the fake idea of constantly needing to go out and do everything like those on social media are constantly suggesting.

I also wish I had a mentor that I could ask for guidance on certain things/issues, but I still don't know what I want to do, so it's kind of hard.  I'd like to work in healthcare in some capacity someday, but for now I work in IT.  Dreams might be just that, though...dreams.  

Anyways, enough about me.  I want to hear what you all have to say regarding the title."

10,"What porn category/fetish do you find strange and are not sure why it exists?


I guess one of the strange ones I've seen are ""giganticism"" when they make a woman Godzilla sized, or shrink a woman down very small. It may be more of a comedy thing, but I just think it's seriously weird."

12,"On pizza night, how many slices do you eat for your dinner?


Large pizzas here are 8 slices, I'm usually in the 4-6 range, but I'm pretty sure I could do all 8 if I wanted."

14,"How many of you have been caught up on someone you've never/barely spoken to?


I was on a train today and there was this stupidly cute girl sat opposite me. We caught eyes when she sat down and gave a little smile. Then throughout the journey we kept locking eyes. I wasn't sure if she was just looking over because she saw me looking a couple times, or whether it was something else. 

I wish I raised a smile but every time I looked over and she was looking I just got nervous and looked right away. I probably seemed a right miserable, creepy sod. Damn my awkwardness and no confidence. 

I can't stop thinking about her. Sounds proper crazy though as we never even spoke! 

Let's hear your stories! Anyone ever had similar and saw them again after? Got a proper rush hour crush going on here! "
15,"What can be done about people you have ghosted?


Yesterday I got really introspective about past relationships and realized I’ve started talking to a lot of girls, then stopped when I’ve lost interest without warning. The most recent and most egregious lasted all summer, and into last semester. I never saw the relationships as too serious at the time, but I still handled it horridly because no one should be ghosted. "
16,"What is the douchiest thing about you?


Are you in love with your car and constantly rev the engine while driving? Do you wear graphic tees with women in bikinis on them? 

I specifically pick T-shirts that are snug (not tight, but well fitted) around my biceps because I feel like it makes my arms look good. I told this to my wife admitting that it was a little douchy. She rolled her eyes and made fun of me. Still love my t shirts though. "
17,"How would you feel if a girl approached you at the grocery store to flirt?


What’s ideal? What doesn’t work? I guess it depends. But seriously. I get tongue tied every time I see a hot guy. The only thing that ends up happening is eye contact and smiles then nothing. "
18,"Men who thought they were ""forever alone"" at 20 and turned out to be wrong, what changed?

19,"What works to get a girl interested again after she goes cold?


I’m in a situation right now where I’ve been seeing this girl and I was never needy or open to meet every day, knew when to end the conversation etc. And she just goes cold. One day she says how we are meeting this weekend and she likes me and the next it’s one word responses and when I ask if we’re still meeting she says “I don’t know”. How can I approach this sudden coldness in a way that regains her interest ? And any idea as to why she has gone cold? 
Thanks"
