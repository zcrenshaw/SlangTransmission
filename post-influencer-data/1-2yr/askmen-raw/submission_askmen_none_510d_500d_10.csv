2,"Men born with sight, I'm losing mine at 19, what sex act is worth going out of my way to try before I lose my vision?


What sex act is so visually appealing that I should really add it to my sight bucket list? 

I've already pretty much lost one eye and my other might go too. 

I'm bisexual if that matters."
3,"How much does the mere glimpse of a woman’s ankle or unkempt locks incite you into a sexual frenzy?


The slightest of glances towards a female’s bare ankles, unpinned hair, or, dare I say, décolletage can completely render a man savage according to periodicals from the city. Tell me, gentlemen, how does this impropriety affect you in your daily goings on? "

6,"How creepy would you find it if a girl you're seeing left you a care package on your doorstep when you weren't feeling well?


Thinking about doing this for the guy I'm seeing. He's been having ringing in his ears lately, among other health problems, that we're pretty sure has to do with the current allergy season. It's driving him crazy, and I told him I had extra behind the counter Sudafed (I get crazy bad sinus problems) and told him I'd give him some to see if it helps. I also got him a sinus rinse kit, some hand cream because the backs of his hands are dry and keep splitting and bleeding, and a gift card to Starbucks because he loves coffee. He's already been to very non helpful doctors who literally gave him Google print outs for his symptoms. 

But, I'm nervous about doing it. :/

I'm a very caring person and this is something I would also do for my friends, but I guess I'm second guessing this time because I really like him. "

8,"(Nsfw) Men of reddit who statred to give oral and realized it was beyond foul, what was your next move?


So this happened to me many years ago. I'm with this woman for the first time and work my way down to give some oral pleasure, the first lick tasted like she had a long day. The second and deeper thrust of my tongue revealed sour, tart lemon. I immediately stopped and started licking the sheets vigorously to get all the flavor off. She asked why i stoppped and i said allergies plugged my nose. So whenever i hear the phrase "" when life gives you lemons"" i think to myself ""Lick the sheets"". I still banged with a condom, not smart i know but hormones are a motherfucker."
9,"Straight men, what was your “gayest” moment so far in life?


I once wrestled one of my best friends while I was wearing a towel. My towel fell off and we kept on wrestling violently. Our other friends walked in and started dying laughing! "

12,"How can I be a better boyfriend for my girlfriend?


This may seem like a stupid question, but I don't really have the best experience with this. 

She and I are both 19, however she's the first real girlfriend I've ever had, and I love her. She's great, and I love spending time with her. 

A little bit after I texted her goodnight, she sent me a message that she couldn't sleep because something was bothering her. She wrote that she feels like all our relationship has been recently is just friends with benefits, rather than dating, and she wants to know what I want, because it ""doesn't seem like much.""

I felt guilty after getting that. Like I said, I don't have any dating experience. We're both in college at the same school. Obviously we both have stuff going on. I try to see her as much as I can to get food, do homework, or occasionally hang out doing something else. 

If there's anything I can work on, let me know. I don't want her to feel like I'm not interested, or that I don't like her anymore, because neither of those are the case. She means the world to me. 

Thanks."

14,"How do I help my GF feel less insecure about her small breasts?


Its a pretty new relationship, we started dating maybe 1.5 months ago. Its her first relationship ever (my 2nd) and she's a very shy person. To be honest, I think I'm the first guy who's ever shown much interest in her, which can't have done much for her self confidence. (We're both college sophomores)

We havent had sex yet, because she comes from a very traditional korean family, and I think it is all moving a little fast for her. Which is OK with me, but just to put some context. 

We were cuddling, and got a little handsy, and when I got to her boobs, she got a little uncomfortable, so I backed off. She told me she feels embarrassed about them because of how flat they are. I told her I didnt care, and that I thought that she was beatiful, but idk, I dont think it got to her. I'm just trying to be a good boyfriend and make her feel pretty, because she is pretty, but I dont think its getting to her. Any advice? I feel so lost sometimes, especially since she isnt a very outwardly emotional person"

20,"Men of Reddit: How were you lucky/unlucky in the genetic lottery


Example: 

I ended up being shorter \(5'8\) than most of the men in my family \(5'9\-6'0\) and got a lot of grays early. 

But, I got my dads natural veiny\-ness, so If i pick up even a smaller weight and do 1 or 2 bicep curls, i'll have veins running along my biceps all day. Makes me look like im in much better shape than other guys that are probably more dedicated than me at the gym."
21,"What small thing do you do to feel more attractive?


I've struggled for a long time to feel ""sexy"". However, I have started to discover a few things in the last year that make me feel more desirable. Most recently, this has been using beard balm. So I'm looking for other things guys find empower them. I'm not talking big changes, like losing weight here. Is it a piece of jewelry? A scent? A mental thing, like meditating? Is it an activity?"
