3,"Why the mindset that being in a long-term relationship is the end of fun?


I had a conversation with some of my bros and we got to talking about long-term relationships and settling down and whatnot. Many of them felt like being in a relationship is ""too much work"" and ""You can't enjoy yourself anymore."" I don't agree! I told them maybe they are with the wrong girls because I still do whatever I like and still have fun with my girlfriend. What are your thoughts on the matter?"

Why is it that in all those movies it’s some nerdy nice guy going for the hot cheerleader who only dates ‘douchebag’ quarterbacks. 
What about the nerdy nice girls? What happens to them? Why is it that no one talks about them?

6,"I'm a 19 year old without a father figure or a caring family, and I am completely lost in life. What advice can you give me so I can get my shit together?


I was brought up in a abusive family that hit me and neglected me emotionally. That left me with a lot of issues like insecurity and trust issues. I have also never learnt a lot things like swimming, cooking, anything concerning cars or life in general. The only knowledge I have I got from TV, school and peers. 

It feels like I don't have any control over my own life. I want to get out of this situation, get my shit together and actually live. But there are so many things I don't know how to do or that I never learned. 

Can any of you guys give me advice how I can get my life on track?

9,"Men, what first clued you in that a certain woman was batshit crazy?


Went to a buddy's party. Lots of friends came. Everyone's a friend, friend of friend, or an SO.

One particular friend comes with a smoking hot lady, and we briefly wonder if it's his new gf. He says she's not. Says he literally met her less than an hour ago at a bar, and she wanted to tag along for this party. He knows next to nothing beyond her name.

Everyone sits around, chilling, playing games, drinking etc. I make small talk with this pretty lady, and after chit-chatting for some twenty minutes or so, she suddenly asks me who are the two toughest, baddest men in the party.

""Ummm.... Mike?"" I pointed to a bodybuilder relaxing on the sofa. ""And Billy."" I pointed to a soldier having drinks with several others.

She cups her mouth and yells, ""YO BILLY! Mike thinks you are weak shit!""

She causes a commotion. Mike and Billy comes rushing over, looking bewildered. She points at Mike(whom she has never even met before), ""Hey Mike! Tell Billy what you just said about him!""

Mike glances at her. ""Who the hell are you?""

She giggles. ""Stop pretending, Mikey! You said you could hand Billy his ass.""

I waved my arms. ""Whoa! Whoa! Mike didn't say any of this. She's making it up!""

""Stop protecting Mike!"" She punches my shoulder. ""Billy, come on! You aren't gonna let this stand, are you?""

Thankfully, Billy and Mike quickly work out she's just sprouting random crap, so they let it pass. I stood up, and left her too, unwilling to be a part of her next drama. The fact that she was smoking hot meant other men soon filled my seats, and were vying for her attention though. Before I left, I heard her boasting about eating thousand-dollar spider crabs and climbing Everest.

Men of Reddit, what first clued you in that a woman was batshit insane?"
10,"What belief do you hold that is completely unreasonable, but you refuse to change your opinion?


I think people who enjoy going to malls for shopping are stupid, weakminded people. I get going to the shoe store or whatever for a new pair. But spending hours wandering around and looking at actual shit is the most mind numbingly stupid thing I can think of that a lot of people do. "
11,"I've come to notice that my boyfriend makes a very specific face when he's thinking about boobs--do any of you know you do the same/have had that pointed out to you by others, and if so, what does it look like for you?


Its like this almost pensive pout, like he's trying to figure out a particularly difficult problem and mildly annoyed that he hasn't come up with the solution yet. "

14,"Men, why is not being into hookups so unappealing?


I’m a 25F and I’ve recently gotten back into the dating world and I’m having such horrible luck. It’s been about 6 years since I’ve slept with anyone so I’m not into hooking up with someone. I’m not saying I’m a prude either, but it’s getting to where it’s almost a chore to try and meet someone. "
15,"My brain can be very stubborn, negative and self defeating. What are ways I can try to change this?


An example is that right now I am pursuing becoming a teacher and I think there are many good reasons it will be good work for me: I enjoy the subject I wish to teach (math), I am pretty good at it, I enjoy watching others learn and grow and can be patient with the process, I've thought a lot about what made learning unenjoyable for me and seek to improve those things, I believe I can make a positive difference in people's lives, etc.

However, for some reason my brain filters out all those positive things about the job in assessing how it defines me: There's doubt in how much respect I will receive, it's difficult to measure the impact I might really have, how valuable can I as a (public school) teacher really be if there is a limit on how I earn compared to other professions, how many people would really look up to me if all they knew was that I was a math teacher.

Now I want to make it clear that it's not that I believe teachers don't have an impact or that they are less valuable because they earn less. I also don't believe how much a person earns defines their value and don't care about earning that much money (I am rather frugal and don't really have many things I want to buy). I fully realize that comments regarding the aforementioned topics are generally subjective opinions and anybody can have a different take on them. It's more the fact that I cannot seem to place that much value into my own opinion and be truly comfortable with it. This seems to be a common problem for me. It is common to hear that I could maybe try to place less weight on other people's opinions. However if I knew how to do that, this wouldn't be a problem! I also don't necessarily believe there are much better choices for me than the ones I choose, but I can't seem to feel any of the positivity that may come from my good reasons or at least embrace my decision without a reluctant acceptance.

Another way to describe it would other people seem to be able to control the volume of their feelings regarding the negative sides of choices they make. I feel like my negative feelings are on high and I don't really know how to turn it down. I've tried meditation and have seen a therapist before. Those have sometimes helped, but for the most part the bigger picture hasn't changed."
16,"Where is the most cringeworthy place you've found someone else's condom?


After finding another's condom in my FWB's vagina after eating her out last night, I'd appreciate some laughter at someone else's expense. 

Edit: It pains me, but I must clarify (after mistakenly posting this without the proper wording) that it was merely a piece--about the size of a penny--of a condom that I found. Not a whole one, but just as disturbing to me. I found out it was from the night before. "
17,"What do you do for enjoyment without any alcohol involved?


Recently took a look into how I spend my free time and found that 90% of my “fun” involves booze. I’d like to cut out the drinking and find enjoyment elsewhere.

Edit: TIL hiking, smoking weed, and masturbating are the keys to life. I’ll try all three at the same time this weekend."
18,"Single men, how did you learn to cook?


I'm really getting tired of fast food and frozen foods. Cooking kinda scares me though. I'm worried about wasting a bunch of time and money on making meals for myself. I feel like it's probably hard to cook for one. Anyone have some advice?"
