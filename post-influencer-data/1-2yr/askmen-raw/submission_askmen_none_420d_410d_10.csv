0,"What's your ""I'm a grown man and I do what I want"" guilty pleasure?


Yesterday I ate Mickey Mouse Eggo waffles for breakfast because I'm a grown man and I do what I want."
1,"Men who have mastered the art of smiling at random attractive women without feeling like a grinning idiot; How?


When walking through the supermarked i oftentimes catch myself with the male version of the resting bitch face. Making eye contact with a women leads me to look away (even though they are oftentimes first by looking away) and creating that awkward moment.

It doesn’t have to start a conversation or sth, but i know how good it feels, when a random woman smiles at you and i want to be able to give that feeling to others."
2,"My brother is falling into the hands of a gang, how do I stop it?


First off, me and my siblings had a good up bringing, we didn’t have a lot of money but my Mum did the best she could with what she had and I’m forever grateful. I’m in a little bit of a different situation because I have a different dad to my siblings and my dad and that side of my family are quite well off, but my mums side of the family isn’t so in a way, my siblings grew up with ‘less money’ than me.

Anyway, my brother has been hanging around some people in gangs and has started wearing red and all of that kind of crap and shares gang propaganda but swears to my mum that he will never “patch up” but he will always rep that gang. Which to me is no different. 

I’ve told him numerous times that if he gets involved with gangs I’ll have nothing to do with him and I know he takes that on board because I know he sees me as a role model, in fact he told my Mum one time “when you said I wouldn’t be welcome in your house if I joined a gang, I didn’t really care that much, not in a mean way but I know that you love me too much to really mean it, but when *John (me, but a fake name) said I wouldn’t be a brother to him anymore, that’s what really made me open my eyes because I don’t want to lose him”

He went through a really good patch at the start of the year, he had a decent paying job, I helped him set up savings accounts and all of that jazz and he was doing really really well and I was so proud of him. Then one day Mum rings me up and tells me that he’s decided to quit his job because he wants to go to university. I knew that was a load of shit because he hated school, turns out I was right, he quit his job, used up all of his savings (he saved about $3000 in the first few months of the year) on weed and alcohol and is now back involved with the gangs. He even went to a patching ceremony and found it “inspiring” which makes me fucking sick. 

I love my brother to death and I can see his future going in the worst of directions, how do I stop it? Please help, I’m desperate."
3,"How often do you do self checks on your nuts?


This is more of an attempt at a PSA than anything else; last Friday I found out that my left testicle has a cancerous tumor in it and I have to have it removed. 3 years ago I lost righty to the same cancer and now I’m gonna be going nutless with hormone therapy to compensate for the lack of a sack. Just wanted to remind all the men here to do regular self checks and report anything you find to your doctor. Testicular cancer can be relatively easy to treat if caught early (removal of the testicle) and it spreads to your lungs and lymph nodes if not treated so don’t waste time in getting to a doctor. "
4,"What makes a girl more of a friend than relationship material?


Asking because in my experience men tend to like me a lot initially- to the point they are willing to pay for plane tickets to go see them or really expensive dates. Even though I ask them not to. Then after the initial 2-4 dates I always get told we’re better as friends- and here’s the odd thing- they mean it. They actually invite me out and want tot talk and hang out.  I also tend to have a lot of married men as friends and it’s not weird. 

So for available men how can I stop being out into the friend zone? "
5,"Men, how obvious is it when a woman is sexually attracted to you?


I’m talking about unplanned (or even unwanted) yet palpable sexual tension. The kind where you can’t think about anything except ripping their clothes off and doing it where you stand.

Is it more or less noticeable when it’s a reciprocal tension?"
6,"How large of an age gap is too large?


A customer came into my job today and started flirting with me. He asked me for my number so we could do a dinner and a movie Friday night. I usually say no to these types of encounters, but he was pretty genuine so I gave him my number. We started texting later and the conversations are good, but I found out he’s 26. My friends think he’s a perv. and my parents (I’m living with them during Summer until college starts back up again) think he has “evil intentions. In his defense, he didn’t know I was 19 either. Conversation wise, out age difference didn’t change the tone of the conversation, so I guess things are fine so far. 

Is 26 too old for a 19y/o? I would think not, but everyone around me are throwing it as a red flags. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Thanks for the replies. "

9,"My husband gets teary and emotional during certain movies/TV but is so embarrassed by it. How can I Signal it’s OK without making him feel more singled out?


I find it incredibly endearing, but he tries to hide it from me because he’s embarrassed. I don’t know how to make him feel safe enough to be that vulnerable with me! 

We’ve been together four years and married for one month. :-)"

12,"Men, how do you explain to your SO it's not about the sex? (but the romance)


So recent girlfriend accused me of doing all of these things for her, just so I could get sex. How do I explain to her that it's not about the physical aspect, but what it represents? The passion, the love, the intimacy, what's a better analogy?

You know that feeling? Where you just feel ""home""? You can go hours not saying much , or get really excited about something small, or act really weird around them and feel comfortable?

I just got out of my first breakup and I'm devastated because the girl felt like home. I travelled all over Europe with her and never felt homesick. I always felt cozy and safe and comfortable like I never have felt . But it seemed to have nothing to do with compatibility on paper.. on paper, we weren't crazy similar, you know?"

17,"[UPDATE] I may have accidentally sexually harassed a co-worker. How do I solve this? **Outcome**


This is an update to Saturday's thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8yteal/i_may_have_accidentally_sexually_harassed_a

I appreciate all of the advice and support. I went ahead and emailed HR and my boss Saturday afternoon. To HR I requested an important meeting and to my boss I let him know I had to meet with HR Monday morning. My boss called me and i ended up explaining the situation to him. He got a little paranoid but said I should be okay. 

So this morning I met with the HR manager. I explained the situation and my concern. She said she appreciated me going to them first. I couldn't really read her and she didn't  say much nor ask many questions. She sent me to the VP of HR whom I never met as she got the job just a few months ago. I explained the situation once more but this woman was a bit out of line. She started grilling me, asking why I didn't grab something else which I told her I couldn't I mean it was in a narrow hall and the situation happened in just seconds. She had a ""hmmph"" type of attitude but said nothing would be done anyways unless the woman complained.

I asked if there was a camera in the hall and she said she wasn't sure but that she would check and get back to me later. She got back to me, via email, and said she reviewed video with security and found no issue. Here's the shit: she said she'll make note in my file. Make note in my file? Why is there a file to begin with for nothing? I was a bit intimidated to ask that so I just thanked her.

Why is there now a file on me? Is this gonna count as some documented incident to pile up on me if I ever got in some heat? What should I do from here?"
18,"My girlfriend believes the moon landing was fake. How do I explain to her it wasn’t?


As I stated, she just decided to tell me she thinks the moon landing was fake. I’m not a genius at all but I tend to think conspiracy theories like that are silly and a signal of someone’s ignorance. It’s also kinda turn off for me as I now expect her to tell me one day that the Earth is flat. 

What’s the best way for me to combat this without coming off as an asshole (which I probably will)? "
19,"What's the male equivalent of dating a guy in a band?


It seems like a coming of age thing for most women to do, so I was wondering what, if any, equivalent there is for men in this regard."

24,"Men who don't sleep in a normal bed: What kind of bed do you use? Why?


I have been sleeping on a Japanese futon style bed (floor, padding, bed-roll) for years.  It started to resolve back pain and stuck around because it works great and is super convenient when I want more floor space in the room (just roll it up and put it in a closet).  

What is your non-conventional sleeping situation and why?"
