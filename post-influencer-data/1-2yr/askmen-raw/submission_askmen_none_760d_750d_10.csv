3,"Who is the worst couple you know, and why are they so terrible?"
4,"How the fuck do I buy an engagement ring without knowing my girlfriend's ring size?


Edit: to dispel common misconceptions:

She doesn't own any rings.  
She doesn't know her ring size.  
Her family and friends don't know her ring size.  
Marriage is something we've talked about extensively, that's how I know she doesn't know her own ring size.

I want the proposal to be a surprise, even though we both have talked extensively about spending our lives together.

So can we stop saying I shouldn't get married if I don't know these things?"

7,"GF is a compulsive licker... how to stop?


So I've been with my GF for about 1.5 years and she's lovely, but around 5 months ago she started to lick my face repeatedly at all times (even in public). I find this highly revolting and gross (also slightly unhygienic) but she clearly loves it and has some form of relief from it? How do I make her stop this habit, I've tried to tell her I hate it!

Has anyone else had this problem and how do you even tell them to stop and seem serious about it."
8,What embarrassing thing did you do and hope no one will ever find out?
9,"How do you deal with losing friends in your 20's?


I'm 23 now and have a good life on paper (house, Fiance', career I love) but I have basically no friends anymore. When I was younger and in college I had a large group that was basically like family and we saw each other every day. Now I've lost touch with half and the other half has moved away. Aside from a group of friends I get drunk with every second weekend or so I don't really have a social life beyond my Fiance' now. The only person I even really text is my best friend who recently moved a couple hours away.



Is this common and if so how did you deal with it?"

12,"Men who didn't start dating until later in life, how did things turn out?


I'm 27 years old, never went on a date in my life. Same goes for having any sort of romantic entanglement whatsoever. Naturally introverted and emotionally closed up. I worked hard in college and work and have a good job, but since my college was engineering intensive, the guy to girl ratio in my school was 2-to-1 and in my program was 6-to-1, so never really met too many girls. Having never dated in high school, college, or mid 20s has left me with no idea what to do and it's getting harder and harder to start all the time. Any advice for someone starting late?"
