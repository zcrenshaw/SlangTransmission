0,"Men who have had the ""I have a boyfriend"" line pulled on you when you weren't remotely interested in the girl, how'd it go?


My story: I was at the gym a while ago and I tapped on a girls shoulder (tried getting her attention before that but she had on headphones and a determined stare) to ask how much longer she had on the equipment. She pulled the line to which i lifted my ring finger and said ""I have a wife how many more sets do you have left.""

Edit: holy gilded fecal matter, thanks for the gold!"

2,"What do you think about women that ask the same old ""What do you think about women that make the first move????"" threads every single day? Is not being able to use the search function a turn off for you?


I want to hear your honest thoughts, men of reddit!!!"
3,"In Your Opinion, What well known man is a good model for modern masculinity?


100 years ago the model man (in America) was George Washington: Strong, silent, honest, principled, a Gentleman, controlled his ego.

50 years ago the model man was someone like John Wayne (or rather the characters he played): Strong, silent, honest, principled, **but** he was not always a Gentleman and rather than controlling his ego he was openly confident of his superiority and he was not reticent to use violence to solve a problem.

What person (fictional or not) from stage, screen, games, or real life would you assert represents the best model for men today?

Second question:  Who do you wish it was?

7,"What message/lesson from Romantic Comedies do you think men should explicitly ignore?

8,"What are some green flags? Some dead give aways that the girl will propably be awesome?


(I think about it since the thread about classy women and) I think girls who are into unicorns are always fun to be around. Never seen a unicorn girl I tend to dislike.

What are your green flags when it comes down to dating?"
9,"Men whose SOs have anxiety, how does it affect you?


Bonus questions: 

- how can your SO help manage this? 

- what do you do for your SO? What do they do for you? 

Edit: I guess to clarify, I am the SO with anxiety and I am looking for ways to make it as easy as possible on my boyfriend. I know it really worries him to see me very anxious or having a panic attack and he feels helpless. I’m just getting onto an SSRI now for anxiety as well as getting on the wait list for therapy but I know it’s going to be rough in the meantime. "

Edit: I finally know what RIP inbox means"
12,"Non-Americans, what is dating culture like in your country? How are relationships formed, and what are the bounds of physical intimacy inside and outside marriage?


I was talking to a friend of mine from India and she told me that american notion of going on a date was foreign to her, a lawyer from Mumbai. There, almost all relationships formed organically from friendships, over time. Something that would connote physical intimacy, like inviting a guy over to stay at your place, wouldn't necessary imply something sexual over there; it would just be an offer of a place to crash. 

What's dating like where you are from? Obviously these are generalizations and anecdotal, but I'm terribly curious. "

This topic recently came up when hanging with the boys and it turns out the majority of the guys I hang out with think that smelling their poop during their shower is more gross than shitting right after getting clean."
16,"If a girl randomly starts touching your hair on a daily basis and talks to you, do you consider if flirting or not? And if you do, what do you do about it?


I was thinking back to my high school years where this girl starting touching this guy's hair. Like, I knew she liked him but I never was sure how he felt about it.They never dated, as far as I know. Wondering what you guys thought."
17,"At what stage did men become stupid on television?
