3,"I just turned 25. I'm having a bit of a quarter-life crisis (as pathetic as that sounds). How do you deal with getting older and having missed out on so many things in life?


I'm a quarter of a century old now. I'm halfway towards my thirties. Almost all of my peers have good jobs and relationships by now. I've never had a relationship. Never went to college to have that ""highschool graduate going to college, making friends and finding himself"" experience. And now that I'm 25, it feels way too late for that. I feel so old and gross, but so childish inside. I'm sick of it guys, beat some sense into me. Give me some advice. Anything.

Edit: You guys are some wise motherfuckers. Thank you."

My ExGF was OBSESSED with makeup. She'd spend HOURS watching makeup videos, so I ended up watching a lot of them too. She worked briefly as a makeup artist before she quit because of school. I just scrolled past this girl on facebook and noticed her winged eyeliner looked bad...It made me feel strange at first, but maybe it's a good thing to know? Have any of you guys picked up on something like this? If so, what?"

9,"My girlfriend hasn't spoken or replied to me in a month. What do I do?


EDIT 3: I meant a week not a month. My bad guys.

So last Wednesday to today she would not reply to a single text or call (Accept once where she replied with one word which was ""Where"".) At first I wrote it off as her just being busy or something for the first day but as the days passed my confusion increased. Around 5 days a close friend of both me and her shot her a text hoping to get a reply to see what was happening (I had brought up the situation.) But he got no reply. I eventually ended up shooting her a snapchat and a message on facebook as it would say ""XYZ was on 1 hour ago."" hoping that might catch her attention. Nothing. She never even opened my snap or look at the facebook message. At this point we started to worry for two reasons. 

1) She has recently had depression come back after a few incidents, but it seemed as if we were passed that. 2) Even if she's pissed or purposely not wanting to talk she'll still reply with things like ""Leave me alone, what do you want, etc,)

I don't attend college right now (Working a full time job and attending an academy in a few months.) but those of my friends who go to the same college have said they saw her around talking to people. Honestly the whole situation has me in a daze and I don't know what to do. I had a person mention that there was a possibility of her phone being broken but then texts, calls, etc. wouldn't have gone through.This is the first time it's ever been like this and I don't know why.

P.S. She has an iPhone and so do we, but it never shows ""read receipts"" since she has that feature off.

Edit: So apparently the comments are saying I'm single, which I'm pretty sure is right. I just feel weird that she'd choose to end it like this as we were engaged.

Edit 2: God damn this blew up. So I'm gonna stop by today or tomorrow at her place to see if she's alright and probably get the ring back. While most are saying she's single and are a bit confused I should probably clear up a few things. This isn't the first time she's gone awol on me or others before due to her habits, but it has never been more than a few days at most. Why hadn't I gone to her place? I was up in vermont at a ski house I just got back the other day. We are (Or were) engaged. No it isn't long distance, we went to the same high school. I honestly expected this to be possibly one or two replies tops. Not so many. Thanks I guess. I'm probably gonna go see if I can get the ring back. Good luck to ya'll.

Update #1: Damn, some of ya'll are supportive while others aren't exactly nice. I know some people keep asking me for updates and a few have personally messaged me wanting to know what happened. I plan to stop by her house later tonight or tomorrow after work. For those of you all yelling at me for not stopping sooner, I don't own a car so I mostly uber and use buses. I'm thankful for the brutal honesty though. I'd much rather have you guys tell me ""It's over, move on."" then try to comfort me with something like ""She's probably busy with school or XYZ."" Anyways, I'll update tomorrow or tonight depending on when I go."

11,"What are some deal breakers you never would have imagined until you encountered it?


So, after the last few potential dating partners I am seriously considering a no pets policy.

One ladies dog tried to attack me and when I said I needed it to be trained before I would consider it she ghosted me.

Next woman flat out said ""my dogs wants will come before your needs""

I love pets, I love dogs. Even when attacked I said trained not gotten rid of. But being told that pets have child like status has made me consider adding pets to children in the deal breaker column.

So what are some of your deal breakers You would have never considered?"

17,"How have the women in your life handled it when you turn them down for sex?


Tonight a girl I see occasionally tried to booty call me. At that point I was pretty beat and kinda settled for the night, and while the sex is fine, there's nothing special about it either, so I told her I was tired. She did not handle that well. 

Not. At. All

This caused me to reflect and realize that every girl I've turned sex down from, always threw some kind of fit/tantrum. Either LTR's that start crying and act like I called her hideous, to more casual arrangements where I've literally been called a faggot and not in a jokey way either. 

Is this the norm for you guys as well? I'd say overall, I accept sexual offers in the high 90%'s, but sometimes I actually do have a headache, or the bootycall happens not long I just got done fapping, or the ""you up?"" text at 2 am when I have work the next day. I'm almost 30, so I'm at the point in my life where fucking just for the sake of fucking isn't as appealing to me as it once was, so just kinda wondering if I'm alone in the world on this, since this really isn't a thing I hear talked about at all.

21,"How can I be there for my little sister so she doesn't feel the need to look to boys for acceptance and approval?


About a week ago Child Protection Services stepped in when my mom and her bf went to jail for meth. Again. The state put my little brother (11) and little sister (13) in my (27 m) care for about a year to see if mom can step up and prove herself. Both our mom and the kids dad are giant pieces of shit. Parents always fighting, doing drugs around the kids, talking to the kids like they are garbage, making them go hungry so they can get high, neglect, emotional  abuse and all the other stuff that goes along with that. My brother is very angry but I went through that too and I'm helping him cope and learn. I got both of them phones so I can keep in touch with them because there's a lot of family helping to pick them up from school and stuff so I can't always be there. 

Well come to find out my sister has an unhealthy obsession with boys. I was using her phone yesterday to talk with tech support and get mine fixed and a barrage of texts were coming through. She's talking with one in particular and they are pretty deep into a conversation about who they are and what they like to the point that she is asking for some of his favorite foods. Her conversation with her bestie is her obsessing over one boy or another while her bestie (15f) is just saying ""ok yeah that's cool"".

I think she wasn't getting what she needed from her dad at home and is turning to boys to try and get it. How can I step up to plate and give her what she needs so she doesn't end up 16 and pregnant or something. It's one thing to like boys at 13 but her whole day apparently revolves around what boys she likes and trying to win their approval. If you guys have any advice I would be forever in your debt. 

( I would ask my dad but he dipped on my other sister and I about 18 years ago.)"
