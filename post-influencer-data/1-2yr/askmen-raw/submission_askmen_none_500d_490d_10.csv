1,"My roommates cried last night because he's leaving college without ever having a girlfriend. He says no one can help him but himself. What can I do?


He's revealed to me before that he's never had a girlfriend though he really wishes he was in a relationship. I didn't know until last night that he's never kissed a girl or been on a date. He even asked 5 different girls to prom and none of them said yes. He's not a weird, creepy pervert or anything, he just has no confidence. He moves out on Saturday. I wish I would've known how much it hurt him earlier so that I could've tried to help. With just a few days left, what can I do?"

3,"How would you react if a girl brought you food on a first date?


I'm seeing this guy tomorrow for our first official meeting/date. We met briefly once about two weeks ago and have been texting since. He is visiting Chicago (where I'm from) and has been wanting to try pizza here, which Chicago is kind of known for. The area he's in doesn't have the best pizza, so my friend gave me the idea to pick up a pizza in my area where it's amazing and surprise him. Would you like if a girl did that or would you think it was weird or creepy?"

7,"How can I stop crying when being reprimanded?


So I don't really know what to call it. I've had it happen at work twice and I just feel awful about it. The first time I experienced it I was sat down and the boss just went through a list of ~20 things that I basically suck at. By the time we got to the end of the list, I was full pledge crying. You know, like a baby. 

Today I experienced something similar at work. I work for a new company, and a bunch of information didn't get passed around correctly. We had a huge job to replace a few projector screens and a bunch of equipment to control it. Someone up the food chain made a mistake and we got the wrong screens. We finished all the work we could do and went back to the office. Upon getting back to the office I went to talk to the design person and asked them what was going on. Upon entering my bosses office to talk to him about the day, he just exploded and started cursing. He yelled at me for me not telling him anything (which I came to do) and I just couldn't help but cry. 

I feel that it's because i'm already upset about the day, and I start to be blamed for things not going right. I understand that i'm an adult (26) and people get yelled at...but I just don't want to cry when shit like this happens. Is there something I can do on my own to help stop that reaction, or is it something I need professional help with?

8,"Do you find “innocence” attractive in a woman? If so, why?


Hopefully this isn’t too weird of a question but my good friend (who’s a guy), was telling me how attractive innocence is which I don’t quite get. Feel free to comment!"
9,"How do you deal with people taking digs at your height?


I'm a short dude (5'8) and I'm dating a girl from a taller family. She's white and while she's not super tall (5'4) her mom is taller than her and her dad and brother are both over 6 ft tall. 

I dont really care about my height as I'm 3 inches taller than the average man from my country. I also don't feel like it's an accurate comparison to compare myself to men from the U.S.

Anyways, I usually have other people take digs at my height. Like my girlfriends dad has teased me, some of my other friends have given me shit for being shorter. Do you have any witty comebacks?"

I'm starting my college career at 26. Almost finished with the first semester with straight A's! But, I'm significantly older than my peers...

Has anyone gone back to get their formal education later on in life and found success? I feel like graduating at 30 will be weird."

My girlfriend has been through alot recently with her ending her last relationship due to her ex taking advantage of her. This was about 9 months ago but it's all being rehashed this week and she's feeling really shitty about herself and still ""feels like he's controlling me even though he doesn't give a shit"". What do I say or do other than say sorry and that I'm here for her. That's all I can think of and everytime I say them I feel like she thinks I don't mean it. Any men out there who have been in this position can help? It'd be greatly appreciated."
21,"When does it class as abuse


Hey guys so the other night my girlfriend full on sucker punched me in the face when we were asleep because she said I was snoring. I woke up confused as hell and she told me to stop. I went back to sleep and she socked me in the back of the head just after for the same reason. My jaw felt like I'd been in a bar fight so I'm sure this was a full on hit.

I know snoring is annoying but this has been really bugging me. She's always been a bit heavy handed in the 6 years together (maybe because I wouldn't lay a finger on her) and I've been stuck wondering over the last week is this a step too far?

What do other guys think?"
22,"What do you think about the ""ask out as many girls as possible"" strategy?


Basically the strategy is to just ask out every girl you see. My friend swears by this method and says that it helped him become more outgoing and confident and have a ""fuck it"" attitude. I have never asked out a girl because I'm too scared of rejection. Do you think it's a good idea to just ask out any and every girl you're even slightly attracted to in order to get more confident?
