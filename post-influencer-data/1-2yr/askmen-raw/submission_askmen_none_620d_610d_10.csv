1,"Men, how do I become an interesting person again?


While waiting on a to-go order of nachos a half hour ago yesterday evening, a girl walked in with a group of friends. 

She walked over to say hi to a couple of people at the table next to me and my attention was drawn to her in pretty profound way. She had an energy around her, a sense of excitement and confidence that made it feel like she had lived a rich, compelling life and it had rendered her inexorably an *interesting* person.

It made recall that not too long, I could radiate the same kind of people-drawing sense of promise and unguarded ambition. Now, on the wrong end of my 20s and having settled into a routine that robs me of imagination on a daily basis, I'm wondering how to get back. I've squandered opportunities and sometimes walked away from potential forks in the road out of fear or disinterest. By and large, I played it safe and it has made me into a pleasant, well-spoken, knowledgeable person with very little significant life experience.

I suppose what it all comes to down is a question - do you ever feel like me? Or if you used to, what did you do to remedy the situation? And does it ever seem that truly compelling people seem to exist in a universe entirely independent of your own?

Edit: It's very heartening to see such a robust response. I debated putting this post up because I was a little afraid of displaying vulnerability but the replies here have definitely given me a major boost.

9,"How useless are you at telling a girl likes you?


Quick anecdote. I was just in a supermarket and was queueing for cigarettes. The counter I was waiting at does both cigarettes and lottery. Another cashier came along and opened up his till and just called over to ask if anyone just wants cigarettes and no lottery. Being next in the queue I headed over. There was a girl in the queue too, very cute, who started over as well. As she was down in the queue, she realised she was pushing but laughed it off (no big deal). So I'm waiting for the guy to ring me up and she walks over. Exchange a couple of pleasantries and she's all smiles and we're chatty ish. I leave, get in my car drive home. I did happen to look back as I left and thought I saw a bit of an expectant sort of surprised look and I think it's only just dawned on me she wanted me to chat. Ooops.

So how useless are you? What are your missed opportunities? Entertain me while I'm on my own eating my salmon salad and coffee."
10,"How do I deal with my dad's dementia?


I'm 26 but moved back home to help. He has frontal lobe dementia that is progressing fast.

Seeing his progression has fucked me up. My mind can't comprehend how someone could change just like that. I'm constantly depressed or angry. I'm scared I'll get it.

I don't know what to do."
11,"Sexually Harrassed someone. What can I do?


Last week I had drunk 3 beer already when I texted a female friend if she wants to come by to my flat later. I think shes attractive but we usually just sit and talk and thats it. Anyway this day because I drank I must have thought I have a shot so I sit next to her and while we chill at my couch I decide to touch her thighs and see how she reacts. She didnt react at all almost like it didnt happen, I think she was in shock that I would touch her. I mustve thought at least she didnt reject me and began carressing her thighs with my hand but 5 minutes later she got up and suddenky had to go, since that day I havent heard from her and she refuses talking to me. At first I thought why is she making such a big deal about it but I begin to think I sexually harrassed her and I feel so shit about it. I'm 28 and have not much experience with women. I dont think the police will get involved but what can I do??"
12,"Men of Reddit. How many of you have never had a one night stand, and is that a result of choice or inability?


For me, it's the latter. The more guys I talk to in real life, or posts I read on here, I get the impression I'm in a minority. I'm well aware that not all stories of ONS will be truthful.
Also,  what would you say is most important in being successful - looks or confidence, and what sort of personality would you describe yourself  (nice guy, badguy  etc)."
13,"How often do you take sick days just because you need a break?


Asking for a friend obviously

Edit: Thought I‚Äôd contribute as well to this discussion because I‚Äôve actually read all your replies and it has been really interesting. As you‚Äôve probably guess I‚Äôve taken a day off today for a break. I‚Äôm actually an intern in a big (very big) company and tbh, this is like my 2nd since I started in June. First I was actually ill and today was genuinely because I‚Äôm getting seriously burnt out. I did feel guilty but I am definitely getting burnt out now. I‚Äôm working as a software developer and have been put on a project as the sole front-end developer as the contractors who were working on that project had their contracts run out and as most developers know, projects don‚Äôt end on time (We‚Äôre pretty close to prod now). I‚Äôve enjoyed it but I‚Äôm starting to struggle to sleep making it extremely difficult to wake up for work. I‚Äôll be in work tomorrow but it seems I‚Äôm not as strong as I thought I was ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I also have an allowance of 20 sick days which are kinda like a use them or lose them kind of deal.

For the people who have never taken a sick day, I tip my hat to you because that is seriously impressive. "
14,"where can I find cougars?


I'm 21 years old and I just had my first experience with a cougar in the Bay Area. She was 37, looked 23 at best, was very attractive, and boy I think I'm addicted.

I mean holy hell, her and her friend bought MY ass drinks all night, she asked ME questions and actually cared about continuing the conversation, and she was fucking amazing in the sack. Compared to the whiny bullshit I get from girls my age, this was a blessing! I didn't have to sit there for 2 hours listening to her incoherent rambling bullshit pretending like I give a fuck about the tan she got last week with her friend chad. Instead, we had actual adult conversations about business and our careers! Also, I didn't have to be the one who thought of conversation topics all the time! 

TL;DR- Cougars are fucking amazing my friends. Where can I find more? 

Edit: can I have gold pls

Edit 2: I technically met her on the street and then we went to a bar. No idea which one it was on Polk street

15,"Tired of being a Nice Guy. What does it take to be a Good Guy?


""Maybe you're the problem"" is a common theme on r/niceguys but I don't see a lot of suggestions for recovering niceaholics

I've got some nice guy symptoms:

- Trying to be nice so it leads to relationships

- Overly respectful (I ask for consent for everything)

- Resentful of women and afrade of rejection

- Feeling of entitlement to what others have
    - love, sex, couple stuff in general

- Resentment of men who have a SO and regular sex. Especially if my value assessment of them as a person isn't positive.
(Howcouldshebewithhim Syndrome)

r/niceguys hunts and finds people like me to prop up and redicule as nice guys. I think a lot of us are just beta males trying to figure out the old and new rules of engaging women and failing spectacularly. Hence the sub dedicated to their cringe worthy behavior.

I joined r/niceguys to try and identify nice guy behavior in myself and cure it if I can but no one really gives advice on what to do, just what not to do.

I just end up feeling really bad about myself because I spent so much time trying to be a good person by being nice but I ended up coming to terms with belonging under one of the most hated and miserable classes on the internet.

I just want to be a good person and be successful with women. That has been my only goal the whole time but I lost my way as I got lonelier and bitter because my attempts weren't working and I saw a lot of jerks get success.

It may all be very obvious to non-nice guys but from this perspective looking out it's hard to see how I might approach women and relationships differently. Like I've learned to ride a bike backwards. Now I need someone to teach me the right way to ride. 

I'm tired of struggling so if you could help by telling me what a good guy would do. Meaning ideal behavior for a guy to exhibit. That would be great. I don't want to be a Nice Guy, just a Good person who has a healthy relationship with women.

17,"What's your relationship like with your closest female friend?


I guess I'm also asking how do you feel about it, and how do you feel it should be as side questions

Also I'm guessing some responses will be from people saying it's the person they're dating or married so I'm asing about your friendship with that peron who isn't your SO who you're still really close with and how it may have affected your relationship with your SO.

That being said, if you recently started dating them, feel free to share your story."
