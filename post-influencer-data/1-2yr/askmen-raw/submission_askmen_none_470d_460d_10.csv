1,"Men's Testosterone levels in the US have dropped by 30% since 1987. Why is this not a bigger issue?


[Testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) is the primary male sex hormone that plays a key role in male well-being, from physical strength (bone strength and muscle mass) to sexual physical development. Attention, memory, and spatial ability are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans. It is also crucial in promoting risk taking ability in humans. 

In short, Testosterone is the hormone that characteristically makes a man a man.

Since the 80s. the average T levels in men have been declining by 1% a year. That makes for a 30% loss today. Statistically speaking, the average man is 30% less of man than one 30 years ago! That's really significant. This drop affects all those things I've mentioned above that are critical for men's well being. 

Yet, we don't see it discussed all that often. The kicker is that it's still not fully understood. When controlling for all pertinent factors, the decrease in T-levels is still significant. Dietary choices are considered the most major factor, but to a layman like me, it feels like someday we will find about some bad chemical that's responsible and have a lead-in-water-wasnt-so-good-after-all moment.

I think we can say that decreasing testosterone levels are significantly harming the well-being of the average male in the west. How come nobody is talking about it? 

I think it's important to talk about the well-being of men in a society that increasingly demonizes masculinity. What do you guys think? Is this drop in testosterone levels a non-problem in your eyes? If not, what changes have you seen compared to earlier generations of men?"

6,"My new puppy or the girlfriend, which one do I choose?


So I actually broke up with my gf of 2 years a month ago. While being broken up I adopted a puppy that I obviously got attached to the last month. Now me and the gf might try to work things out. But she doesn’t want to keep the puppy with us because she feels it was adopted in spite of her. 
I’ll admit the puppy is a work in progress  but we hit some milestones already. He knows his name, how to sit, and we’re working on him shaking my hand.
And the gf has a great place where the puppy could go, and would be taken care of. It’s a mutual friend that we both know that just had her dog pass away. 
I do feel it’s messed up that I’m even being given this ultimatum. Advice please."
7,"My fiancé just ended our relationship. Of two years. What do I do now?


Hey, guys, I'm a 21 year old man, who has been engaged to the same girl since 2016. She left our hometown and moved 1300 miles away to go to school in Scottsdale, AZ at MMI. We've been long distance for a huge part of our relationship, and we made it work. She just got back yesterday, wasn't even in town for 24 hours, broke up with me, packed up her shit, and left me in an almost empty apt. What do I do from here guys? I have one semester under my belt in school, and haven't been in nearly 3 years. I'm fat and out of shape. I don't even remember how to date. I don't remember how to deal with this kind of grief. 

Does anyone older and wiser have any good advice on what to do and where to go from here?"

It's time for the bi-annual picture post, because you know you MFs love that sweet, sweet validation. For the thirstbuckets, the ladies' post is this way.

Also, we don't want to see any creepy fuckery in here. For the lurkers that intend to treat this sub like it's GW, don't.  If you receive any questionable PMs, message /r/askmen and we'll handle it.

[One more thing](https://imgur.com/aW1DLTj), this isn't your place to advertise, so keep the photo hosting 3rd party (that means no, you can't link your insta).

Have fun!"

I'm female and love the instructional videos on pornhub (eroserotica, hegre-art, sex positions etc). A few of my recent recommendations are only available to PornHub premium members (such as a Tristan Taormino video).

Is it worth being a premium member for the extra content? Any other perks?"
