"ANNOUNCEMENT: There will be no more ""Women of AskMen"" titled posts.


There's a reason that you title your posts that way; and believe me when I say that we understand completely. You don't want to post your question on the ""ideal"" subreddit because of reasons that are well known to ~~all~~ most of us. However, you can't post the shit here anymore.

Allow us to make one thing clear:

#***Women will always be allowed to post and comment on this subreddit.***

However, every single time a thread like that is posted, that *one* person who knows nothing about the other sub inevitably asks ""wouldn't this be better off in AskWomen?"" That one comment leads to a flood of comments about how that sub sucks, their mods suck, their users suck, and it gets old after a while.

We get it. We get why you don't want to post your question over there, we get why you don't like their mods, we get why you don't like their users. We understand all of that, we really do. We're also tired of hearing about it. Subreddit fighting is really funny for users to see because y'all motherfuckers like watching shit burn to the ground, but we aren't trying to moderate that fuckery.

That said, we're not telling you to post your question there (come on, even we have limits), but it ain't gonna be posted here.

tl;dr: EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A MASTER, EVERYBODY WANTS TO SHOW THEIR SKILLS"

"My date supposedly forgot about our first date today, what now?


We agreed to meet at this coffee shop and I got there and waited until noon when we said we would meet. I messaged her and said ""Hey! I'm at the coffee shop"" and 5 minutes later she replied saying ""I'm so sorry! I forgot I have this big project I'm working on that's due today at 3. I'm so sorry""






I said ""no worries! Not a problem""

"How do you guys feel about someone telling you to watch your language around women?


This didn't happen to me but I witnessed it happen at the gym yesterday. 

While on the stairmaster I witnessed an older man yell at these two guys who were talking on the treadmills in front of me. I had my headphones in so I couldn't hear what they were talking about or how severe the language was, but I paused my podcast when I saw there was a confrontation and I heard the older man yell at them to watch their language around women. I heard one of the younger men say in a snarky tone ""fucking primitive thinking."" 

I think it's probably universally agreed to watch your language in public places, but I'm not sure how I felt about him specifically mentioning women. 

What do you guys think?"
"Was your SO ""there for the futon and instant noodles?"" How did she support you if so? How do you express your gratitude now that things are better?


I know there are a few self made men here, and I was just wondering whether any of you are still with the SO's you were with when you are building your life, and didn't have a lot of money. If so, how did she support and encourage you? What do you do today to appreciate her patience and support during harder times?"

"Dead father, 7 yo younger brother. How to parent?


So my father died last month and now I (22M) am essentially the father figure my younger brother has. Like all children his age, he's an insubordinate, selfish, and entitled little prick lol.

I have no idea how to approach this situation. I wanna be a friend to him, but I need to know where to draw the line, and *how* to draw/enforce it. I'm also not home much because of school, so that kinda makes things more difficult, but nonetheless, any help is appreciated."

"How does ordering alcohol at the bar work?


19, never done it before. Do I need to be specific, like if I want rum and coke or whiskey and coke, can I just say that? Or do I need to know the specific names of the rum or whiskey (all I know if jack and coke lol).

Same with beer, if I say I want a Budweiser, would they just give that in a can or bottle or would it be poured in a glass and stuff?

Edit: Another question, if you go to a bar to grab a drink for a date or something, where do you usually sit? The bar/stools or is there usually tables as well? If there's tables, do you go the bar first to order and then take the drinks to the table?"

I'll go first: wasting food. Throwing food away just hurts.

I know ""leftovers"" is a thing, but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about that half slice of pizza you know you're not gonna eat, or those 3 spoonfuls of pasta that are left, that you know you won't eat either."
"How can I stop putting women in a pedestal?


Everytime I talk to a girl I like I mess up and become way to needy and available for her and ends up with me getting the you come on to strong speech or etc. I know I text girl I like a lot more than I should and I try and stop but I always feel like I have too. Girls I don’t really like I take my time to get back to etc but I just can’t seem to keep that up with girls I’m into. What can I do. Especially when a girl is ignoring me I like I keep chasing and end up pushing them further away."
"Whats THE song that always sends chills down from your spine while listening, and why?


Lets share some good music!

For me its Def Leppard - Hysteria. Because I listened to it alot, when I was in my late teens and IN LOVE for the first time in my life. Its a combination of nostalgia, the remindment of the overwhelming feeling when I was in love for the first time, and a little bit of sadness, because we we never worked out. But mostly it just takes me back to the time, when I was in love for the first time, and reminds me of the beautifulness of that feeling."
