"[Update] My [22/M] best friend of 16 years [22/F] was diagnosed with cancer and only has two years left to live. Is it selfish to tell her that I love her?

"[UPDATE] My [24F] boyfriend [26M] spends holidays with his classic happy family while I spend them alone.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fhd9c/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_spends_holidays_with_his/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)

I was so nervous to see him after he got back from seeing his family because I was afraid my bitterness and jealousy would show in my reaction to his stories. But I had a long hard think after reading all the comments, and I decided I want to be the type of partner who can genuinely be happy for him. I realized that his good fortune has nothing to do with my misfortune. They're separate issues entirely and don't always belong in the same discussion.

So he told me about his trip—the cooking, card games, heart-to-hearts, long walks together—and I really listened without making it about me. I could tell that meant a lot to him. He wanted to hear about my week but I said I'd tell him later (wasn't quite ready to talk through all of it, but I've since told him everything).

Anyway, I asked him if he'd figured out his Christmas plans. He said he was heading to his hometown and asked what I'd do. I said I might go visit a friend but wasn't sure because I have a puppy who can't come. He offered to pay for a dogsitter as a Christmas gift, which was really sweet.

Then I went across the room to get changed and he came up behind me and held me and said, ""or we could spend the holidays together."" And I said, ""Wait, I thought we already talked about that."" And he said he'd thought it over and he really wanted me to be there with his whole family, especially after he got some quality alone time with them on Thanksgiving.

So I guess it's all worked out! Thanks for the responses, it got me to realize that my bitterness stems from my own family, not his. I have to work through it in order to be an independent person and a loving partner.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I managed to put my issues aside and be supportive about his family experiences. He ended up inviting me to Christmas! Thanks for the help :)"
"[UPDATE] Me [25F] with my two new roomates, a couple 28M and 22F. They are acting like I am living in their apartment, not a shared apartment for the communal space, how to address this?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bl9xg/me_25f_with_my_two_new_roomates_a_couple_28m_and/ 


So it has been about a month since I posted, and I just wanted to thank everyone who took the time to reply, I did read all the comments. 


A few points that came up via questions, - I pay over a third but not half the rent, I am renting as a sharer in the house (including communal spaces), the wire rack (originally theirs in that position) is uglyish, but there is also a few other ugly things (of theirs) in the house so it isn't like this was the sole eyesore. 


So the talk itself ended up being fairly uneventful. Which was definitely thanks to many people here who were like ""hey OP why the fuck are you getting so rageworthy over this you sound like a nightmare"" lol. So I slept on it for a day or two to kind of have that time removed and get my head right. Basically caught one of my roommates in the hallway, just kind of asked like ""hey did you put the rack back in my room"" R: ""oh that was partner"" Me: ""oh okay well I think I'd prefer to have it in the hallway"" R: ""Okay, all good"" I left it at that because by then I realised I was making a mountain out of a molehill.


After reading the feedback from people, I kind of sat back and thought like ""why am I getting so upset over this?"" I am honestly quite chill so what is bothering me? I realised a few things, so like I mentioned everything in the house was my roommates. And even though they knew when I was moving in I didn't have anything and there wasn't space, I still felt like I was being a mooch/shitty roommate for not having things to contribute. And so in a way seeing the rack in my room was both confirming that, and also it was almost like I was resenting them for my insecurity about not contributing if that makes sense.


So I took action, I bought a (needed) appliance for the house, some bits and pieces in and for the garden. I should also mention that I had also just moved to this new city, didn't know anyone and am still job hunting. So I think I realised as well that I was feeling kind of overwhelmed/stressed and so was most likely using the rack as like a thing to get upset about as an outlet. I still wasn't thrilled about my roommate entering my room/not addressing an issue and just dumping it, and maybe they thought they were being helpful/it hasn't happened since so I think no reason to get caught up in it.


Since then everything has been really good, we are all settling in. No sharehouse situation is going to be perfect, but I'm pretty lucky. 
  
  ---   
  **TLDR: Thanks for talking me off a huge, mountain/molehill confrontation that I'm sure would have made for an awkward living situation and was unnecessary. My overreaction was mainly due to stress about moving, finding friends and a job and this was a convennient outlet.**"
"[UPDATE] I’m [22F] bothered by how my best friend[22F] claims she doesn’t see my texts and takes days to respond. But when we’re together, she’s consistently looking at her phone and texting. Should I call her out?


Original [post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gennr/im_22f_bothered_by_how_my_best_friend22f_claims/) 

So I went ahead and talked to Amanda about it. Because some people asked in the other post, I don’t think my texts are draining — it’s all light-hearted things, like asking how school is going or sending each other funny links. That’s why I didn’t really mind it took her several days to respond initially (it’s an improvement from before, where it would literally take her weeks). Like, I’ve known her for long enough that I know she’s just not a very good texter. But when I noticed she would be on her phone all the time while we were hanging out or texting other people back faster in comparison, of course that hurt my feelings. 


We’ve been friends for so long though, I wanted to talk it out with her. And just from personal experience, I really hate it when I do something unintentionally that bothers a friend… and they just end up bottling it up and becoming passive aggressive or exploding about it later. Also, I really didn’t want resentment in what is otherwise a great friendship.


Anyways, I met up with her for coffee yesterday morning and I just explained how her actions made me feel. I also did ask her if she found my texts draining because I wanted to have a fair, open discussion.


Amanda said my texts weren’t draining at all, and that she really is busy with school. But she’s been on her phone a lot because she’s on-call at her work now, and subsequently, she’ll see the messages she gets more frequently. The people she texts back instantly are  either her parents and her boss. Other texts she’ll read, but put off responding until later. Additionally, the reason why she participated in the group chat was because she’d actually been feeling like the other girls were freezing her out for being so unresponsive all the time. She was afraid of losing them, because we’re her only friend group, so she’s making more of an effort lately. With me, she said that she might have taken me for granted just because we’re so close. But anyway I appreciated how honest she was. 


It’s normal for Amanda not to text me back for about three days or so. I’m actually used to it. But I’ve come to realize that I was feeling more sensitive/insecure than usual about this because Amanda is busy with graduate school, and I’ve just been really afraid of drifting apart. We just graduated and it’s kind of scary to see friends move or become more distant after entering the workforce. Especially since I'm leaving for Europe soon for school... But that’s just part of life and something I’ll have to personally deal with. 


In short, we both apologized to each other and everything’s cool now. It was nice being able to reaffirm our friendship and get everything off our chest too. 


Honestly, I was a bit taken aback by how many people were saying that we must not be very good friends or Amanda is trying to ghost me. I can’t emphasize enough that it’s not like that at all! 


Nevertheless thanks to everyone for their advice/experiences/perspective. I still appreciate the people who took the time to help me out.

--

**tldr**: We talked it out and it’s all good now. I’m grateful to have such an understanding friend.

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hitsz/my_27_m_girlfriend_26_f_has_not_spoken_with_me/  

Thank you all for your feedback on my first post. I doubt that I would have been able to handle this situation so well without your help and advice.

So, early in the morning after I made my post my girlfriend called me. We did not talk much on the call, but she said that she wanted to meet me for lunch the next day to talk about the situation. To clear things up, when I first told her about what I had done, I did not give her full context. I was afraid that she would think I was trying to justify my crime, but after talking with most of you in the comments, I realized that it was pretty dumb for me not to have given her the full picture. 

The first thing she wanted to know was why it took so long for me to tell her about it. She felt that I way lying through omission and that keeping that away from her is making her question what else I have been dishonest about. I told her that I was just afraid of looking like a monster in her eyes. It is often hard for even myself to accept what I did, who I was, and who I am now. This fear does not excuse lying to her for so long. By leaving such a big part of myself out of our relationship, I was not giving my full self to her, and that is wrong. This is what she is most upset about now. 

I did end up giving her the full context of the situation, and I'll give you those details as well, I owe you all that much for the help you have given me. When I was 12, I tried to kill my mom's boyfriend. He had lived with us for a few years, and he was unbelievable cruel. He screamed at my mom pretty much every day. He cheated on her. He did nothing to provide for the house hold, and it was my mom who worked hard every day to make sure we were fed and taken care of. He had started to get  more physical with her, like grabbing at her during arguments and raising his fists, threatening her. He was cruel to me as well, but it was nothing compared to the way he treated my mom. One day I snapped, and I attacked him with a knife. He survived, but he was hurt very badly. I spend the next five years in a juvenile corrections center. If I was older, I would have gotten longer, and I think the circumstances surrounding the attack also lead to what I am sure most people would consider a slap-on-the-wrist punishment.

When I gave her the full context she broke down crying. We actually had to leave the restaurant, and we walked to her place. After we both calmed down a bit, she told me that she did not blame me for what I had done, and that sure, I should have handled it ** much ** differently, but she said that it sounds like I was a abused and confused kid who was trying to protect his family. She did question me on how I view my anger now, what I think about using violence to solve serious issues, and what being locked away at a young age did to me.

I think I am probably a bit more angry than most people. I have never had a violent episode since or before that one, and I don't get into shouting matches with people, but I do have to get space and collect myself or else I can become pretty bitter. I do not think it is okay to use violence unless your life is being threatened. 

Being locked up definitely did something to me. I am sort of jumpy and easily startled, which I think has to do with how I was often teased. No one ever tried to fight me there, but I am small, on the autism spectrum, and an easy target for being picked on. My experience in there also gave me a need for personal space, and I prefer smaller rooms. I also ** HATE ** meatloaf, it is a vile meal.

She told me that it would probably take her a while to fully trust me again, and that she will be questioning what I do and do not tell her. I understand that, and it would not be good if she just jumped back like everything was normal. I betrayed her trust, and I will have to work to win it back.

I did stay over that night, and we are going to go through with moving in with each other in January. She does want to go to some of my appointments with my therapist, and we may see a couple's counselor soon. She also wants to talk to my mom about all of this -- I am dreading that part because it is not the easiest thing for my mom to talk about, but I have already called her about it, and we are going to her house tomorrow night.

"My [17m] brother [17m] got hit by a car and is now in the hospital. My mother [36m] won't let me go see him, and I don't know why. How can I convince her to let me see him?


Two weeks ago my brother and I were walking home from the store (the road leading to our house has no sidewalk) and it was time that we crossed. There was a car that was far enough away for us to run and make it, so we ran, but that's when I heard the sound of them speeding up. All I remember is hearing him screaming, and someone falling. That's how I remember things anyway, but the details are blurry. I do clearly remember seeing a lot of blood, and him screaming in pain. The ambulance took us to the hospital, and he had to get emergency surgery. 

When my mom came, she took me home immediately. Ever since then, whenever she sees me she just yells. About how dumb we are, and how we got ourselves into this mess-a whole bunch of things. She won't let me go see him, or tell me anything about how he is. My dad has been the one going to check on him, and he avoids my mother because of past events (and they're divorced) and he won't ""go against what she says"", so he's silent about him.

I don't really care, but I just want to see my brother. It's been two weeks and I don't even know how he is. If he's still in the hospital after this time it has to be serious I would think. I feel so empty and depressed. I can't sleep well, because I keep having nightmares and anxiety attacks. The house is so quiet, and I'm so alone without him here. I haven't really done anything but try to sleep and shower, because doing everything else reminds me of what we use to do together. This is really the first time I've written out my feelings, but I can't go to anyone else (especially my mom) about this. Is there any other way I can try to convince her to let me see him? And maybe see why she's so upset with us, because I still don't understand.

  **tl;dr**: Brother got hit by a car and is now in the hospital. Mother is upset at both if us and won't let me go see him. Dad won't ""go against"" mom. I feel so messed up and don't know how to handle myself, or her? How can I persuade her to let me go see him?"
"UPDATE: My mom's [61F] grieving for my sister [29F] makes me [25F] concerned for her


Hi everyone, I'm back. I can't say this update is an uplifting one, but I think it's okay for what it is, and what happened. [Original is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fg9gw/my_moms_61f_grieving_for_my_sister_29f_makes_me/)

Here's the old summary: My mom won't let us do family traditions after my sister's passing, and I'm worried she may not be doing other things. How can I get her to start feeling better and recovering?

Anyways, on my mom's last day in town, I took her to the cemetery where Diana is buried, since it was just more practical for her to be buried near to us. She didn't want to go through the gate, because she'd never visited the grave. Even when the funeral was held, she didn't want to go because she didn't want it to be real. I waited for her for about thirty minutes, then decided to go on without her so I could at least see Diana's grave. After another thirty minutes, my mom came and joined me. She started sobbing that it wasn't real, that it was all a bad dream.

I just sat there and let her cry. I'd watched Diana die- I knew it was real. So, I just let her try and understand what I knew all along. It made me feel like a robot. I felt even worse when I looked at her headstone, and just felt nothing. Obviously, I miss and love my sister, but I just didn't feel *sad*. It just felt like looking at a stranger's headstone, and thinking, ""Hey, we have the same last name.""

My mom eventually wore herself out, and just hugged the headstone and sat there, sniffling. I got up and started to look around, checking out the other gravestones. I have no idea what happened, but I was staring at a headstone, and doing some mental math to find out how old the person was. They were thirty. All of a sudden, I just started bawling. I was thinking about how excited my sister was to turn thirty, and I realized she would never get to turn thirty. I sat in front of a total stranger's headstone, and cried like a baby.

Eventually, I managed to get back to my mom, and we held each other for a while and cried together. She told me she loved me, and I told her I loved her. We just stood there for a long time, then my mom told me she wanted me to have ""my moment"" with my sister, and went off to a different part of the cemetery. I sat with the headstone for a while, and just started talking about my life. I talked about my job, my lack of success on Tinder, how badly I wanted a cat but my apartment complex didn't let us have animals. I kept waiting for her to tease me, or tell me I was being ridiculous, but she didn't say anything, and I just broke down in tears every time I finished a sentence.

I went to find my mom after sitting there for about forty-five minutes. We went to go get breakfast at a nearby diner. I asked my mom what she was doing since Diana died. She said she'd been going to her counselor, but also found a local group of grieving parents who do a group therapy thing. I asked if she had hobbies outside of Diana. She said that she did what she did before Diana died, and I asked her to do something like scrapbooking, or cooking, or just take a class. I even offered to pay, and that snapped my mom out of it pretty quickly- she swatted at me and told me not to pay for her.

Once she got home, she signed up for a meditation class, and at my request- also started taking an art class at her local rec center. I like to think she's doing a bit better. The other day, she sent me a picture of me and Diana from the day she moved out. It was really sweet, and I asked her to send me a physical copy so I could frame it. I think I'm also doing better. I visited Diana last night, and I felt really good. I brought her some flowers, and I just stayed and chatted for a little bit.

I got myself into a grief handling program, and I'm excited to attend my first group therapy session. This festered in me for a long time, and I let myself believe I was okay because we didn't have a ""real bond."" But we did, and I loved her, and I've been trying to heal in a way that was just... Going through the motions. I had to let my world stop turning for a while, and experience it like my mother did.

Before that visit to the cemetery, I would cook for myself every night. Since then, I've been going through frozen meals like crazy. I would shower everyday, make sure I curled my hair every morning, wore matching socks even if my boots were too high for anyone to see. Now, I let my hair get kind of gross and let it stay straight for a while. I drag whatever socks I can get out of my dryer. I let myself be sad, and gross, and ugly, and unfortunate. I eat lunch by myself at work somedays, and hide in the bathroom when I feel grief coming on. I've ripped the band-aid off, and am letting all the bacteria and ick get into the cut before I pour hydrogen peroxide in it and let it really be fixed. 

It's bedtime for me now, but thank you to everyone who reached out and commented and was kind. And to the people who weren't, thanks for still taking time out of your day.

TLDR: My mom and I had a catharsis moment at my sister's grave, and have been slowly healing and rebuilding ourselves. We're doing okay, and are slowly getting back to being happy and normal."
"My parents [60sF/M] pit my sister [34F] and I [34F] against each other our entire lives, but she can't see the truth


My sister and I are identical twins, and have been in constant competition, always fueled by our parents. I was usually the twin that came out ""on top"" just by nature, and my sister was desperate for their approval. She would do anything. My sister was thrown out of her private school because my parents kept saying I was the smart twin, and saying my sister would just need to catch up- so she cheated on half of her tests through sixth grade. They would act frostily towards her if I was ""winning."" I weighed 3 pounds less than her in high school, and our parents decided that meant she didn't get a slice of cake on her birthday. She became anorexic and bulimic for years. When she was skinner, even though she had to be on a feeding tube, my parents ""forgot"" to give me a gift on my birthday, and didn't pay my fees for prom, so I couldn't go.

It was always like that, even over little things. ""Oh, WeeUrn is so much better at vacuuming than you."" And all of a sudden, my sister was vacuuming 24/7. I cared, obviously, but never as much as her. She got frantic about it. If she wasn't ""winning,"" she would be absolutely hysterical- having regular breakdowns, crying when my parents looked at her. When she knew she couldn't get ahead of me, she would hurt herself or make herself sick, so our parents would give her attention.

We both applied to the same colleges. I got into Yale, she got into Cornell. She was devastated. Our parents kept saying that this proved it, I was the smarter twin, I was the twin going to the better college. My sister lost it. All she would do was scream and cry for about the week before we left. She would visit me at Yale all the time, and just act like a ghost. Before I graduated, she told me that she was tired of me winning, and she started crying and saying that I was taking everything from her.

Our parents had kept it up while we were in college. ""WeeUrn calls more,"" ""oh, your sister has a better GPA."" It was *absurd.* I gave up on them. They still called, told me lies, tried to make me have some kind of showdown with my sister. But I wouldn't and couldn't buy into it. My sister always did.

We're adults now. She still plays the game. Our parents told her that I was getting married, she forced her boyfriend to propose, and ended up destroying their relationship within a month of being engaged. I got a Beagle, she got an Akita. I bought a house, she drained herself financially and emotionally by buying a horrible ""fixer-upper"" that was too dangerous for her to live in at one point. When I became pregnant the first time and lost my baby, my sister decided to become pregnant on the tail-end of my miscarriage, and our parents bragged that she was ""the pregnant twin."" She didn't carry to term either, and when I tried to reach out, she blamed me. She said the stress of trying to keep up to me killed her and her baby. I apologized, tried to delegate blame to our parents, and tried my best to open her eyes. She said she wouldn't have it.

We haven't spoken since. That was a year ago, and now I want to reconcile with my sister. We're both lawyers, and I think I'm happier than her. Our parents still play the game, telling me I'm getting more cases than my sister, or my sister has more acquittals than me. I consistently tell them I don't care, don't put me up against her, it's hurting us both- but they don't listen. My sister still buys into it 100%, she even posts on Facebook about how she's the ""skinny twin"" or the ""rich twin."" It's unhealthy. She doesn't smile in pictures, she just has this kind of scared look like she's being hunted.

I miss my sister. The way she was when our parents weren't using her as a big game hunt for parenting points. How can I tell her I love her? What's the best way to approach her?

TLDR: My parents played a sick game, in which my sister and I were pitted against each other. She took it more seriously, and now hates me for it.

EDIT: I’d like to clarify that I don’t have a relationship with my parents. Yes, I actively fed into it, when I was younger and still felt bad about being neglected by my parents if I wasn’t as good. I did tell them about certain things because I did want to feel better than my sister. They treated me just as awfully when I wasn’t doing “good” by their standards, and I wanted that validation. I got disillusioned by it towards the end of college, when my sister had her big breakdown. My parents got their information from my relatives, or via my Facebook. I blocked them, and they had cousins and aunts funnel my info to them. Yes, I did tell them about things such as my engagement, my owning a house, and my pregnancy because I did want them involved, even if it was a stupid, bad choice. Since then, they have been watching my career like hawks, even though I give them no information. I don’t know all their sources, but I don’t play into it. Their calls are mostly just them needling at me, me saying I don’t wanna do it, and them pressing until I hang up. Going NC wouldn’t be much of a difference.

And I didn’t want to sound holier-than-thou in saying I’m happier than my sister. I’m just worried that she’s still caught up in a game I’m not playing anymore. It has too much of a hold on her life, and it’s weighing her down. I want her to get those chains off of her.

Thanks to everyone for the comments and advice.

**UPDATE?:** My mom called me a while after I posted. Before she even started, I decided to grow a spine. I said if it was about my sister, I didn't want to hear it. I told her I didn't want to be a part of her competition anymore, and if she called me again, I'd block her. My mom was quiet for a moment, then said my sister is now a partner at her firm. I said that was great, and my sister really deserved the recognition. My mom called me a ""sick little shit"" and hung up. I was at work, so I finished up what I was doing, so I could maybe text my sister some congratulations. I felt inspired to mend those fences. She called me first, and started yelling the second I answered. The first thing out of her mouth was, ""Why can't you be happy for me?""

It broke my heart. She was obviously crying, and I knew my mom had reported the situation wrong, so it seemed like I wasn't proud of her. I tried to say I was happy for her, but she cut me off and just kept going. She said that she was tired of it always being about me. When she got into Cornell, I got my letter from Yale the next day. I said I was sorry, and said she went to a great school. She kept going again, when she got pregnant, I had just miscarried. I said I was sorry, and that I didn't try to plan that, and I was sorry if it eclipsed her moment. She continued, when she lost her baby, my parents compared the time frames. I said I was sorry, and I'd never want her to feel like loss like that was a competition. When she had gotten engaged, I was throwing my bridal shower. I said I was sorry, and that I wish I could've planned her a shower. It was hard to know what to say. She screamed for me to stop saying sorry, and it was like she turned into a broken record- just screeching ""stop it with 'sorry'"" over and over again. She finally just dissolved into tears, and hung up.

I've never felt worse in my life. After, I messaged her boyfriend on Facebook (I don't have his number), to ask if she was okay. He said that she had a ""bad moment"", but was feeling better, and he'd have her call me in the morning. I said it wasn't necessary, she should take time. I asked if she was doing any therapy, he said no, and I asked him if he'd convince her to make an appointment.

I'll make a more formal update when something happens. But until then, this is where we're at."

"[Update]: Me (25F) with BF (31M) are these red flags or just adjusting to each other? (together 3 months)


Original post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/78lfq0/me_25f_with_bf_31m_are_these_red_flags_or_just/

After making the post, I re-evaluated the relationship and had a talk with X. Against my better judgement, I decided to give him another chance. 

Anyway, I'll get to the incident which was the straw which broke the camel's back. 

Last Sunday, I enquired whether we could spend the coming Friday night together so we could get an early start to the weekend. He replied that he would let me know how his schedule worked with that.

The following day (Monday), I received a dinner invite for Friday from a bunch of good friends. Since X hadn't confirmed with me on his schedule yet, I assumed things were still up in the air with him so I accepted the invitation. 

I informed X that I would be doing dinner with my friends, so I would be meeting him a couple of hours later than I had initially suggested. He FLIPPED OUT on me. 

He yelled and screamed at me on the phone, cursing me out and demanding to know who was so fucking important I was going to meet. He asked me if a frivolous dinner with mere friends meant more to me than spending time with my SO. 

I responded that of course I valued my SO's, however there were other people I also liked to have in my life. He told me I could go and date those people then.

He went on at how I was incredibly disrespectful towards his time and that I was jerking him around. I told him that I didn't see how that counted as being disrespectful of his time since it was only Monday and the invite was for Friday - I was keeping him updated of the dinner way in advance so that he could plan his time for those couple of hours ; it wasn't as though I was pushing plans back at the very last minute or even cancelling on him. 

I told him that in my perspective, since he had yet to get back to me on his schedule I had the impression that we weren't confirmed hence accepted the invite.  I also told him that from my point of view, when I make plans with someone for the whole weekend and they push things back a couple of hours (for whatever reason) it wouldn't be a big deal to me so I didn't see why he was being so drastic. 

He then said to enjoy myself with my friends and that he hoped the dinner would be worth the cost of our relationship. I responded 'ok'. 

There's still some stuff that both of us have at each other's places though so we're meeting up later this week to return things. 

Tl;dr - he made things easy by breaking up with me.

"[UPDATE]Me [21 F] engaged after 2 months of knowing each other and dating with my boyfriend [20 M] duration, short-description


Link to Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gtlr5/me_21_f_engaged_after_2_months_of_knowing_each/
Original tl;dr He was dating someone for 4 months before me and started dating me after 2 months of that breakup...is this a red flag?
EDIT: After reading all the replies, I have come to the conclusion that I need to have a serious talk to him to slow things down( he set the wedding for April next year) I m thinking of giving back the ring

So I talked to him Saturday night, it took everything I got and I was scared. I eased him by starting to talk about what we each wanted in terms of career path, where we want to live, kids etc...found out that he wants four and I only want one lol.After the light talk, I expressed my concerns that we might be rushing things, and I gave him his ring back...he started to cry and at first I was starting to feel really guilty, he was going nuts and I was a little scared but I was able to calm him down. I told him that we should call off the wedding and that didn't go down well, he called me names and claimed that I didn't really love him. I told him I want to work things out, that we can be together but not married for now, not engaged. He said that he needs space and time to think, it has been almost 3 days now and he won't talk to me, won't answer my text and he won't see me. His mom has been posting stuff on his facebook wall about relationships and stuff. I reached out to the girl he was dating for 4 months before we started dating 2 months later and she told me that he had proposed to her and that is why the broke up, with the same ring he claimed to have bought for me using his savings...needless to say, I feel gutted, should have probably contacted the ex-first but I didn't want to be that guy and I was in love. I still have feelings for him, just can't turn them off but I now know that being with him will bring me tears, I am tempted to try to salvage the relationship but I won't be, going to take time for myself away from everything.Thank you so much to everyone who answered on my post, this has been a very sobering experience and I hope to grow from it. I really appreciate all the replies, it made me feel like I was not crazy for all the concerns I had been having.

"I [18 M] found out a number of my relationships were sabotaged/being sabotaged by my closest friends [18-19 M&amp;F].


I consider myself as being happy that I can maintain a small number of circles of friends with some overlap between them. I'm even more extremely grateful to have this core group that I've grown up with for most of my life that stays mostly separate from the rest of the circles because it gives me the chance to speak *in confidence* about other people without any bias in the opinions that they give to me.

Recently I found out that said closer circle of friends had been playing pranks on me for the greater part of this year, and had been getting a kick out of watching my frustration with new friends I had made this year decide to cut contact with me. I only found out as in a group chat I'm in someone accidentally referenced an event I had not told them about in a way that could only be described as them being orchestrators behind the drama.

Turns out this insider knowledge came from my closest friend who had been actively reading my messages on numerous social media on my devices and with the help of the others in the group, began thinking and acting out ways to subtly mess with these newly-formed friendships and relationships.

They've told me that they only went after specific people that they deemed that my relationships with them won't last, and I had to agree to disagree because it was as a result of their interference with them that they didn't. And it hurts me deeply because I tried to be a more open person this year and I wanted these new relationships I made to work but negative experience after negative experience led me to returning to being defensive and overly-cautious with making genuine lasting friendships and relationships.

I'm not sure how I'm to make a decision to address this. One part of me tells me to cut these people out of my life but I had known them for so long that to do so would leave a big hole where the mostly positive experiences I've had with them would be. What do you guys think I should do?

  **tl;dr**: people I considered to be in my inner circle betrayed my forthcoming nature when speaking about relationships in order to influence the formation of my current circles of friends *for their own enjoyment*, what should I to address this?"
"UPDATE: My mom [55F] invited my[21M] girlfriend [21F] over for holiday dinners this year...then un-invited her after the first one without any reason, other than it's uncomfortable having non-family there?


Link to [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ggfb7/my_mom_55f_invited_my21m_girlfriend_21f_over_for/)


**Original tl;dr:** Girlfriend from France invited to Thanksgiving and Christmas, then uninvited from Christmas after Thanksgiving...family insists she didn't do anything wrong but that they feel uncomfortable having someone who isn't family at our holiday gatherings. I'm not sure how to tell Sandrine or what to do.

I really appreciate everyone's response to my post! I was starting to feel a little crazy and felt like I was being selfish not wanting to spend Christmas with my family, so I appreciate having other people validate the situation.

Basically, I called my mom and asked her what the deal really was. I said that she was the one who wanted Sandrine over, and it doesn't make sense to un-invite her and have treated her coldly at Thanksgiving. I told her that it not only embarrassed me, but was flat out rude to Sandrine. She maintains her story of ""it's uncomfortable having non-family"" at holiday events. It seems like most people think my sisters convinced my mom to un-invite her because they were uncomfortable - for multiple reasons, either that they don't like her or are self conscious about being single - and I think that if that's the case, my mom is sticking to it and isn't budging. I asked if it had anything to do with them and her response was: ""Of course not!"" Lol. 

I told her I wanted to spend the holiday with Sandrine and that she was putting me in a really awful position having to figure out how to break this bad news to her. My mom asked if we can just talk about this again sooner to the holiday and if we could drop the topic for now. Whenever she knows I'm right about something she tries to delay the actual conversation so I said absolutely not because if we're not coming over for Christmas, then I need to know now so that I have time to tell Sandrine and also time to plan something fun for us to do. She said I was being ""unreasonable"". My sisters both texted me in our group chat - a couple hours after my phone call with my mom - and asked why I'd choose my girlfriend over them. The whole ""blood is thicker than water"" thing. I'm not responding. The sad part about this is that Sandrine had texted me a screenshot of the presents she got my sisters asking if I thought they would like them (this was right before my mom told me she was un-inviting her from Christmas). I had forgotten about that at the time of writing my original post. So now in addition to telling her we aren't spending the holidays with my family, I need to figure out how to help her return the gifts. 

My issue is that I feel like it might make the most sense to say that I'm having some trouble with my mom and sisters right now (which is true) and I would rather not see them at the holidays and would rather spend time with her. This would avoid having to involve her in the reasoning for not going. She wouldn't feel bad about them ""not liking her"" and she wouldn't feel guilty for being the reason I'm not spending the day with them, which were two things a lot of people brought up in their comments. 

The thing is, she will still want to send them the gifts she bought. She'll probably want to mail them because she won't want to look rude not giving them gifts. Does anyone have any tips on this end? Not only do they not deserve her gifts, I don't want her spending money on people who were so thoughtless and rude to her. 

I'm looking into what we can do for the holidays and really appreciate the suggestions! We're on the west coast so unfortunately the New York trip is not feasible for us, but I've still got a few other good ideas :) 


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom won't budge and still maintains same answer. I've figured out a few ideas of what Sandrine and I can do over the holidays, but still haven't figured out the best way to tell her. If I tell her the truth, it will offend/hurt her. But if I'm not truthful, she will not know the reality of the situation and will still (innocently) want to give them their Christmas gifts."

Even though I'm in the acceptance stage of grief, I want to include my dad in our holiday celebrations. Not making it all about him, rather, acknowledging that he is important to me and I feel his love around me when we do this. Well, his birthday is coming up and I just wanted to get a small cake and spend some time with my family. My fiancé is viewing this as me not being able to move on. In reality I just love my dad and I want to commemorate things that were important to him. (He loved birthdays) He has told me it is super weird to him. He's never lost anyone so I think he just doesn't realize how I feel.

I know this is a stupid question but my parents basically just give me the old thing of ""they aren't worth it"" ""u'll find new friends"" and ""their jealous."" etc... 

I sort of feel like they bully me or what not. One friend is really, really fat the others are sort of fat but my grandma died from diabetes last year and it was really, really sad because after I read about it I realized that if we did more to help her she could have lived a long time. my mom was so upset that I decided to lose weight so I wouldn't give her the same grief. I talked to my doctor and he's a big advocate of natural foods and paleo eating so not only did I start eating better but I also started going hunting with my dad which REALLY sucked at first because I couldn't walk two steps without heart attack so that caused me to start walking and that led to running and even to joining the cross country team this fall because I realized that after not exercising my entire life I really enjoyed it. Anyways I lost almost 60 pounds in the year. 

My friends like hate me now. The two do mainly, the other one that will still talk to me only sends me stuff about how awful ThinSpo is and that I have an eating disorder and she's worried about me. I tell her not to worry because I feel better than I ever have and then she tells me I'm jocking out and I need to rethink my priorities. 

Since this is such a stupid thing how do I just deal with it?

"UPDATE: My [30 M] Wife [28 F] and I have been married for five months and we cannot talk about things because she cannot seem to put her thoughts together. Is there a medical condition like this?


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fuj93/my_30_m_wife_28_f_and_i_have_been_married_for/

I would like to begin by thanking every single individual who offered advice on my original post. In fact, even though it is not very likely to get diagnosis over the internet, the advice which especially focused on what I can personally do has really made a powerful impression on me which will definitely help me to manage my wife's condition very lovingly. So thank you all.

When I got home the other day, my wife and I had a really lengthy conversation under total stress-free conditions. I began by apologizing sincerely for the whole situation as I would never ever have done certain things I did before if I knew she had a medical condition.

After showing her my efforts to look for answers even from the internet, she just heaved a sigh of relief. I understood that to mean she was appreciative of my efforts. I could sense a real sense of relief. 

Upon the conversation however, certain additional details came to light. First, she indicated that her father seem to have same challenge as she has. That her father will forget and wouldn't know how to articulate his thoughts especially on very important subjects. He forgets his thoughts when it is needed most.

Secondly, I was able to figure out another thing. My wife is very forgetful such that just when you finish a sentence you are speaking to her, she'd ask you a question that suggests that she didn't hear or paid attention to you. This is a pattern I've observed ever since I got close to her and I sometimes wrongly concluded that she just didn't care enough to at least give me her ears when I needed her most. During our conversation, I enquired when she realised that she was becoming forgetful. She indicated that her former boyfriend drew her attention to it some five or six years back. They made fun of it suggesting that they were getting old.

Sometime afterwards, she got knocked down by a cab and for over a year since the accident, she lived in panic of getting knocked down again. A doctor suggested that she see a psychiatrist but her mum disuaded her due to the stigma that goes with it in our part of the world. After about a year, she seemed to have overcome the fear.

However, since we married, she has on several cases woken up in panic and talk in her sleep. Sometimes what she says in her sleep will be intelligible. Other times it isn't. Worst of all, she wouldn't remember a thing the following day.

Our sex life has not been great as my wife seem to be on low desire most of the time and never orgasms (except I masturbate her). Touching her body parts in areas virtually all erogenous zones(including thigh, neck, ears) felt uncomfortable for her and she'd shove me off as a result. The boobs which she felt comfortable with too does not give her any sensual feeling. Things have been pretty bad.

However, my readings yesterday on ADHD links all these signs with the condition, and has thus helped to explain almost all puzzles that I've been encountering with her.

Therefore, there seem to be a whole lot going on in my dearest brain that I should be concerned about. Thus, upon hearing everything, I suggested we seek medical help which she agreed to. We have booked appointment with one general practitioner we know to enquire which specialist we may need to see and pick it from there on.

I will keep y'all posted on what happens. Thank y'all once again.

tl;dr: my wife seems to be suffering from several psychological or neurological conditions. We have booked appointment with a GP as a starting point.

"I (30F) promised my dying friend that I would visit regularly visit her disabled son (50sM). Now my husband (30M) wants to move across the country but I feel too guilty


When I was in college I got a job looking after an elderly couple's middle aged, disabled son ""John"" on afternoons and some weekends. John is unable to take care of himself and requires constant supervision, but he is an overall very pleasant person. I grew up with two severely disabled siblings, so I am quite comfortable with John. I don't have any formal care taking experience, and because ""Jan"" and ""Jerry"" were retired, I was almost never completely alone with John. They took on the heavy lifting, so to speak, but they liked to have me around so they had the freedom to run errands by themselves, go on walks, take naps etc. Caring for John was truly a full time job and hiring me helped to lessen the burden. They were extremely kind people, paid me well, and treated me like family. 

Over time, I grew very close to Jan, Jerry and John. I brought over meals for them every week and we would eat together. It stopped being about the compensation (although they did compensate me generously.) 

This whole situation went on for about 4 years. Once I graduated college, I stopped working for them formally, but still spent time with them regularly. Around this time, Jerry passed away. Jan and I remained close, and I went back to assisting her with John on a part time basis even though I had a full time job at this time. John is Jan and Jerry's only child, and all of their siblings are either dead or live far away. They had many close friends from church and around the community, but it was still difficult to find Jan the support she needed. 

About a year after Jerry passed away, Jan was diagnosed with cancer. She continued to care for John full-time even while battling cancer and undergoing treatment, but eventually, as her disease continued to progress, she moved John to live in a full-time assisted living center. Towards the end of her life, we visited him together and she expressed her fear that he would have no visitors and become depressed after she passed away. She asked me if I would continue to visit him regularly, and I agreed. She told me this was her only dying wish. 

Jan passed away over 3 years ago, and I have remained a part of John's life ever since. I visit his care facility (that is over an hour away) at least twice a week, because it is important to me to uphold my promise to Jan. However, my husband recently received a once in a lifetime job offer across the country. We are talking thousands of miles away. I'm so happy for my husband, but I can't seem to get this awful pit out of my stomach. If it wasn't for John, I would have absolutely no hesitation moving away, but I can't let go of my overwhelming guilt. John really does have no other visitors. If he's lucky, a church friend will come once every six months or so. If I leave, he will be alone. Yes he has his caretakers, but they care for dozens of people each day. Most of the other patients in this care facility are far less amicable and pleasant than John is, so he has difficulty making friends. The personal connection is just not there, and without it I worry he will regress. 

I really don't know if I can move across the country in good conscience, but I know refusing to leave could jeopardize my marriage. Do I have any options legally if I wanted to pursue moving John to a care facility in my new city? Money is extremely tight so I can't fathom hiring a lawyer or taking on any personal financial responsibility over John, but I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the length.

"My mom (39F) thinks I’m (23F) “trying to make her look bad” because I spent a lot of money on presents for my siblings (19M, 15M, 12M, 10F). Now she won’t talk to me and has uninvited me to Christmas.


I love my mom. Despite having me at a young age, she’s always cared for me, and she’d give any of her kids the shirt off her back. It’s easy to judge her because she’s a single mother to 5 kids, but she has a big heart. She makes just enough money for food, rent, utilities, bills, etc. and it’s always been like that. Growing up, money was always tight.

I’ve since moved out, and after a couple years of working two jobs and going through my own financial hardship, I’ve finally reached a point where I live comfortably. Earlier this year, I got a new job at a place where I make more than my two old jobs combined, and between that and my S.O. and I splitting the bills for our shared apartment, I am probably at the best place financially I’ve ever been in my entire life. So, I figured that I would go all-out for Christmas. I’ve been setting aside money from every paycheck since August, and I asked all my siblings to tell me something they really wanted. All of them wanted some sort of electronic. So, I got them all what they wanted. They deserve it, and I can afford it. My S.O. even pitched in. I want to give them a great Christmas, and I know Christmas isn’t just about material gifts, but this means a lot to me and I know it will mean a lot to them.

So, I bought and wrapped their gifts, and I wanted to drop them off at my mom’s this weekend so she can put them under the tree. I called and asked, and she was gushing about how sweet it was that I got them something. And I was kind of gushing too, because I was proud. Maybe it’s a little self-righteous, but I was proud of myself for being able to do something like this. In the midst of my excitement, I told her what I had gotten them, which was basically, two game systems, some games, a laptop, and a cellphone on my phone plan, and she went silent. I asked her if she was still there, and she just angrily asked why I would do this to her. I was so confused, I thought she was upset because I didn’t ask her first and maybe she didn’t want my little sister to have a phone or my little brother to have a computer, but then she said something to the effect of, “after everything, all you want to do is try to make me look bad”, and then she hung up on me
Immediately I felt like shit. We’ve never gotten big Christmas gifts. It was always something small or something we needed, like jeans or socks. Sometimes, we’d get one shared gift. I guess me buying them expensive presents made her feel bad that she couldn’t, or maybe she took it as me implying that her presents are not good enough. I tried calling her back and she would just keep sending me to voicemail. And yesterday she texted me to keep my presents and not even show up on Christmas. She still won’t answer my calls.

I don’t know what to do. I want my siblings to have their gifts, but I don’t want to upset my mom. I just wanted to do something nice while I have the means. Should I just give them their presents anyway?

**TL;DR: I bought my siblings expensive presents and now my mom is upset with me and doesn’t want me giving them their presents. She won’t talk to me and doesn’t want me at her house for Christmas.**"
"Me [20F] with my boyfriend [21M] of 3 years and his best friend [23F]. I saw a video of them on Snapchat that upset me.


Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my reddit.


I’ll be the first to admit that I can be a jealous person. My boyfriend (Eden) and I have been together for 3 years, he’s known his best friend (Jackie) for a few months more than that. We met through Eden and while we text sometimes and hang out on occasion, I’m not nearly as close to her as she is to him. Neither of them choose to have many friends so they spend a lot of time together.


My relationship with Eden is almost perfect. We have been living together with his family since I went NC with my abusive parents 2 years ago. We make each other happy as far as I know and we laugh together a lot. He treats me well except for when his depression causes him to get more snappy, but he always realises he’s wrong and apologises afterwards. We have sex at least every other day. He and his family, who treat me like their own, even look after my puppy when I’m busy. We go on a lot of dates and we have a lot of the same hobbies because we both made an effort to get involved in each other’s interests. He always tells me he wants to spend his life with me, how in love with me he is, etc. He still spends a healthy amount of time away from me playing football, hanging out with his family, going out with friends. Likewise, I spend a lot of time with my friends and doing my own thing. We’re very supportive of each other.


Whenever the three of us hang out in a group, Eden always gives Jackie slightly more attention and enthusiasm than he gives me. It used to bug me but I asked him about it and he said he just doesn’t want to make her feel like the third wheel and he doesn’t see her as much as he sees me. This was perfectly reasonable to me and I didn’t pursue the matter. Jackie is a model and Eden has said a few times that she’s a stunner, and I guess sometimes that makes me slightly insecure because even though he says it about me sometimes too, I’m not confident about my looks. I try my best not to show it because I don’t want to be a jealous psycho girlfriend. I have social media but I don’t ever post, I kind of just lurk. I’ve seen that Jackie has a ton of pictures of them together on her Instagram looking really close (with their arms around each other, baking together, etc). Again, this made me a tiny bit insecure but I never said anything because I knew I was just being irrational and a lot of best friends are like that. I’m really close and huggy with my best friends, and we have baked together a few times before. My biggest issue with their relationship before today was when my boyfriend and I had a fight and he left the house. The next day I found out that he had gone to stay at her place and I told him I was uncomfortable with it. It didn’t happen again. They’re always there for each other when something goes wrong. Sometimes I still feel bad for telling him I wasn’t okay with him staying over at her place after a fight because I feel like I took away his support by being controlling.


So last night after I got home from a bit of drinking with friends, I found that my boyfriend wasn’t home. I took my dog for a walk and sent him a text asking where he was. He replied that he was hanging out with Jackie and her family and cousins. This was normal to me because he sees Jackie’s family frequently and always says she’s like a sister to him. I told him to have fun and asked him what time he would be home. He didn’t read the message and I thought nothing of it. After I got home and had a shower I checked my phone again. Still no response. I decide to go to bed first because I’m tired and it’s a little late, so I climb in bed and do my nightly social media check. I browse through Instagram and Facebook and finally Snapchat.


Then I saw it. (I’m just saying it that way for dramatic effect.) Someone who wasn’t Jackie, presumably a cousin, had posted a video to Jackie’s Snapchat. In the video, Eden had his arm around Jackie’s waist. They were looking at a television screen and he turned his head and kissed her forehead and they smiled at each other. Her head was resting on his chest and the video was captioned “Can you believe how adorable they are??” followed by some hearts. I immediately felt like my whole chest was on fire. I kind of just curled up into a ball and started crying after a minute or two of it sinking in. At first I wanted to contact Jackie and ask her what was going on but I decided not to react when my emotions are high and I am not calm. I still don’t know if I’m overreacting and maybe it’s just them being close as best friends. Is that a thing best friends of the opposite gender do? I don’t do that with my best friends if they’re guys. If they’re girls I might kiss them on the forehead or cheek rarely because I’m very touchy feely but I’m 100% straight and it was always innocent. Maybe this is the same thing but with the opposite gender?? I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive or hypocritical. The caption REALLY got to me too. It’s like whoever posted that saw them as a couple. I know it doesn’t matter what other people think, but maybe they thought that because they act so much like one and I feel like that might be crossing the line a little bit. Maybe whoever posted it was joking or teasing them, I don’t know. I cried myself to sleep and woke up an hour later. He still wasn’t home so I checked my phone. He texted me asking me how I’m feeling and if he could stay over at her place. I just said “sure” because I didn’t want to be possessive or controlling. I didn’t tell him how I was feeling because I honestly felt horrible. I checked Snapchat again and the video was gone. I cried myself to sleep again and he came home this afternoon. I’ve been really quiet and he knows something is wrong but I’m not sure how to approach the matter.


tl;dr Saw a Snapchat video of my boyfriend and his best friend (my friend) cuddling and looking coupley (maybe). Am I overreacting? How do I approach this situation and what should my next steps be?

(Kind of an) update: Hey guys! Thank you so so much for the immense outpouring of support. Your comments have made me feel better and more confident in myself, and while I am still absolutely gutted, I now have the courage to confront him about this when he comes home from football later today. Any advice on what to do about my living situation would be appreciated. I absolutely cannot move back in with my parents. They are emotionally and physically abusive. I will give you an update when possible but in all honesty it might take a while because I am completely emotionally drained. Still, lots of love and hugs. I cannot express just how grateful I am for all the love and goodness I have received from all of you. I have read every single one of your comments and I take them all very seriously. You guys are the light in the darkness. Thank you."

"I (23F) am constantly hungry staying with my boyfriends (29M) family


Hi there everyone, thank you for reading. I'll try not to make this too long, I wasn't sure where I could post this because I am not sure that it's even a relationship problem, maybe it's just a personal one. 

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years. We live together usually and everything is wonderful, he is sweet and fun and really is my better half. 2 months ago, we decided to move to a new city, and because this coincided with his sisters wedding, we decided to stay in his village with his parents to help out and spend time with his family before moving to our new city. We had this time off in between leaving our old jobs and we start our new one in January. 

I've been having a bit of a hard time concerning food. I don't want to sound ungrateful because I appreciate staying here and I love his family, but lately this has all been affecting my mood and making me sad in ways I can't even explain. His family are very well off, and his mom is very health conscious but gives serving sizes for a toddler. A lot of meals revolve around small servings of either :

-lunch: chickpeas and carrots 
-dinner: lettuce, tomato and corn salad
- lunch: peas with olive oil and vinegar 
-dinner- fried egg and salad as above

I'm constantly in a state of hunger. They are European and I am not so they eat bread with each meal, I think this could be why they are fine with the amounts of food. I'm Asian and don't find it normal or usual to eat bread so usually I don't. Maybe that's my fault? His mom cooks also cooks with no salt, which is great, but makes it hard to eat the food too...

I've cooked once in a while but usually my boyfriend has said his mom prefers cooking in her own kitchen.. and everything was more or less fine, I was hungry but otherwise ok until the other night.

Once a week they will go to a restaurant to eat. It's the culture here for them to pay (I paid once and they got upset) so everyone will  eat one tapas (small plates) sometimes two and we all go home. The other night I was still hungry so I ate some bread, my boyfriend got upset with me and said I shouldn't be a glutton (???) 

I stopped eating the bread and since then I can't bring myself to eat much. I'm always hungry and sad. I told my boyfriend how it was awkward for me that he said that at a family dinner and he said he didn't mean that, I could eat as I wanted but I can't explain this feeling I have inside me now. When my boyfriend came to visit me, he stayed at my family house for a month and I always made sure he wasn't hungry and we always gave him food and encouraged him to eat. So maybe I find it odd that I am always hungry here, as I said I don't want to seem ungrateful but I can't help how I feel, although even as I write this I feel like a total brat

I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm even asking for, i feel sluggish and sad and again now hungry. I have even considered keeping chips/biscuits in the bedroom to eat in private... 

Tl;dr staying at my boyfriends house, always hungry and feeling like an ungrateful brat

Edit: also I didn't mention we are in a very small village of 4K people. Here nobody walks (they insist driving a car because it looks better) so I also can't walk around to get myself food.. one time my boyfriend was getting groceries so I went with and got biscuits and things to keep in the room. But I feel like this is just going to make me put on weight.."

"My [27 F] boyfriend [28 M] of nine months, made himself sick trying to impress my family, who now hate him


I've been dating ""Adam"" for nine months now, which seemed to be a decent time to start integrating him into my extended family. Thanksgiving seemed too high pressure, so we settled for the next best thing: a dinner after Thanksgiving, before Christmas, but still in the holiday season when everyone's spirits would hypothetically be bright. This dinner happened yesterday night, on Friday. 

With my family, dinners are a Big Deal. My grandparents own a restaurant that many of my family members are involved with, and when it comes time for there to be a significant meal, we go all out. I'm the youngest of five and this is the first person I've bought home in a couple of years, so naturally everyone wanted to meet and show off for Adam. 

When it came time for dinner, things were going great; conversation was flowing, Adam was charming everyone, and I thought everyone was having a great time until dessert. As dessert started finishing up, Adam got a bit quieter, which was strange because after the food and wine, most of my relatives tend to get a bit louder and rowdier. I wanted to ask if he was okay but didn't want to draw unnecessary attention to him, so I let him be. Suddenly with no warning, he bolted up, looking panicked, and sprinted out of the room. I followed him of course, just in time to see him lose his dinner all over the bathroom door. He managed to make it inside after that, thankfully, and the rest of it got into the toilet. I was shocked but really concerned about him and rubbed his back, comforted him, told my mom who came out to check on us to give us a few moments etc, and when he was done he told me what had happened. Apparently as he'd been eating my family kept plying him with food, which again, is a fairly normal occurrence in my household. He didn't want to be rude or seem impolite, so he kept eating, and eating, until finally he, well, couldn't. I reassured him that it was okay, and even got him laughing a bit when I joked about how someday when he got more comfortable he'd learn that it's okay to say no to my grandma.

Of course, this put a damper on the evening, and he said that he was so embarrassed and feeling unwell still, so he politely popped back into the dining room, thanked my family for dinner and said he needed to head home, and he left. I cleaned up his mess and went back to the table and I hoped that would be that. 

Of course that was not that, or else I wouldn't have to write this post. I don't think anyone else knew what had happened at the time, they all seemed a little confused. My grandma asked me if Adam was okay and I said he was, that he'd loved the meal and that he'd just gone a little overboard. My mom interjected though and said, ""I guess your food made him sick."" 

This set off a huge hubbub. My grandma felt bad, my grandpa was upset, and by the end of the evening everyone was for some reason incredibly mad at Adam. I tried to explain what had happened but everyone brushed it aside. This afternoon my mom texted me saying that she didn't want to see Adam again until he apologized. I texted her back saying he did apologize, and that he had said goodbye to my family before he left, and that everyone had loved him before that. All she said in response was that he was incredibly rude and she's not answering my texts now.

How do I go about getting Adam back in everyone's good graces? For the record, I saw him today and he's feeling much better, albeit humiliated. I keep telling him he's fine and he has nothing to be ashamed of...although I'm not sure how well that's going to hold up once (if?) he finds out about all of this, which is another issue I could use some help with. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: At dinner with my family, my boyfriend ate too much to not seem rude and wound up getting sick. Now my family is insulted and does think he's rude, and I'm not sure how to approach the necessary conversations I need to have to talk to my family and to comfort my boyfriend. "
"My girlfriend [29F] introduced me to her son [13M] and I don't know if I want to parent him


My girlfriend, Emily, and I have been dating for six months now. Two nights ago, she sat me down and told me that she had something to tell me. Emily said that when she was 16, she was in a rough situation, and got pregnant. When her baby was born, her parents had an agreement with Emily's sister that she would raise the baby until Emily had the means to get him back. Emily worked hard to graduate, get a job, and have her own apartment, and finally got back in contact with her son. He's been doing weekly visits, and has his own room at her place (we mostly either go out, or hang out at my place, and while I see her often, she does say she has ""family stuff"" if she's busy). Soon, he'll be moving in full time and they're both really excited.

In the past, they had done counseling sessions with a child psychologist so that he could come to terms with everything, and according to Emily, he's very well-adjusted. They have a good relationship, he's got a clean record, and is doing very well in school. She asked if I would be willing to meet him the next day, because it's her next visit. I said that was fine.

Before I left, she said she didn't want me to feel like she was looking for someone to be her son's dad. She just wanted to be open with me, and since he was such a huge part of her life, it was only fair that I was included, because she wants me to be a big part of her life. I asked why she didn't tell me before, and she told me it was because she didn't want to complicate things, and so her son's privacy could be respected. She'd made the mistake of letting people in too early, and it just hurt them both. I didn't really know how to feel when I left, but everything just felt odd.

Yesterday, I went over to her house for dinner, and she introduced me to her son. He shook my hand, and kept calling me by my last name like I was a teacher. He was very polite, and a little bit shy. Even though he's a pretty stocky guy, he kept trying to hide behind his mom like he was 7. It was very endearing. We got along really well, and talked about how he likes sports, and how excited he is to come live with his mom. Nothing too serious, just lighthearted fun. By the time we finished dinner, Emily was upset because it was getting late, and he still hadn't done his homework. 

They argued a little bit, but it was all very light, and she was really nice. He struggled a little with his math, and so I stepped in to help out. We talked about how he wanted to do something regarding science when he was older, and Emily piped up, saying that I work in STEM. He got really excited about that, then bummed again when Emily made him do his English homework.

Overall, they had a really good dynamic. When I first came in the apartment, he was shy enough to just be mumbling to his mom, and she didn't force him to talk or yell at him, she just let him cling onto her and mumble until he was comfortable. Emily gushed about how good he is at sports, and he said that not only does Emily come to every game, but she always cheers the loudest for him.

After he went to bed, Emily said she was really happy with how things went, and she was glad that we got along so well. I agreed, and we left it at that.

Seeing Emily last night made me realize that I really do love her, and I'd be really excited to have kids with her. I just don't know if I want this kid. He's a nice kid, and we got along really well, but I don't want to feel like a stepfather. There's just something unique to having raised your own kids and seeing them from day one. And there's a lot of baggage involved, even if both of them have tried to work it out- I feel like it'll just keep rising up. But I do like Emily, and her son is a nice guy, I just don't know if I'm ready to enter into it all.

Am I wrong in feeling apprehensive? How can I communicate this to Emily? What's a good plan to proceed with?

TLDR: My GF of 6 months has a son who's getting back in her life. I want to be a parent, but I don't know if I want to parent her son. I love my GF and can see a future with her, but I'm not sure if it's okay for this to be a dealbreaker.

**UPDATE**: I read the comments here, and took a lot of them to heart. I also wanted to hear her side of the story, so I texted and asked what she was up to, and if she wanted to get coffee. She responded that her son was feeling really needy, and she wanted to spend time with him, but if I was willing to come over, she had a coffeemaker. I told her it was about her son, and she said it was okay, he could go to his room for a little bit, and we could talk on her terrace.

I came over, she made a good cup of coffee, and we hung out awkwardly for a moment before I asked her why she lied to me. After getting her Master's, Emily started getting involved with her son, and with a new guy. On their first date, she told him she had a son, and apparently, he posed a threat to her son's safety and it almost caused her sister to completely ban her from visiting. Emily said it mattered too much to her to let it happen again, and she's been trying to give herself a time period where she can figure out if someone's safe to be around him or not. She said she waited too long, and she apologized sincerely.

I told her I needed a little more time to think, and then I said bye to her and her son and just went home. I'm still conflicted. Yikes."
"I (18F) found out my mother (43F) has been spreading lies about me to our family and friends that I don't have a job, am lazy, am not paying for college, don't clean up after myself etc. I feel absolutely terrible because I love her and am not sure how to confront her about this.

"My sister [25F] has accused my husband [36M] of one year dated for four, of being inappropriate with her and I [25F] know she's lying, been sisters since age 6


reposted because I broke a rule. Sorry! Married for one-ish year, dating for four-ish years. Sisters for about 19-ish years


Alright. Before I get into this i'll discuss the age gap between my husband and I as I know that it will be discussed. Though I know as a rule older men dating younger women is not a good thing, I think we're one of the exceptions. We met in college when I was 18 and he was 29. He had a late start in life as he was the youngest child in the home when his mother got sick and was asked to stay behind to take care of her. This was a cultural expectation. So while his siblings went on to college he was taking care of his Alzheimers ridden mother. She died when he was 25 and it was an awful emotional burden that took him a while to bounce back from. 


We met in a volunteer group who spent time in nursing homes. I also took care of my grandmother the last year of high school to the best of my capabilities while she slowly declined too, so we had that in common. We had been friends for two years and at age 20 for me, we broached dating each other. He spoke to my family about dating me and all was well... so I thought. 



We moved in together during my final two years of college and we're honestly amazing roommates. We contribute fairly not just financially but emotionally and physically too. Last year we broached the topic of getting married and after some premarital counseling... went for it. We had a wedding, invited family the whole thing. My dad and stepmom and siblings on that side threatened to not come because they did not agree with our age gap and thought that i was only dating this guy for fun not for serious. My mom called him and told him he was being an idiot and nothing would separate us more than him not going. So they showed up.


Here's my present issue. My sister (well step sister but we consider each other sisters) stayed over this last week as she had a job interview in the city that my husband and I live in. She was a little cold to my husband but oh well we thought, she didn't really know him and maybe it cramped our sister sister style? We tried our best though and I did my best to have just her and me time so overall we didnt feel like it was a terrible time.


She left Friday and on Saturday I received a weird phone call from my father telling me that my husband had apparently been drunk Wednesday night while I was asleep, went to talk to my sister in the guest part of our home and began to profusely hit on her. To the point of making her feel uncomfortable for her safety. The immediate red flag was that my husband is sober 16 years and if he was going to break that it would be bigger.... if that makes sense. My dads side also does not know he is sober. 


Not wanting to completely discount it I asked why she didnt say anything or something. Those are awful feelings to be dealing with and i would have found her better accommodations like a hotel or something. My father said that she didnt want to hurt my feelings by telling me but the weight of it was too much. She also has some recorded proof that my husband hit on her. I asked if I could hear it or it be sent to me as at this point i was doubting my husband a little, and they wouldn't send it to me. They couldn't trust me to send a copy of a recording to listen to? What?? Ok so that's fishy beyond belief right?


Now my dad and that side have barred me from seeing them or going to family events unless I leave my husband. My sister has been posting all over facebook about being part of metoo, that blood is thicker than water, and how she cant even be safe with her sister.


I dont know what to do. I'm not leaving my husband without proof. Especially with how withholding theyre being of it. I asked my husband what happened that night and he told me that he came home from shift work, saw my sister watching tv said hey how are you, asked what she was watching, then went to our room and went to bed. I remember waking up to him coming to bed and nothing seemed off. 




Wtf do I do here?



  **tl;dr**: Sister accused my husband of being inappropriate with her, says there is a recording but will not share it with me. It seems really incredible but has completely managed to have me cut out of family events unless I leave my husband.... what do I do here?"
"UPDATE: My (22F) father (70M) invited TOTAL STRANGERS to Thanksgiving and neglected to tell anyone until the last minute.


Firstly, thanks to everyone for the great ideas and insight. I really appreciate it. Here is a bare-bones update on what went down. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7dhdqr/my_22f_father_70m_invited_total_strangers_to/

I talked over the trip and the changes that had come up with my boyfriend. He still wanted to go. 
He was really great about it, told me he would re-arrange the food and gifts we sent for the actual dinner and would bring more for the week when all these people would be crashing. So, we flew down. 

We ended up having to crash on what were essentially cushioned beach chairs for the entire week.
My cousin and her husband(I have met them only once or twice) got one guest bedroom, my teenage brother got the other. 
My other aunt, who is 50s and just had surgery this summer, slept on the couch. 
My parents had their own room. (Duh, but I figured I'd include that).

When my cousin and her husband showed up--they had invited the random friends whose names we never learned--they simply shrugged and said their friends had decided not to come. 
They also brought 4 of their dogs, which were not house trained.

These two spent their entire stay interrupting everyone, spinning ridiculously stupid stories (ex: how they were friends with the REAL creator of Bitcoin) and generally being drunk, racist, and obnoxious. But that's a different issue. 

As anticipated, my brother refused to let my boyfriend and I ""borrow"" the car (which is not his, but my parents) for our day trip. This trip, as stated before, had been confirmed and reconfirmed with my parents to make sure all the scheduling worked out. 
The morning of our trip (an hour late in our departure) my mom finally said we could use the other car. My brother had gone out drinking (underage and driving) the night before, didn't come back the next morning. We asked everyone in the house (i.e. My dad) if that was ok, took the second car for the day and had it home before dinner. Of course when we got back, my father had some snide remarks about having to bike down the block to the store. Yes, I paid them for the gas! 

Basically my boyfriend and I helped out my mom as much as we could with keeping up the house and fetching food and the cleaning. We provided as much social interaction needed to be polite, and for the rest of the time went off and did our own thing. Sleeping conditions were uncomfortable but livable. 

We were both really grateful to have gotten some sun and water and fishing. We're both going to the chiropractor after the sleeping setup, and the roller coasters from the day trip haha. 

We kept it civil, sweet, and enjoyed the moments that were fun. My boyfriend really rolled with the punches and helped keep my stress level down. He was a great sport, and we definitely enjoy many aspects of the holiday--many aspects away from the house. 

We thanked my parents profusely and confirmed that we would not be coming down for Christmas. 

TLDR: Went down to my parents place, survived rude relatives, had fun in our alone time. "
"My [24/F] best friend's [23/F] boyfriend [25/M] tried to take creep shots of me and I don't know how to tell her.


Sorry if this is a little long, I don't really know where to begin.

So Erin and I have been friends since middle school. We have been through it all.


She has overcome many difficult relationships, moved past it, and changed into a different person (for the better). About three years back, she met her now-boyfriend, Ryan. When I say Erin was obsessed with Ryan, I mean it. She constantly talked about him and was completely head over heels for this guy even before they started dating. Eventually, they did become official. They quickly moved in together (his hometown, not ours), have travelled together quite extensively, and have pretty much been a model couple. All of Erin's friends really like Ryan. He fits in perfectly, and is just a really nice person.  
Erin is **extremely** happy with Ryan. She often tells me how she is still just as in love as when they first met, and how she feels like they are supposed to be together. They travel, live in a great area, and  have their dream puppy. Basically, everything she has ever wanted has come true in the past year or so. 
I have never seen her so happy, and it is really an amazing thing to see for me. Before this all, I was so so so happy for her and Ryan.
 

So here is the problem:
About 1.5 weeks ago, Ryan, Erin, and myself went out drinking. None of us drank much, and we called it an early night. It was planned that I would be staying on their pull out bed in the living room for the night. I had brought pajama shorts and a tank top, which I didn't give any thought to as this is my usual sleepwear at a friend's. Anyway, we go to bed and all is well. At about ~4 am, I'm startled awake by something very lightly moving at my feet. I should note that I put a pillow over my head to block out noise from outside. At first, I think it is the puppy, but realized I didn't hear the sound of his nails on the floor, which would have absolutely woken me up as I am a very lightsleeper (also it sleeps in a crate at night). Realizing that it could not be the puppy, I became frozen. It's hard to explain but I really couldn't move. The blanket at my feet was being pulled very lightly over my legs to expose them. I start to shift around in my sleep and move the pillow off of my eyes a little. To my surprise, I see Ryan standing by the side of my bed completely still. I move around a bit more, to signal I am waking up, unsure of what he is doing. He really quietly shuffles away. If I hadn't seen him, I probably wouldnt't have heard him shuffle away at all. He was eerily quiet. 

I figure he was trying to get one of my blankets without waking me up, as maybe him and Erin were cold. I turn onto my other side (the bed I slept in did not have a wall on either side, just the head), and I see him standing extremely still behind a wall in the kitchen. At this point, I am frozen again and my heart starts pounding. He then walks up, and turns his phone flashlight on and shines it in my eyes, which were open a very small amount. This startled me, and I accidentally let out a noise. He quietly shuffled into his bedroom and I heard the door close.

Again, I think he must have been trying to get a blanket and I fall back asleep. Probably an hour passes and I wake up to the exact same sensation of the blankets being moved from my body. My heart at this point is pounding incredibly fast and I am scared he will be able to hear it and realize I am awake. My back was facing toward him, and I kept feeling the covers getting peeled back. I think I was in shock, as I would have never thought he would do anything even remotely sinister. My back is exposed now, and I thought he was going to get into the bed with me, which I thought I could use as an excuse to wake up and ask him what he was doing. Instead, the flash of his camera went off. Realizing what just happened, I started coughing and clearing my throat, and moving around until he shuffled off again. I was very shocked and confused at this point, as I considered Ryan a friend of mine. At one point, I even started thinking that he must have had a plan in case I woke up, like attacking me or something. He most likely didn't, but that is where my mind kept going for some reason, and it made me too scared to move.


From what I think was about 5am to 8am he constantly tried to move the covers off of me but as I had not fallen back asleep, I would pull the covers tighter and tighter around me each tim, as well as cough and yawn and stretch and generally give off the signs that I was waking. Finally, at around 8am he went back into his bedroom and I texted my boyfriend that I needed to talk to him when he woke up and to please call me. The sun was up at this point, and the room was completely bright. I figured I was safe at this point, because it was officially daytime, and decided I could let myself relax until Erin woke up. About 45 minutes after I had texted my boyfriend (my boyfriend and Ryan really get on and like eachother a LOT), Ryan came BACK AGAIN. At this point I started yawning and stretching to let him know I was awake. He very hurriedly shuffled to his room and I quickly pulled out my phone and played a youtube video quite loudly, hoping he could hear it.

 I am just in complete shock because I thought we were friends and he respected me, yet he terrorized me all night. Also, I am completely enraged at how he could do this at all, and even while in a relationship with my best friend. And selfishly, I am angry that he put me in the position where I have to destroy her happiness.


I know I have to tell her, but I am unsure of what to say. I guess I just want to know how to go about this. I haven't spoken to either of them since, despite us previously speaking daily prior to this incident. I don't know if she will believe me, which is my greatest fear. I also don't know if she will hate me or blame me. I wish I had a night vision camera set up as proof. I really don't want to destroy everything she had wanted for so long, but I know I don't have a choice. How should I approach this? Do I text her? Ask to meet for lunch? Do I confront him? I keep thinking that it is going to ruin our friendship, and it's his word against mine. I am also concerned that he posted the picture to some kind of creep shot forum.
Any advice would be appreciated. I am very sorry for the long post.


Tl;dr: my best friends boyfriend kept coming into where I was sleeping to take creep shots of me. I was frozen the entire time. It lasted all night into the morning. Do not know how to approach the situation with my best friend as I am scared she will not believe me.

"
My (21F) boyfriend’s (22M) Father(44M) made a pretty aggressive pass at me a few days ago. Should I tell my boyfriend or just leave it alone?
"Friend (34F) asked me for assurance that her husband doesn't have to worry about me (33M).


So I met a close friend of mine that I had a falling out with for drinks after work this week.  We had stopped talking to each other about a month ago after she unexpectedly started distancing herself from me.  I tried to confront her several times about what was going on until she finally just cut me off completely.  Then I get a text asking if we could meet for drinks so I said fine.  


We are both happily married and have never expressed any sort of feelings for eachot her other than friendship.  We had a great time and she just told me that she had been going through some personal stuff and she appologized and said that she was glad we could work things out.  

So at the end of our evening together I just came out and said that I still felt she was keeping something from me to which she responded ,""The real reason I cut things off with you is that my husband asked me if he should be worried about you and I need to be able to tell him at the end of the night that he doesn't have anything to worry about, so does he?"".  


I was really taken aback by this as her husband and I are also friends and I have never done or said anything even close to inappropriate with his wife.  I also thought that the way she worded the question was weird as it's her responsibility to reassure her husband that she will be faithful, not mine.  


So once I got over the shock of the question I said of course not, I'm happily married and I respect your marriage and your husband as well and I would never do anyhthing to jeopardise that.  I left feeling really confused and hurt realizing that our friendship is probably over because I'm definitely not that kind of guy.

  When I got home I talked to my wife about it and she pointed out that her question to me was very weird and she thought that what she meant wasn't that she thought I was making a move on her but that she is actually the one who has feelings for me and wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to try anything because she may have been tempted to do something.  She also pointed out that she never said she didn't have feelings for me and never directly asked if I had feelings for her which led my wife to believe that she does have feelings for me.

  I'm hoping that's the case because otherwise it means that she was saying that she thinks I'm a low life who wants to cheat on his wife...   What do you guys think?

Edit:  I also forgot to add that the next thing she said after that comment was ""I don't want to lead anyone on""

Tl;dr - Female friend told me that her husband asked her if he should be worried about me and that she needs to know that she can tell him he has nothing to worry about.   What was she trying to say to me?"
"Update: I (24 F) just found a bunch of screenshots of my fiance's (29 M) (together 5 years) friend (late 20's F) saved to his phone. looks like taken off her instagram. I just had a baby and am feeling really hurt by this.


Edit: i should clarify, I am still talking to him about general life stuff, our kid, bills, work, etc. I just cant bring myself to talk about the specific issue so far. Not giving him complete silent treatment. Seriously not trying to punish him, I have tried to talk about it but I get so anxious, my chest and throat tighten up, I lose my breath and tears start.

I still feel really hurt. He want's to make this right, but I just can't think of anything he could do right now that would make me feel better? The first night I slept on the couch and he came over and started talking, I just couldn't stand to listen to him so I put headphones on and upped the volume to drown him out (pretty childish, I know.) So I have no idea what he said that first night. I've been sleeping separately all week, I just can't bring myself to be so close to him. I am used to cuddling up to him every night and I just don't want him to touch me at all. 

Thanksgiving was awkward, I had him come to dinner at my dad's because it would have been worse trying to explain or come up with a reason for why he wasn't there. Luckily I hardly had to interact with him and no one noticed. The food my dad made was so amazing it brought back my appetite a bit and my pie turned out great too. 


As far as recovering from giving birth, physically I am doing great, and emotionally I think I am doing alright too.I know being a surrogate is really weird to some people but I honestly never felt connected to that baby and do not feel weird or anything because I do not have her. It's like I was just babysitting for 9 months and I finally got to give her back to her parents. Maybe postpartum hormones are contributing to my current dilemma, but idk. 


This past Sunday-Wednesday we were on a vacation. It sucked being stuck in a car with him and in hotel rooms, and him kind of pretending everything was fine but I wasn't going to throw away $1000 dollars worth of hotel rooms and activities over this. So for our sons' sake I sucked it up and tried to enjoy the trip as much as I could while avoiding him as  much as possible. We drove up the northern CA coast, it was beautiful and just the sunsets themselves made going on the trip 100% worth it to me...


At one point, while our son was napping during a long drive he started talking about how I made him feel like a piece of shit and how he hated the silent treatment and he brought up everything that was wrong in our relationship EXCEPT the picture thing. Which just made me more angry. I am not intentionally giving him the silent treatment, I just physically cannot bring myself to talk about the current issue without crying and I just need to think and put myself together more before I can talk about it.  He was talking about stuff like our apartment never being clean (he was in no way blaming just me, it's a joint issue we both need to work on) and how he talks too much sometimes.!?! the only thing he said in relation to the current issue is that he feels like I don't trust him.

 Despite this I actually do trust him not to cheat. Maybe that sounds crazy to some people but I know him. We both grew up in families with parents that cheated and had bitter divorces that ruined our childhoods.. We have talked about it a lot, and I guess I trust him enough to just end our relationship on better terms than to cheat on me.  I believe him saving the pictures is a completely one-sided (creepy) thing. I have no reason to think that  she sent him  the pictures or that they have any communication at all since they no longer work together. I might want to see proof of this, later, but for right now I do not think this is an issue of him cheating on me. More an issue of him doing something very creepy that crosses a boundary. 



 I could ask him to delete any pictures and make promises, whatever. But ultimately my insecurities won't let me feel anything besides hurt right now. Like I need to work on myself, and my self image before I can even think about ""us"" and what me finding the pictures means for our relationship. 

I hate my body right now (even though objectively I look fucking great for just having had a baby, no one believes me when I tell them) and I just keep comparing myself to this woman. I DO think about how creepy this was for him to do, but I find that I cannot stop thinking about how I will literally never ever look like this woman. She's a conventionally attractive, petite, fit, white lady. I'm like a fat, brown, giant compared to her. I never thought I was ugly before, more unique looking and average/pretty. I feel UGLY right now, like I  thought I had found a person that loved me and thought I was beautiful only to find out I am not his ideal, more like the opposite and that this woman is his ideal.   It is so shitty feeling this way. Obviously he is with me and not her, or anyone else so I really need to figure out myself before I can figure out this issue. It might be awhile TBH. 

After thinking about it for a week, I think another part of the reason it hurts so much is because I just don't have eyes for anyone else but him. I don't fantasize about anyone, even when I watch porn it's like I use it to help me imagine us in those positions or scenarios.

 I don't expect him to feel the same way, and not fantasize about anyone else, but seeing the evidence of him thinking about someone he knows personally is 1. CREEPY and 2. not anything I can relate to. Sure, I see a hot guy and think ""that guy is hot."" or I totally can say I have had a crush on a co-worker or friend. but it stops there for me. I don't think about them besides an initial reaction/thought when I see them. I especially do not stalk through their social media and save their pictures! That part is so creepy to think about, I would feel so violated if I found out one of my friends was jerking off to my pictures. His initial reaction when I sent him a picture of the screenshots and called him out for being a creep was ""it is creepy but I still look at porn"" and ""she is also an instagram model"" 

IMO these pictures, while mostly of her in a bikini and dressed for the club and in a sexy halloween costume, they just do not look like insta model pictures! they look more normal and candid than her purposefully trying to look sexy just for her followers! like most of the pictures he saved she was with family and friends. EW. There was I think only one picture of just her and she was wearing a sports bra and short shorts, flexing at the gym!  I havent had insta in over a year but I remember all the ""models"" and the constant selfies and booty and boobs in your face. These pics are not like that at all.  ugh it's so fucked up the more I think about it.. So, not that it makes much of a difference but I want to confirm if she is a ""model"" or not because I think he is lying about that. I guess him lying would make it different. 

So my plan right now is to work on myself and then we can talk. I need to work out like a script or something to start this conversation because every time I try to talk about it I just feel the waterworks coming on and can't make the words come out. I've been thinking about writing everything down in a letter or just showing him my posts, that way he can also see how most people seem to agree what he did was wrong too. 


Anyways, that is where I am at. Hopefully I will have a better update soon. 


TLDR: I'm hella insecure and need to work on myself before I can talk to him about this. I cannot stop comparing myself to the woman he saved the pictures of. He feels like I am giving him the silent treatment and he feels ""like a piece of shit."" He wants to make things right but I have no clue what he could do that would make me feel better right now. Definitely doubting his claim that this woman is also an ""instagram model."" Where to go from here?

"I [30 M] am having some serious doubts about the continued longevity of my marriage with my wife [31 F] due to a hard-shift regarding religious ideals on my part


Hi folks, 

Using an alt account for reasons.  I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but with as long a relationship as this has been, it's collected a lot of baggage.  We've been married coming up on 12 years.  We started dating at 16 and married just as young, right out of high school.  We were both very, VERY religious.  She'd been attending a conservative Church of Christ since birth; I was raised Baptist and began attending the CoC with her a few months after we began dating.  By 18 we were married, by 20 we had our first of 2 children.  At 22 I was heavily considering getting into the ministry, looking at attending the Memphis School of Preaching - a very conservative evangelical academy within the CoC.  I ended up receiving a very attractive job offer prior to pulling the trigger which put that dream on hold at the time (but ultimately killed it in the long run).  

As time passed, I became less religious, and she became more religious.  By 2014 I was considering myself an atheist internally, but hid those thoughts from my wife until late 2016 where I finally ""came out.""  To say that this has caused problems would be an understatement.   I became more liberal in many of my views, she became more conservative.  The most recent election caused some very heated ""conversations"" on the couch after the kids went to bed.  I became more skeptical and scientifically minded, she holds firm that the earth is 6000 years old and that dinosaurs walked with humans.  Most conversations end in her crying and saying something along the lines of ""why did you have to go and fill your head with that trash?""  Which, as you might imagine, is incredibly deflating.  

At this point, I feel the only thing holding us together is the kids.  This isn't the sort of thing that's going to be reconciled by seeing past each others differences...the CoC is the sort of church who thinks other christian groups are going to hell because they ""haven't read the bible correctly.""  Very cult-like, in my mind, but I would never say that to her....The take-away here is that she is ""right"" and will forever BE right and actively refuses to partake of information that may tell her otherwise.  I used to hold to that mentality.  I no longer can.  Obviously, this has had some serious ramifications when it comes to raising our children when we have extremely different world views.  

I don't know what sort of responses I'll get here, but I really just needed to vent.  I don't know where I want to go from here.  I don't necessarily want to end the marriage, but I certainly don't want to continue as-is.  I just don't see any resolution down the road.  If anything, I see this continuing as it has been, ""ignoring the problem,"" until the kids are out of the house...and then what?  I don't know.  


 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Used to be religious, now I'm not.  Wife still is, which is causing some serious issues.  



EDIT:  Sorry everyone, there’s so many comments coming through I’m having a hard time keeping up. Just know that I appreciate every one of you who have taken the time to comment. In the end, I know what the inevitable outcome is going to be...but I’m sad, I’m scared, I’m a lot of things except glad this is the result. I’m going to put counseling back on the table, we’re see where that goes for now. Thank you all. "
"My (26f) fiance (27m) of 5 years is severely depressed (on meds, therapy, etc...) his mom (50s?) is warning me that this is a bout of ""extreme tantrum and laziness"" and he's done it his entire life, says I should leave. I'm really torn.


Obviously, this issue goes really deep but I'm going to try and keep it as short as possible.

Basically, in March of last year my fiance was laid off from his job. For lack of a better term, he's always been a bit ""morose"" but I just figured it was part of his personality, and to be very honest he's actually very funny in his cynicism. But after losing his job, he went downhill fast, I'd say about a week he was getting out of bed for maybe 8 hours a day, that declined to only getting out of bed maybe an hour a day to go to the bathroom and eat. We postponed our summer wedding, he went to therapy, they suggest a psychiatrist, he tried meds and ultimately ended up in a 2 week inpatient treatment that he extended to four weeks. That wrapped up in the beginning of September. He came out with new meds, a seemingly new outlook on everything. He got rejected for the only job he had applied for and it was like the process started all over again. 

Since about July my future MIL has been desperately trying to get in touch with me. She seems to really, really like me but my fiance has always warned me about her so if I'm being honest, I've been very distant and cold with her. On the few occasions where she would catch me on the phone I was pretty good about changing the subject or pretending like she was catching me at a bad time. 

This thanksgiving, she was hosting a huge dinner that was essentially a family reunion (I think there were over 50 people in her house). She'd been planning it for at least two years. My fiance said he'd wanted to go but literately as we were driving out of the drive way he had an anxiety attack and couldn't go. I knew that his mom would be heartbroken so I got him set up in his bed, got him his meds, made him some food for the weekend and ended up making the 10 hour drive to her house by myself. 

It was the first time I'd ever been around his family without him around and contrary to the sort of ""cold peace"" that exists when he's there, the entire family was warm, joyful, loving, full of laughter. I ended up having an amazing time. I have a pretty positive workplace but I'd forgotten how isolated I'd become living in such a ""sad"" house and never seeing other people, never going out and never seeing my family or friends. 

Before I left on Friday, his mom pulled me aside and asked if she could please talk to me. I finally gave her the chance. Basically she confessed to me that she'd indulged my fiance in every way possible since he was a kid and she made a huge mistake. She said that this latest depressive episode sounds exactly like the stunts (her words) he'd pull as a kid when he didn't get his way. She said he's always been very manipulative and his attitude had a huge impact on the way the rest of the house was run and everything got better when he went into the military. She said he's always been extremely lazy and will use whatever excuse he can just to get out of participating in nearly everything. She said the way he was raised was her greatest mistake and she got more serious about her younger kids and they are both happy and productive. She said that he's so good at manipulating people that she suspects he even manipulates professionals who are trying to treat him--and she suspects he's even manipulating me. I thanked her, she asked me to please leave him for my own sake and that she would support me in every way possible. 

Needless to say I had a ton to mull over on the way home. The truth is I'm exhausted, I'm sad, I'm working at least time and half (I'm a nurse so even my standard shift is exhausting) often more to keep us afloat. I indulged him in buying his dream ""craftsman"" house so I live with with one barely functioning bathroom, buckets, tools, materials and dust everywhere so I don't sleep well at my own house. All my money goes into our mortgage, insurance, cars and his treatment. I live on a diet of steamed broccoli, ramen noodles and cheap frozen pizza and I feel I'm sick all the time. 

On top of all of this, he shows no signs of getting better in fact they are getting worse. When I tried to talk to him about what his mom said (I even offered to wait until we were at a therapy appointment) he said she's the biggest liar he's ever met and he slammed his door so hard the plaster actually cracked and I really haven't seen him since. 

Basically, is it time for me to cut my losses and go? I feel like a nurse I should be better at dealing with him but I feel like I just out of the pan when I leave work and into the fire when I get home. But I feel like in a professional setting I would be able to tell a patient manipulating me but at home, because emotions are involved I'm getting run over. Basically, what should I do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My future MIL warned me that my fiance's latest depression is probably him just being lazy and manipulative. What should I do?

Edit: so I guess I posted this a few hours ago. Seeing what everyone is saying in black and white has forced me to realize I can't ignore it anymore. 

I just got off the phone with his mom and broke down and confessed that I need help. She asked if I wanted her help fixing him or her help leaving him. I said at this point, leaving. She said that was the right choice. She's making a plane reservation now and is going to fly in early this next week and help me asses and figure out how to move out and along. I'm in tears because it's the first time in almost 9 months someone in my personal life has said ""here, I'm going to help you, you get to relax."" I'm literally crying my eyes out because I don't think if she would have said what she said ar thanksgiving, I would never have posted this, if I didn't post it I Wouldn't have got such great advice...and I WOULD Have stuck it out for months or even years to come.

I'm calling work to take some vacation time this week so I can focus on getting this sorted out. 

Everyone in this thread helped. Thank you so much, I mean that with the deepest of sincerity. "

"I [34F] am about to publish a very personal essay that will devastate my parents [60s M/F] if they read it. Important for me to publish this, but I don't want to hurt anyone. What should I do?


I'm a writer, but until now I've only published fiction. Most of my family has shown little interest in my work, aside from one sister.
This week I had a personal essay accepted by a major publication. It will be my first time receiving a check for a creative work (I also write professionally, but it's hard to make money for creative writing...dat starving artist life). I have a ton of writers in my social network and was very excited about the publication, so I posted about it on Facebook.

I made the mistake of not blocking my family from seeing my publication announcement, but I honestly didn't think any of them (aside from the one sister) would care. But I really should have been more careful, because the essay, although ostensibly political, really is hugely personal. It definitely doesn't vilify my parents or anything, but I know it would be incredibly hurtful for them to read. I think they're portrayed as well-intentioned but misguided. It's also very critical of some of their ideals.

Well, my dad messaged me the other night and asked me to send him a link once it's published. I was just like...shit. I said, ""Okay, it has to go through edits and blah blah blah."" I'm not going to share the link with him, and I'll hide them from the post when I share it on social media, but if he wants to find it, he'll be able to, and he'll be devastated.

My relationship with my parents is already strained. They don't approve of many of my life choices, and they refuse to acknowledge that my mental illness (bipolar 2--went through a period of extreeeeeme depression in the last couple of years) is in fact a real illness and not just a bad attitude/lack of vitamins/whatever. I'm not going to just not publish these things that I feel the need to write about...this is what I do, and I have important things to say. But hurting people isn't my goal. I know it sucks that they have to be part of it. It feels like collateral damage, and that's not something I feel great about. But it is what it is.

Anyway...I'm just kind of freaking out about my dad reading this essay. He's tried to be a good parent. I think they've done a lot to fuck me up, but I know it wasn't intentional. Bah, I don't know whether to just do my best to hide the publication or to actually communicate with my dad about the fact that he shouldn't read it. I like being communicative, but I just don't think there's any way he'll choose not to read it, especially if he knows he and my mom are in it.

**tl;dr:** About to have a very personal essay published on a major website. My dad wants to read it but it will devastate him. Halp."

"SIL [24F] throwing a tantrum because our In-laws [60s] want to change vacation plans to accommodate our [30s] children. Should I intervene?


I’m writing this on my phone so apologies for any errors.

Anyways my in laws are very generous people. They’re fairly well off and for the past few years they really enjoy treating the whole family out on exotic vacations. 

So here’s the current issue. In laws suggested a week long cruise trip on a very expensive/very exclusive line that none of us would be able to afford otherwise. Apparently SIL was really into it as it would’ve been very glamourous and luxurious and she could invite one friend. However after talking about it with my husband, I decided that our youngest should not go on the trip as she suffers from an illness from birth that has flared up in the past year. The idea of taking her out at sea without proper medical care and hundreds of miles from the closest hospital gave me a lot of anxiety. 

We told the in laws that my husband and our oldest will go as expected and I will stay home with our other one. However my in laws won’t have it. They don’t want to go on a trip where we all can’t go so they asked us what sorts of trips would be appropriate for us at the moment. We said anything that’s close to any big city where there is sufficient medical support in case anything happens. Ok they come back and said they’ve nixed the cruise idea. Now they are planning a family trip to Japan just so that we can all come because they want to see their grandchildren too. 

Well SIL heard and is now being ridiculously rude and demanding of us. She basically threw an adult tantrum over text, saying that the past year has been hard for her and it’s so like her parents to favour us and their grandchildren over her. She texted my husband asking him to just tell their parents that we won’t be coming at all so they can go back to the cruise plan. She said it’s not fair one of our kids get to decide the entire family vacation, and that no one asked her what she wanted. 

I think she’s being unfair because this was completely the parents choice. They didn’t want to go on a cruise where one of their grandchildren couldn’t go, so they are now choosing something else. My husband even offered to talk to his parents about choosing another city according to SIL wishes but she says she been “everywhere” and the exclusive cruise was the only thing she wanted. 

Yesterday she sent me a lengthy email asking me to see things from her perspective. She said she thinks my kids are too young to remember anything anyways and maybe it’s better we all just sit out this time and tell her parents we’ve decided to stay home. She also said something like I’ve never been nice to her so this is the one thing I could do to pay her back. I have no idea what she’s referring to, but now I don’t know how to reply. 

What should I say to her? Are we being unreasonable for not wanting to sit out on this trip? Does SIL have a point?

Edit: also to add that this isn’t just any trip. This is their 40th  anniversary trip.

  **tl;dr**: In laws wanted to treat whole family to an exclusive cruise trip, but my youngest daughter wouldn’t be able to go due to health.

"UPDATE: Me (26 F) with my husband (32 M), considering skipping vacation after he accused me of cheating


Hey guys! Figured I️ would post an update for those of you who were interested. Here’s a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hwrah/me_26_f_with_my_husband_32_m_considering_skipping/

First off I️ want to thank everyone who offered their point of view, even if some people were pretty harsh. Seems like everyone was pretty polarized on things and reading through all the posts I️ think that the truth falls somewhere in the middle.

I️ messed up and I️ betrayed his trust. I️ can’t push him to forgive me and I️ shouldn’t. I️ likely haven’t been as open about reassuring him and conveying my regret as I️ should have been and I️ realize that more now. At the same time, I️ was put in an awkward situation at work which was hard to navigate and people make bad calls sometimes.

Just for clarity’s sake: I️ never met up with coworker outside of work, we never spent time together one on one and we certainly never had a drink together. The second time coworker and I️ were texting was in the middle of the day and I️ had no idea he was drinking - I️ thought we were having a normal conversation until things went sideways real quick. Should’ve blocked him the first time he disrespected my marriage and shouldn’t have been texting him at all... You live and you learn.

Anyways, husband was really apologetic as soon as he woke up and continued to apologize throughout the day. When we both got home this evening we had a long talk about things. I️ acknowledged that what I️ did was wrong and that I️ betrayed him. No matter what happens what I️ did will never be okay. I️ apologized for that and expressed my regret and at the same time I️ explained that he can’t keep accusing me of cheating. I️ told him I️ did not cheat and I️ said that was the last time I️ would answer that question. All I️ have is my word and at this point he has to decide if that’s enough. Throwing accusations around right before bed on a weeknight months after all this occurred isn’t going to solve anything.

He completely agreed that he didn’t want to keep going in circles like this. I️ suggested he approach me differently in the future if he needed reassurance and explained I️ would be happy to give it to him after everything that happened. He was really receptive to this and agreed to try something different in the future. If he comes to me with insecurities I️ am going to work on being less defensive and more understanding of his pain.

We ended things with both agreeing to seek individual counseling. We aren’t currently going to couples counseling but once we sort things out on our own we will likely go down that road again to continue working on our relationship. We both have a lot of baggage and it’s hard to be in a healthy relationship when neither of us have good models. We’re really trying and both committed to making this thing work because we love each other dearly.

I️ realize now that skipping the vacation was just a way to avoid the problem and wasn’t productive. I️ think I️ still feel guilty and embarrassed of what happen and hate having to deal with it - both on the level of betraying husband and on being harassed by coworker. That’s obviously not fair to him because he went through it too. I️ will definitely be going and I’m hoping we have a chance to forget about work for the weekend and reconnect.

TL;DR Husband apologized, I️ apologized while explicitly stating I didn’t cheat and no longer want to be accused of cheating. I️ agreed to be more reassuring and open through this process while he agreed to come to me with his feelings more so that I️ have the opportunity to do so. We are seeking individual counseling and I’m definitely going on our trip!"

"[UPDATE] Everything is right between me (34F) and my potential love interest (34M) except a lack of chemistry. I have kids and struggle to find someone I'm really into who accepts them, but this guy does. What should I do?


[**Original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7g5aga/everything_is_right_between_me_34f_and_my/)

Since making my original post, which spelled out the concerns I've had for the year and a half I've known this person, I really couldn't shake the feeling that something had changed. I kept thinking about him and wanting to see him. Although I'd kind of decided to just take it slow, as some had suggested, taking it slow didn't feel like what I wanted. 

So I asked him on a date. We'd been talking a lot and had seen each other regularly, but I wanted him to know I viewed it as a date. I wasn't 100% certain he was still interested in me after all this time, but I thought he probably was, based on things he'd suggested for us in the future. So I texted, ""Will you go on a date with me?"" and sent a silly ""do you like me"" gif, and he said, ""Absolutely."" 

Our date was last night. We went to dinner and a movie, and then back to his house to talk. One of the reasons I've been so confused with him is that he's just not as physically assertive as I'm used to. I'm not accustomed to making the first move. I guess we're both a little physically shy around each other for some reason. Finally it got late and I said I should head home--I live half an hour away. He said, ""Next time we should plan better and you can bring stuff to stay."" I said, ""I have a bag in my car. I always come prepared."" :P So I stayed the night, and it was really nice! In bed we were, again, a little shy, but laughed and cuddled a lot before finally kissing etc, and I enjoyed it all. I think a big part of it before was really the awful emotional place I was in. He's always represented a likely lifelong partner to me, and I think that was scary for me before, even though I knew it was what I eventually wanted. 

Surely a ""defining the relationship"" talk will happen soon, but I'm not too worried about it just yet. But we do have several things planned as far out as April, so I don't know, I guess I do expect it might get serious, and in this moment, I like that idea. 

Anyway...I'm happy with the way things are going, and hopeful that this happiness will stay!

"[UPDATE] My [26/F] boyfriend [30/M] refuses to be my date at my cousin's wedding in December


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70051y/my_25f_boyfriend_30m_refuses_to_be_my_date_at_my/

So my cousin’s wedding was last night, and my boyfriend did not go, but there is more to the story!

A couple weeks after my post, my boyfriend came home from work one day and said he had good news and bad news. The good news was that he would come to the wedding with me. The bad news was that his work was sending him out of the country for a project and that he’d be gone a month (missing my birthday in November). So his agreeing to the wedding was to soften the blow of the work trip—fine with me!

Unfortunately his trip got extended and we got confirmation just before thanksgiving that he wouldn’t be back in time for the wedding, so I’d have to be dateless anyway.

HOWEVER, a couple weeks ago while on the phone, with no prompting or prodding from me, he told me that he will definitely be my date to weddings in the future because (even though he still thinks that weddings are dumb and pointless) he knows it’s important to me, and he said that he cares about me enough that making that sacrifice is okay. 

The wedding was fun; it was great to see my family. It would have been more fun with my boyfriend there but it’s okay because now I know we will have plenty of opportunities in the future.


TL;DR Boyfriend agreed to come to the wedding but a work trip prevented him. He will come to future weddings because he likes me more than he hates weddings."
"My (18F) boyfriend (19M) will not leave when I ask. I am fed up


My boyfriend &amp; i have been together for one year. One of my biggest pet peeves with him is he is always late. Like usually anywhere from 45 min to an hour late. He is very aware of this &amp; tells me that he's trying to fix it, but so far nothing has changed. 

So last night we were supposed to meet up around 10, smoke, &amp; then go back to my place to watch TV. I texted him around 9:30 &amp; said ""is 10 really gonna work?"" because he's usually late. He said ""no 10:15 is better"" Ok whatever. At least he told me. But also he only considered that he would be late after I brought it up. Anyway, at 10:15 I leave my apartment to wait for him. After 30 minutes of me waiting in the cold, he's finally ready. At this point i'm pretty tired so i suggest we just go back to my place.

Now onto the second issue. Besides my boyfriend being late he DOES NOT LEAVE WHEN I ASK HIM TO. This is incredibly frustrating &amp; he does it all the time. If we are in his car &amp; I try to get out, he will hold me down &amp; beg me for sex for however long it takes me to give in or finally just wait it out. Last night, he kept trying to kiss me &amp; initiate sex but I was completely exhausted so I suggested we hang out the next day because I was about to fall asleep. Nope. For the next HOUR my boyfriend proceeds to hold me down &amp; kiss me, once I can finally get up he starts grabbing me &amp; trying to pin me against the wall, I'm like NO. He doesn't listen!!!! Finally I'm literally standing by the door tapping my foot like GET OUT. But to him it's like a joke or a game. He lies on the floor &amp; raps all of Nas's second verse from NY State of Mind, keeps initiating conversation to deflect from the fact that I want him to leave, &amp; does nothing to gather up his stuff. Instead he just stares at himself in the mirror &amp; talks to me like we're just hanging out, not like I've been waiting to sleep for over an hour &amp; he clearly overstayed his welcome. Finally I get him to gather up his stuff (which takes him probably 10 minutes. I watched him as it took like 5 min for him to unplug his phone &amp; put his charger away. That's how slow he is).

Finally, we're by the door &amp; I'm ready to leave but NO he grabs me again &amp; starts kissing me. At this point I am  so frustrated I'm on the verge of tears. I finally basically shove him out. Reddit what do I do?? I feel so angry &amp; disrespected by my boyfriend. Not only was he 45 minutes late, he overstayed his welcome by an hour. I feel annoyed that he won't listen to me at all &amp; has no issue doing things completely on his terms with no regards to mine. I know if I talk to him about this he'll make me feel bad because we haven't had sex in a while but this is part of the reason why!!! His lack of awareness &amp; respect is a huge turn off. I am really angry with him how do I approach this issue?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for you input. I broke up with him. He said he thought I was being playful when I asked him to stop. Whatever I'm over it. Thanks for the help except for the people who are convinced that I don't know how old I am

TL;DR: Boyfriend is always late &amp; doesn't leave when I ask, how do I talk to him about it?"
"I found out that my (35) wife (35) has bought me a Christmas gift that I really don't want. This isn't the first time.

"My [24f] roommate [32m] is buying a lot of expensive toys while making excuses about taking his elderly cat to the vet. I've talked to him about it and he continues to say ""on the next paycheck""


I've lived with this roommate for 3 years, and been close friends with him for years before that. One of his cats has a bronchospasm disorder and needs a daily inhaler to prevent attacks. I have had to explain to him multiple times that it is not a rescue inhaler, and that she needs to get it everyday as a preventative.Over the years I've known him he only sometimes even has her prescription, and is often between vets or out of money for the medication. 

Recently her disorder has gotten a lot worse because we have had the heat on and the dry air combined with the crappy heating system of our house has been giving her several attacks a day. It started when I was cat-sitting and I asked him where the inhaler was, he said he didn't have one. I point it out to him a few days later that the attacks were not slowing down and she really needs her inhaler, he keeps saying he can't afford it until next week.

If it were an issue of time, I had already offered to take her to the appointment. It's supposedly an issue of money, despite the fact that three times this week he has told me about some fun toy or DVD set that he purchased, and I know that he is subscribed to several subscription boxes and orders out a few nights a week. I also know this vet does payment plans because one of the other cat's needed surgery a while ago and he looked into it.

Honestly, I feel like I'm going to snap. Is it unreasonable to think that he should be putting his animals health and comfort first? Instead of ordering takeout and buying a bunch of limited edition toys. As an animal lover who's lived with these cats for several years, it makes me very angry and I don't know how to bring it up to him in a constructive way. I've already expressed my concern and offered help and he traditionally does not listen to my advice. For example, he told me that when she's having an attack and wheezing and puffing you should pick her up and hold her upright in your arms. I didn't even know where to begin telling him how bad that is for her so I just let it go, rather than get in a fight over it. Advice?

TL DR: my roommate hasn't taken his cat to the vet for a medication that we all know she needs for several months, and she's having more and more frequent asthma attacks. In the meanwhile he has bought several luxury items for himself, some of them rather expensive. How do I handle this situation?"
"My (26M) girlfriend (23F) of 9 months is having vocal chord surgery to remove a polyp and won’t be able to speak for over a month. I need some advice on how to keep things healthy and fun during this time period.


As the title states, my girlfriend is having a minor surgical procedure to remove a polyp from one of her vocal chords. She is training to be a professional classical singer, and this operation is a pretty brutal circumstance for her as singing is the thing she loves to do more than anything.

As a consequence of the surgery, she will not be able to speak for more than 5-10 minutes per day until the incision from the surgery heals completely, which is expected to be about a month or so. I am feeling nervous about this upcoming change to our relationship and I’m looking for some simple advice on how to handle this challenge, or even ideas for things we can do together as a couple to keep our relationship moving forward in a fun and healthy way. 

TLDR; Girlfriend will be unable to speak for a month because of surgery. What are some things we can do together that will keep our relationship fun and healthy during this time despite her lack of speaking ability?"
"A girl I hooked up with (22F) is pregnant. She said she won't have an abortion unless I (21M) sleep with her again.


So I've found myself in a huge problem. A couple months ago I had a one night stand with a girl I met at my friend's party. Back in her room she went to get a condom but found she was out. She told me it was ok because she was also on birth control, so we went ahead and had sex. I now wonder if she was lying about the birth control, or even the condom, but obviously it's too late now.

So the sex was alright but she, for lack of a better term was not very clean down there. That made it kind of gross for me. I otherwise liked her, but to me the sex wasn't worth the hygiene problem so before I left I said afterwards that I thought we'd get on better as friends. She seemed kind of bummed. 

She texted me late at night a couple times over the next week hinting she wanted me to come over. I ignored this or just responded saying something unrelated. Despite this I thought we were ok, since she's also occasionally texted since then with a funny meme or something else non sexual.

Now, a couple days ago she texted me saying we needed to talk because she was pregnant. She sent me a pic of the test to prove it. I couldn't find anything when I reverse image searched, but I've read about how crazy women can get to try to keep guys from leaving them so I insisted she take it again in front of me. She agreed, I went with her to the store, bought her another test, and was with her while she peed on it and we saw the positive result.

So she really is pregnant, she's not making that up. I started panicking because no way am I gonna have a kid at 21. And with a random hook up? Fuck no. 

She had been pretty calm throughout this chaos, at least it was chaos to me. I told her I would use my savings to pay for her abortion if she needed, anything to get rid of the pregnancy. That's when she dropped her conditions on me..she would have the abortion (and pay for it herself) but only if I slept with her again.

She had a semi-breakdown during this. She started confiding that guys were never interested in her. From what I got she had a couple hookups before me and they ghosted after having sex, not wanting a repeat. She had a couple relationships too, where the guys were good boyfriends but never wanted sex again after the first time. She thought it's because she's ugly or too fat (she is a typical, thin but not skinny physique, nothing to complain about) or her boobs weren't big enough or all these different reasons. I really didn't know how to respond to this.

So she insisted I have sex with her again to show her she's not ""broken"" or something, else she won't abort. She would be pregnant for graduation and have the kid in the summer. She said I wouldn't have to be involved at all except for child support. I can't afford child support! And I'll have student loans when I graduate in a couple years. 

What the fuck do I do? Honestly the answer to her guy problems is probably her hygiene, should I just tell her that?? Hell if she fixed it I am sure she'd find someone who wouldn't ghost after sex, there's nothing else wrong with her. I was so overwhelmed when she started talking about all this and also with the threat of fatherhood that I kind of shut down. I told her I needed to think about it and I'd talk to her this weekend.

What the hell should I do??? Even if she fixed her hygiene, I still don't want to sleep with her again now because of the whole insane way she acted about this. But I really need her to have the abortion if there's a way she's willing. Help.

TL;DR : A girl I had a one night hookup with is pregnant, possibly because she lied about birth control. She took a test in front of me and I know it's not fake. She's now saying she's going to have the baby unless I sleep with her again. Don't want to because her crotch hygiene was gross. What is the best way to handle this?"
"My [23F] ex-coach of 7+ years [50's?M] keeps randomly showing up and calling my family.


Coach G coached me in Soccer for 2 years when I was in high school. We had a falling out when he stiffed me for an award in favor of an assistant coach's daughter who wasn't that good, my mom got mad, and I changed schools because of it. This WAS NOT the first time a player changed schools because of the politics he played, nor was it the last after me. He eventually ended up getting fired after it happened again. He called me every now and then while I moved schools, and my family ignored his calls unless he used a different number (not often) and we were stuck having a 5 minute, awkward conversation. My family and I found it amusing, but odd.

Well, I ended up going out of state to a college to play my sport. He called and congratulated me, which my family and I thought was nice. While I was away, my parents would sometimes (once, twice a year?) mention that Coach G drove by our house and stopped to talk to them, which they found really strange because our house is not by any main street, and pretty fair away from where he lives. During these times he'd ask about me and tell my parents about his own life (being fired, forced to move, his kids graduating, etc.). 

I graduated, got a great job near my parents house, moved back in, and also help coach a high school Soccer team in my free time. I was biking home from the gym 2 nights ago, and was stuck at a red light. I had headphones in, but heard someone yelling at me from a car. I ignored it and they went on for about 30-40 seconds. Finally when there was 5 seconds left on the crosswalk I look, and it's Coach G. I was pretty close to my home at this point, and it was late - around 10 pm. He asked if I recognized him, then asked what I was doing (I responded with my professional job, not coaching) and he said he'd call me later after the light changes. Again, we all laughed about it when I told my family. The next day he left a voice message on my dad's phone, and we decided to just ignore and block him.

Yesterday I was coaching for the high school soccer team (which is completely unrelated/unaffiliated with Coach G or anyone in his family) and I see him in the stands. I ask the head coach if he knew who he was and pointed him out, and the coach said yes, it was Coach G, a friend of his. I tried not to let it distract me. It felt like he was staring at me for most of the game, and sometimes he even pointed towards me. He came up to me at half time when I wanted to talk to my girls about what to focus on, and he spent most of the break telling me about his woes. That he had to 'resign' (lie) because of the 'heartbreak' of girls leaving the team, such as myself and the last girl which ultimately caused him to be fired. How he almost got a job that he really wanted somewhere else but didn't. He mentioned offhandedly some of my stats in college, which was also weird. I was pretty quiet and said it was a shame he was having a difficult time. He said he'd see me after the game after I told him I had to go, but I ducked out pretty quick afterwards and didn't see him.

I don't want to see this guy again. I don't want to talk to him or carry on any sort of relationship. He's part of my past, and he doesn't reflect well in my memory. However, I don't want to get on the bad side of someone who is obviously struggling and has a difficult time understanding how odd his behavior comes off as. I would go to the coach I work with, but honestly I don't really consider him that great of guy either and he'd probably turn it around on me since he calls this guy his friend (honestly, what is up with high school coaches?). How can I tactfully tell ex-coach if he shows up again that I want this to stop?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: How do I gracefully let my ex-coach who I had a falling out with 7+ years ago know that I want nothing more to do with him?"
"My (22F) dad (48M) expects me to buy one of my little brothers an entire deadpool costume for Christmas, and it'll cost me around £90. I'm a student, I don't think I can get him all of that stuff, and I feel guilty.


Okay, I'll make it as short as possible:

I'm a student living in student housing, currently in my second year. I believe i'm decently good with my finances. My dad lives in another country with my two brothers, who are both around 8 and 10 years old. I'm leaving next month in mid-december to spend Christmas, New Years and most of January with my family over there. 

In terms of money I've already spent on presents, I've bought my dad's girlfriend two super expensive Yankee Candles, and I bought my dad a rare Vinyl album and some other little things he wanted for Christmas. All in all so far I've spent a small chunk of my money. To add to this, I've decided to take out some *more* money that I can spend while I'm there, which includes some groceries and gifts for friends when I come back, and for travelling to and from the airport. My dad told me to get an itunes giftcard (around 25 or 50 quid) for my eldest brother. My youngest brother wants a deadpool kids costume (which I can afford) but he also wants the belt, the accessories and the fake swords. In total this entire costume will cost me way over £90. 

Realistically I need that money for a few things: travelling to my classes, groceries, internet bill. I need to save enough cash to pay for the rent while I'm not here (which I need to transfer to my other housemate because they overcharge you when you're in a different country).

I spoke to my dad about this and he's really focused on me getting my brother the whole costume. When I asked about anything else, all he said was that costume. I feel like if I buy him half the costume (e.g the suit, maybe the belt but not the rest) then that's just pointless? But the whole thing seems pointless to me because my little brother is growing like a giant and he'll barely fit in that costume in two months from now.

When I mentioned not even being able to carry the weapons in my suitcase, my dad got all sulky. 

And to add to this, my dad hasn't asked me what I'd like for Christmas, at all (though I'm pretty sure his girlfriend has gotten me something, because she's lovely like that) and he even wants me to pick up a bunch of DVDs before I come over. Like, do you think I'm made of money, dad?

Am I being selfish or something?

Any advice on what to do would be great, thank you.

**TL;DR**: My dad expects me to buy my little brother an entire deadpool costume that'll cost me way more than I can afford for a present that is, mostly, disposable. He really wants me to get my brother that costume, and I think I can get some of it, but it would feel like a waste if I do. "
"My [29M] partner [30F] is afraid I'm going to leave them after getting in shape.


About 2.5 years ago I was knocking 375lbs. After a few life changes I'm getting close to breaking 200lbs. Still working on it. Running and bodyweight exercises 3x a week right now while dieting.

My partner and I have been together 12 years. We met as horny high school teens and have been together since. Our relationship developed over time. I feel closer to her today than I ever have.

We got married 7 years ago. Had a kid 4 years ago. Over the last 12 years we've been through a lot. Fighting PPD together, cancer scare, struggling to make ends meet, etc. She's always struggled with her weight, even so much that recently she's started calling herself a ""fat cow"". She's fluxed between 270lbs and 290lbs constantly within the last few years. I do not ask, she tells me.

I never say a damned thing about her weight; I've been there, I know it doesn't help.

She's been a stay at home mom since our kid was born. Kid just started Pre-K this year (half day) and as a result my partner has free time; this has helped her depression. We've talked about getting her into therapy through our company EAP. I know she struggles with her self esteem. She feels useless for not contributing financially to our household. I understand and have no judgment about it. She's a great mom.

Last night we were chatting as I recently acquired a home pull up bar. I was working with it and getting excited to work on my upper body strength as we can't afford the gym anymore. She brought up my goals (run a 10K, join the 1000lb club, get down to 155lbs, etc.) with a bit of disdain in her voice. Picked up on it and after talking she expressed that she's ""afraid you'll leave me"". We haven't talked about separating in years (things were rough for a long while) and I have no clue where this is coming from. I know she has little to no self confidence as she's been dependent on me financially for the last 5+ years. She calls herself ""a burden"" among other things. This has mostly stopped since she's started reading CBT and ACT resources that helped me tremendously. We've been working on her mental health and this has come out of the blue.

I don't know what to say to reassure her at this point.

-----

Edit: She plans to go back to work this next year once our kid goes to school for more than half a day this next year. I'm at lunch currently. Can't respond to everyone atm. She's made tremendous progress over the last year and things have been getting better.

-----

**TL;DR: I've lost a bit of weight in the last few years. Have developed an interest in running and lifting. Partner feels self conscious; is afraid that I won't be into her anymore when I hit my goals. How do I address this with her? How do I offer reassurance when it's something so personal?**"
"Brother in law doesn’t want to go places with us because we don’t take over caring for his kids when we go?


My brother and sister in law (M early 40’s, F mid 30’s) live about 30 minutes from my husband and I (M38, F30) and we see them once a week or or once every two weeks on weekends. They have two kids, almost 6 and 1.5 years old. We don’t have kids. We always suggest going to go to the zoo, LEGOland, or the park with them (child friendly activities that are fun for adults too) but always we end up just going out to eat or hanging out at their house. They frequently go to fun activities (actually sometimes the exact same activities we’ve suggested, on the same date as we suggested we go) with my sister in law’s parents who live about 1 hour from all of us. They see her parents several times per week because her mom watches the kids and stays over at their house overnight 2 days per week, plus they see them every weekend. 

My brother in law recently told my husband my husband that they don’t want to go with us because when they go with her parents the parents care for the children a large amount, and with us it’s too much work because we don’t take over the child care responsibilities. I feel like, A. they don’t let us take care of the kids when their around and don’t give us any authority in the children’s eyes, they don’t have to listen to us, etc. and B. they are their children and we’re all just going for a fun outing. It’s not a giant ordeal that requires 4 adults to be actively controlling 2 children (I know, I’ve taken 5 kids on many fun outings alone with no other adults). Is this weird? What should we do? 

As a background, I’m a professional nanny and I’ve been one for 10 years. My husband’s only child experience is with his brother's kids, but like I said we see them pretty frequently. I get along well with my brother in law and pretty well with my sister in law (though she’s not warm or very friendly, but she’s like that to everyone but her parents and sister). I’ve known my brother in law longer than his wife has, and my husband and I got engaged when their first born was an infant. For the first 4 years of the older child’s life the parents acted as though I was going to molest their child or something. It was very weird. They didn’t let me hold him or interact with him as a baby, never let me talk to him as he got older (they would swoop in and talk to him instead if I tried) and would not let me be in the same room alone with him (my sister in law would literally run from another part of the house into the living room if someone left him alone with me). The reason I mention this is that I never really bonded with the older child because of this, so I’m not that hands on with him (though I will play with him, board games, sword fighting, pretend, etc.). This weirdness stopped shortly before they had the second baby, and now they have had us babysit them both, and I helped a lot with the baby and the older child when the younger was a newborn. 

Tldr: my brother in law and sister in law don’t want to go fun places with us because we don’t take over child care when we go. What to do, and is this weird?"
"My sister [15F] wants me [24F] asked me to take responsibility for an accident she caused


My parents renewed their vows right before Thanksgiving, and decided to do a ""redo Honeymoon"" this week, since they weren't able to afford one when they first got married. They asked me if I'd come stay and keep an eye on my sister, since I live the closest of my siblings. I agreed, because I get along really well with my sister. The brother between us is very frosty towards us, and our oldest sister is a huge bully. We banded together a lot when we were young, so I looked forward to spending time with her.

She's taking her license test in January, and so I wanted to be a fun sister and take her driving yesterday night. For the most part, she did really well. Then, she was driving behind a car, and they slowed down abruptly. My sister panicked, and hit the accelerator instead of the brake, ramming into the back of their car. Nobody got hurt but the bumpers, and my hood is kind of smashed up. She started crying, apologizing to me and the other people, and I told her I wasn't mad, and that accidents are called accidents for a reason.

I exchanged info with the other people, we had to get a police report done, and I got my car towed. Because of it, I'm going to need to be stranded in town for a few extra days while my car gets fixed. My parents are going to be gone until Monday, and they estimated my car won't be ready until Tuesday. She's not going to have her permit taken, but my parents can still make her revoke it, and I told her that.

My sister panicked. She begged me not to tell our dad, because he's a hard ass and mean. He's a ""teaser"", but with my sister, he always goes too far and hurts her feelings. Driving has been a big beef between them. He makes a lot of rude comments to her and intentionally tells her red lights are green, or does other things that freak her out and make her make bad decisions, so he can yell at her for not being ""on her toes."" We're all mixed white (dad's side) and Asian (mom's side), and he's been milking the bad driver jokes. He's getting a two-for-one since she's a girl too, and it's really getting under my sister's skin and actually making her feel kind of bad.

I know he'd be awful to her if he found out. Our mom would be a lot cooler about it, but I doubt she wouldn't tell my dad. While she has gotten angry with him over the comments he makes towards my sister, she would still be *pissed* about the actual accident. Usually, I'd take the fault and just foot the bill, but they're going to know my car got messed up. My sister wants me to take the blame and pretend I got in an accident, but my dad would be equally as harsh with me. Our dad isn't physically abusive, but he's very harsh and at times does edge into the verbally abusive territory when he's angry.

I don't want my sister to get in trouble. But someone has to be the sacrifice, and I don't want it to be me. Yes, this is a deeper issue with my family and my dad, but right now, it's a car issue. Do I just step up and take it? Or should I let it be a ""learning experience"" for my sister?


TLDR: My sister got in an accident in my car, but she wants me to take responsibility for it, so our dad won't be mad at her. I also don't want to lie, because then I'll be the one on the chopping block. "
"A guy [28M] asked me out. I [26 F] turned him down. Now he's telling people I'm racist.


Details slightly shifted in case they reddit. 

I moved to a new city last year, and I've just started to get my sea legs. It took me a while to get a new group of friends started, but I've met some very nice people that have decided to fold me into their group of college buddies. 

Right now, I'm not dating for a number of reasons. I'm very busy studying for the LSAT, I have a full time job, and I got out of a bad relationship somewhat recently. Just not on my list of priorities right now. 

At a party with my new friends a month or so ago, I met this guy Brad. 

Turns out, he works in the same industry as I do...we're in politics. We talked for a little bit and he said we should get drinks sometime. I didn't pay much attention to it. I looked him up and it turns out he works for someone I really, *really* don't like. I'm quite liberal, and his boss is a right-wing radical. Politics is my lifeblood, and this person is on the exact opposite of that spectrum. 

Turns out he really liked me, and got my number from a friend. He called me asking to go out to drinks, and I told him I had a busy night and couldn't make it work, which was true. 

He called me asking again a couple weeks later, and I said that I was really busy and didn't have time for dating at the moment, but thanks for asking.

I thought everything was fine. A couple weeks later, I am at another party with my new friends. One of them came up to me and said 'You know, what you did to brad really was unnecessary."" 

I asked them what they were talking about, and she said ""He told us all that you wouldn't go out with him because you don't like Indian guys"" 

This is emphatically **not true**. I didn't go out with him because I am busy, we have totally different ideological backgrounds politically, and we just didn't have chemistry. 

I told her as much, and she seemed to warily accept it. I was very upset that this person is spreading untrue lies about me just because I didn't go out with him.

Here's where I need advice: How do I go about confronting him/telling his friends? I really like the rest of these people and I don't want it to blow up into a huge effing issue where they feel like they're stuck between their old friend from years of college and me, who they've known for a few months. I feel like it would end up with me getting kicked out.

  **tl;dr**: Didn't go out with a guy, told our mutual friends I was racist."
"Friend revoked New Years invitation and now constantly asks me what my plans are


A friend (f/32) of mine (f/34) invited me spend New years in a warm state (plane ride away) at her brother's (33) house with his wife (35). She was excited, so was I, and surprised.  I asked if she was sure and she was like ""Of course! They have a huge house, they love entertaining, you have so much in common with them, etc etc"". I joked and said ""i'm taking you 100% seriously, so I hope you're not just inviting me to be nice"" and she said ""Umm, you know I don't do that. I'm 100% serious. If I don't end up going there, let's spend it together in my city!"" 

She lives 4 hrs away from me, and we've spent a lot of time together this summer, mainly me going to see her. She told me that she'd keep me posted of her plans/the plans. When she'd mentioned NYE, I hadn't even thought of it. It wasn't really a huge deal to me or something on my mind.. I've been so busy writing my business plan and pre-occupied with other stuff. 

A week or so later, I saw on social media that she got her ticket to her brother's city. I asked bout her dates, and she told me her departure date, saying that she still hasn't booked the return, as she's unsure if she''ll spend NYE there. Then she says that if she does, she no longer thinks it's a good idea if I join, because of some drama her sister-in-law has been going through with work, and they won't be able to handle another houseguest. I just expressed my sympathies to her sister-in-law (drama with a co-worker), and left it at that.
 
She casually said she booked her return, gushing over how she got it for free with points, casually stating that she will be spending New Years there with her brother. She then went on to tell me about all the fun things they'll be doing.  

Since then, she constantly asks if I figured out what I'm doing for NYE. I said: ""Nooo, I haven't :("" Wondering if she'd maybe say ""i hope you figure it out soon!"" Or ""wish you could come join us!"". 
I told her about an upcoming trip in January and she went silent- didn't act happy for me, didn't feign excitement like i did for her, nothing. This is all over text. 

Truth is, I actually don't really care if I don't end up doing anything for New Years. All  my close friends are gonna be out of town with family/for work, and to me, it's just another day. I ignore the hype and don't buy into it. I'd rather stay warm and save my money for my upcoming trip in January. But everytime she asks me what i have planned for it, I feel this pressure, this obligation to care when I don't! Does that make sense?

What are your thoughts on my friend, her actions, and how do I proceed? Lately I've been a bit turned off and haven't felt the desire to talk to her. Do you think it's lame that I don't care about staying in for New years eve?

  **tl;dr**: Friend (f/32) invited me (f/34) to spend NYE w her, her bro and his wife, plane ride away. When I followed up, she casually said it's prob not a good idea if I join. She now constantly asks me what my NYE plans are, bragging about what theyll be doing on the trip she invited and un-invited me on, which I showed excitement for. She's not expressed any excitement for my own upcoming trip in Jan. What are your thoughts/how do I proceed?"

Hi Reddit.

I’m 26 and clearly I was deceived. I’ve been dating “Jim” for two years. He “travelled a lot for work” because he works in pharma and in New York City it’s fairly normal for an adult to be living that single/traveling/focus on career life  well into their 30s so no red flags went up when we met. He was never secretive with his phone, but turns out that’s because he had two phones. Everything seemed normal, days he wasn’t “traveling” we often spent the night together in both my and his apartment (so it’s not like only were together in my apartment which would be a major sign), which turned out to be a pied a tierre he and his wife owned before they moved to NYC full time and is not currently being rented. So it seemed to fit the narrative, having a small apartment because he’s not home often.

We “moved in together” 6 months ago and signed a lease together. Same thing, he’s “traveling” half the week. Living together raised a couple red flags, such as some phone calls he took outside but he just said because he needed to ensure no interruptions for work calls. We planned life together and I thought I found the guy I was going to be with, especially as he reassured me of a future with less travel.

I never questioned his travel because he genuinely booked flights in front of me regularly and just never went. He spent so much money booking trips he never went to so he could go home to be with his wife and I’m sure he booked some to be with me in front of his wife. He also said he was an only child and his parents lived in Germany so I never met them, and again that doesn’t strike me as weird because he only met my parents two or three times and we all live a couple hours away. I’m not close with them and assumed he wasn’t either and it didn’t seem off to me. Or idk in isolation it made sense but now that everything is out it seems painfully obvious. 

Anyway, he left the wrong phone at home one day and it got an incoming call with a photo of a woman at the park with a kid as her image. I didn’t answer because I never really had a reason to suspect him and figured he forgot his phone. However, he called me from his cell phone number, which I thought I had sitting at the apartment, so I asked him “I thought you forgot your phone? There’s one here”. And he said it’s just a work phone, but his work phone is an android. It had a password so I couldn’t unlock it but he came home and I pressed him more about it. He said I have no reason to distrust him and I just don’t remember his work phone. He said he didn’t want to sleep here and booked a hotel room since I clearly didn’t trust him and he needed time to cool off. He tried to come back on Monday and figured I wouldn’t mention it apparently but I did and asked him to unlock his phone, he refused and we argued about it for maybe an hour and then that same woman called, I demanded he answer it and he refused so we started fighting over the phone because I wanted to pick up and although the call didn’t answer, the whole thing became obvious. 

I tell him to leave obviously then he tells me he wants to meet up and talk and I do and he basically tells me everything and he thought he was going to leave her but he never did then we got too deep for him to step back, again nonsense. I told him I didn’t want to see him ever again but he begged me not to tell his wife. To be honest, telling his wife never even crossed my mind- all I was thinking is that I’m in a lease I can’t afford alone with a man I thought I was going to marry, my life felt like it was falling apart and I didn’t even begin to digest that. Him telling me not to tell his wife then made me feel guilty for never even considering it and now I’m not sure if it’s my place. 

A part of me just wants to end this whole chapter of my life by but the other part of me is thinking this woman is spending her life with a pathological liar and cheater and she doesn’t even know. 

Places where I need guidance:
1.) Do I tell his wife 
2.) Do I make him to keep paying his part of the lease? Won’t that be considered me willingly being involved with more infidelity even if we only take care of the money? I feel like out of respect for his wife I should end all contact but then I don’t know how I’ll pay for the full apartment 
3.) I’m humiliated and don’t want to tell friends and family. Will they eventually find out? Is it better to just explain everything sooner or is after the holidays appropriate?

TLDR: My ex turned out to have a wife and kids and lied to me for two years, I don’t know whether or not to tell his wife or how I should move forward since we have a lease together. 

Edit: yes we are both on the lease legally 
Edit 2: He has no history of violence or even aggressive tendencies but this whole reveal makes me reliably afraid of him in general and that’s my hesitation regarding telling his wife "
