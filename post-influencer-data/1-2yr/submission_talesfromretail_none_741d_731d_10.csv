"The best phone call I had all day


I work in a shoe store as an assistant manager. I carry a store phone on me so I can answer it wherever I am in the store. Today the phone would not stop ringing. People wanted to know what time we closed, where we were located, and a ton of shoe checks. 

So the phone rings and I answer it and it sounds like a little kid. K will be kid. 

K: umm hello do you carry all black high top vans for kids?

Me: let me check for you really quick. I'm sorry, we only have the low top vans in all black for kids. 

K: okay well I like those too. 

Me: what size shoe do you wear?

K: one and a half

Me: okay so I don't have a one and a half but I do have a size two. 

K: okay that sounds good. 

Me: would you like me to hold it for you?

K: yes please

Me: okay, what is your name?

*the phone got really quiet like he was hesitating, then I heard someone in the background, it was his mom*

Mom: give her your name!

K: Tyler. 

Me: okay Tyler, I'm going to hold this shoe for you. So when you and your mom come in, just come up to the counter and tell us you have a shoe on hold under your name. 

K: okay thank you. Have a nice day. 

Me: absolutely. You have a nice day too. 

It was the most wholesome phone call I have ever experienced in my four years of retail. I love that his mom had him call and ask about his shoes. Today was a good day ❤️

Edit: I didn't think you guys were going to like my good day as much as you did! Thank you for the gold! I forgot to tell you guys the best part. He even made sure to ask where we were located. He said it just like that too, ""where are you located?"" I'm happy Tyler could make you all as happy as he made me. "
"Customer broke a our last bottle of an item we had in stock, demanded we compensate her.


I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet. This JUST happened and I had to share it.  
  
I work at a drinks retailer.  
  
A lady comes in and browses for a while, after a few seconds she grabs the last bottle we have of a clearance item and accidentally drops it. I walk over and ask if she is okay and if she's hurt at all and make sure she's okay. She IMMEDIATELY says *""IM NOT PAYING FOR THAT, Can you get me another?""*. I tell her that it was a clearance item and quite literally our last one in store. But you know what she said? *""Well you guys owe me a free bottle! I wanted THAT bottle and it broke""*.  
  
I tell her that store policy won't allow such thing and that I can call around other stores of ours to see if they have any. Nope.. she kept insisting we give her another one of her choice for free because it was ""*unfair""* on her.  
  
A minutes passes by as I play the broken record technique, sticking to what I said and constantly reiterating myself, giving her the option to pick up a bottle elsewhere.  
  
She wouldn't have a bar of it and left in a super aggressive mood.  
  
Is it possible some people have actually never retailed before?.."
