"UPDATE: My [24F] best friend [23F] is doing something I don't agree with in regards to her ex boyfriend. Do I need to say something to the ex?


Link to my original post here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6yx283/my24f_best_friend_23f_is_doing_something_i_dont/

Even though my post didn't get a lot of attention I wanted to post an update for the curious and for those who were kind enough to share their opinion.

So I decided I was going to talk to Kimberly first (sober) before I did anything. I did actually end up finding Kyle's number as a last resort backup in case Kimberly decided there was no way she'd stop. 

So Kimberly and I had not talked much since the ""incident."" Very awkward and stiff. So I texted her ""Hey girl I miss you. I got this awesome new coffee and creamer flavor, you've got to come over and try it.""

She jumped on it, and I had her over. Once we got settled with our coffee I took the plunge and started by apologizing for coming across as abrupt and judgmental the last time we talked. She seemed really embarrassed and sad and apologized for getting an attitude with me. 

But I also said with that being said, while I am sorry about the tone I took, I wasn't sorry about saying what I said. She was just really quiet and looking at the floor.

I told her I loved her to pieces and wanted what was best for her. And that good friends don't enable, they call each other out if they are doing something wrong. And what she was doing was really...REALLY messed up. And that I was going to give her one chance...just one...to put a stop to it. So if she did not message Kyle telling him to change his passwords...I would do it for her.

At first she got really upset with me and started to get angry and rage but I told her there was a reason she told me her secret because deep down she knows what she's doing is wrong and I think she was asking for help but didn't know how to because she can't stop.

She just starts crying and crying and crying. She said she was so sick of pining for Kyle. She was still in love with him. She couldn't stop thinking about him, wishing for him, even though she knew they were not meant to be. She just wanted to stop having these feelings. That her boyfriend helped numb the pain a bit or distracted her for it, but it always came back. And she logged in just to be near him again, to see if he was happy, if he missed her at all, etc. She knew it was really bad but I was right and she couldn't stop. 

I just let her cry it out. Then I told her if she wanted to make an anon account or text him from an anon number she could. Or if she wanted me to take care of it altogether I would. She said no, she was mortified and felt horrible but she wanted to, but could I please help her and be with her as she did it.

So she sent Kyle the following message (helped worded by me) ""Hey Kyle sorry to bother you. I just realized I haven't really updated our passwords to our social media stuff since last year and thought it might be a good idea to change them for myself and that you might want to as well.""

Basically so she didn't have to come right out and say it but Kyle would have to be a moron not to pick up on what she was really trying to say. He texted back within 20 minutes.

""Hey there! Duly noted. Thanks for the heads up."" I then told her to delete the text and block the number. I took her out shopping and while walking I said there is no shame in seeing a therapist to help with her grief and could give her the start to the relief she wants from hurting over Kyle. And I offered to help her schedule an appointment.

Long story short, we found a sliding scale therapist through our alma mater and she has an appointment next week. That night, just to see if Kyle got the hint I sat with her as she attempted to log into his account to see if he took the hint. The password didn't work. She cried hard but said it was for the best and thanked me for helping her. 

Anyways that pretty much sums it up. I'm going to be there for my friend and be a sounding board and support as she starts to really process her grief. I'm really happy that we both solved the facebook crap and she has an appointment with a professional to help get a start on things. 

Per my advice she's going to take things one day at a time with the new boyfriend and just enjoy him in the moments she has with him. If she finds herself using him as purely a coping mechanism, becoming codependent, or she assesses in 2-3 months she doesn't feel in love with him or she's not over Kyle, she will let him go and give herself time being single trying a new hobby and keeping up with the therapist.

Thanks again for everyone who helped.

**TL;DR Had a sit down with BFF. Gently and soberly called her out. She admitted she can't get over her ex and it's driving her insane. Helped her message her ex heavily implying he needs to change his password. He did. Got friend fixed up with a therapist and I'm going to be her sounding board and support. Hopefully she can start the process of really getting over the ex.**"
"UPDATE: I[22M] keep seeing girl[20sF] spinning; should I ask if ok or let sleeping horses lay?


[removed]"
"I (26F) have been married to (23F) for a little under 3 years now. Her parents (50sMF) hid this from the rest of the family, and wants another wedding ceremony to cover their tracks. They also want me to pretend to be a man.


Sorry about the title long enough to have ""by Fall Out Boy"" tacked to the end.

Me and my wife Mandy have been dating all the way through high school and college. Her parents were always unhappy about us being friends, let alone being in a relationship, but for the most part they seemed to not take our relationship seriously so we both didn't pay them any mind. Eventually I proposed to Mandy and she said yes, so we decided to break the happy news to her parents, only for them to laugh in our faces and tell Mandy that she didn't need to ""waste time fooling around with lesbians"" because once she graduated college they were just going to immediately hook her up with a family friend's son to get married. I said some real colorful words to them that day, and we left after Mandy told them that unless they came to terms with her relationship, she didn't want them in her life. They continued sending her emails and text messages belittling her sexuality and insisting that she was just confused. 

A little while later we got married. All our friends were there, as well as a local elderly couple that had ""adopted"" us (since I'm an orphan and Mandy wasn't talking to her parents, we started hanging out at our childless neighbors' place helping with chores and became pretty close). We had good food and good entertainment, and it was seriously awesome. Mandy sent our wedding pictures to her parents, saying no matter what they thought of her lifestyle, she was happy. We both were.

Soon after that her parents finally seemed to be coming around. They called one day, apologizing like crazy, saying all that mattered to them was that Mandy was happy. We cautiously accepted them back into our lives. They were pleasant enough the few times we talked on the phone, and started almost immediately showering us both with gifts and greeting cards. I thought it was great; Mandy thought something was up.

And as usual, Mandy was right. When we paid them a visit a good year later, they seemed more anxious and nervous than I'd ever remembered them. It took Mandy telling them to spit it out multiple times before they finally admitted that they had been keeping our marriage a secret to their entire extended family. It turns out that they were so ashamed that we pretty much eloped and had a same sex marriage, that when family members showed up with our wedding pictures they found on Facebook they had been telling everyone that we were just at a mutual friend's bridal shower and were ""pretending"" to be brides. At the same time, they knew that they couldn't keep it a secret forever, so they had been telling their family that Mandy was seeing a ""very nice boy"" and might be getting married in a couple years or so. It wasn't my finest moment, but I blew up. I couldn't imagine that anyone could disrespect their own child's sexuality and life decisions to this degree. I told them exactly what was on my mind, while Mandy backed me up and pretty much egged me on. All her parents could say was ""calm down"" and ""think about *our* feelings!"" which honestly made me angrier. 

Eventually when everyone cooled down, I asked them what exactly their plan was now that everything was out in the open. And you guys... Not only did they actually want to have another wedding ceremony with the family invited to corroborate their fake timeline, they wanted me to dress up as a man. I almost choked on my drink. I was just like ""are you guys serious?!"" and all they could say was ""well, our family is very conservative, and it's just not fair for them to have a lesbian wedding forced onto them."" Mandy asked them what they were gonna do once the extended family inevitably found out that I was a woman, and her parents basically told us that we didn't ever have to interact with the rest of the family again-- just invite them one time to this fake straight wedding to trick them into believing their story, so that they could save face.

Boy I was ready to get in another yelling match with these people but thankfully Mandy is pretty much the buddha incarnate and deescalated the situation before we went home. She doesn't seem to be too fazed about her parents' elaborate ruse, probably because she says this isn't the first time they've lied to the rest of the family to cover their asses. She even thinks another wedding might be fun, especially because her parents are offering to pay for the entire thing. However she isn't comfortable pretending to be straight, and says we can just show up as two women in love with each other and if the rest of the family doesn't like what they see they can fuck right back off. Personally I just don't feel comfortable with the whole concept of this fake wedding. I am by all means unmistakably a woman-- nothing about me is masculine, not even androgynous, and there is really no way in hell I could ever look like a man unless Mandy's parents are planning to hire an entire Hollywood makeup crew, a voice coach, and a plastic surgeon. Not to mention Mandy has always been completely disinterested in men, both physically and romantically. I'm not about to pretend I'm something I'm not just to please a bunch of people I've never met. 

The problem? It's been about a year or so and Mandy's parents are still trying to push the fake marriage on us. Every time we talk to them, we tell them we're not gonna do it and they say they understand. But the next time we talk to them, it's like they have no recollection of the previous conversation. Part of me feels like they're doing this on purpose just to get us to say ""all right all right, we'll do you stupid fucking wedding."" My question is, should we just do what they want and get it over with? I'm really loath going through with it, but if that's the best and only option I guess I have no choice. Or Is there some kind of compromise that we can come to? Better yet... Is it appropriate to just tell Mandy's parents to fuck off? 


[EDIT]
So Mandy and I texted a few of her relatives with pictures of our wedding saying we're married and her parents were lying to cover their asses. Turns out the relatives already knew about it, and were just playing along with her parents because they didn't want to embarrass them. Got Mandy's granddad's blessing and was invited to their cookout, it was pretty sweet. You can all go home now lmao


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: wife's parents are serious homophobes, and now that we're married they've lied to the entire family saying I'm a man and we're only dating, and we'll be getting married ""for real"" later on. they want me to dress up as a man and have a ""fake wedding"" where only the family is invited, so that they'll be fooled into thinking we're in a straight relationship.

"I [27/M] am dating a girl [28/F] with a really odd ""quirk"" and I'm not sure this is too big a red flag or just a case of nerves?


Here's the situation. This summer I landed an internship between Year 1 and Year 2 of my MBA program. At work, I met ""Jules"" [28/F] who works in an administrative &amp; E/A role at the company. Nothing happened at work but she and I stayed in contact and after I left she initiated discussions of a date. We did and have been out 5 or 6 times. In general, things are really great - she's very sweet and thoughtful; she's funny and we share a lot of common interests as well as sharing a similar set of goals. We're well matched, but here's the thing: She often says the wrong fucking thing, then panics, repeats it and then panics further, goes beet red and then buys me a gift. 

I'm going to recreate two encounters that happened with ~48 hours of each other. They're the best of my recollection:

&gt;Me: I'm applying for work today. Busy with classwork, taking a full course load plus an extra two seminars.

&gt;Her: Oh, wow, really busy. Must be looking forward to being done!

&gt;Me: Yeah, and working rather than studying. Paying off these loans would be nice.

&gt;Her: I don't mind that I make more money than you. Not that you're lazy, you're not, but I make more money.. I... uh...

&gt;Her: Forget I said anything. It's that I have a job and you're unemployed.... I mean... ermmm.

&gt;Her: You're studying! You're going to have a great job but you need to find your groove, you know, being unemployed.

&gt;Her: Not that you're useless or anything....

&gt;Her: I need to go........

I get what she's saying, didn't take offense, but I am never sure what she is going, says something she thinks I'll take offense to and then panics and hyper-speed speaks until she has said so many odd/borderline offensive things that she just terminates the conversation. Here's another (and my fav)

&gt;Different Friend: Penis size is so overrated.

&gt;Me: Phew! Dodged a bullet there!

&gt;Her: Aww, don't be hard on yourself!

&gt;Me: Hard. That's what she sa......

&gt;Her: It's cute! It's just the right size for you. Not that it's small, it's just not...

&gt;Her: Let me phrase... you're really good at oral. 

&gt;Her: I like your penis, too! It's not small, I promise. Show them....

&gt;Me: Umm, no.....

&gt;Her: Uhh, sorry.. gotta go. 

I feel like every time we're together there's this potential for extreme awkwardness that just won't end. Sometimes we're together and it's fine, but others... we wind up with the weiner debacle. After the weiner debacle, she sent me a box of chocolates, bought me a lobster, then sent an e-card and an amazon gift card for $50. Then called to apologize for gifts, said she was very happy with ""that aspect of our relationship"" and I shouldn't feel like there's anything wrong/I don't measure up and that she'd understand if I didn't want to see her again. 

This is honestly every conversation. I'm not sure if it's nerves or she's an awkward person or she genuinely holds odd beliefs about me and they keep seeping out of her mouth at the worst times. I feel like our relationship could be okay, or could be a horrible mess or that she doesn't have the heart to dump me and is making it so awkward that I ghost her/bail. 

Everytime I take the direct approach, she swears up and down that it's just awkwardness and that it's ""not you, it's me."" Seriously? She's using lines from Costanza. 

What is going on here? How can I handle this. 

--- tl;dr Girl I'm seeing either dislikes me and doesn't want to let me down or is the most awkward person I have ever met before. I'm not sure which it is but I would be delighted to know/figure it out."
"Witnessed my boyfriend (27m) accidentally meet his ex (26ish f) at the gym, he's still in love with her and I'm heartbroken


To give you some background

I met Shaun at the gym I work where I'm a personal trainer. I am rather social in my area and I knew a lot of his friends and him. I always had a crush on him and thought he was cute.

He started training constantly when I decided to speak to him and do a little flirting after a month or so, I didn't know if he was interested or not since he never really reciprocate so I asked him out. That was hard for me to do because to be honest, I usually get attention from guys but Shaun I didn't know what he was thinking.

We went on a date. I tried to bring up if he was seeing anyone and that's when he told me that he's not but still in love with his ex, Denise that she broke up with him because he was getting too serious and she wasn't ready for it. Obviously, this hurt me. We have been speaking at that time for over a month and he was really a great caring person and I started to develop feelings for. 

He told me that he just wanted to be straight up so I don't think he's leading me on because he can't change how he feels. Because I liked him, I thought I'd just forget about it and maybe time will sort it out. 

We began dating (7 months now) and it was good. I never brought up what was discussed and neither did he. He's been sweet and taking care of me when I was sick etc. I've been wanting to tell him that I love him but was just waiting for the right moment. 

Well shit was messed up today. Usually on Wednesday, I don't do early morning sessions. Another personal trainer had an emergency and asked me to cover a session otherwise she'll lose the client. I said no problem.

So I walked in and was changing in the locker rooms. As I walked up the stairs I could see the front desk and noticed Shaun there. I was about to run and say hi but he was having some sort of in depth conversation with HER. I know it was her. I've done a little stalking. It looks like she was leaving the gym and he was coming in and they sort of met

From what I saw. He was just trying to speak to her and she was sort of dismissing him. And she looked away and he tucked her hair under her ear and touched her hip because she was about to leave. I nearly burst into tears right there.

I came up to them and asked Shaun what's going on. She says she has to go and she walks away. He just looks at me and says ""we'll speak later"" and he leave to find her. I was devastated.

He tried to call me a few hours later but I didn't pick up. I sent him a message asking if he even has feelings for me and if he's still in love with her. He sends one back and says that I knew how he felt from day one and he's sorry but when it comes to her, he's different.

I don't know what to do. I've fallen for this guy and I've introduced him to my family. For the short amount of time he's touched my heart and is just perfect for me..

I don't know if I can let him go but I don't know what to say to him or how to even approach a situation like this. 

TL;DR Boyfriend of 7 months is still in love with his ex and has told me this when we first started dating. I've seen them together when they met briefly at gym and it  broke my heart to see him treat her like gold"

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6zenpv/am_i_being_overpossessive/?st=J7NUWKQU&amp;sh=e5067cd0

After reading people's reactions I realised perhaps I'd been a little blinded by infatuation. I sent her a message taking the blame upon myself for being over possessive (I took the blame to avoid confrontation, I just wanted it to end quickly) and the conversation went as follows.


Me: [long apology / we need to break up message]

Her: ""so we're done?""

Me: ""It's probably for the best.""

Her:""okay""


We haven't spoken a word since about four days ago when that happened, and I now realise just how little she cared about me. I'm off to university in a week, and couldn't be feeling better about myself!

"My [17M] sister [21F] has been missing for 6 months, I feel lots of rage


My big brother told me to write it here. He's helping me write this. Sorry if it is a bit all over the place.


My sister, Laura, has always been a very sweet girl. She was always respectfull and kind, intelligent, pretty. She was great to me while growing up, and she loved kids.


Laura is adopted. We all are. Her biological parents died. Our adoptive parents are not bad people but they are very...weird. For example they do not say 'your T-shirt is ugly', they say 'you are ugly'.


Laura was studying at University. Had good grades. 2 years ago she got a boyfriend: Jens. He was an asshole. He cheated on her, told her how he wanted to beat her, was mad cause she did not cheat on him etc. He went out with other girls etc. After4 months he broke up with her.


Laura had never been the Same. She told us about how Jens would date all his ex's for at least a year. Even the ones he did not love. Laura felt like a loser. To top things of, she had been bullied by the girl he cheated on her with. She was threatening her etc.


6 months ago, Laura told out mother that she did not want to return to the city she studied at. We had seen it coming,for 2 weeks she only slept, did not eat. Our mother told her 'To think long and hard' and How she was going to be a 'loser working at a supermarket'. They got into a huge fight and Laura went to bed. 


The next morning she was gone. She took a train and further we do not know. She posted on Instagram 'Goodbye'. Police came and our mother was not able to answer a single question: her friends, hobby's, what she liked, the subject of her bachelorpaper,... Our mother could not answer a thing.


It's been 6 months. Police found her. But she told them she wishes to be left in peace. As an adult, they have to respect that.


I miss my sister. I am also mad. At her. But especially at my mom, and Jens. For being so mean and hurting her, while in fact she was so sweet. I don't get why she ran away. How she could do that.


I feel a lot of anger towards people. I would like to know how I could handle this? And if any of you know or could explain why people run away? Thank you


Tl;dr: My sister ran away,  I am very mad at people like my mom and her ex-bf for doing this. How do I handle these feelings?"

"I (27f) just found out my husband (27m) of 2 years has been meeting his ex-girlfriend (27?f) every Friday for breakfast for at least 6 months. I'm in shock and surely more info will come, but what should my ""immediate"" actions be?


This actually is kind of still happening as we speak so I'm going to try and remain coherent, I'm also supposed to give a reasonable big presentation this afternoon at work and my mind is literally everywhere and nowhere at the same time. 

Like I mentioned above, I have a huge presentation this afternoon. To sort of take some steam off, my group and I decided to hit up the new ""hip"" breakfast spot. I knew, but sort of forgot that my husband has been going to this place every Friday since they opened. As such I wasn't at all surprised when I walked in the front door and saw him sitting at a table towards the rear of the place. I was very shocked however to see another woman sitting across from him (he'd told me that he enjoyed meeting ""friends"" at this place because it was convenient to all their work places). He hadn't seen me so I walked up to give him a hug and sure enough as I got closer I knew right away it was his ex-girlfriend. 

We were both at the point of no return and he noticed me, at first he looked like he wanted to escape (as did I) but when he realized that wasn't possible he tried to play very cool and said ""hey babe so good to see you here! you remember ""Jessica?"" I also tried to play it cool and said ""yeah well, here with a group from work, how are you Jessica?"" She was very friendly and got up to shake my hand, he got up to give me a kiss on the cheek and a hug...I felt like I wanted to puke. He asked if I'd like to join them and I said it was really a working breakfast so I better get back to my table. 

I told my group what had happened and didn't want to stay and walked back to work. As soon as I got there (15 minutes or so) he texted me ""I owe you a huge explanation"" This is sort of how it went:

Me: ""Was that really who I think it was?"" 

Him: yes, but please let me explain

M: is that the ""friends"" you've been meeting?

H: y, her and others. 

M: Ok. 

H: Please let me explain. 

M: Not sure I'm ready to hear an explanation.

H: She's having some private issues and I'm trying to help her. Please, please understand that. 

M: Don't write anymore. 

H: why?

M: because I have things going on and don't want to stare at your words trying to figure what the fuck you are doing. 

H: please let me explain. 

M: not now. 

H: I love you so much. 

M: whatever. 

And that's where it ended. So I have absolute confirmation that he's been hanging out with her, probably since this place opened about 9 months ago. I've racked my brain and we are still very much in the newlywed phase of our marriage (or so I thought) and I can't think of any ""free"" time that we haven't been around each other. The only time he ever really hangs out with anyone other than me is at these breakfasts. I looked through credit card statements and sure enough, he's been there every Friday (save for the one's we've been out of town) and there's no strange transactions (hotels, flowers, etc...) 

I've had every thought bouncing around my head that I just need to let this go until my presentation is over with (yeah right) to I need to call a divorce attorney to protect myself. All I know is that he's having breakfast regularly with someone he used to be in love with...and I don't know what to do about it. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I caught my husband having breakfast with his ex-girlfriend. I don't know what to do about it. 

update edit: So thank you everyone for the advice, a lot of people asked for an update so here it is. Basically my presentation went like crap because I was so preoccupied with this that I couldn't think, I'm lucky that I had a very competent team member who understood my part as well as his and he stepped in and covered for me on parts where I just couldn't think. I have a meeting with my direct supervisor on Monday to hopefully explain what was going on, she's very cool and I think she'll have no problem covering for me this time.

On to my husband. After the presentation I drove to his work without warning, said hello to the floor secretary who let me onto his ""cube farm"" floor. I walked up to him and said ""give me your phone right now or I'm calling a divorce lawyer"" (I'm lucky it was Friday and his floor was basically empty. He handed me his phone but suggested that we go into one of the conference rooms so we could have a private talk. I said fair enough. We sat down at the table and I first verified that he hadn't deleted any messages, I then looked for the same on whatsapp. I also looked through his phone to make sure he doesn't have any chat apps that I wasn't aware of. I quickly scrolled through the texts from ""Jesscia"" and saw that as long as I kept scrolling there were messages. Instead of reading them directly,  I told him to give me his explanation. 

So this is basically what it is, Jessica's dad got really sick back in May and she contacted him to let him know that he probably wasn't going to make it (they have known each other for a really long time, family friends and what not). He offered to meet her for breakfast at his ""regular"" spot and she would join him and other friends. When her dad did pass away, there was a big scramble among she and her brothers and sisters because it had happened so suddenly and she then came to my husband for advice since he's an accountant for a huge firm (he focuses mainly on taxes, but still very knowledgeable in most areas). He referred her to one his firm's estate lawyers, but continued to help on the accounting side of things. Basically they would meet every week or so to go over the latest developments, how to proceed, etc... He admitted the breakfasts were also friendly and they didn't discuss business during the whole time or at all of them. Apparently they did a lot of reminiscing over her dad, things they'd done as kids together and that kind of stuff in addition to business. 

I of course asked why he didn't tell me about it, he says he meant to but it sort of got away from him and he wasn't sure how to broach the subject after they'd met so many times.  He claims that he's about done with her and figured very much that he would gradually stop seeing her as much as things settled. 

I then asked him to stop talking and looked through the texts, I mean with very minor interpretational differences (what I mean is, things like her saying ""looking forward to seeing you on Friday"" could be taken as innocent or really bad) what he was saying was exactly true. There's zero texts before May 17th then it starts out with ""so good to talk to you and I can't believe this is really happening, your dad was always such a great guy, I'll tell my parents and please let me know how we can help."" There's a lot of messages and I think I read most of them and there aren't any that are truly suspect. I suppose there's a minor possibility he has another phone or something, but I pay all the bills and balance all our accounts (he doesn't want to think about money in his off time), even so much as I basically give him an ""allowance"" since I do all the budgeting so I don't know where he would get the funds to pay for something like that. Like I mentioned in the original, we are still very much in the honeymoon phase and I can't think of a single incident outside of working hours where he would have the time to carry on an affair. So there's no even simmering guns when it comes to the two big ones, money and time to have an affair. 

That doesn't mean he's off the hook with me by a long shot. I'm very angry that he didn't tell me about this. I don't think i'm an irrational person and I know of his family's relationship with Jessica and her family (most of them came to our wedding, Jessica didn't come because she was working overseas and couldn't make it) and I feel very hurt that he didn't trust me with the truth. I'm still very angry with him and not sure how to make constructive use of my anger or begin to forgive him for what I still feel is a pretty big betrayal. 

I'm not exactly sure how to proceed but I can be more measured than this morning. I guess that's it and I just wanted to say thank you for all the advice. As you can see I followed a lot of the tips. "
"My[35F] Husband[35M] of 15 years admitted to having feelings for my younger cousin[25F].

"A guy [20s?M] who works at my university waits for me on the same night every time I [24F] leave for class.


This began the first week of school, so about 4 weeks ago. I have two evening classes on Tuesdays and my teacher told us we would likely get out after an hour and a half so we definitely would not be there the full three hours. I share a car with my mom and so on Tuesdays, she drives with me to school, I hand it off to her, and she comes to pick me up. 

That evening, since it was the first day, I got out much earlier and figured I would sit in the lobby and read for a bit while I waited. I was the only one in the lobby at that point and it was around 8:30 PM. I hear someone say ""Hi."" but I just kept reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a tall man in sweats carrying a gym back a few feet away from me. I look up and he apologizes because he didn't mean to frighten me. I say it's fine and go back to my book. He then sits down across from me and I realize he was saying hi to me. He introduces himself as Gabe and says he works in the cafeteria and just finished his shift. I just nod politely and I'd like to note my entire body language was ""I'm trying to be by myself.""

He asks me if I go to school here and I say yes. He makes some small talk with me before immediately launching into ""So what do I have to do to get to know you better?"" and I freeze a little. He repeats himself and I don't know what to say at that point. After some silence, he asks if I have a boyfriend to which I reply yes (not even as a way to make him back off, I honestly do and at that point, I wished he was there at that moment). He says he figured because I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever seen but I probably know I'm beautiful since I'm probably told that all the time.

That was my first signal that this guy was making me uncomfortable. He then goes on to say that he loves white women and how if he could lock a white woman down, he would be set for life and that he's sick of black girls because they're so ""hood"" and ""selfish"" as well as how white girls are so ""caring"" and ""classy"". This is my next signal because aside from how uncomfortable I already was, just how he was talking about women really rubbed me the wrong way. I look down at my phone and send a quick text to a friend asking her to call me really quickly. He keeps talking about this one white girl he used to date who was so perfect but he let her go and he regrets it. I'd never been in this situation before so before you ask me why I didn't just leave, I was just scared to be honest. She calls me shortly after, I say I have a call to take, and then leave as fast as I can. She asks what happened and I tell her. She says he probably just wanted to take a chance. I agreed to a point but everything about how he talked made me uncomfortable. I figured this was a one-time thing and forgot about it.

Until the next week.

I go back out to the lobby the following week and there he is again, standing by the door. I go to leave and he blocks my exit, smiling. He starts trying to chat me up saying how he's sad he couldn't get my number last week and he'd love to talk to me some more because I'm just his type. I tell him I'm not interested and I have to leave. He keeps pushing for me to give him my number but thankfully with other people behind me this time I was able to leave.

The next week after, a girl I met joined me leaving class and we were chatting as we were project partners. We get down to the lobby and we see him again. She asks if I know him and I explain what happened to me. She and I walk to the door and he tries to get to me but she blocks him off. He says that he and I know each other and that we always talk. She says that she and I have stuff to work on so we have to leave right now. He looks annoyed at her but we quickly make an exit. 

Now I'm scared. I've already told this guy no so many times and he actually waits for me until I get out of classes. I don't know how to proceed or what to do but now I dread going to my classes because I'm scared he might just show up again and again.

**tl;dr** - Guy hit on me in the lobby at school and I turned down. Since then, he's been persistent and has waited for me when I get out of my classes. What do I do?"

"UPDATE: My [24] parents [50; 57] don't want me to move out because ""I'm not done cooking,"" but I want out.


Link to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pte0z/my_24_parents_50_57_dont_want_me_to_move_out/?st=J7QXC05C&amp;sh=c46cc453

SO. A lot has happened.

Let me just say I appreciate everything you guys have told me. I reread your comments and it's amazing how many instances I ignored from my parents that was *extremely* wrong of them to do. Thank you so much for your advice, and concerns, I felt extremely vindicated but more than that, I finally felt ""not crazy"" which was extremely important to me.

Anyway. On to the update!

So after reading all the comments, I made the decision to apply to jobs. I applied to all I could find, and actually landed a decent paying job as a front desk associate. Also, I got two grants from my school to pay for my entire tuition, AND have some extra money! So yay!!

I landed the job, got my grant money, and talked to my boyfriend. We both agreed that I should move out, and he was more than willing to have me move in for 500 a month. I was thrilled, and sat down with my parents.

They did not take it well.

They told me I couldn't live somewhere else and stay on their insurance. They told me I was making the worst decision of my life, and threatened to take me off all insurance and to cut me off completely. As a person who has to take Prozac everyday to function like a normal human being, this terrified me. They told me they ""let"" me get a job this time (even though I did it behind their backs) but that moving out against the ""agreement"" they had with me (we never had an agreement...they simply told me that I had to live with them, period.) 

This broke my heart and my boyfriend decided to talk with them next time with me, this time bringing a financial planning paper we both worked on to show we thought about things and we had a budget and talked to his parents and they were thrilled and everything. 

My parents shot me down again. The entire meeting in front of my boyfriend, my parents told me I was incapable of living on my own, that I wouldn't last out there in the ""real world"" and that I never finished anything I sought out to do. Even though I am a straight A student. Even though I got not one, but TWO college grants. Even though I am literally a state champion in speech and debate. They guilted me and made me feel bad for wanting to move out, accusing me of abandoning the family, and told me flat out that I will fail, period. That I would not be able to accomplish anything and that I will be miserable. I'm not even exaggerating, they legit said I wouldn't accomplish anything. 

I then tried to compromise, and asked them if I was to still live at home, to allow me to live a relatively free life to come and go, and if they wanted me to quit my job, give me a little bit more to live off of since I'm trying to make a life for myself out there. Nope. They said I belonged at home, period, for the sake of me being home in case they needed me. I don't mind helping out at all, but home for the sake of just being around? Doing nothing?

Writing this, I still feel like I'm plain out disobeying them and feeling guilty for feeling upset at how they treated me. I feel like I have to justify every sentence I say, and that in itself isn't right. I think they love me in their way. But i couldn't live with them anymore.

At this moment I realized my parents would never look at me and see anything but the mistakes I've made in my life, and see me as a crutch. I was so sad I didn't have their support. But I got out.

Now, I live with my boyfriend and things are good. We are still packing, but I have never felt happier. I look forward to going home now, I barely have panic attacks, and my job is going very well. I'm learning how to budget for bills, and after fighting hard I managed to get my parents to keep me on medical insurance, but I think I can make it work. 

Thanks again everyone for their advice. Just wanted to let you all know I took it, and I don't regret it at all.

TL;DR: got out of my parents house, they threatened to cut me out, now I live with boyfriend and feel more at home than I've ever had.

"I [35F] am leaving my husband [32M] and taking our young child with me. Should I give him warning?


[deleted]"
"My[24F] boyfriend [26M] found a secret of mine and won'tleave me alone because of it.


EDIT: this blew up in a way i didn't expect. i want to answer everyone and i'll try to but to clear some things up:

i don't think my boyfriend was snooping. i always clear my history out of habit and this time i left it there. it most likely came up in the search bar since he told me he just 'found it there.'

the problem here is not my sense of humour, it's the fact that when i told him i wrote fics and came clean about it, i was laughing with him. then the mockery started and for the next few days, i was a crazed fangirl in his eyes and he wouldn't let go. that is not having a sense of humour, that's someone i love being hurtful towards me on purpose even though i told him to knock it off.

we're currently not talking. he thinks i'm being over sensitive and i'm here reading your replies. i haven't let him come to my house yet and won't until i think of something to tell him. i already have something in my head thanks to you guys.

this is the first time i see my boyfriend acting this way. i wouldn't be with him if he had been like this since the start. this is the first time and it's probably why i'm so shocked here. i'm hurt. a joke or two, fine. straight up mean mockery? nope.

i don't know if he got jealous, i don't know if the content of the stories bothered him, i don't know. i plan on finding out though.

---
EDIT 2: i'm meeting with him later today, we're gonna talk. 

but again, to clear up any confusion: i did not kick him out completely out of nowhere. he was not confused why i snapped. when he started teasing, it was okay the first couple of times. then he started mocking and reading the fics just to make fun of it. he'd read parts back to me while laughing and making fun of me in a way that wasn't a joke or him seeing me as 'one of the guys'.

---

i'm a writer. a serious writer who's got her first book published and a few poems that made its way to the local paper.

i make a living out of it.

i also have a very secret blog that i use to publish fanfiction under a pseudonym. i know when we mention fanfiction, the first thing that comes to the mind is that i'm ab obsessed fangirl who writes countless of OCs and all of them are in love with an alter ego of myself and bla bla.

no. i just really like exploring my favorite characters and the universe they live in. if i'm reading a book, playing a game, watching a movie--i sometimes think 'what if'. and i write it out. it's been my secret for a long while now.

it used to be.

my boyfriend found my blog when i forgot to clear out my hystory on my laptop. (i don't hide stuff from him, it's just a habit i picked up since i was a child and  hit that curious about porn phase. we had a family computer and if i didn't clear the history i'd get caught, so i always do this.)

he's been mocking me for it. i'm not fragile, i can take a mocking every now and then if i know it's not really malicious. my boyfriend, on the other hand, keeps laughing and making jokes about me being a 'tumblr girl', about me wanting to be with those characters and so on.

it's to the point he read a few and started nitpicking and making fun of some of it. 

i talked to him, he dismissed me. i finally snapped yesterday when he came over and i was writing (again for the local paper). he said 'writing your weird smut fanfiction, fangirl?'

he meant it as a joke. he laughed but i was already so cranky that i told him to leave. he looked at me puzzled and said he was kidding but i kicked him out.

english's not my native language. i started learning english when i was 9 years old because there was no one to write/read fanfictions of a particular fandom i was into in my native language. 

because of it, i discovered how much i love writing. because of it, i learned english and it saved my life when i needed a job but was inexperienced in a lot of things. but man i could speak and write english fluently. and all thanks to writing fanfiction.

it means a lot to me and i'm not hurt that most people think it's silly and make fun of fanfiction writers. i'm hurt because the boy i love is being horrible about it and i'm this close to breaking up. i don't deserve to be mocked for something i like, especially when i don't judge him with the stuff he likes.

he wants to come over but he doesn't think he's wrong and he doesn't see how his behaviour is hurting me.

what do i do?

i learned a long time ago not to be ashamed of doing something that brings me joy, especially when times are hard enough already. 

but it hurts so much that my bf thinks i'm a loser and i don't know what to do. i'm starting to see him differently.

"I'm First Nations [27 M] and I really struggle with feeling not good enough for my white girlfriend [25 F].


I love this girl immensely and I think that's why I feel like she can not only do better but deserves better. We've been together 4 years and in the beginning it was mostly about sex. We met online. She'd never been with a native dude and I'd never been with a white girl. 

It didn't take long at all for me to fall for her. She's funny and witty and so smart. Way smarter than I could ever dream to be. It doesn't hurt that she's incredibly beautiful either. 10/10 in my books. She's just a wonderful person inside and out.

I struggled a lot before I met her. I lived on the reserve. Alcoholism is rampant there and I was not an exception. My ex and I even lost custody of our son and daughter because we couldn't keep our shit together. Currently my kids are [11M and 9F]. I wasn't even working when I met my gf since I was in such a bad place.

I started drinking very young 13, maybe 14 and it feels like I just never stopped. I tried quitting around the birth of my first born at least half a million times. I'd only make it a few days until the detox was absolutely unbearable and I'd give into the craving. I wanted so badly to change for him, to be a good daddy but ultimately I failed him miserably. I failed my daughter too.

I don't know what my gf saw in me when she met me. I was a failure of a human being. She was the first person in my whole entire life to call me on my bullshit though. She told me I was a deadbeat dad. She told me my drinking was a huge issue. She said countless hurtful things, yet they were all very true. I was exactly the person she said I was.

It was barely a month into meeting her that I showed up at her house incredibly drunk and had a full on meltdown. I just cried like I'd never cried before and I basically admitted to all the terrible things she said I was. I told her I didn't want to be that person. I didn't want to be me.

It's all a vague and blurry memory but I can remember her just hugging me and crying with me and I don't think I'd ever felt that kind of compassion before her. I don't think I ever truly felt cared about in the way she cared about me. 

The next morning she asked if I wanted help. She said she'd figure everything out for me if I wanted help. I did want help. 

She got me into detox which was a fucking nightmare. Then I went to rehab where she visited as often as they allowed. Then instead of going back home to the reserve she asked if I wanted to stay with her. She along with my therapist didn't think going  back home would be at all good for my sobriety. 

I've lived with her ever since. She even helped me get a job, albeit for her dad's company. If anything that gave me even more incentive not to fuck it up since I wanted to make a good impression. After that I was allowed a lot more visitation with my kids and then about a year into my sobriety I was given custody back. Again my gf went above and beyond by letting them move into her home.

She has been an amazing mother figure to them over the last three years of us all living together. The kids love her. I love her. Her family has been great with the kids too. Never treated them like outsiders. They've been given the best Christmases and birthdays because of these people. I've never felt anything but warmth and acceptance from all of them which I know deep down I don't deserve.

I want to marry her, but that's where all the doubt starts to come into play. She given me so much but I feel like I have nothing to offer in return. She says she loves me more than anything in the whole entire world. I don't see how. I feel gross most of the time. I can't stand thinking about who I was, how I neglected and lost my kids just so I could get drunk.

I was a truly horrible person and it disgusts me. I feel like a joke. I feel like a stereotype. I feel like the whole lot of them would be better off without me. 

I know my gf would say yes if I proposed. As badly as I want to I just feel like a woman as wonderful as her deserves a man just as great. I don't want her to settle for me. I don't want her to look back in 10 years and wish she never met me. I wish I could have as big and amazing impact on her life as she did mine, but instead I feel like I can only bring her down.

I know we get looks sometimes when we're out too. I know people wonder why she's with someone like me. Her friends were always very vocal about me being a huge mistake. That I'll only cause trouble in her life/that I'm using her. To this day they say she could do better. They're not wrong about the better part.

Sometimes I can't help but wish I was born white. Things would've been so much different. I feel like at least that way when people looked at me they wouldn't automatically assume I'm up to no good. They wouldn't see us together and wonder what a pretty girl like her is doing with a guy like me. I feel like no matter how much I try to change my life my skin colour is a reflection of how shitty I once was.

What do I do Reddit? This is probably above your pay grade isn't it? How I do I feel good enough? Be good enough? Is it right to propose or am I just doing my girl big disservice in the long run?


**tl;dr**: I have a very crappy past. I was not a good person. I don't feel good enough for my gf. Am I wrong in my thinking? Or am I right?

"My [31 M] fiancee [29 F] broke up with me last night, I'm in shock, not sure what to do next...


My fiancee and I have been together for 4 years and engaged for about 1.5. We just moved in together 2 months ago.

She was out of town for a wedding over the weekend, and last night when she got home she said she's been thinking about it for a while and we just aren't right for each other and that she can't marry me and she wants to break up. I feel blindsided - things had felt a little off lately, but I thought it was just us finding our groove living together, we haven't had any major fights or conflicts, and I really had no idea she was feeling this way. She said I've been great to her over the time we've been together and she's sorry. She brought up a fight we had a year ago that I didn't think was a big deal and that we'd gotten past it, but I guess not. She said she's staying with a friend and won't come back to the apartment for a couple weeks so I can figure out my situation and get my stuff out. She was as nice about breaking up as you can be at least I guess...

When we moved I gave up almost all of my furniture and kitchen items. I have to figure out a new living situation, see if I can get refunds for any vacation stuff I had scheduled and paid for, and I'm going to return a very expensive Christmas gift I had already gotten for her.

I guess I just could use some positive words, advice about how to proceed, and just any coping strategies... I feel completely empty inside and am having a really hard time envisioning what my future looks like now... it took me a long time and a lot of bad first dates to meet her and I thought she was my person, so now I'm feeling lost and sad and confused.

thanks in advance.

"My [25f] boyfriend [24m] got a fake number pretending to be my ex [25m] just so he could talk to his ex girlfriend [20f]


Sorry if this title is confusing, I will explain best I can.

My Boyfriend - Max
My Ex boyfriend - James 
Max's Ex girlfriend - Brooke

2 weeks ago I received a text from an unknown number, claiming they were my ex boyfriend James. I believed it was James as he did write a status on Facebook saying he had a new number. It was just casual talk ""how are things?"" ""How's your new boyfriend?"" I replied platonically and friendly as we did end on good terms. 

My current boyfriend Max said if I am talking to my ex then he should be allowed to speak to his ex Brooke.
I said that's fine, you can speak to who you want although you know I won't like that. I wasn't happy because the only reason I ever stopped him talking to Brooke is because their messages were always flirty and she still sent him nudes. So I asked him to block her, and he did. But He said he would talk to her anyway because I am speaking to James. 

That was that.

A few days later, Max went to make dinner, and I was up in the bedroom. I was looking for some socks from Max's drawer, and I found a cheap mobile phone that I never saw before. I looked on it and it was the texts I sent to James. I was livid. He was pretending to be my ex boyfriend?

I confronted max straight away, and he admitted that he wanted to get back in touch with Brooke, and he thought if I spoke to my ex James, he could use that as an excuse to be able to talk to Brooke.

I am pissed off. I am really angry that he had to do this behind my back. I asked to see his messages between Brooke and they are all flirty and just borderline inappropriate.

Tldr ; my boyfriend pretended to be my ex so he could speak to his ex. We live together, + own a dog. Is this salvageable? where do I go from here?

"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my GF [24F] of two years. I'm starting to want other women... How do I fix the way I'm feeling so my relationship can survive?


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6v8k58/me_25f_with_my_gf_24f_of_two_years_im_starting_to/

I came here a couple of weeks ago because, despite everything going well in my relationship, I was having these urges to be single and be with other women. I got a lot of great advice and I'm happy to say things have improved -- it took a little effort on my part but Laura and I are the happiest we've ever been!

The next time I saw Laura I took her out on a date. Nothing fancy but we watched a horror movie and got dinner, then went for a walk around town. I think she noticed I had been acting a bit weird because she upped her cuteness game and left me a bunch of post-it notes scattered around the house with reasons why she loved me. She's the best.

We also have been having sex more often! It required some slight effort on my part because she has a higher libido than I do and I get very tired at the end of the day... But I think I'd forgotten how important sex is in a long term relationship. We've introduced some new things in the bedroom too which has been great.

I'm back to being crazy in love with her and wanted to thank you all for the advice, especially u/idontreallylikecandy who asked ""If you knew that for the rest of your relationship this was all you were ever going to get from her, no more no less, would you stay?"" That question really got me thinking. Thank you again.

OKAY, SO.
This issue has been driving me crazy lately to the point where I'm actually becoming stressed out about it pretty hardcore. I called one of my best girlfriends. I called my sister. I prepared an entire mental speech for him at my birthday party this Friday. I finally started to accept that it was time to lay my cards all out on the table.


Then, last night, we were just hanging out like we usually do; drinking a bottle of wine, playing music, drawing, talking about life. We ended up under the desk and he goes ""I'm gonna cuddle you"", so we cuddled. Nothing crazy yet.


But then we fell asleep cuddling, and the next thing I know he's sleepily pressing his face against my cheek and kissed it. I pulled back to look at him and see if he was for real and then he went in and kissed me.


Boom. Fireworks.


We talked a bunch after a really heavy makeout sesh, and it turns out that we have been exactly on the same page... for 3 years. This doesn't feel real. I was shaking and cried happy tears as he told me everything that was on his mind. I'm really excited to see where this goes... I've never felt this way about anybody before.

"My (31F) husband (33M) was assaulted on the train home after birthday celebrations last night. I don't know what to do.


My husband and I have just celebrated our third anniversary, we've just come back from holiday and things have been awesome.

Last night he went out with his old work friends to a London sports bar to watch the match, and then for drinks and whisky etc after. I've really hurt my neck, and in the process discovered some awfully large lumps, so am having tests to rule out cancer/auto-immune disease. I was going to join him after the footie finished but was feeling rough so left him and the lads to it.

I fully expected him to stay out all night, so when he texted to let me know he was thinking about a going to a club and that he'd head back and sofa crash with mates, I said go for it. I'm home before uni starts again so stayed up until midnight, turned off all the lights I'd left on for him, and went upstairs. He texted me to say he was on his way home, he was still in London but Covent Garden tube was closed so he was walking to Hoborn to get the right line. I was so excited so ran around turning lights back on, got him water and Berocca ready and went to bed.

A few hours later - I must have fallen asleep - he called. He was at our home station with the police. He'd been assaulted/punched/head butted by a group of chavs on the train, and was being taken to the hospital I work at by BTP. I couldn't get to the hospital so he said he'd keep me updated. Ended up having a CT, ECG, and other tests. He was discharged with 48 hour observations. 

He got in at 6am and is shaken up. I've gone out and bought him treats, made him tea, but clearly he's quite tired and upset. The police stopped by and wanted to take a statement but he refused. They're calling again tomorrow. 

I just don't know what to do - I feel like I'm being a bit like a hoverer and bugging him, but don't want to just leave him to it either. Any advice on how to handle things would be great. I'm sure he'll be fine physically, but I don't know if the attack was actually worse than he's making out to me. I don't know how to support him right now.

**Tl;dr - husband was attacked on his birthday, suffered head injuries and is shaken up, but he refuses to speak to police or me. I have a feeling the attack is worse than he's telling me. I don't know how to support him through it and feel like I'm getting in the way.**

Edit to add: So he's talked a little about what happened. Despite having his iPhone/Bose headphones/a literal bag of presents they seem to have just pounced in him for fun.

"Me [29F] at a newish job, managing data for an all-male engineer team [20-70M] are treating me like a secretary. How do I tactfully establish boundaries?


Hey all!

I thought this might be a good place to reach out for advice. I'm fairly new, as a data management specialist for a team of engineers. I just graduated with a CTIS degree and was excited to land a job so quickly with such an established company, but the novelty is quickly wearing off because of the treatment I'm receiving from several members of my team.

The team is fairly young at this company and expanded quickly in the last year. Twelve months ago this group wasn't a requirement for the company but government standards have changed and it had to be added  and rapidly expanded from 3 engineers to 11 in that time. The huge workload on them meant they were generating a lot of data that needs to be maintained, properly stored, etc. which created the need for my position as well.

I think some of these confusions come from the team just not knowing how to utilize my support (yes I am there to support them, but not the way they are trying to use my skills) since this is a brand new position, combined with general, standard office misogyny. Also, because it's my first job outside of the food service industry and after graduating, I wasn't sure in the beginning what was appropriate so I've been a ""yes woman"" until now. 

Now that I have a better idea of my role, some of the guys are pushing it too far and I want to establish boundaries. Some examples of what I'm talking about include:

1) Manager emailing me to tell me to schedule a meeting, that has nothing to do with my work, and I'm not supposed to attend. We schedule meetings via Outlook so he could have scheduled it himself in the time he took to send that email would. That said, he's my manager, so I'm not going to rock that boat too much.

2) While this was a joke, and I don't hold anything against this person for it, it revealed how I'm coming across to people. One older engineer told me he could really use some coffee and we laughed about it. He is the person that envisioned my role, pushing for it's creation, and has expressed his frustration at how I'm being used for menial tasks instead of being allowed to support the team the way he imagined.

3) I run weekly reports on documents/submittals that are due, asking for updates from each engineer on their progress and when we can expect them to have them turned in. I also track down missing/overdue items from external support keeping internal workflow moving. NOBODY RESPONDS TO MY EMAILS except the last engineer I was speaking of. So I have to wait a reasonable amount of time and track down these guys in person who reluctantly give me updates. Several of them get indignant and cut me off and pedal excuses when I do this.

4) One of those people sent me an email last week TELLING me to print out his PTO form, have our manager sign it, and send it into Payroll for him. I just forwarded it straight to my manager and said I wasn't comfortable putting my hands in other peoples' payroll activities and that he should handle it (first time I've stood up for myself so far). In a phone meeting with him and my manager later on other topics, this engineer forgot to run a report needed for the meeting, but I'd already done it. My manager said, ""see, [thebirdabides] DOES help you"" which leads me to believe that a conversation about that took place.

5) Yesterday a younger engineer TOLD me to update his attempt to escalate an issue to upper management, despite the fact that for on-site engineers, this is their own responsibility. I do this for folks off-site, because they can't access most of our drives to provide adequate information. I responded, and cc'd the manager, that I would do it this time but for future reference, according to procedure, it's his responsibility (second time I've stood up for myself). It was 5 o'clock on Friday so I left right after that.

I probably should have stayed, though, because now I'm anxious that I'm pushing it. I guess I need guidance on how to proceed.  Should I continue with these methods? I don't want to risk my job, but this I did not sign up to be a secretary (nothing wrong with secretary work, it's just not what I signed up for). I'm even considering transferring elsewhere in the company once I hit 6 months because this appears to be confined to just my team, at least to this extent. 

Thanks everybody!


EDIT:  Adding another incident. In an email exchange between a different department's representative and my manager that I was CC'd on, the other guy said, ""have your admin schedule a meeting and release this workflow"". So this perception of my position is bleeding and I strongly believe it needs to be reigned in if I hope to advance within my field. 

TL;DR: Only woman on an all-male team, how do I keep them from treating me like a secretary, when that's not my job description."

"My[21F] roommate[21F] continues to defy my orders about my dog.


I didn't know her before moving in. The apartment people put us together in a 2 bedroom. I told her I have a young dog (in case the apartment didn't convey it) and she was very excited and saying that she loves dogs. We got on great when we first met and I thought it would be a good situation.

Background on my dog: he is about 2 years old and came from a pet hoarding situation. Due to that, he wasn't socialized at all until I got him so he can be very shy and timid. That said, he is very active. So he is basically a giant ball of nervous energy when I'm not around. He also has separation anxiety so I crate him when I leave (he is never left longer than 4 hours). I know there are differing opinions about that, but that isn't what this is about so please don't comment about that. My issue is with my roommate explicitly defying me in regard to my dog.

The 2nd day home I went to the grocery store. I was gone for an hour and returned to find my dog out of the crate. He had jumped on the counter and chewed on a bunch of fruit and chewed on the wall. I could also hear him screaming when I walked up which is what he does when he's left out of the crate alone. 

I explained to my roommate that he needs to stay in the crate because he has separation anxiety and gets destructive when I'm gone. He has also gotten so scared before that he injured himself so it is for his own safety. Roommate told me that she doesn't believe in crating. I told her I didn't care, it was my dog, and she needs to respect that. She said okay.

Keep in mind that my dog loves his crate, goes in on his own free will, and sleeps soundly the entire time I'm gone when he is in it. In my opinion, that's a much nicer experience for him than panicking, crying, and trying to claw his way through the front door for hours. 

So I went to class on Monday and she let him out again. Again I told her not to. Tuesday she let him out again and I was furious. I also noticed that he was in a sad mood all day and barely greeted me. Wednesday I locked the crate with a combination lock and came home to find that she had cut it off with some tool. Thursday I got permission from my professor to take my dog for one day only. Friday I had a friend go by halfway through my class to make sure the dog was in the crate. He wasn't, of course, and my friend recrated her and didn't see the roommate anywhere. I got home 45 minutes later and the dog was out again.

Many things have been destroyed over the week, including the front door, wall, blinds, bed, and the couch. My dog also has scratched on his face from throwing himself at the front door trying to escape. Roommate had the audacity to complain to me about my dog making a mess and chewing up her headphones. She continues to tell me I owe her $150 for new headphones. I've lost track about how many times I've gotten furious and yelled at her because she's putting my dog in danger.

This can't continue. It's only been a week and I have no idea how to go about this but something has to change. I complained to the apartment and they told me I would have to deal with it and they would let me know if another room opened up. My parents recently died and so this is my first apartment renting experience I've done by myself and I have no idea what to do 

In addition to all this, I set up a video camera by the crate and caught her hitting my dog. He was extremely timid before and I've been actively working with positive reinforcement to build up his confidence. It is a very slow process and she has completely set him back. It explains why I noticed he was in such a sad mood and not his normal self, happy to see me

Edit: Hi guys. Sorry I didn't update sooner. I called the officer over and he was really nice and helpful. He even went down and talked to my apartment manager with me to explain the situation and they were much more compliant with him of course. Then we went back to my apartment and when he began taking down the report, my roommate got home. She began demanding that the officer reveal while he was there and then she called the police...on a police officer...to report an intruder. All this while the officer is trying to keep her calm because she was freaking out so much. She then chucked her cell phone at her own tv and broke it, and when the officer began moving toward her she pulled something out of her pants (some sort of tool, maybe the same one she broke my lock with) and hit him with it. So she got arrested and the apartment is moving me into a single bedroom and keeping me at the (less expensive) rent price of 2 bedroom. I just picked up my new key so I'm just moving in now. My dog is doing better today now that the roommate has been gone since last night. He is much more relaxed and seems happy :)

"I [14M] live on a military base with just my mom [30sF]. I was asked out by a girl here and I turned her down. I saw her outside my bedroom window last night and I don't know what to do because I don't want to cause trouble.


Hello everybody. I face a unique problem with my life. My mom and dad are both in the military, but are divorced. My dad and I don't talk much anymore. I don't know how to word this without sounding like I think I'm the best. People always tell me I got my dads looks. I am very athletic and have a good body for my age. I don't go around doing things with as many girls as I can like he did. I've had other female personal in the army talk to me after what dad did and mom did as well. 

There is this girl that lives not to far away from me on the base. She asked me out and I turned her down gently. I cannot stress that enough. I don't like hurting peoples feelings or them in general. I'm not a mean person. Last night my mom was out buying some stuff we needed for our home. I was watching Grimm which is one of my favourite television series ever. I love fantasy stuff like that. I got up and started walking towards the kitchen to check on Dinner I was making. To get to the kitchen I have to walk past my bedroom. Out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw something. I turned my head to the left and I saw her face pressed against the window looking in. I let a fuck because it scared me.I went outside and she was running away in the distance. 

I don't know how to tell mom. She knows something is up because I keep trying to block peoples view from the window. I feel so uncomfortable. She told me I have until 8 tonight which leaves me an hour. 

**TL;DR: I don't know how to tell mom about the girl outside.**

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6wxlyh/after_meeting_this_girl_26_f_for_the_first_time/

We ended up driving to Vegas with five of us in the car and there were a few moments where I was like ""what have I gotten myself into"" but I was just psyching myself out. I sucked it up and stayed positive and ended up having a great time. She was great, her friends were great. 

We didn't hook up but we fooled around a lot and had a lot of fun together. There were times where we were couple-y, and plenty of times where we weren't. I tried to not have expectations and it ended up working out.

We went out again this past weekend and have been talking a lot more and I'm liking her a lot more too. Glad my first impression wasn't necessarily the most accurate impression. We had some somewhat serious discussions about dating and whatnot and it turns out that she is not a one night stand type of person either.

"Me [24F] with my SO [24M]. He saw a stain on my pants and questioned if it was .. bodily fluids.


As the title states... this is so ridiculous.

My boyfriend and I were at dinner and he looked down and saw a mystery white stain on my pants. I had not even known it was there but I am a very sloppy person so it didn't surprise me. He seemed really concerned and was like uhh what is that? I explained I didn't know and it was weird because I had brought them to the dry cleaner but they must have missed it or oh well, must have spilled something.  I answered calmly and explained this. He would NOT LET it go. It ruined our entire dinner. I seriously thought it was a joke.  

Things smoothed over and we talked as normal but he kept bringing it up somehow. I had gone away last weekend so he asked what I wore and I told him. The pants with the stain were at his apartment while I was away so there was NO WAY I could have worn them anyway. At this point I am starting to get really aggravated and raising my voice.  He comes from a house hold that was far from stable and has major trust issues and our relationship started rocky. It is far from perfect but we compliment each other in ways for each other  that are great. It's just these trust things. I forgot to mention I have never cheated on him.

The final straw was when we got home and I was doing laundry and he said ""'maybe you should wash those pants to get that mystery stain out too..."" I lost my shit and stormed out and drove back to my parents. Am I overreacting? I really am offended that he would think I would cheat on him or even just sleep around in general. Not that that is a bad thing but he should know MY character and that's not it. I don't think I want to talk to him until I get a sincere apology. How should I approach this Reddit..

"Me [30/F] with my husband [37 M] of 6 years, has a hard time accepting that I won't go on a trip with his family [34/F, 60s M/F] specifically because of his father [60s M]


Hello to my favorite sub!

So, down to the nitty gritty:

My father-in-law, Steve, is a convicted sex offender. He now not considered a re-offense risk, he no longer has to register, it's now just a footnote in his history. His victim, my sister-in-law, Angie, has taken her faith very seriously and has forgiven him a long time ago (but not forgotten, as she does not leave her daughters alone with him for any length of time.) I am a child sex abuse victim (more than at one set of hands, unfortunately,) and so this has colored my view of him to start.

Steve is also not a smart or very nice person. We have very different political views, and he would literally start things with my friends and I on social media. If he was proven wrong, he'd start yelling at them to leave him alone (or, my personal favorite, was to say that he ""didn't have time"" to read anything that anyone linked him, but he had time to be nasty.) I ended up removing him from social only to watch him do the same thing to Angie.

He also once told my husband to forget that he owed him money when he was unemployed just to throw it in his face later.

Sarah, my mother-in-law, just lost her 90-something year old father to cancer last week and has flown out across the country for his funeral. It has now been determined that we are taking a family trip in May to see her mother, my grandmother-in-law, if she survives that long.

I do not want to go anywhere with Steve. I do not want to be trapped in Bumfuck, nowhere with Steve. I do not want to Steve to spend any money on me in any capacity that he can hold over my head somewhere down the line when he's feeling vindictive. I am VERY LC with Steve, and will only talk to him if the situation truly requires it.

As a result, this has unintentionally caused my husband to be alienated from his family. Angie gets it, she and I have talked about it, but I won't approach Sarah nor Steve about it; it's just a worthless endeavor that would cause more drama.

So, now my husband is pressuring me. He understands that I hate Steve, so he made an offer: Either we get out there on our own (which will be hard seeing as I'm currently unemployed and headed to grad school in the spring) or we go with his family. He will not go without me. He points out that he has family he hasn't seen since he was a small child and that his grandmother would love to meet me.

I'd love to meet them, but I will not do so with Steve. But I have no other solution to offer my husband.

TL;DR: Husband's grandfather died. It has been determined that we are going to take a ""family"" trip paid for by my FIL to see husband's grandmother. I will not go specifically because of my FIL, but have no other way for my husband to see his living relatives that he wants to see beyond this trip. He will not go without me. What do I do? Help!

**Edit:** This might be relevant, and something *I* didn't consider: my husband may be grieving and not thinking rationally. His grandfather just died days ago and he couldn't get time off for the funeral (nor did we have the means to send him across the country, honestly.) This has only been on the table for a few days.

Please forgive me on this, but I am neurologically atypical and can't read people very well.

"I [25F] loathe my boyfriend's [32M] son [11M]... is this relationship doomed?


**EDIT**:  *Thank you all for your words.  I want to clarify that Jake will* **not** *be spending any amount of time with Randall until I have seen significant improvements in his behavior, as Jake's mental and physical well being is my top priority.  I am going to speak to Dean tomorrow and make it clear that our ongoing relationship is dependent upon both him and Randall seeing therapists to improve their communication and reactions to each others behavior, as the blame for Randall's behavior does not fall solely on his shoulders.  If he tries to deflect blame or make excuses, I am going to have to accept that our relationship does not have a future.  I will post another update tomorrow evening once we have had the chance to talk face to face - wish me luck!*

&amp;nbsp;

Hi Reddit, I am hoping for your insight into my relationship with my boyfriend, Dean (32M), and his son.  Both Dean and I are bringing children (the cutest baggage) into the relationship: Dean’s son, Randall (11M), and my son, Jake (8M).  For background, Dean and his ex had a 40/60 custody arrangement, and my son lives with me full-time except for occasional visitation with his father.

&amp;nbsp;

Dean and I had dated for two years from the time Jake was 2-4, and Randall was 5-7.  I only met Randall a handful of times in the last six months of our relationship, but even from that limited exposure he was… overwhelming.  If we would take the kids to an indoor play park to run around, Randall would ignore any rules Dean tried to put in place and terrorize other kids who got on his ‘bad side’.  He was friendly to Jake and generally respectful towards me, as I left it up to Dean to enforce rules and punishments.  I occasionally heard stories from Dean about Randall being in trouble at school for doing things like hitting and throwing scissors at his teachers (!?).  Dean would insist that he had an issue with authority figures, but did not act that way at home.

&amp;nbsp;

I also had a lot of sympathy for the kid: he didn’t have any friends at school or in the neighborhood he lived in, had been moved around a bunch (in the six years I have known Dean, he’s moved five times), and both of his parents were in new relationships.  I thought he might be angry and defiant because deep down he was insecure.  But when I suggested Dean sign Randall up for activities or camps so he could meet new friends, Dean said he had tried that and Randall would get told not to come back after a couple of days because of his difficult behavior.

&amp;nbsp;

We broke up for a couple of years for unrelated reasons, but started spending time together again in 2015.  We took it slow (again), and for the first year Dean didn’t really bring Randall up in conversation unless I asked about him, so I assumed his behavioral issues were just an age thing that he’d outgrown.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wrong.**

&amp;nbsp;

We have had about half a dozen ‘play dates’ with the boys in the last year, and every single one as left me wanting strangle Randall.  He is in grade six and acts worse than my barely-8-year-old.  At the trampoline park, he got offended by a child much younger than him hitting him with a foam ball (in the dodgeball area of the park, mind you) and proceeded to target the poor kid for the rest of the time we were there.  Pelting him with balls as hard as he could, getting in his way so he couldn’t jump, and calling him names until the kid left.  Dean got irate and yelled at Randall, but this did nothing to help the situation: Jake left to play in another part of the park until our time ran out, and Randall’s mood was ruined by this perceived slight for the rest of the day.  It is like this with everything: Randall feels “disrespected” by someone, and obsesses over it for the rest of the day.  I fucking hate this behavior, 
but was able to keep my mouth shut until he directed it at Jake this weekend.

&amp;nbsp;

Dean suggested we take the boys out to his parents’ cabin this weekend for an early lunch and maybe a game of mini golf afterwards.  I did not really want to spend an entire day with Randall (it’s an hour drive out to the lake), but since it was the last time we would be able to see his parents before they went south for the winter, I agreed.  On the drive out this morning, Randall was pushing Dean’s buttons as usual (refusing to turn down the volume on his tablet, or if music was playing on the radio that he “didn’t like” he would sing along in obnoxious voices to ruin the song for everyone) but fuck it, Jake has his shitty days too, so I ignored it.

&amp;nbsp;

 We get out to the cabin, and after half an hour the boys decide to venture down to the play park half a block away.  After about twenty minutes, Randall comes back fuming and claiming Jake swore at him.  Jake initially denies it, but then admits he called Randall a fucking jerk for trying to push him off the merry-go-round while it was spinning and spitting on his shoes on purpose.  Both boys get reprimanded by their respective parent: Randall for spitting, and Jake for swearing.  But the fact that Randall got in trouble at all sets. Him. Off.  He loses it in front of everyone in attendance, and locks himself in Dean’s vehicle for the next hour.  Dean goes out to the truck and blows up on him, tries to pull him out of the car, etc., but this just makes Randall dig his heels in more.  I went out after half an hour thinking I could diffuse the situation by giving him his tablet and letting him know I will bring him out his lunch to eat there if he would prefer, but Randall locks the car doors so I can’t open the door and speak wth him.  Whatever.

&amp;nbsp;

He emerges about half an hour before we leave, stomps around the cabin, scowls at Jake when he apologizes for swearing at him, and is a general miserable cloud on an otherwise nice afternoon with my boyfriend’s parents.

&amp;nbsp;

We start the awkward drive home with Randall in the front passenger seat and me sitting beside Jake, and Dean decided to drive through DQ and treat the boys to slushies… which, in any other situation I would appreciate, but I can tell you if Jake gave me half the fucking attitude Randall had shown in the last four hours, he would be drinking a glass of DQ’s finest tap water while I enjoyed my MooLatte.

&amp;nbsp;

And that is where I’m at now.  Still upset several hours after the fact, and trying to think of how I can approach my concerns with Dean.  I have no empathy left for Randall.  Until I can see marked improvements in his behavior, I don’t want to spend any time around him with or without Jake, and I can’t see my relationship with Dean progressing to the next level with him around.  Dean made a joke today on the drive out about the volume level in the car, and how we should “add two more” to the pack, and my blood ran cold: I can’t imagine being tied to Randall in such a permanent way.  And I really, truly don’t think Dean sees his behavior for what it is.  On days like today he will mention that he “never acts like this”, even though every play date we have had ends with Randall in a rage.  He will also make comparisons between Jake’s tantrums (which are pretty average for a kid his age) and Randall’s… even though Jake is four years younger, and will fume for 20-30 minutes then apologize and continue with his day, whereas Randall will obsess and not let things go for **hours** afterwards.

&amp;nbsp;

So I get to the final questions: is it a death knell for our relationship if I tell Dean we will not be living together until Randall is graduated and out of his house?  How can I talk to him constructively about how he approaches Randall’s tantrums, without him feeling attacked?  Am I awful for not wanting to do “family” trips or vacations with his son… ever?

&amp;nbsp;

Please, Reddit, help me find the words and courage to approach Dean about this, hopefully in a way that means we can navigate our way through this and stay together!

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR // I have been dating my boyfriend for four years and it is getting to the point that I can't spend time around his son because of his bratty, explosive behavior.  Am I a monster for wanting to not live together or make attempts to ""blend"" our family until his son is grown and out of the house?"

"My (22F) supervisor (42F) attempted and failed give my job away to her friend (40F), and is now retaliating against me. What do I do?



  Hi, /r/Relationships! I was hoping you could help me with a sticky situation at work. I have been a department manager at a grocery store for a little over a year now. I've worked at this store for three years, and attained my position naturally through promotions during my time there.

 Overall, it's a good job, except about a year and a half ago my boss resigned and a new boss (Janet) came in to replace him. The new boss was a friend of our supervisor (Sarah), which is why she was hired. At first, since our department had all been friends before, my approach was that Janet and I would get along, so I welcomed her and was friendly, and was immediately shut down- Janet was cold, and mean for the sake of being mean. Three months in and I was the most depressed I had ever been. She was so horrible that I had begun drafting out my letter of resignation since work wasn't doing good things to my mental health under her ""leadership"". Most of my friends quit.

Around this time, Janet violated our store's safety regulations and climbed on something that was not a ladder, and fell off- hard. Janet broke her leg in three places and couldn't work anymore. Since it was clear she'd be gone for a while, Sarah asked if I could step up as a temporary fill for Janet's job while she was in recovery. Months and months passed by, and Janet's recovery was taking much longer than previously thought. Around 6 months in of our department not having an official leader, Sarah's boss noticed I was doing an excellent job. They asked if I would like to be the official department manager. I took the job, and was now paid in salary instead of hourly, which is living the dream if you're in retail. 

Six more months later, after Janet's sick leave is timed out, she calls and says she's ready to come back to work- but here's the problem, they didn't have to hold her job for her any longer than six months, and it's been twice that. The store is obligated to give her a full time position, just not what she had before (as it had been filled since then, by me.). Janet was livid. 

Sarah was happy to have her friend back, and made me re-train Janet on my duties and reveal all of my projects to her. They smiled at each other like Ursula's twin eels in The Little Mermaid. 

The next day, Sarah's boss (who has my back) emails and says Janet will be informed today that her new role at the store will be as a cashier and nothing more. Neither of them speaks to me that day, and look at me with acid in their eyes. Other than the worry that one of them will impale me, I felt secure since that meant I get to keep my job, and Janet would never be my boss again.

Ever since the news that Janet has been demoted has dropped, Sarah has been going behind my back and giving Janet my duties. For example, they took my schedule and redo it together, they start the weekly managers' meetings without me, they rearranged my entire personal office space, and every time I clock in, Janet has completed a dramatic change in my section without my knowledge or approval, like decorating for Halloween, straight up cutting me out of the schedule creation process altogether, or creating informational programs for my cashiers. I've asked Sarah to run large changes like this by me so that I'm at least aware of what's going on, and all I got in return was a sneer.  This has made me feel powerless and cornered.

Sarah and I seem to have had a good relationship before this, and I'm trying to find a way to make this toxic work environment possible to breathe in. I really liked my job, and I care a lot about the folks that I'm in charge of. The last thing I want to do is leave my position, especially in the hands of someone I know is horrible. It looks like Sarah and Janet are trying to run me out and I don't know what to do. I'm becoming so emotionally fatigued by the way they are treating me, but I want to find a way to keep my job in spite of things. I've already spoken to Sarah's boss, who is on my side of things and sees the way they are acting, and he has reported Sarah's hostile behavior to corporate, but it's been three weeks and nothing has happened. Does anyone have a good way to reprise to Sarah that I am worthy of my position and the way she and Janet are undermining me is not okay?

"My [38 M] wife [38 F] is obsessed with keeping up with the Joneses


My wife and I have been married for 10 years, and have 3 awesome kids together.  She stays at home with the kids, and I provide all of the income.  Because we live in a high cost of living area, my salary doesn't go as far as we'd like.

She had developed friendships with the other stay at home moms, the majority of whom lead these fantasy lives of pampering, vacations, etc.  Because money is tight for us, my wife cannot afford things like a cleaning lady, frequent manicures, etc.

I help out around the house, co-parent, cook - things you would expect a partner to do.  

The problem is, she is consumed with what she doesn't have.  To the point of almost being depressed about it.  I hear remarks all the time about how she doesn't have this or that.  I have told her that she cannot let these things get her down, but to no avail.  Her remarks impact my psyche as well, since I am the only income, and clearly it is viewed as not being enough.

I don't know what to do at this point.  Her negative attitude has really turned me off.  I really don't want to be with someone who is like this, but at the same time I don't want to break up our family.

"He [34M] turned into a nightmare. I [24F] need to deal with this but am a little lost.


This is so damn difficult.

Met this guy, fell in love, he's amazing, I'm in a dream-like state every time we get together. We start getting serious, we talk about kids. I tell him I don't want them, he says he doesn't want them now either.

I am very very very stupid and in love here so I pretend I don't hear the 'now' part and I carry on with him knowing that our relationship has an expiration date. I just want to enjoy it a bit more.

Period is late. I don't freak out because I take my birth control religiously and we use condoms. I know I'm not pregnant, and my period is wonky when I'm under stress.

He hears me talking to my friend about my period being late. He freaks out and thinks I might be pregnant, I reassure him I'm not. Period comes, he's relieved and I'm just trying to off the cramps with a strong painkiller 'cause I get really bad ones.

I'm in bed, he mentions how scared he was because this isn't the time for kids but that he also thought about it and he really wants a baby with me later.

Oh boy.

I'm already trying not to cry because this is it, this is where we're going to break up. I tell him we're not compatible. I tell him I don't want kids ever and that it was selfish of me not mentioning that earlier and I was sorry, but having kids is not going to happen with me.

He has a hard time believing me, thinks I'm just traumatized by the almost baby scare (ok?), I tell him no. He starts questioning why and I calmly explain to him that hey, I do find babies cute but it stops there. I really don't like small children and I also tell him that I wouldn't have a minute to just rest because I'd be worried about them all the time. I'd be on edge all the time because anything could happen to them and nope, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

So we break up right there. I'm a mess but I keep it cool. He packs his things and leaves. I break down then because I really love him.

He calls me the other day saying he thinks I should go to therapy. I'm so heartbroken I don't see the ignorance of his suggestion right away and I ask him why. He says I must have been abused and am repressing the memory because it's not normal for me to not want kids. I hang up on him.

He calls again, I don't pick up. He starts texting. I tell him to stop, I'm not going to therapy, no one ever abused me, I had an amazing childhood, I just don't want to be a mother.

He leaves me alone for a while but my view of him is already too damaged. Here's someone I loved turning into a nightmare. And he plays the part.

He keeps bombarding my phone with texts saying he misses me and this is a mistake. He then goes into angry spells where he calls me names for not wanting a baby. One day he gets drunk and sends me an audio message going on a tirade saying the woman's body is made to birth children, women are supposed to want kids, that I was selfish because I just wanted sex and so I may as well be a prostitute.

I listen and I'm in shock because this is not the man I loved. And then I realize that yes, it is. He's been hiding this side from me all this time and now that he's not getting his way he's showing it to me. I block him, unfriend him on social media, block him everywhere else and I change the locks of my home because he has a key and he hasn't given it back.

All of that pisses him off and he's texting me from random numbers, he's being cruel and saying violent things via emails and he has even brought it on facebook where he says I denied him his child. (????) The level of crazy is high and I'm scared but also looking for options on how to handle this.

Any of you have any advice? Any of you ever dealt with this? This is so upsetting, I've been a little numb now to it all but ugh, never in a million years did I think he'd turn into this.

My sister is not a very good sister. She's going through this phase where she's being rebellious as humanly possible. She always tell me to piss off or kill myself if I so much as even talk to her. I am being honest when I say I don't know what I did to make her so angry at me. I have always been much closer with my brother than I have my sister. 

My brother is dating Juliet. Juliet looks like one of those Instagram models that other girls aspire to be. She's gorgeous and she treats my brother so well. She's really into beauty and fashion. Juliet and my brother have been dating for 3 years and live together. I asked her if she could help me get ready for the formal and we made a day out of it. My brother was happy to see us doing stuff together. My sister has freaked out because I apparently betrayed her because Juliet is stealing Mike from us. She's not. Mike always wants to do stuff but my sister is always ""Busy."" She's calling me a betrayer.

"Me [24F] with the support staff in my office [20sF], they talk about me in Spanish


Please forgive any grammatical mistakes and my inability to write in a way that sounds nice. I'm running on very little sleep right now and I don't have the energy to make myself sound smart. 

I'm an intern at a law firm. I started working at the firm a couple months ago and I'll continue to work there throughout this school year and maybe during the summer if it's a good fit. I'm a full time student in my second year of law school so I'm only working 20 or so hours per week. 

All of the lawyers in the office are really nice. The support staff is nice to my face but talk shit about me in Spanish. During my first week of work, they asked me what my ethnicity is (I'm darker than your average white person and have dark hair) and if I spoke Spanish. I said that I didn't speak Spanish because it's true. I probably should have told them that I understand it pretty well, having grown up around Spanish speakers. 

Since the first week, I've heard them talk about me almost every day. If I ask the attorneys a question, they'll mock me or complain that they have to hear my voice. They make fun of the way I dress, even though it's standard business casual (the norm in the office). I know I shouldn't care what they think of me but it's making it unpleasant to work here.

I honestly have no idea what I did to make them dislike me. I've always treated them with respect. I'm friendly. I don't make unnecessary noise. I really don't get it. 

I've thought about saying something to the attorneys but I'm worried it will hurt my chances of having an opportunity to work here this summer. I'm just an intern so I'm replaceable. The newest member of the support staff has been here for almost two years. None of the attorneys speak Spanish so I don't think they know that this is happening. 

Is there a way to fix this? Should I suck it up or start looking for a new job?

"My (26f) husband (27m) thinks it's unreasonable for me to expect him not to tickle me and continually touch me in ways that make me feel uncomfortable.


We've been married two years, have a kid together.

My husband likes teasing people, a lot. He will constantly tickle me, poke me, or grab me too hard. He will hold me down so I can't move sometimes. Sometimes it's painful, other times it's just uncomfortable. I will ask him over and over to stop, but he won't listen. It's gotten to the point where I have to yell at him to get him to stop, and I don't enjoy being around him anymore. It reminds me a lot of how my older brother would torment me when we were kids... only my older brother grew out of it.

Tonight he was tickling me and I had been objecting to it for awhile. I finally told him that if he tickles me one more time I'm going to punch him. He laughed and said, ""if the cops come here because you broke my nose, telling them that I tickled you isn't going to get you out of going to jail.""

I lost my temper at that point. I told him that ""just teasing"" isn't an excuse to continually invade another person's boundaries, and what he's doing is abusive. That made him very angry, and he went to sleep on the couch without saying anything. Later he sent me a text saying that he wants us to be apart and not talk for a few weeks.

Truthfully I've always had a much lower pain tolerance than most people, I have sensitive skin, but I'm extremely frustrated that he's not listening to me or making any effort to make me feel more comfortable. As long as he gets to laugh at me that's apparently all that he cares about. This has been such an ongoing problem for such a long time and he's made no indication that he hears me or cares that I'm not enjoying his manner of showing affection, that I'm not sure I even care if he decides to end our marriage over what I said tonight.
  
Did I overreact, or do I have a legitimate reason to be pissed about this? I do think threatening to punch him was too far, I let my frustration get the best of me, but I really don't know how to get him to stop at this point.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: my husband continually tickles me and touches me in ways that are painful/uncomfortable for me. I've been telling him I don't like it and to stop doing it for months, he doesn't listen, thinks I'm overreacting. Tonight I told him that what he's doing is abusive, now he won't talk to me and wants time apart. Did I overreact?




UPDATE:  Thanks for all your replies. They came in so quickly I didn't have time to respond to many of them, but I decided to have a conversation with my husband about this. Since he's not talking to me I sent it over text. I told him that I'm sorry for blowing up like I did, but that I'm not willing to compromise my emotional and physical boundaries, and that if he wants things to work out he needs to stop the unwanted touch, and stop swearing at me and calling me names when he's angry (sorry I didn't mention the swearing in my post, I wanted some perspective on the teasing aspects of our relationship without everyone focusing on that-- but in short, he thinks calling me a bitch or asshole when we have a disagreement is just part of his personality and I'm overreacting and not accepting him for who he is). 
He sent me back a short text saying that he has no interest in talking to someone who is always biting his head off, and to leave him alone. So I left it at that. I'm going to respect his wishes, and while I don't have the means to hire a lawyer, I'm making plans to go back home if things turn out poorly over the next week or two. I've gotten tired of not being able to have a rational discussion with him about anything without him getting angry or making fun of me, so I've been becoming more assertive about these things over the last few weeks, and it's caused a lot of conflict and problems-- I wouldn't be surprised if he comes to me soon and says he wants a divorce. But I'm slowly making my peace with that, it hurts that he doesn't care more about me or this marriage, but I haven't been happy in a long time, and I'm slowly realizing that I would be better off alone than with someone who won't listen or respect my feelings. I had already suspected this was an unhealthy situation, but truthfully part of me still believed him that I was crazy and overreacting, so posting here really helped me to cement the feeling that I need to establish strong boundaries and find a healthier relationship-- either with my husband, or someone else down the road. Thanks again for your help. 



UPDATE 2: I was feeling bad earlier today, so I took my daughter to the store to buy some lemon-aide and treats. This isn't something I normally do without my husband, I was just feeling poorly and thought getting out would help, which it did. When my husband came home from work and realized I had gone to the store without asking him, he called me a psycho and told me he wants a divorce. He told me to book a plane ticket back home. So that's what I'm going to do. I apologized for going to the store, it was an impulse decision and he's right that we really don't have money for frivolous things, but he wouldn't accept my apology. I'm feeling really bad about everything right now, I think I also had a part in this happening, I don't handle the finances and didn't really think about what I was doing until he got angry about it. But my mom is letting me move back home for awhile, so I'm going to take time to heal before reflecting more on this situation. "
"My [27 f] husband [30 m] caught his sister [27 f] secretly recording our conversation at family dinner, she admitted to it and claims it's so she can ""psycho analyze"" us but who knows


So yeah, last weekend we were at my in laws' house for family dinner, and half way through my husband grabs his sister's phone from the table and loudly asks why she was recording. Everyone at the table became quiet except for MIL, she jumped to SIL's defense by saying my husband must be mistaken, but he wasn't because her phone happened to be unlocked and in one second he showed us it was indeed recording and it had been since she had arrived. 

Then SIL snatched her phone back and told us that she would be recording the rest of dinner as well since she plans on  getting it ""psycho analyzed."" I don't know what she means by that, or why she would say or do that, but the way she said it made it seem like a threat. She then put her phone back on the table to record the rest of dinner. As with most family dinners, I was rather stoned at the time so I didn't really react beyond just remaining quiet from that moment on. My in laws decided to do what they usually do, which is just ignore it, but my husband was very open about how pissed he was. He argued with her to stop recording and she refused to stop or apologize. We left right after dinner since she was still recording and my husband was upset about that and with his parents. His parents wouldn't even talk about it. Today when he called his mom she laughed it off like it was no big deal. He even told her that what SIL did was illegal in our state, it totally is, and she still didn't care. 

One of the things that bothers me the most about this is that my SIL has a long history of really sketchy behavior. In the past she has actually bragged to me about blackmailing people before, so who knows what she is going to do with it. She also asked her parents a bunch of loaded questions before we knew she was recording and they said some stuff that would look bad for them. I think they were the main target of her malice since she only asked them the controversial questions, but if she's willing to do that to her parents who knows what she would do to us. Maybe I'm paranoid but I'm fairly certain nothing good can come from this, and she probably won't stop recording since she lives with no consequences. 

I love family dinner, especially when I'm baked, but my inlaws clearly don't see anything wrong with her behavior and I hate feeling uncomfortable so I don't really want to go back. My husband agrees with me. I'm afraid that if my husband and I just stop going to family dinner my inlaws will solely blame me for ruining their relationship with their son since they already blame my nonexistent relationship with my abusive parents on me for not forgiving them. Like I said, my husband tried talking to his mom today about it and that got us nowhere, what do we do next?? Should I try to talk to her myself? Should my husband and I try talking to her together? It can't be just my husband, he doesn't want to, and they argue constantly. Could this be more of a phone call thing? We can't really suggest therapy, she's already seeing one since she was depressed and suicidal earlier this year. 

Tl;dr: my SIL tried to secretly record our conversation and refused to stop, my inlaws don't think it's anything to be upset about, I don't want to go back but I'm afraid the inlaws will hate me, what do you think is the best way to handle this situation because it's stressing me out "
"I (22M) just called the cops on my mom (46F) and she was baker acted. I feel SO guilty.


This just happened about 40 minutes ago.  My family and I have been without power all day because of hurricane Irma here in Florida.  Obviously we are all stressed out already and a heated situation broke out between my mom and my step sister.  They have been arguing back and forth for about a month now about a boy my sister has been dating who is 18 and she is 15.  My sister talks to my mom like she is garbage when they're arguing, and it takes a lot out of my mom.  I try and support her when stuff like this happens, but tonight I guess I couldn't.  This has never been diagnosed but I'm pretty sure my mom has fairly bad anxiety and depression.  Tonight after the argument she starts yelling and screaming about how nobody respects her how she should just leave and 'end it all'.  This scared me even though it isn't the first time she's said things like this.  


After trying to reason with her for about 30 minutes she becomes upset and locks herself in the bathroom.  I walk over and sit beside the door asking her to open it, telling her I'm scared she's going to do something harmful to herself.  She refuses over and over again.  She stars saying things like 'nobody respects me so I'll just leave.  I'll just take care of it tonight.""  This horrified me even more now that there is a locked door between the two of us.  I beg and plead for her to open the door for about 30 minutes more before I tell her to promise me she won't hurt herself and that I'll leave her alone if she does.  She agrees and I go to my room for the night.  Ten minutes later my youngest step sister comes into my room and tells me she can't take it anymore, she's still threatening to kill herself.  I go back to the bathroom door and try to reason with her to open it again.  She becomes increasingly erratic and continues to refuse. 


At this point I threaten to call the cops because I am scared for her life and for my sisters having to witness this.  She tells me to do it because she doesn't know what to do anymore.  I really don't want to call them, but I had no idea what to do. I love her so much and I just didn't want to lose her.  I end up calling the cops and she exits he bathroom while I'm on the phone with the operator.  The operator asks if she can talk to my mom if she's calm enough and I let them talk.  The operator sends two deputies out to my house and they take my statement and one of my step sisters statements.  The deputies end up deciding to take her to a nearby hospital for 72 hours based on the baker act.  My mom is nearby talking to the other deputy while I'm off to the side with the other, so I can't hear what she's saying.  I have no idea if she voluntarily went or not.  They put her in handcuffs because they said it was required to be in their vehicle.  It broke my heart.  I told her I only called because I loved her.  I didn't to lose her.  She said she knows and that she just didn't know what to do.  


The deputy told me we could contact her in 3 hours, but my step dad said he didn't think they'd actually let us talk to her when we called.  Then I googled to see if they actually would let us talk to her when I called and all I got was a bunch of links telling me that the baker act is inhumane and an awful  thing to do to someone against their will.  I feel so guilty.  I feel so worried for my mom who is so sheltered and just wants a calm life.  I put her in cuffs and humiliated her.  I don't know what to do right now.  


I'm sorry this is so poorly written, I'm just a mess right now.  My mom and I are very close.  

TL;DR:  My mother and I are very close.  She was stressed out and argued with my step sisters and I about how nobody respects or cares about her.  She locked herself in the bathroom and threatened to kill herself.  This isn't the first time something like this has happened so I called the cops and they took her away in handcuffs due to the baker act.  I feel awful and guilty about all of it. "
"My [M 30s] wife [F 20s] put an ingredient she knows I can't eat into a soup today.


Sort of unsure as to how to approach this.

I've had GERD and LPR (chronic acid reflux due to hypotensive LES) for over 3 years. I've got one more test to complete before being eligible for surgery. In the meantime, I've been trying my very best to manage this horrible condition with lifestyle and diet modifications.

There are three main things I can't consume: tomatoes, garlic, and lemon. My symptoms go crazy if I eat any amount of these.

I genuinely respect my wife for putting up with my tomato and garlic free cooking and appreciate that she tries to keep it in mind if she's cooking for all of us (our son included). Often she'll make something for herself that includes garlic and/or tomatoes, so I don't feel so bad.

In any case, I have been managing quite well by eliminating these ingredients, so it's frustrating if I ever do have a bad flare up, **like I am currently**. So, just a few minutes ago I told my wife that my reflux hasn't been this bad in a long time. After another minute or so she said ""oh, it is probably that garlic I put in the soup"".

I'm not being a sook, nor as reddit likes to say ""butt hurt"". I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm curious as to what others would do in my shoes. Cheers.
  
**EDIT**: I asked her why she did it. She admitted that she believes people are ""psychologically influenced by what they know/don't know about what they eat"".  She apologized and said she felt bad. I'm a bit shook, but otherwise fine, and the flare up symptoms (burning, mucus, regurgitation, and aspiration through right ear) have dissipated after having skipped supper and taken some extra Gaviscon Advance. Thanks for your concerns!

**EDIT 2**: Wow, the response to this was unexpected and rather alarming. As I sit here early the next morning reading your comments with a full-feeling head and ears that are ringing as though I went to a heavy metal concert last night (my reflux causes tinnitus), a lot of them are really opening my eyes to the dynamics of my relationship with my wife. The same mentality has prevailed in other very important areas of our life, and the fact that I've pointed it out before to no avail is, well, case in point. Thanks again.

"Me [17F] with my brother's [28M] fiancée [25F]. She is the meanest girl in the world and my brother doesn't stand up for us against her.


[removed]"
"Me [27F] with my partner [28M]. His whole family is going to move wherever we move and I'm not happy about it.


For the record, I think the way I feel about this is probably going to make me seem like a jerk, and I wish I felt otherwise.

My partner of 7 years, Mark (28M), and I (27F) met in the state we grew up in and that our families live in. About 5 years ago we moved to a different state together which is only a couple states away. We see our families in person about twice a year, sometimes more.

His family consists of his parents, and his older sister (40sF) and her family (husband and a few kids). I get along with them all quite well and they like me. However, I think our relationship is good *because* of the distance.

His mom is sweet, but she can also have a very intense personality. She's borderline. I find her very draining to talk to for long periods of time. His parents are also very religious, where we are not. I get along with his sister, but she can have a fairly abrasive/confrontational personality. She has apparently mellowed out over the years and used to be much worse. Again, she is intense. I do like hanging out with her for shorter periods of time.

Now, you have probably noticed my boyfriend's family members seem pretty okay. Nothing terrible like some of the stories you hear on this sub. The real problem lies with me. I'm extremely introverted (yes, I realize people are known to use this as an excuse to be an asshole), and I have social anxiety. I can usually deal with this pretty well and have an active social life. However, when I'm with my boyfriend's family I find it absolutely exhausting because I feel like I can't be my true self (not sure if that makes sense). I find them difficult to talk to and relate to, and really appreciate the boundaries that our distance provides.

Mark and I have been looking to purchase a house somewhere in this state (looking at several different areas). His sister recently told us her family's plan: they want to relocate to this state and buy a house in or near whatever community we move to. They then want to convince their parents to do the same (the parents are retired). We would all be living in the same city. My heart sank at the thought of this. I know it’s so selfish, but I absolutely do not want this to happen. I would be okay with them living a few hours away and us seeing them once a month or so, but I don’t want to see them all every week. I love the quiet life Mark and I have made here. I was so excited about buying a house together and settling somewhere together. Now I want to put it off as long as possible.

That’s the selfish reason, but I also have a more rational reason. I feel really uncomfortable with two different families basing their living situation on where Mark and I choose to live. I think we will feel stuck there forever, even if we eventually want to move again. I think his sister would be pissed if we ended up moving again, if she is basing her house purchase on where we go. The whole situation makes me anxious and nauseous.

I have not told Mark how I feel yet. I feel like too much of an asshole. His parents are aging and have had health problems. His sister has kids, and I’m sure he would want to be closer to them. Is this something I should just “suck up” because there’s no way to be against it without being a massive tool?

EDIT: I feel like I need to clarify a few things. I was trying to make this as brief as possible but I left out some important details. While I'm introverted, my boyfriend is not. He's social and doesn't get anxious. While he is fine to be far away from his family (very independent), I think there would be a lot of positives for him for his family to be close by (his parents have had health issues and he has felt bad about being far away, he would probably like to watch his niece and nephew grow up, etc.). I also think he would be 100% cool with it if my family wanted to move nearby.
