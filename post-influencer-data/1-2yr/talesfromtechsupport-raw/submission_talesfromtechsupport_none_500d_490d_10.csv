0,"The moment that elevated mum from $user to $admin


Hey TFTS. LTL;FTP.


Like most of you here, I too have parents whom are largely tech-illiterate. but over the last two years, I've been making a conscious effort to get my parents (especially mum) to understand computers better. 


I'm a big believer of the ol' *give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day, teach him how to fish, and he can have food for life* mentality. So rather than showing mum how to resolve her every problem, we go through a process of:


* *what do you think is wrong?* 
* and *how are you going to solve it?*



Now admittedly, things do get incredibly frustrating in this process, and it can often take ~1/2 hour up to 1 hour to resolve issues. **BUT**, it has slowly been working.



So today, mum came to me with a problem, and as usual, seemed to blow it way out of proportion.



&gt; $mum: My phone is broken.

&gt; $me: What do you mean?

&gt; $mum: The camera doesn't work.

&gt; $me: What do you mean exactly?

&gt; $mum: When I go to the camera app, it says *connection cannot be establised*

&gt; $me: So have you tried anything to resolve it? (*insert smirky face*)

&gt; $mum: I turned it off and on again. But that didn't work.. 

&gt; $me: uh huh.

&gt; $mum: So then I booted the phone into recovery mode. 

&gt; $me: (*queue disbelief*)

&gt; $mum: And then I wiped the cache partition.

&gt; $me: (*sustained disbelief*)

&gt; $mum: But when I rebooted the phone, it still didn't work. So I thought the problem might be larger than that. 

&gt; $me: ... 

&gt; $mum: So I went onto several forums, and a lot of other people describing similar problems said it turned out to be a hardware fault.

&gt; $me: How the hell did you know how to do that? 

&gt; $mum: I googled it. 

&gt; $me: (*queue jaw drop*) So..I guess your phone is broken.

&gt; $mum: Yeah. That's what I told you in the beginning.



This is the same person whom two years ago didn't even know how to use the volume buttons on her phone - now troubleshooting all on her own... 


Mum, I am so proud of you. You've now been granted admin privileges."
