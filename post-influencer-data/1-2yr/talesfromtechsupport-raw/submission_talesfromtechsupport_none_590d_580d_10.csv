0,"That time I helped automate 20 people out of a job


Since the day I started at this small company I noticed their workstations were horribly out of date and reaching end of life for support and depreciation. I worked with a developer to get our in-house software to run on new machines with much more CPU+GPU to run everything. This was only in an effort to prevent or avoid being backed into obsolescence, but the development team saw an opportunity to optimize the application.

Fast forward about a year when the project is complete and the application can now finish its processing in 10-40x less time depending on difficulty. We have everyone on new systems that run like a dream and everyone is thrilled with how much more we can do in a day. The department head sends a wonderful email about the new time it takes to process.

The backlog of work is now quickly shrinking for this team and their department head has to stop calling in per-diem workers. Slowly, we fire employees as there's not enough work for them.

Fast forward another year and we've fired some 20 people (about 27% of our company). I was friends with many of them.

I still feel bad 5 years later."
