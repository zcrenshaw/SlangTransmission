0,"If my thing breaks, I'll just throw it away and you can replace it under the warranty, right?


I wish I could post the screen shot in this thread, otherwise I don't think that anyone will believe me!

I work for a large company who sells popular phones and also sells and services a certain brand of headphones (please try not to throw me under the buss).

Here is the reenactment:

Cus=customer

Peach=yours truly

Cus:...(after introduction) ....I went ahead and threw them out since they are covered under warranty and I have the receipt

Peach.........

Peach: We would need the defective product. We do not simply replace them at someones will

Cus: It doesnt say that in the warranty

Peach:  The word 'replace' is used several times as well as the phrase 'swap out'. No warranty gives you another device if you throw out the original

Cus: So what do I do here?

Peach: Can you retrieve them from the trash?

Cus: Possibly but I am a music producer and its important for me to have these ASAP so it will be a huge time inconvenience and a financial one for me to have to wait until you receive my broken ones and then ship it back out

Peach: We dont wait for your broken ones to be received prior to shipping out a replacement, we immediately ship the replacement and if your defective ones aren't received then there is a charge imposed. What I recommend is that you purchase another pair, since you need them immediately then try to find the dumpster pair and send them in. Once you receive your replacement, you can return the brand new ones that you just purchased for a full refund.

Cus: This is completely unacceptable-I will be going to corporate &amp; the media about this as well as purchasing your competitors product form now on!

........scene......

I am still shocked that this person is real"
