0,"Caught red handed


So I work at a school when one day at the start of the year I get a call from a Year 1 teacher. She describes a common problem that is easily fixed by reinstalling the app so I head over to do that. When I get to the classroom the teacher has her hands full with the kids, so I just give her a smile and a nod and head straight to her computer trying not to be a distraction. But being the start of the year, the little ones have never seen me before and are curious...

&gt;*Kid1:* ""Hi""  
&gt;*Me:* ""Hello""

&gt;*Kid2:* ""Who are you?""  
&gt;*Me:* ""I'm the IT guy""

&gt;*Kid1:* ""What are you doing?""  
&gt;*Me:* ""I'm fixing-""  
&gt;*Kid3 from the other side of the room:* ""HE'S STEALING THE INTERNET!!!!"""
