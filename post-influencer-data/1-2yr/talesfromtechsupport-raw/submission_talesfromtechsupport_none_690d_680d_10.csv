0,"I have a user trying to get me fired for doing my job.


Blood pressure is so spiked right now from being so pissed I can feel my heart. Neat.

[This is technically a continuation from these stories. Same supervisor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4zxoxe/i_cant_sleep_this_weekend_because_of_this_incident)

Came in this morning to a ticket that many users were unable to use a web based application that they use to log tickets for their departments.

I waited for user availability, asked nicely, then would go through the standard troubleshooting routines.

Turns out the application had corrupted something in Firefox. I cleared out the appdata folders and they were good to go. Developers swear it's not the application, even though it's only that application affected, and all the users had the same issues at the same time.

I thought, cool, they're back up, users are happy, I'll just monitor them and ask them to let me know if it happens again.

One person wasn't happy, of course. The b**** supervisor from hell.

My manager had me call him five minutes ago and he said she had emailed him and all of the higher ups (**all** of them. He sent me a copy. All of the management people that you never want to see on the same email) saying I had been extremely unprofessional, that I had been expected to be there at 8:30AM, and that it was our fault that things were out of date and broken.  


1) I was extremely professional and accommodating. This is all logged in the chat program and emails.

2) I arrived at 8AM. I never heard from or saw the supervisor. In fact all users but one started at 9:30, so if she had grabbed me at 8:30, nothing would be different.

3) I had discovered none of the issue was due to out of date software. In fact when I discovered the solution I had emailed her and CC'd everyone involved what it was.

She also said that I had left the office at 4PM... When I have my timesheet and everything logged that I stayed until 4:30, even though I had worked through my break. No emails, no calls, *nothing* saying they were looking for me.

This b**** also has ""slowness"" issues every single day with her laptop. I've been watching her system performance all week. I have the reports showing not only is it fine, but it's in the top systems. I hope she tries to use that against me too, then I can forward the reports and nuke this from orbit.

CYA folks. Log. Everything.

This is why even if they're in the same office I default to chat and email.

This is probably going to turn into an ongoing situation. Stay tuned."
