0,"The custom convertible laptop.


So…  This just happened, as I was writing my other story for today.  I don’t usually share stories from my current job, this one is the exception.

Recently one of our offices received new computers; 12.5” notebooks and 12.5” convertible hybrids.

A user walks in with a laptop that is in two pieces.  He explains that his convertible (the kind that is a tablet with an attachable keyboard) is broken.  As I come to the realization that I issued this user a notebook, NOT a convertible, he drops the device on my desk.  (That’s right; he somehow tore the lid from the base of the notebook thinking that he got a convertible.)  I tell him that this wasn’t a convertible, it was a notebook.  It WAS a notebook, now it’s a paperweight.  Somehow this is beyond his comprehension.  His response was that his other coworker got a convertible and that no one told him his wasn’t so he thought it was stuck and he need to pull harder.  I ask him how hard he pulled and if that didn’t give him some indication that it was not a convertible, I receive a blank stare in return.

After some back and forth, I asked him to leave my office.  I could not take it anymore; I did not want to lose my composure.  On his way out of my office, he asks when he will get a replacement.

I take this to my boss, who asks me how long it will take to fix and when can I get this user a replacement.  He apparently sees nothing wrong with this situation.  I am giving this user the biggest heaviest laptop I have.

This is why I drink.
