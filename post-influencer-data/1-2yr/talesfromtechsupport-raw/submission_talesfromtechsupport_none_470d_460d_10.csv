I once drove for 3 hours through heavy holiday traffic to type ctrl\-D to get a server to boot. On arrival there was nowhere to park except the directors spot. The job was very urgent according to the customer so I parked up in his spot and carried on into the building.

5 minutes later stood in front of the server and looking at the server terminal there was no output. Customer was yabbering on to one of his colleagues and not paying any attention. I held down ctrl\-D on the terminal and cycled the terminal power.  Bingo , two seconds later the server is booting. ""What did you do"" shouts the customer when he noticed the server coming back to life. Pressed ctrl\-D and power cycled the terminal like I asked you to do over the phone.

I didn't get to hear his reply because at that point the director came in shouting the odds at full volume that some one had parked in his spot. That'll be me, I'm just leaving!"
