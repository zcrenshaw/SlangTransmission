0,"Best pun of my career


Hello all!  

As the title states I just got to use the best pun in my career!  

I got a call from one of our receptionists saying that some of the keys on her keyboard are getting stuck. So I grab a spare keyboard just in case and get over to her office.  

When I get there the first thing I see on her desk is a (mostly eaten) bagel with jelly on it. I bet you can all see where this is going...  

&gt;Me: Were you eating that at your desk?  
*The user nods taking a drink of her coffee*  

I smile and sit down at her desk and start popping off a few keys. Sure enough there was jelly under some of the keys. I look up and I can see the receptionist is already red in the face from embarrassment. That is when I got to deliver my best one liner...  

&gt;Me: Well, it looks like your keyboard is.... *puts on sunglasses* jammed.  

I love puns. "
