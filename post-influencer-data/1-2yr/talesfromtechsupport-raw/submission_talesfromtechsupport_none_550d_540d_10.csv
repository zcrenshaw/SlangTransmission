*This just happened.*


*I work in a small software company.*

$Me *is myself.*

$Sec *is the secretary in the company, and is responsible for generic administrative office stuff and HR-related things.*

$Software *is a webapp we use to punch in/out to track our work hours, which I had problems logging into this morning.*


**$Me:** Good morning, $Sec. I'm having some problems logging into $Software. It seems their server is down. Could you punch me in manually once it's up again?

**$Sec:** Don't worry. I can just do it for you at my computer, right now.

**$Me:** Thanks, but unfortunately that won't work, because their server is currently down.

**$Sec:** How about you use this computer then? *points*


&gt; The computer she is pointing at, is a small unit with a touchscreen, right by the entrance to our office. It's main purpose is to be used as a dedicated machine for $Software. I can see the login window is preloaded on the screen.


**$Me:** It won't work on that computer either, because the server for $Software is down. In fact, it won't work on any computers until the server is online again. All I'm asking, is if you can manually add it in for me, once it's back up again.

**$Sec:** Why do you have to make things so difficult? You know you can use your phone to use $Software as well, right?

**$Me:** The server is down. It won't work.

&gt; $Sec huffs and puffs, obviously annoyed by my incompetence, and goes over to the computer she was previously pointing at. She enters her login info, then turns around facing me, while her finger is hovering over the login button.

**$Sec:** I'll show you how SIMPLE it is, since you don't understand how $Software works!

&gt; $Sec presses the login button and it loads the default Chrome ""no internet connection"" page.

**$Sec:** Oh, looks like the server is down.


*Internally screaming and without saying a word, I return to my office for an intense facepalming session.*"
