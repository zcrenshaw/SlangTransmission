0,"But you sent me an email!


Just happened a few moments ago. Every time this coworker has to ask me something, I take a deep breath and get ready for whatever ridiculous conversation we're going to have. Last week one of my coworkers took over the company's twitter page. I emailed him the username and password which everyone can find from our database but I was trying to make it easy for him. I'm surprised it took a week for something like this to happen.  
 

$coworker: Did you change the password for our twitter account? I tried logging in for an hour this morning!   
$me: No, why would I do that?  
$cw: I can't log in.  

$me: OK, well I didn't change the password.  
$cw: Well, you sent me the email with the account info last week.  
$me: I did, I just coped it from  our database which *everyone* has access to. If you can't login, you can ask for a password reset and then go talk to $othercoworker who controls that email. It's easy.     
$cw: Yeah, but you sent me the email with the login.  
$me: Yes, that's true. But I don't have access to the twitter account email. Go talk to her.  
$cw: Why would I talk to her? You sent me the email with the account information.  
$me: Yes, but if you can't log in, you should try to reset or recover the password. An email will be sent to the email account associated with the twitter account. I don't have access to that email, but $othercoworker does. Go talk to her.  
$cw: But you sent me the original email!  
$me: I **don't have** access to that email account.   
$cw: Yeah, but you sent me the email, can't you just give me the password?  

This went on for a few more moments until he finally went over to my other coworker who was 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) away. The problem? He wasn't typing in the right password. Only 3 days until I'm on vacation.
