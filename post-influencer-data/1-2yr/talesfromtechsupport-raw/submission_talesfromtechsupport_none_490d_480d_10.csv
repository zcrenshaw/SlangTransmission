Ok fellow TFTSers, this just happened a few hours ago.

So our hosting service was forced to do an emergency maintenance, and all VPNs were going to be downed for about 2 hours, between 9am and 11am.

They called us at 8:30, making us aware of the situation and apologizing profusely. Additionally, they have a 5 minute window where they can push us up to a gig of our docs for the meantime.

Upper Management was having a monthly meeting, with the Office Manager giving an 'important' presentation about core values or synergy or some other time waster.

I know that most likely the OM had her docs stored remotely, so I put the host support on hold and call up to the conference room.

2 rings, then hangup. No voicemail.

Call again.

One ring, hangup, no voicemail.

So I page on the intercom 'OM please call the IT dept, this is important'.

2 minutes go by, no answer.

So now 3 minutes left and I run upstairs to the meeting room (the meeting isn't scheduled to go live for another 20 mins or so), and wave down the OM. I was planning to tell her: ""The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have a 5 minute window to get them for you.""

She angrily waves me away and keeps talking to the room.

I slide up next to the podium and this exchange occurs:

Fhtagnyatta: The VPN...

OM: Look, whatever it is it can wait, I'm giving a presentation.

Fhtagnyatta: The sched...

OM: We have a lot of ground to cover so we started early, if you interrupt me again that will be a verbal. Sit down and wait until we have a pause.

Fhtagnyatta: Fine...

So I get my stale donut and lukewarm coffee and sit.

And wait.

Synergy... core values... encapture... life branding...

And wait.

Eventually she goes to open her presentation, and lo and behold 'Server not found'.

She glares angrily at me and waves me up.

OM: What is going...

Fhtagnyatta: The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have (checks phone) a negative eight minute window to get them for you..

OM glares at me like I just stomped on a kitten.

She sent me away, and I'm scheduled to meet with the president later this afternoon.

I might be without a job because she wouldn't let me say 23 words.

Of course this is all my fault..."
