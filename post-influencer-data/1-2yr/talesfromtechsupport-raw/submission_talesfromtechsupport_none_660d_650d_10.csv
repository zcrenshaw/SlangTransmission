0,"the site is logging me out immediately after logging in.


from when I did phone support for a hosting provider a few years back.

$me: Thanks for calling $SupportCO etc

$woman: Every time I log into the site I am logged out immediately. My husband needs me to make a change immediately and your site's broken.

$me: I hope not, I haven't had an issue and we haven't had any other calls, let's troubleshoot a bit. What happens when you log in?

$woman: It accepts my password and after redirecting me to my account page it logs me back out and sends me to the front page.

$me: Ok, sounds like possibly a browser issue, let's try some stuff

We check cookies settings etc, try some other browsers, nothing is working she says the same thing every time.

$me: wow this is just bizarre, can you humor me and just log in one more time and just tell me each thing you're doing no matter how small or mundane the point seems.

$woman: *long sigh* yes. I visit your site. I click login. I enter my user name. I enter my password. I click login.  It logs me in. I click ""My Account."" It says ""Hi Tim, if you're not Tim, click here"" I ""click here.""

$me: Wait don't click that, that's what is logging you out,  that's for if you somehow found yourself in the wrong account...

$woman: I'm not Tim

$me: No, but your husband is; he set this up.

$woman: Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. *Click*"
