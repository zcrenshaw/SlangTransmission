0,"You have a bucket.


You have a bucket almost full of water. You have a second bucket, the same size, also nearly full of water.

You want to pour all the water from one bucket into the other. Maybe it's dark or you're just not paying attention. You start to pour one bucket into the other bucket. Naturally, it starts to overflow, and your shoes get wet.

You call the bucket company, upset at them for not making buckets that are infinite in size. You ask why you are no longer able to pour any more water into your full bucket. Also, you're mad because your shoes are wet, and that's embarrassing. You demand they send you a free pair of shoes.

The bucket company assures you that you only need to pour out some water from the full bucket to make room for the other one. Some of it's probably dirty river water or something. Go pour some water out into the river, they say, so that you can put more, better water in the bucket you like.

You pour an extremely small amount of old crappy water into the river, grumbling the whole time. You see that there is now a tiny amount of extra space left in the bucket.

You go back to your other, almost full bucket, and try to pour the entire thing into the first one again.

Furious, you call the company asking why this didn't work, and for another pair of free shoes.

In case you wanted to know what the call I just had at work was like."
