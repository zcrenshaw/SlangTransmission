0,"Your instructions are stupid. I'll keep doing things the way I've always done them. What do you mean I can't open tickets anymore?! And why am I getting charged for it?!


We have a pretty simple system. You ask for **something** and you get **something**. With me so far? It really is that simple for the user. We have to do some crazy routing on our end depending on what **something** is but that is an entirely different story. 

There is also a big button that say click here if you want **something** for someone else. With a giant red warning underneath that says ""Hey if you don't use that big button right above the **something** you ask for will be FOR YOU"". 

We even have a ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T MEAN YOU WANT IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE?  YOU ALREADY HAVE **SOMETHING** if the system detects you already have **something**. 

So enter *user A*. This user supports many other users. The department might get a lot of turn over because every month they get at least 1 new person. Or maybe they're expanding? Who knows not my problem. 

Like clock work the 2nd Monday of every month we get a ticket. ""I asked for **something** for new hire but they never got it. Please fix."" I'm not kidding. Literally every 2nd Monday of every month for the last year or so. Can you guess what went wrong? Let me give you a hint...it has something to do with someone not using the giant button and not reading the 2 different warnings or popups. 

I had gotten really tired of sending *user A* the same email every month...""Please use the button to ask for **something** for someone else. We'll send ticket over to finance to swap the charges"". That email also contains very detailed step by step instructions. The rest of my team had also gotten tired of hearing from *user A* so we decided to not help this time(with manager/director backup). 

We disabled the ability for *user A* to submit tickets. They must call the help desk for tickets now. We also didn't forward the current ticket to finance. We sent *user A* a strongly worded email that basically said ""Look you do this EVERY month. We told you HOW to do this the correct way for a year. If you still can't figure it out you're on your own and all these charges will fall on you."" Attach the last 12 month's worth of tickets. CC *user A*'s boss. 

*User A* must have not noticed her boss CCed on the email because we get a nasty email back. ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T OPEN TICKETS ANYMORE?! AND WHY AM I GETTING CHARGED FOR IT?! DO YOU KNOW WHO I SUPPORT?! YOU WILL FIX THIS NOW OR MY BOSS WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS."" Insert other comments about how stupid the system is and how incompetent my team is and other non professional language. Email was also largely in caps. 

We didn't get around to responding until after lunch but as it turns out we don't need to respond anymore. 

*User A*'s boss has apparently responded. ""I apologize for the behavior of *user A*. Please don't let her behavior affect the wonderful support you provide to our department. *User B* will now be responsible for interfacing with your team to get **something** for our new hires. Please grant *User B* the permissions *user A* previously had.  I've read through your directions you send *user A* over and tried it out. It worked as expected. *User B* will be using those directions to complete her work. Also please see *ticket #* for terminating *user A*'s network access. 

We killed *user A*'s network account with pleasure. "
