0,"Why would you sell me an obsolete system? ???


This comes from the wonderful world of home security systems customer support. My coworker fields this one.

$CW is coworker.  
$GOG is grumpy old guy. 

$CW: ""thank you for calling Blah Blah Blah Security,  how may I help you?""

 $GOG: *Gives name, address, password, blood sample of first born for verification purposes.*  ""Well my system isn't accepting codes and won't turn on or off. I think it started after the storm that came through last night.""

$CW: ""Did lightning strike your house or close by?""

$GOG: ""yes""

$CW: ""I see. Based on the age of the system, it probably took a surge. We're unable to get replacement parts anymore,  so you'll need an upgrade. I can get someone in sales to call you with a price.""

$GOG: ""Well can't you just send someone out to fix it?""

$CW: ""We certainly can, but as it's obsolete equipment it's unlikely they can repair it. You'd still be billed for the service call.""

*This is where the customer gets irate*

$GOG: **WHY WOULD YOU SELL ME AN OBSOLETE SYSTEM???**


$CW: *soft voice* ""Well Sir, it *was* brand new in 1986."""
1,"I don't have a manager.


I used to work for a particularly large ISP doing tech support. One day the guy working next to me was dealing with a particularly rude business customer. The business customers were usually treated like kings but this guy was having a particularly hard time even getting a word in. Eventually he put up his hand to motion the supervisor come talk to the customer.

Right then the owner of the company happened to be walking by with another one of the execs. I've met the guy a few times at the company social events and he is a really down to earth employee friendly boss. He asked what the issue was with his customer and after it was explained he took the headset and picked up the line.

After listening for about 4-5 minutes he said very flatly ""That's never going to happen, especially not when you have an attitude like a 13 year old girl."" Again listening for a minutes before he said ""I don't have a manager. I own this company and I don't have to listen to this s..t from an a..hole like you and neither do my employees. I'm terminating your account with us.""

He hung up and I watched him disable this guys account and add a note to the file. ""Customer is an a..hole. Do not reinstate account - Boss"". Then he just handed back the headset and carried on about his day.

edit: since so many people have asked the issue the guy was going nuts about was something to do with a delay in testing for a fault on his line; something that is done by the phone company and not by the ISP. We literally have nothing to do with it other than submitting the request for testing to them. "
