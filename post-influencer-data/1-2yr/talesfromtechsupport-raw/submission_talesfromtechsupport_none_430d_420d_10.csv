0,"Idiot doctor gave his work laptop with PHI on it to his son to use for college.


I run a small IT business about a couple miles up the road from a big regional hospital.  A couple times a year we recover lost/stolen PC's that belong to them.  This one has the best origin story so far.

A kid brought in his Mac which needed a significant amount of work that he can't afford.  So his generous dad gave him his old work computer to use.  He brought it in to have us wipe it for him and make it like new.  Well, this ""old"" computer is practically brand new and had an asset tag as well as encryption software for the local hospital on it.

Standard procedure is to remove asset tags when retiring equipment, so whenever we see one, we call the company to verify that it has in fact been retired, not just stolen.  I called the hospital help desk, and surprise, surprise this laptop is still active and is assigned to not just any doctor, but a department head.  As is typical when we recover these, someone from the IT dept showed up in our office 10 minutes later to take possession of it.

For those who don't know, losing equipment with protected health information on it is a serious issue.  Lucky for this doctor, it was encrypted, so isn't a reportable loss, but he's going to be in deep shit tomorrow when he gets to work.

TLDR - Doctors are complete idiots when it comes to computers and often common sense in general."
