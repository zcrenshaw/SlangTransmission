0,"Unicorns do exist.


Some time ago, I got possibly the best bug report ticket ever filed.

A piece of software I'd written would completely crap out under extremely
specific circumstances, upon encountering web pages written in a way I thought
completely insane. What I naively didn't realize is that, due to the
extraordinary leniency of web browsers in parsing invalid HTML, a lot of web
pages are written in a *completely* insane way.

So, one user happened to run the software on one of these little HTML
monstrosities, and it broke. An average user, if they would even consider such
extreme measures as *reporting* a bug, would write something like:

    Expected behavior: It works
    Actual behavior: It doesn't
    Reproduction steps: Visit a website

I've seen way too many tickets like this. This user wasn't an ""average"" user
though. This guy was a *unicorn*.

The bug report included **a link to a tiny page hosted on a VPS of his that would cause the bug to occur**. He had
enough knowledge and did enough testing on his own to *write a minimal example*
that still triggered it.

I still have that ticket printed out and pinned to the wall right above my
desk.
