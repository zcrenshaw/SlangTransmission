0,"The files of the VP are missing. Who do we contact? IT? No. The Supervisor of IT? No. The VP of IT? No. The the vp over the server admin? No. Lets call the CIO. Who also does not contact IT.


So the EVP over sales recently got a new PC and had immediate issues with it. We, in the IT Support area, never knew about the issues. 

Today I get an email demanding my attention at a meeting in the main corporate headquarters 10 miles down the road from the IT facility. I drive over there and immediately walk into the meeting 10 minutes early.

All of the execs, VPs, higher ups, supervisors, and I believe one guy eating popcorn all showed up to watch me get roasted. 

The meeting started out very confrontational with everything directed at me about some issue I had no clue about and some VP who I never met who was pissed her issue was not resolved. Ill skip the preamble and go straight to the head desk. 

After proving beyond a shadow of a doubt, by calling the CIO directly and putting him on speakerphone, I took a look at the issue. 

&gt; $DVP = Dumb VP  
&gt; $Me = Algernop Krieger

&gt; $ME - So you are missing files since getting your new PC?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes. I thought one of the reasons we got citrix was to prevent these kinds of issues.  
&gt; $Me - I can go ahead and look at this to see where you files went. (30 seconds later) Umm... your citrix profile is completely empty. Is your username $DVP?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes, but you wont find anything in there as I don't use citrix. 

Freeze frame. Full stop. Queue the word music from ff7 after Meteor had been summoned. 

&gt; $Me - So you dont use citrix at all?  
&gt; $DVP - No. I hate it, its slow, it reduced my productivity, and generally is not a good experience to use.  
&gt; $ME - So why would your files be transferred over from one PC to another if you never used citrix?  
&gt; $DVP - Citrix makes backups of all files. You said so yourself in your email to me 3 years ago.  
&gt; $Me - Well I was not with *our company* three years ago but I do know the email you are talking about. That only counts for files inside citrix.  
&gt; $DVP - I do not understand what you mean.  

Several people around the room did not either. The more technically inclined did. Several eyes focused on me like a laser while several more started rolling. The guy eating popcorn was eating his popcorn at cartoonish levels now. 

&gt; $ME - *Does not even hide his exasperated sigh.* Imagine this. Say you did not have an office assigned to you.  
&gt; $DVP - I fail to see how...   
&gt; $ME - Just roll with it. Imagine that every day you had to go to a new desk. Also every day you carry around a box with you with all of your office supplies. Now what goes inside the box, stays in the box for you to use. What is outside the box, is lost when you change desks.  
&gt; $DVP - oooookaaaay?  
&gt; $ME - Citrix is that box. Your files are those office supplies. Because you did not use citrix, your files are still on your old PC. I would need that before I can do anything at all to assist you with it.  
&gt; $DVP - Ill have to make a call.  
&gt; $ME - Make it. 

She calls facilities who brings the old laptop up to me. I hook up an external drive to it and startsimply xfer the non appdata side of her local profile and merged it with her new local profile. Its been 6 years since my last local profile transfer. 

The CIO had made it down to the building by this time and was sitting in on the meeting... where I was performing live tech support for a much smaller crowd and the one guy still eating popcorn. (That bag was bottomless)

The local profile xfer went perfectly, I removed all old shortcuts that were to old 2010 office programs and cleaned up any duplicates she had on her PC. 

At the end $DVP questioned CIO on why this took 4 days to fix. The CIO said he send an email over to the server guys as soon as he got it. They responded with the news that she never used citrix and to contact IT to do a local profile transfer. $DVP never responded to the email and magically thought my dept would be able to read her emails. 

In the end the CIO thanked me for my work and told me he would try to get this to our team first since that was company policy. "
