"The FCC just voted to end net neutrality. But the fight isn’t over. We can get Congress to overturn their vote using a Congressional Resolution of Disapproval. It only takes a simple majority in the House and Senate. We can do this.


The FCC just voted to repeal all existing net neutrality protections. They are giving giant ISPs like Verizon and Comcast the power to control what we can see and do online with new fees, throttling, and censorship. This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. **This fight isn’t over though, there is still a clear path to victory.**

The organizations behind Battle For The Net are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via [Congressional Review Act](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43992.html) (CRA).

The CRA let’s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. **But it won’t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.**

We can’t stop now. [Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:

&gt; I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.”

**You can also text BATTLE to Text ""BATTLE"" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers.**

We can still win this. Even if you’ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to https://www.battleforthenet.com/

"TIFU by peeing all over my first kiss and immediately legging it


Not today, about 9 years ago. This story is one that stills keeps me awake at night begging for death.

**BACKSTORY**

I was 15, just an awkward high schooler from the suburbs of Melbourne. I wasn't popular by any means, but I had a few good mates and while any of us lacked a girlfriend, we were always full of bullshit stories about our sexual conquests. ""Oh, she's from another school you don't know her"", ""It was on holiday"", ""And then her friend joined in"", etc. Between us we must have fucked half the female population of Australia before hitting 16. But in reality all of us probably would have killed each other if it meant a shot at ditching the V plates.

Anyway, as the school year's finishing up and everyone's gearing up for Summer, there's talk about some of the popular kids heading out of town on a bit of a camping trip, out on this king-of-the-jocks types cousins farm. Everyone wanted in. A big piss up away from adults filled with the hottest girls from our year? Come on. If us boys could score an invite we'd finally be able to prove to each other just how much game we had.

I wasn't so naive as to actually bother asking for an invite. There was no chance of us getting a look in, we simply did not have that kind of status. But then, on the first day of the summer break, one of the guys hits me up with a text; ""we're in, pack your shit."" Fortunately for us, his much cooler sister from the year below ours had been immediately invited, and through the age old art of sibling blackmail, he'd wrestled the details out of her. It wasn't an invite per se, but we knew where to go and I doubt we rated high enough to even bother asking to leave.

Due to the nature of the impending debauchery, we had absolutely no interest in our parents catching on to the vibe of the trip and decided to get ourselves there. An hour and a half on the train out of town, a bus ride and about a thirty minute walk later we arrive at the campsite. It wasn't really a farm, it was just this massive property that made money as a sort of backup scout camp most of the year, but the owner was letting us have it for the weekend while it was empty.

We shouldn't have worried about not getting an invite, it seemed like half the year level had rocked up. Looking back I honestly have no idea how a group of 14-16 year olds got their hands on as much alcohol as they did but this thing was **stocked**. We were on some *Project X* shit, a whole bunch of sex crazy teenagers out in the sticks drinking themselves stupid. This was my first experience properly drinking, and despite my apparent long list of sexual conquests, my first time really hanging out with girls.



**THE PISSENING**

One of the great things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down social barriers and make you realise that most people are actually pretty cool once they drop the act. One of the terrible things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down urinal barriers and make you realise that no matter how recently you took a piss, you're gonna be busting for another in no time.

For example, late into the evening, I found myself sitting on a log, alone with a girl I'd never have had to balls to speak to before. A classic popular high school girl, way out of my league. But here we were, her downing vodka from the bottle, me sinking tinnies (of sweet, sugary, girly cider).

Things get a little blurry, but I remember getting increasingly closer and closer until we were making out. We were pretty awkwardly positioned on this log, and in an attempt to disguise my own overly excited log I was sort of leaning forward with my arm tucked into my stomach. My elbow was pushing up hard against my bladder. I suddenly became aware of a desperate need to pee, but I wasn't gonna be a fucking idiot by ending this action to get up and go empty the tank. I needed to be stoic. I could pee when I'm dead.

My unwelcome rock hard guest was at this point making a pretty good go of trying to break free from my pants, and this girl could tell. To my teenage delight, rather than retracting in horror she didn't seem to mind and decided to work with it. Unzip. Pull free. Spit in the hand. She knew what she was doing. But the unrelenting excitement that should have been my first handjob became sheer panic as I felt the flood gates reaching breaking point. Within milliseconds, the thought left my brain and travelled south.

Before the words ""oh shit stop"" could leave my mouth I became a human Super Soaker, releasing a veritable Niagara falls skyward into the small space between us. By the time she'd pulled away in drunken horror, my liquid fury was all over both of us. Her face was contorted into a mixture of confusion and rage, and before either one of us says anything I'm on my feet running for the hills, attempting to tuck my still flowing hose away. She's yelling after me, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"", as people look over at the chaos.

After hiding away in my tent for a short time, king-of-the-jocks less than politely told me that it was time for me to leave and to take my guys with me. They were not impressed. I called my dad to come and pick us up at two in the morning. He was not impressed. As for the girl? The reputation that followed me around school for the following three years makes me think that she was, in fact, not impressed. 

**Tl;dr** Things were getting a little wild post my first make out sesh with a hot girl, but after foolishly ignoring my bladder liquid gold rained down on the both of us and I ran like the wind. Got myself and my mates kicked out of the party of the year, and had my dad drive an hour and a half out at 2am to pick us up.

Edit: Thanks for my first ever (non liquid) gold!

Edit 2: To all those asking about my ability to take a piss while standing to attention, I dunno what to tell you. Is it a super power? Am I broken? We may never know. But I can safely say that I don't partake often due to urine related ptsd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Follow up:** Thanks for all the kind words, I'm glad this harrowing moment of adolescence made you laugh. I can't reply to all the comments but to those asking what happened to the girl, I don't think we ever spoke again but still saw each other in classes and stuff, just forever avoiding eye contact. As for my group of mates, it didn't take them too long to forgive me, and it eventually just became one of those story's that is brought up at every possible opportunity. I still get roasted for it."
"TIFU by getting a DNA test and revealing a family secret


I've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  My mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely Native American, and I recently learned that this is apparently something common for Southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  I finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing I enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  

Fast forward a few weeks.  I get my results.  I am 0% Native America, which isn't exactly shocking.  The real surprise comes from the fact that I am also 0% Eastern European.

This probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but I happen to be Polish.  Or at least, I thought I was.  I have an unpronounceable, very Polish last name.  My great-grandparents were Polish-speaking immigrants.  My paternal grandfather himself spoke Polish as a child.

My first thought was that the test was a mistake.  My results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and I KNEW I should be somewhere around 25% Polish/Eastern European.  So maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  I started digging around through my DNA relative matches.  I had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  So the DNA analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.

There were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my Polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  

I look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  However, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  In fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and I had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  Also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.

My paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and I gave her a call.  It took a while for me to fully explain the DNA testing to her—she's 87, but we got there.  She denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating European tribes before I was finally able to make her understand that I would be able to test relatives from the Polish side of the family and determine whether or not I was actually related to them.  She told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and I should think about it before contacting anyone.

I think I knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  

So who is my actual paternal grandfather?  TBD.  My grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for Christmas.  She requested that we not tell anyone until then (it's too late, my sister already told everyone).  

TL;DR:  Did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.  "
"TIFU by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house


This actually took place a couple of years ago.

I had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

Well, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. 

By the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded ""Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. 

Well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

I had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

My boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

I look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

Now my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he's not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he's thinking. There' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

In this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

I couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn't have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

It suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

I could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

My boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

He finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

He makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

We all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

As soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

Turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

A year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.

TL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. Yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. "
"TIFU by having sex and ending up in Urgent Care.


Obligatory: This was last weekend

So it's a typical Friday night at my boyfriend's house and we went upstairs to have a little fun before bed. Everything was great, and then he decided he wanted to try a new position. Nothing crazy, just new. It felt fine for a second and then after about 5-10 seconds I feel a super intense cramping. I immediately made him stop and that's when things got worse. The cramping was so intense I was keeled over and could barely move or talk. I tried stretching, curling up into the fetal position, lying on my side. You name it, I tried it, but nothing I did would make the pain subside. My poor boyfriend is watching me and trying to help, but I could tell he had no idea what to do... nor did I. The pain went on and didn't subside for over an hour! I was lying in bed, sweating profusely and feeling the need to vomit. We were just about to go to the E.R. when the pain started to subside. After about an hour and a half of the most intense pain I have ever felt in my life, it died down about as quick as it came on. I was so exhausted, I fell asleep immediately. When we woke up the next morning, I was still cramping (but nowhere near as bad as the night before), so we decided to go to the Urgent Care and see what the hell was going on. Once there, I tried to discretely tell the receptionist what my symptoms were and why I came in. She gave my boyfriend this look like, ""What on earth did you do to her?"" 

Jump to when the Dr. comes in to see me. She does all these tests, pokes around down there and says everything looks fine and then tells me what she thinks happened.... Apparently, my boyfriend had literally ""fucked me too hard"" (Her words btw!) He had hit my cervix multiple times and my uterus reacted the same way it would if I were delivering a baby and my body was going through contractions. Except this was a constant pain, not a contraction followed by a lull, followed by another contraction. I'm talking about an hour and a half long contraction! It was by far the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I was sent home with some pain pills and a prescription for ""no sex for a week"". Funniest part is when the Dr. told us that my boyfriend had ""fucked me too hard"", his face lit up like a little boy on Christmas. I had never seen a prouder man. 

TL;DR - My boyfriend pounded my cervix and induced an hour long contraction, ended up in Urgent care."
"TIFU by doing destroy dick December and actually destroying my dick.


So this happened last night into this morning. If you dont know what destroy dick december is, its when you fap/ejaculate for every day of the month for that specific date. Anyway me being the fast ejaculator that I am, I actually took the challenge. I can make myself cum in under a minute the first time if i really want to and I normally do at least twice each ""session"". I am uncircumcised and could never get my skin back when i'm fully erect (will be relevant later)

I did no fap November so on the first day there was quite a load and a huge relief. Everything went alright until about the 6th day where It was becoming really difficult to get myself to cum. took too long even though that i spaced it out throughout the day. But no worries I had a genius plan to solve this. Make a masturbation machine for guys. You know you've seen those ones they make for the girls with a dildo strapped to a drill or something or the other. I had my idea i just needed to execute it.

On the 8th day (yesterday), I Decided to take what prisoners called a ""fifi"" and improve upon it. I took a 2 liter soda bottle, cut the top 1/4 of it off and bent the rim inwards (should have bent it outwards and taped over it instead but im getting ahead of myself). I bore a hole in the cap with a screw from the inside of the cap and duct taped over it not to prevent any leaks. I then took a rubber latex glove, making sure the fingers were inside and taped it over the end of the bottle I had just cut. I pulled a few of the fingers through the actual bottle opening (where you normally pour from). Then filled that baby up with some warm water and screwed it back up. I was proud of my contraption.

It was time to put her to the test. I took a drill and placed the screw in the part where you would normally put a drill bit, squirted some lotion in the glove, stuck my Johnson in there and gave her a test run.It worked like a dream. I didnt have to wear my arm out spanking it anymore, I could even adjust the speed to make me cum faster. After the first session I thought I could make it better by having it fully automated instead of having to hold the trigger down. Later that night when I was going for my 5th try. I got a zip tie and strapped it to the trigger and went to town. 

This try was pretty close to the last try since I woke up late that morning and had to start later. When I came i convulsed and lost all control while in orgasm, the drill still going at high speed had torn through the glove and the plastic end came in contact with my dick and sliced it right open. I was in a state of pain and pleasure.. I made a loud scream and my roommate came barging in to check on me. I dont remember the look on his face because I was in so much pain but i do remember him going ""what the fuck"" and pointing at my dick. I was bleeding badly and I can see part of my foreskin just hanging off of my penis. I was freaking the fuck out. Roommate said i needed to go to the hospital but i was reluctant considering the situation. after i while i said fuck it and he drove me to the hospital.

When they finally saw me, the nurses cleaned me up and the doctors were debating over something or the other. After a few minutes they came back to me saying that because so much of my foreskin had been cut off (the right half had actually been clean cut off, probably still somewhere in my room). They thought it was best to just circumcise me and take off the rest. Now a man in pain hearing that his dick will be cut off was just too much. i was flipping balls. Since this post is kind of long already I'll spare all the fine details. They ended up convincing me to get the circumcision, procedure was rather short. Came home with less of my dick that i had left with. Had to clean up my blood bath and threw away my invention. Dont  pull a MacGyver like i did, old fashion way works and stick with it.

TL;DR Made a masturbating machine that ended up slicing my dick and had to get circumcised.

Edit: changed ""no fap December"" to ""November"". glad i decided to make a throwaway for this lol. No i didnt think I was going to make it all the way to day 31, I just wanted to see how far I can get. Was hoping to make something out of it. No more fapping for me for a while anyway :/"
"TIFU by not properly checking the passport rules of travelling to Kenya, throwing $30,000 dollars down the drain.


Literally just happened today. My mother, brother, sister and I were all planning to go to Kenya for a giant vacation. It was the death anniversary of my grandma, and since my mom had not been there in 20 years, she decided that she wanted to go and show us where she was raised. 

We are a pretty low income family due to my mom having a brain tumour a few years ago that still exhibits problems for her and all 3 of us kids going to school, so only work is part time for myself and my brother (sister was too young). Due to this, we saved up as much as we could, and even though it hurt us a lot financially, we bought the tickets 6 months ago using a travel agent for a total cost of $6000. 

Since it was with a travel agent, we thought it was a done deal. He sent us the ticket and travel itinerary, and said everything was good to go. We soon learned however, that this was wrong. But that's to come later on.

Anyway, due to us thinking that it was a done deal. We called up our family in Kenya and told them that we would finally be coming to visit them. This had them excited, especially my uncle, who is fairly wealthy, and decided that he wanted to make this trip worthwhile. Knowing that we couldn't afford anything special, he decided to pitch in to make our trip something we would never forget. A $20,000 dollar event itinerary filled with a personal driver, 4 days at a safari, 5 star hotels, scuba-diving, and more. It was one if those dream vacations that you could not wait for. It WOULD have been great.

Fast forward to today. Where we had finished buying luggages and packing them, had arranged accommodation for our dog, and had put valuables in secure areas. It was a 3 week trip that was supposed to end on January 6, 2018. Remember this date folks.

We take an hour ride through traffic, and finally arrive at the airport at 3:30, with the flight leaving around 6. We have everything ready and with us, and we were feeling really good. We go up to the Lufthansa baggage check in and wait. Around 4, it's finally our turn. We go with the right amount of suitcases, show them our ticket, and then finally give in our passports to be scanned. Everything looks good... And then here's where it started to crumble.

Remember how I said that the return date was January 6th. Well Lufthansa just then tells us that they can't let us on the trip because to go to Kenya our passport should be valid for 6 months after the end of the trip. Our passports however, expired on the 4th of June. 2 FUCKING DAYS DIFFERENCE. This comes as a blow to my mom, and after going through confusion, she starts going through panic. She asks them what we can do. And they say that there's an emergency passport place that can do it in an hour.... But they close at 4:30 and it was already around 4:15 by then and it was half an hour drive. Not possible.

My mom goes back to the Lufthansa desk and asks them if there is anything else they can please do to help, is there a way to reschedule from the desk so we can go in within the next 2 days to try and get the renewed passport. They say they can't do anything. She asks for what to do with the travel agent, they say that she better leave or else they will call the police on her.

We leave the desk and we go to sit down and call the agent. we ask him to call the head of service and to try and change the flight date, they tell him that the only thing we can do is to cancel the flight and rebook.... And of course, they'll still keep about $2000 from the $6000. We try to get him to see if they can exchange (because we knew the price for a new one would be unaffordable), but he didn't do shit and just did the cancellation. Never going to hire him again EVER.

My mom starts to break down. But I try my best to make her feel a better. ""How could I be so stupid, why didn't I do it"" and ""why didn't he warn us. I shouldn't have ever picked him to book our flight"" really started to break my heart. But I told her to keep her head strong, we will get through it. We immediately get home and go to get passport photos done, grab renewal forms, and get referrals and what not and have the paperwork ready to go early morning tomorrow (technically today at the time of typing) at 8 am to hopefully be ready the end of tomorrow with the urgent renewal running about $1000 in total. If the ticket is affordable enough now, we would be able to do it, it would just mean that we would have to be living pretty broke for the next few months.

 All we need now, is to see the ticket prices. We go online and my mom starts to cry. We check all the websites, the lowest price is $12,000. Double that of what we paid. And way out of our price range due to all the things we had paid for before hand (even worse, the ""refund"" from Lufthansa would take approximately 4 weeks to arrive. We won't be able to afford it, unless we go afterwards. But doing that would mean that the amazing event that my uncle set up would go down the drain. We had to go to our last resort. 

My mom had to call my uncle, and ask for help. We tell him that they wouldn't let us on the flight... And he starts fucking raging. He is so pissed and it's understandable. He would lose his $20,000 that he spent  just for us since it was all booked and paid for already. After though, my mom starts to pretty much beg him to help us find a flight, but he says that he can't spend over $12,000 more for us, especially with that $12,000 being on the line with us actually getting a renewed passport tomorrow. We beg him to please do it, and he angrily says he will see and will call by 1 if he has a flight (we need a travel itinerary to show the passport office in order for them to renew it in 1 day).

It's almost 2 now, and there's no call. I'm sitting in bed here depressed while typing this (which is probably why there where mistakes in the text. I'm to sad to think properly). Meanwhile my mom is crying while trying to fall asleep. My mom's biggest dream in years and about $30,000 all pretty much down the drain. And only because our passport was expiring in June 4, 2018 instead of June 6, 2018 on a trip that was ending on January 6, 2018.

Tl;dr: we had a giant trip planned to have my mom finally go back home to Kenya, had a shitty travel agent who didn't  tell us that our passport was 2 days under the 6 months validity after the trip, and now my mom is crying and our uncle who payed the $20,000 event itinerary hates us.

*Edit: holy shit. I didn't expect the post to get this much attention. Anyway, I realized that there where some errors so I'm here to fix them. For the discussion about whether it was start or end trip, I honestly can tell you I had no clue. All I do know is that they said two days off and 6 months. So I interpreted it as in they we're counting January in the 6 months since that would make the most sense then. Im sorry  if I caused any confusion

Also, for those saying that the 6 month thing is everywhere, it is not. They even told us at the gate that if we were only going to Frankfurt (the stop over location), it would be 3 months and we would be fine. The 6 months was a thing set by the Kenyan government.

I'm going to be looking into the comments a bit more to answer more questions in future edits, while also trying to decide what stuff to do in order to try and see if this trip is still salvageable for my mother.

Edit #2: I see a lot of people want me to post proof cause they think I'm lying. It's 4am right now, but ass soon as I get some sleep and it's around 7 I'll post the original ticket that was wasted. 

Edit #3: here is the proof as wanted
 Removed.

Edit #4: due to a large amount of people messaging me to warn me, I have decided to remove the proof since it was too risky to have up. Sorry folks"
"TIFU by waterboarding myself


This actually happened a few years ago, well a little more because I was around 8-10 at the time. I went for a movie, and it was one of those action gun shooting movies that you see all the time (I forgot the name of it). There was a part where they captured the main character and they tied him to a chair. Then, they put a towel over his face and poured a bucket of water on him. I thought to myself “It’s so hot in that room it’s probably not even that bad”. After the movie, I went home and after a while I got bored. Then I remembered the scene from that movie and decided to try it out myself. I went and got a towel, and then laid down on the counter, putting my head under the sink faucet. I put the towel over my face and turned the water on. You can only imagine what happened next. I suddenly realized what was happening in the movie. As soon as I turned the faucet on, I couldn’t breathe. This scared he living shit out of me, and I tried to scream, which made it like 10x worse. I started thinking to myself that I was gonna die. With my amazing problem solving skills I tried to remove my head from under the faucet and hit my head on it really hard. I somehow managed to get the towel off of my head and I was freaking out whilst turning the water off. I just sat on the ground and cried my ass off for like an hour. And that’s how I learned what waterboarding was. Also after about an hour I had a half circle kind of bruise on the top of my forehead from hitting the faucet.

TL;DR Saw a waterboarding scene in an action movie and decided to try it myself, ended with me crying with a bruise on my forehead."
"TIFU by trying to unclog a toilet with a condom


So, this is a story that happened a couple years ago. I was in a new-ish relationship that also happened to be my first with a guy I liked a decent amount. To set the stage, this guy had some jealousy issues that were kind of warranted due to me being a pretty big flirt. Anyway, let's jump into things.

One day, I was going about my day when I had to take a shit (girls don't poop I know) that ended up being a pretty big shit. So big, in fact, that it clogged my toilet. I ended up freaking out because my boyfriend was coming over soon and I didn't know how to explain the huge turd in my toilet that was almost now overflowing due to the amount of times I attempted to flush it :) I was in college at the time, and as a result didn't have basic life items like a plunger. Or gloves. Anyway, the clock is winding down and my boyfriend'll be here soon so I think the use the only glove-like item I have on hand: a condom. If you're thinking of using a condom as a rubber glove to unclog a toilet, just don't, because it didn't work at all. So I toss the condom to the side and use a plastic bag to try to retrieve my shit instead and that ends up working (although the bag did have holes in it and I ended up getting poop water on my hand). 

So I think everything's fine, and my boyfriend comes over and it's all chill until he notices a condom on the floor. He'd been over the night before so I tried to brush it off like I just hadn't had time to clean up yet. For some reason he had taken some kind of inventory in his head of all the condoms by my nightstand (they were assorted) and noticed the only magnum was gone (I needed a big one for my hand!!). So then he starts freaking out and accuses me of cheating on him and literally fucking other guys in the small time frame that he'd been gone. Eventually he literally breaks up with me and storms out. And at that point I couldn't even tell him the truth because who'd believe that fucked up story lmao.

TL;DR I took a huge shit and tried to unclog my toilet with an unused condom, which my boyfriend found and thought was a result of me cheating on him and ended up causing us to breakup.
