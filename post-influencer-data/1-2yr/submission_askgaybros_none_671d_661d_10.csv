"I’m 14 and Just Had My First Date (UPDATE POST)


So taking in all your guys advice I think really helped.

- I took a shower and made sure my hygiene was on point.

- I followed your guys cologne tips and my sister told me I smelt great.

- I made small talk about common interests and movies. (Justice League, Marvel and DC, parents, school and stuff)

- When the lights for the play went off I held his hand, and he held mine back. And then we kept kind of brushing each other’s thumbs and i kind of put my other hand on his arm and stroked that. We played a bit of footsie too. Overall it was very romantic and i loved it.

- We made our goodbyes when my dad got there and he texted me a very sweet message saying how fun it was. 

Thanks guys! You really helped!"
"UPDATE: Guy looking at me at my college...is gay!!!


Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7ba7o0/gaybros_was_this_guy_at_my_college_checking_me/


So I saw him again on Friday, looking as cute as ever, we were in the Library and we both enter the elevator, we were eyeing each other again.....he got off at the 4th floor and I got off too. I really wanted to make a move and speak to him finally...so I said ""I like your jacket bro, where'd you get it!?"" and we had small talk, I asked him what program he's in, we were kinda flirting with each other....he ended asking me for my number!!! 

That night he texted me saying how he always sees me around campus and thought I was cute. Our first date is on Tuesday!! This guy is sooo cute, my dream guy. And he's so down-to-earth and we have so much in common. I would've never thought he was gay too. That's why I ignored all the signs and assumed he was straight. 

You guys, I'm 21, I've never had a boyfriend, only been on one actual date, and I'm sexually inexperienced. I'm a good looking guy though, I've just been unlucky I guess. I can't believe something like this happened to me...I never in a million years thought something like this would ever happen to me honestly. I always believed I'm just an unlucky cursed guy and I gave up on finding a guy and focused on my education. 

I hope this gives hope to those of you that are in my situation. Focus on your education and getting your degree. Don't worry about finding a boyfriend, focus on bettering your life...and then maybe one day, your dream guy will pop up outta no where like mine did.

"“Oh you two are a gay couple? So which one is...you know...the one that says, ‘I don’t care you pick’ when choosing a place to eat at?”


"
"Has this ever happened to you?


Your lover is pounding your ass, lips locked onto yours, your legs are cramping up, your arms going numb from being pinned above your head. You have a cosmic orgasm and groan through your nostrils because he won't take his lips off yours.

His thrusting quickens until he pulls his head back and lets out a long, low moan, then collapses onto you.

You love his weight crushing you. You're happy to breathe freely through your mouth for a moment. Then he rolls onto his side and you onto yours.

You look into each others eyes. You reach for his cheek to gently caress it, then you wake up because your fucking upstairs neighbor decided to rearrange their furniture at 2 in the morning? You try to go back to sleep and pick up where you were but all you can dream about is stocking shelves at Walmart? ಠ_ಠ"
"Tomorrow (Nov 15) Australia finds out if the country says yes or no to homos getting hitched.


Admittedly it’s a pretty tense time here for the LGBTI community with the conservative side making life difficult in a lot of ways. The results of the national survey gets announced tomorrow. 
Keep your fingers crossed for us gaybros!"
"If Being Gay Is A ""Mental Illness"", Why Are People So Hostile Towards The Sick?


Am I the only one who sees the flaw in social-conservatism arguments when they argue that being gay or trans is a ""mental illness""? If they truly believed that, wouldn't that ultimately make them the shitty person for being hostile and demeaning towards the ""mentally ill""? Especially the so called good Christians lol. You'd expect them to be the most understanding of the so called mentally ill. It absolutely makes no sense to me. I, ofc, know for a fact it's not a mental illness."
"In college, I used to think I was going through a “slut phase.”


Now I realize I’m just a slut. And there’s nothing wrong with that."
"Doesn't it make you cringe when women say all the hot guys are gay!?


Lol it makes me laugh...because only if they knew! But the truth is, you can't really blame them...oh if they really knew how good they have it *sigh*"
"A guy at my school (16yo) is sexting an adult girl (≈23yo) on a daily basis and everyone is cheering him because ""he's a real man now""


Would people still cheer him if she was a man instead? No

Being gay is fucking unfair sometime"
"I had a test yesterday in college, the gay lecturer sat all the cute twinks at the front


So he came up with a seating plan so people wouldn't cheat and all the guys at the front were slim white blue eyed brown haired twinks (straight but had the twink look) which I found funny then I cried my chubby ass off at the back of the room when I realised where he sat me :*( haha"
