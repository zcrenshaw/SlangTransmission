"Has Anyone Else Had an Experience With This Guy? (resposted from r/nyc)


I posted this on r/nyc but it might belong here-- 

Hi this is my first post but I had a scary experience on the train last night and wanted to know if anyone else has come across this guy. He's tall and has dark hair and very tan to brown skin (possibly of American Indian descent?), he's probably around 40 and doesn't really look homeless but smells VERY DISTINCTLY of wet dog and was carrying three knapsacks. The wet dog smell is probably his most defining characteristic.

Here was my experience: Thursday night I was going home from Grand Central and took the 4/5 train downtown at around 10 pm. This man got on one or two stops later and immediately stood right above me, staring very intensely at me for the remainder of the train ride. There was a lot of space on the train car so it wasn't like it was a crowded train and he was forced to stand over me. The smell of wet dog was really intense, but I didn't want to switch cars because I thought I was being silly to have a bad feeling about this guy and I didn't want to offend (social conditioning...). I got to my stop and I was afraid he was going to follow me off the train but he didn't thank god and I forgot about the experience.

Then last night, Sunday night, I was coming back from the Upper West Side at around 7 pm (totally different time and location from Thursday). As I was waiting on the platform I turned and noticed that SAME GUY standing there, staring at me. Same clothes, same knapsacks, same VERY distinct smell. I immediately was terrified, but casually walked down the platform a little ways so that I wouldn't be on the same car as him. I noticed him continue to stare at me so I walked down further to the very end of the platform. The train came and I got on the car, thinking I was safe and had gotten rid of him. Then the smell of wet dog hit my nostrils and I looked up and he was standing right there, staring at me. I was so scared at that point and tried to maneuver my way through the crowded train car to at least get a little distance from him. Then the train stopped at the next stop and I pretended like I was getting off. He got off the train but when he saw I didn't actually get off got back on. I then quickly switched cars as the doors were closing and he luckily didn't follow me.

I have to believe it was a coincidence that I saw him twice within a couple days, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has possibly had a similar experience? Maybe this guy just really enjoys making people uncomfortable? I'm terrified now that I'll see him on the train again."
"I got hid in the head by some of the break dancers on the MTA. Has this happened to anyone else?


The other day I was riding the D train and I got hit hard in the head by someone doing a flip. I pushed the guy away and yelled, ""motherfucker!"" but thought better of escalating it. I realized afterwards that I could have found myself in a world of hurt just for pushing the guy away, but it was a rather thoughtless response to the pain. 

In any case, it got me thinking. What if this was worse? I think I caught a shoulder, but what if it was a foot? I realize that I could obviously call the cops, but what could they really do? I know people get assaulted in the subway quite a bit, but this probably isn't assault. I don't really care though. I'd be happy for that kid to spend a night in jail and not jump around the subway like an asshole.

Has anyone had this happen to them? What did you do?"
"What is the deal with The Hamptons?


It seems to be that tons of my coworkers spend time out at The Hamptons. From everything I have seen so far, It's the place truly loaded (as in, 1M+ a year earnings) soend their time during the summer. It seems popular with the finance crowd.

What's the appeal of it? Am I missing something? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"How to treat sister in NYC, remotely? (I‚Äôm nowhere near NYC)


I don‚Äôt live in NYC, but my sister does (upper east side, Manhattan) and I want to be able to treat her/couple (holidays, when she‚Äôs feeling down/stressed, etc). I dont want her to have to pay for anything, so I need things to be able to be paid online in advance. 

Besides sending her amazon packages, how else can I treat her? What about experiences, like tickets to local things? Spas? I‚Äôm not really familiar with a lot of NYC places/experiences and I‚Äôm a new adult still learning how to do these things so anything and everything is helpful. Thank you.
