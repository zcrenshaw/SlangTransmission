"What would you do if you got an alert on your phone saying a nuke was going to hit NYC in thirty minutes?


Do you have a plan? Would you just wait it out? Try to escape?"
"What are your personal favorite neighborhoods to wander through?


Like most New Yorkers, I love to spend free time wandering around, seeing new areas of the city.

Can you recommend me neighborhoods/specific areas to wander through on my days off? My current favorite is the LES."
"Just moved here and feeling a little intimidated and lonely


So I just moved to the city a little less than a week ago and I am feeling a little overwhelmed still. 
I have moved to several different places on my own before but that was always for school purposes. And by saying that.. going to classes more or less always came with a guaranteed social life for me. I have also travelled solo abroad before and never had any issues chatting up strangers in hostels, bars, walking tours etc.

Now here’s the thing. For some reason the vibe of this city feels extremely intimidating to me. I would love to go to a bar tonight/tomorrow by myself and ultimately I know, that I just need to build up the courage and GO but something is holding me back to leave the comfort zone of my apartment or going to yoga class or movies or whatever it is that I have been doing so far. 

I don’t know why, but the idea of going to a bar and just sitting there by myself is terrifying to me. Whilst solo traveling abroad, I didn’t have much of an issue with it since it was normal to encounter solo travelers in nightlife but I feel like here, everyone will be in their established groups. 
I don’t know what I am looking for with this post. Maybe just some words of reassurance or a little PUSH. 

Thanks for reading and taking your time. Any words of comfort or wisdom are appreciated!!"
