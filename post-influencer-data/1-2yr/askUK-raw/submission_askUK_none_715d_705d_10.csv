"Has there been a mysterious yellow sky this morning where you are?


I have only seen this kind of weather once before, in Beijing."
"People who pay for airplane priority boarding. Are they morons?


Been a few years since I flew and whilst I was sitting watching this enormous queue of people waiting in line at the gate looking pissed off, I was thinking WHY!?

Chill out and sit down.

1. Getting on the plane first doesn't mean the plane leaves any earlier. 
2. Why would you pay extra to board the plane and watch people take their seats? Refer to the above statement. 
3. If it's a case of wanting to get hand luggage in the storage, there's nearly always space somewhere. 
4. Chill the fuck out!"
