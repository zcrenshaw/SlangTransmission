"Questions about a The Falklands Conflict from Argentinian Teens


Hello, my name is Rodrigo and I'm a highschool senior in Argentina.We've been asked to gather information about the Falklands Conflict, but from your guy's perspective. As from a young age we are taught the story from our point of view, but this time we want to know the way you guys see it and what you think about it with a few questions.

-You are taught your side of the story but do you know our side?

-What are the biggest differences you could see between our soldiers and yours(during that time)?

-If you were a kid, do you remember what was you first thought when you knew a war was happening?

-Do you agree with the actions taken by both sides?

-Do you have 'hollyday' to remember the war like we do?

-If you're a Kelper what do you think about the few argentines who live in the islands?

-If you fought in the war, do you have any experience you want to share?

-How did the media cover the whole conflict if it did at all?

Thanks in Advance."
"Where can I buy good teenager tampons and have correct usage explained?


I am a single dad and my daughter is 12. Is this topic covered in most schools or do parents need to teach this? Girls/women here could you recommend some good ones to buy, I found [this one](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/default.aspx?id=271088924) in tesco?

Is is possible to ask a (preferably a female one) professional (e.g. teacher, pharmacist, GP)  to give her advice on correct usage?"
"Remember when it used to snow in winter?


I live down south near London and it hasn't snowed for like 4 years!
  Like its Just shitty frost and no snow at all. Is it because of global warming or what? Winters are now boring and I just realised how close we are to autumn. "
