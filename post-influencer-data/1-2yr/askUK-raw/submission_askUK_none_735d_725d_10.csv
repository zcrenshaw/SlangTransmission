"I have a question for the good people of Scotland. Why have you got 20 geese wandering around a motorway services car park like they own the fucking place?

Arrogant pricks they were. The ringleader had a very bad attitude. Wouldn't accept that I didn't have any spare change."
"What should I do if someone tried to record me under a bathroom stall?


So this morning whilst waiting for my train, I went into the toilet so I could blow my nose in one of the cubicles. As I was blowing my nose, I saw a phone slowly appear underneath the cubicle next to me. This person pressed record and pointed the phone at the toilet, where I would have been sitting.

I said something along the lines of ""You alright there mate, do you need something?"". He didn't respond, so I knocked on his door and he still didn't respond. I then heard my train pull up to the station so had to leave the toilets.

Should I have done anything, or do anything now? He would have been the only other person in the toilets, so I guess would be easy to spot on CCTV?"
