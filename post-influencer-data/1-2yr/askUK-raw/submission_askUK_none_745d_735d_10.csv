"Anyone else feel like they've lost their youth to mental illness?


I'm almost 28 &amp; have had various issues with mental health over the last decade. Things are getting better with meds &amp; counselling and I'm starting to feel comfortable in my own skin. The one thing I can't seem to shake is the realisation I'm nearly 30 &amp; how much I feel time I feel like I've lost &amp; how much fun I've missed out on because to illness. 

Like if I go out now &amp; have a good night, I can't shake the feeling that people my age are... done with that. That they're basically winding down &amp; beginning to settle. I get stuck in the ""I've wasted my youth, everyone my age has done so much more than me"" mindset &amp; it really grinds me down.

this time of year gets to me a bit as it just reminds me that I never went to uni despite making plans to almost every year &amp; never following them through. I suppose there's not really anything stopping me now, but I worry that I'd still feel light years behind everyone else. I don't want to go *wild* per se but I feel like letting my hair down now I'm just gonna look like a sad old bastard. :(

Does or has anyone else feel/felt the same way? It would be nice to feel less alone :)"

"What are some aspects of modern UK working-class life or culture that those from middle-class and up might not be aware of?


It feels like we might be a minority on the UK subs, even though everybody is pinched nowadays, it seems that in the career threads everyone seems to be at least average in terms of where they are/income, and in the political and news threads people tend to have certain expectations of e.g. family life and life goals that to me, from a more working-class background, are less familiar.

I'm fairly certain I've seen threads of this nature on AskReddit and some of the international subs, but not so often on the UK subs - despite the fact that our class background is so much more central to our identity here or how we see ourselves.

To start us off, I'll say one that's always unfamiliar to me is the generally-accepted modern expectation that someone in their 20s has the option to just *live with their parents* or *live at home* for free. I was raised in a culture where from age 18 or 20, once you finished education or got a job, *you* the young person should be giving some of your wage to your folks for upkeep and the household. Our houses were small and people in my area often shared bedrooms up to late teens or older, as opposed to being able to have their own space in their parents' house, and a right to expect to live there as an adult - the view was more that you shouldn't be hanging around when you could be out in your own place; your parents had their own lives now that they'd done their duty by you.

What are others? You can talk about culture and life yourself as an adult or yourself as a child growing up, whatever comes to mind."
