"Help! My colleagues think I’m Muslim, but I’m not. It was a lie I told to get them off of my back and it’s out of control! What do I do!??!


So I’ve recently started a new role at a private sector firm, I’ve been a month in and the culture has taken some getting used to. Previously, where I worked everyone I guess was quite geeky and we all got on and generally a nicer less masculine atmosphere. 

However, I took a new job and whilst I don’t mind the work, the people I am with are not what I am used to. Think the ‘jock’ type of people from School, the sporty laddish ones at Uni associated with drinking etc, that’s who I am now working with.

I’m quite introverted and I don’t drink, gamble, smoke etc, that’s just not me. However, working here, it seems I am definitely the odd one out. Some of my colleagues were making comments about visiting lap dancing clubs or casinos etc and I found this rather uncomfortable. I was being questioned as to whether or not I would be visiting one or have I ever visited one. This was of course all meant as a joke, but, one I did not find funny.

Upon being pestered more, I blurted out that I’m actually quite religious and I’m a Muslim, meaning anything that they mentioned is forbidden (I know this isn’t exactly the case, but, I just thought of it as an excuse). 

This seemed to get my colleagues off of my back for a while, I mean; I know a fair bit about Islam so using it as a cover story isn’t too bad. However, it’s got to the point where I am now being offered time to pray and visit the Mosque etc. because even my senior directors have cottoned on. People are asking about which one I visit, do I speak Arabic, diet, where my family are from, Mecca etc. This lie has expanded and it really shouldn’t have.

Most comments and questions have been brushed off, but, I can see this dragging on and I need to nip it in the bud. I’m even receiving gifts and things (no pictures of the prophet of course).

I should add I do like my work and the behaviour of my colleagues has massively improved since learning I am ‘Muslim’. But I guess this has come at the cost of telling an outright lie.

Reddit…what do I do?

"Why don't British people dress warmly when it's cold outside?


I realize that this is a huge stereotype, so take it with a grain of salt before unsheathing the pitchforks and torches ;)

I've noticed in my time living here, anecdotally and non-scientifically, that there is a propensity for people to not wear jackets/warm clothing even when it's -2C. I've heard it said something along the lines of, ""people get used to the weather here"" or ""it's genetic"" - but I don't buy that. I've been to Scandinavia in Feb, March, and April, and people dress warmly! If anyone's resistant to cold, it's the Nords.

What's going on here guys? :) "
"Are country pubs supposed to be welcoming?


I was just wondering if this was the embodied image of country pubs - ie cosy and welcoming - because practically every one I've ever been to, I've felt like a complete outsider, especially when the regulars are in.

Thoughts?"
