"Why can't police evict travellers?


Whenever gypsies goonto private or public land illegally, even causing criminal damage, they are there for 4 or 5 days before they get moved. The police don't do anything. 

If I got a tend and started camping in a park, I'd get moved on pretty quickly, and if I refused or went back after, I'd get arrested. If I cut a lock and broke onto land I'd also get arrested. Yet, these tax avoiding, cowboy merchant, uninsured thieves get to do whatever the fuck they want, block public right of ways, intimidate the public and they get away with it. "
"Suspended for accepting a scottish banknote


Hi, today I've been suspended from work for accepting a £20 Scottish note (clydesdale bank). It has been checked and is 100% genuine.

I understand how Scottish notes aren't technically legal tender. However, there isn't really any reason for places not to accept them in England. I go to scotland several times a year, and regularly bring Scottish notes back down south and use them with no issues.

They are saying that they can't pay it in, as their bank won't accept scottish notes as it is not legal tender and want to deduct £20 from my pay. I offered to swap the clydesdale bank £20 for a bank of england one, but they refuse to. They are treating it as if I've just accepted a piece of blank paper for a £50 or something.

I have no idea what to do, as I am loosing pay for tomorrow, and money is very tight.

Thanks"
"Is being put on gardening leave shameful?


I’m an American working in London, and long story short, I’m leaving my current company to work for a competitor.  My boss is quite unhappy and has been threatening to put me on gardening leave for the rest of my notice period.  He makes it sound like some sort of punishment, but my understanding is that it’s essentially paid holiday.  I kind of hope he does it, I have a lot of video games to catch up on.

What am I missing?  Is there a stigma against it?"
