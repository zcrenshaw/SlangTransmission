"[PSA] Mother's Day - Sunday 11th March (this Sunday)


You're welcome."
"People of the North, are you still going out tonight?


Coat or no coat?"
"American girl visiting the UK for the first time at the end of March... How can I not seem rude?


Ive been told Americans are taken as very brash and loud.  I'm worried I'll be offending folks accidentally.  Are there any tips y'all can give me to not make an ass of myself?

Edit: I just woke up to so much awesome advice.  Thank you all so much!!"
