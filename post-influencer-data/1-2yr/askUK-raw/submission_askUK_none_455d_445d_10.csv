"UK teachers, why the resistance to allowing boys to wear shorts to school in a heatwave?


I, an adult, haven't worn long trousers for the past three weeks and I'm not sure I understand why anyone would be against schoolboys being allowed to wear shorts.

When we're all supposed to be encouraging kids to be more active surely letting them wear shorts would help them to run about at break time as well as just being generally humane in 30 degree heat."
"I want to put my child up for adoption


I have a 2 year old daughter and unfortunately I simply cannot stand the sight of her. I don’t want a family member to adopt her (not that I’m close to anyone in my family anyway) and would prefer it if someone outside of our family adopted her. This way I don’t get too much contact with her through a family member since it doesn’t feel right to give her up yet be involved in her life in any way. I want the best for her but in all honesty I don’t love her at all and it’s becoming too much for me as a single father. I can’t explain how I feel so negative towards her and would rather just get on with my life since I don’t think I’ll be a good father to her when she’s older and I simply couldn’t care less how she goes about her life when she’s older. I’ve felt like this for a long time too and raising a child is not for me any more. I could go on and on and explain why I feel like this but I would like some advice on how to put her up for adoption please. I know for a fact it will be the best for both of us this way, even if she might find it a bit difficult initially. I absolutely hate bringing her up and the process of doing so is getting really toxic for me. Is the process of giving up a child relatively easy or do the government attempt to stop that happening if possible? Would like some advice please and Thanks in advance "
"Can we, like, take some of this heat, and store it away for the winter?


Make it cooler now but a bit nicer in winter innit."
"Ive just woken uo this morning to find that one of my neighbors has let the air out of my tires for parking outside their house, is this illegal? If so what can be done?


Im fucking fuming. In fairness I was partly over his dropped curb but if he had an issue with that he should have either rang the bell or called the council and got me ticketed."
