"I'm constantly receiving ""emergency service"" voicemails and now the police have visited my house. Why is this happening?


I have been receiving voicemail for 2 months from people claiming they are from the emergency service. They always say, ""emergency service, do you need ambulance or police, I can not release the line."" I have always hung up. Today however, I received the same voicemail and hung up but this time police came to my house saying that I dialled them at 10:58am. I answered the voicemail at 10:57am. Now I am confused and irradiated that I somehow called the police and have wasted their time. They said they heard someone yelling when they received the call. The yelling was from a family member yelling and laughing with her friends online. I have no idea how they heard that. I'm now asking this because idiotically I did not explain this to the two officers as I was startled at their presence."
"What should someone know before buying their first house? (UK Edition!)


After reading through the popular post on /r/AskReddit I really wanted a British take on this as a lot of the answers are specific to the US. Hopefully going to be exchanging and completing in a few weeks and I don’t want to miss anything! "
"Can anyone explain to me why the highest council tax band in Westminster is less than the middle council tax band where I live in the South West?


Band H in Westminster, London is lower (£1375 per year) than the band we are in in Gloucestershire (£1450ish per year).

This seem odd to me as the property values in Westminster are much higher than where we live, even in 1999 which is what I think the bandings are based on.

Is there a logical explanation for this?"
