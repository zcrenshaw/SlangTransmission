"My brother has just joined, what I believe is, a pyramid scheme: Herbalife


I found out recently and I've been doing some research and they seem like a very shady business. My brother even told me that last year, they were sued because people claimed they were a pyramid scheme but Herbalife won. I've sent him articles and videos but he still insists Herbalife are a good company. 

How else can I convince him? Am I maybe wrong?

Edit: Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who gave advice. I'll try everything and see how it goes with my brother. "

Given the poor state and reliability of our trains I am guessing nothing less than seppuku by the CEOs will satisfy you."
