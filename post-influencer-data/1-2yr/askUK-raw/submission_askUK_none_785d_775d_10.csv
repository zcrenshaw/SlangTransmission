"I am 60 years old in November, I suffer from Parkinson's disease and have Â£1,000 to spend on a memorable holiday. Have you any suggestions?


I usually travel on my own.  I have a slight tremor and can make my own meals etc.  My problem is walking.  Given enough notice, I can just about walk from a bus stop to a nearby railway station, but not much further.  I like people, sploshing about in water, and unusual food.  Any ideas?

Apologies.  i should have mentioned UK only."
"Update: Just wanted to say thank you! I got the job!


Thank you to everyone's advice on my question I posted a couple weeks ago! I had two interviews and was then called today to be told I start next week. You all helped me so much, and I can't believe my first ever CV and interview went this well. <3

"Should visitors ask before using the toilet?


I have always been under the impression that if you are visiting someone, you should ask if you can use their loo as part of basic manners, unless you have been there before.

We have had 2 workmen recently (doing less than 1 hour jobs), who decided to use our toilet without asking. One got temporarily locked in because our lock has been broken since before we moved in (and our rental agency doesn't think it really needs fixing as there are just 2 of us). The other interrupted my partner while he was sitting on the toilet himself, and got a not so delightful view of him. If they had thought to ask about using the toilet first, neither of these things would have happened.

So, UK redditors - are you supposed to ask about using the toilet, or have excessive manners been drilled into my brain?

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone. I'm glad to see that I am right, and I am not being overly fussy about this."
