"What IN THE NAME OF FUCK is the new American announcement I have to listen to at the train station every day about RailPlan ""twenny twenny""?


It's as if the fuckers have sat down and tried to find something even more fucking irritating than the ""See it, Say it, Sorted"" horseshit that plagues us every day.

An American voice telling us about changes to the rail system as part of Rail Plan 2020. Who the fuck comes up with these announcements and how can we make them stop???"
"Should I report this to the police?


This morning as I cycled to work two guys in a car ran me off the road accusing me of cutting them up.  One of them got out the car and the other one who was driving started shouting about how he wanted to kill all white people (they were black) and basically he was saying ‘we’re gonna wipe the lot if you out / you all deserve to die’ 

I only got a partial plate and I have no other evidence of this bar my word. 

Is there any point in going through making a statement to the police? Would I just be wasting my time? "
"What is a topic that the British public really should debate, but can't for political reasons?


What is a topic that the British public really should debate, but can't for political reasons, or just because it's an uncomfortable topic?"
"Is there a less mental version of fathers 4 justice?


My mate's having baby mama issues- demanding he pays for everything for her (including mortgage) even though they are no longer together, and only letting him see his son a few hours a week. He needs advice from someone who knows what they're talking about but has no money for legal advice. Are there any reasonable charities to help fathers in this sort of position? I feel like F4J would just make things worse, even if he does love superheroes"
