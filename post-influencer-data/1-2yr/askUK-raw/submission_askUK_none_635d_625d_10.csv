"Please help! American, my husband's sister said he died Thursday. Family doesn't know I exist. What do I do?


Sorry, fourth reddit post about this but I climbing up the walls. Yesterday my husband's sister called to tell me he had been found unresponsive. The last conversation we had was about him scanning two docs for his green card.

She was very kind but I said ""as his wife, do I need to do anything?"" And she paused and said ""I didn't know that, he said he was there on business."" I said we'd been together for 11 years and she said she didn't know about that either. She said not to call his mom because of the shock. My mom later called his sister and she said she was processing that he ""had a secret life."" In the earlier call she asked me if it was a ""real wedding."" 

I called Thames Valley police and was transferred twice and one policeman is going to take my calls.

My friends think this is some sort of epic catfish, one worked for El Al and interrogated me and thinks this is a catfish death. I'm inclined to believe he's dead because of the police but he said small town. 

Plus, in America, we bury people within the week. The cop said that the morgue was closed for the bank holiday and he probably won't be autopsied until Wednesday. I know it's longer there. Do you have wakes?

I don't know what to do and I need to see his body. What if what his sister was stuttering about was another partner?

What the f*** was he planning to do since he was due to move here in eight weeks but never told anyone about me? The timing is suspicious but it would be crazy of me to think this is a trick.

However, our final six weeks together (he left the US in mid-December) were hard with lots of family problems here. He said he didn't signup for that. He also unusually sobbed in my arms for half an hour hysterically before he left. He was ill when he left, but not dying. He loved me so much. But he stopped having sex with me six weeks before he left, from daily.

The only complaint he had was foot pain.

I know this is a crazy ramble but I need to put one foot in front of the other and I need to see him. When do I go? What do I do? Why is no one posting RIPs to his FB page? Why do I feel crazy? I'm in my late 30s, him early 40s.

Someone please help me. Using my real account because the fuck do I have to lose now. "
"I was in Chicago recently and the Uber driver said ""I'll wait to see you in"" as I was getting out. Then he waited for me to get inside safe before leaving. Apparently, that's pretty common but I feel like it would never happen here. Why is that?


I should add I'm male, 6ft.

Am I right in saying it wouldn't happen here or am I talking out of my arse? 

Are we just less nice? I've also been called ""sir"" a few times which I felt was quite nice.

"Worried about my friend on holiday.


There's a long time friend of my dads who is 83 and for the last 20 years he's spent xmas week in and around Benidorm alone as he likes to be on the beach on Xmas.

He was due to come back home 3 days ago and we've heard nothing, it's not like him to do this either I cant get through to him via phone and he has no family left who might know where he is / whats going on at this point we're pretty worried and wondering what we should do?

Edit: He's definitely not at his address my dad and I have been going over to feed his cat, I'm going to do as advised and report him missing.  Thanks everyone"
