Do you feel like the US has too much influence on the UK? Even US terms and spellings for certain things are gaining popularity in the UK as well."

Just tried calling mine. Asked for an appointment after 4pm if possible. 

""Sorry, there aren't any, and the diary only goes up to 25th May""

""Okay, are there any other appointments available at any other time?""

""No"". 

The only option is to call at 8.30am, and ask for an emergency appointment, despite the fact it isn't an emergency. "
"Hello friends! I'm visiting the UK in the 3rd week of May with my aged parents. Had some questions and needed some advice!


Hello all!

I'm travelling to the UK from India with my parents. While I have travelled quite a bit in the Europe and US, this is their first time visiting a country outside of India.

**Our Current Plan**

We will be staying in the UK for 7 days:

* London - 3D/4N
* Edinburgh - 1D/2N
* Fort William - 1D/2N

There is a day road trip planned from London-Edinburgh and then a round trip from Edinburgh-Fort William.

We have taken the London Pass for 3 days and visit all the main attractions in the city. Current list includes (but not limited to):

* Westminster Abbey and Big Ben
* London Eye
* Natural History Museum
* Tower of London
* Tower Bridge
* Greenwich

We will then drive from London to Edinburgh by renting a car so as to get a good feel of the English countryside. I had in mind the Cotswolds area but that's about the extent of knowledge I have on this topic.

I'm pretty much clueless about Edinburgh but I had in mind the Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh Castle and maybe the Camera Obscura place.

We will then again drive from Edinburgh to Fort Williams to get the Scottish Highlands feel. Our itinerary includes visiting a Scotch Whisky distillery, taking the Ben Nevis ropeway and maybe visit the Loch Ness.

Some questions I have in mind:

* What are some of the best rental car agencies in UK? I need one that allows a drop-off at a different city (Edinburgh). Also is it required to pre-book?

* Maps tells me the road trip is going to be 10-12hours long. What is it going to be realistically? What route should I take so that we can both enjoy the countryside and also reach Edinburgh fairly quickly? Are there any points on the way that includes in the ""must-see, off-beat"" list?

* My parents are both vegetarians. What are the vegetarian options like in the restaurants?

* Any tips and advices - on the itinerary, general info, unsaid rules are welcome.

PS: My parents are both aged (60+), so it will be difficult for us to include anything adventurous or strenuous on the list.

Thanks in advance!"
