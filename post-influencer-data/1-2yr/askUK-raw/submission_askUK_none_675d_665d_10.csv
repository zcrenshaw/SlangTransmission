"Male domestic abuse victim, i want to leave but cant


I'm stuck. 26/m living with 21/f under her mums house,
i cant work for at least 12 months due to medical reasons, i've been officially signed off by the job centre/dwp.

I have extra money coming in due to that but its in a joint account
very little savings ( 800 )
i have NO family, and the only place/friend i have i coul dpossibly go to is over 300 miles away. 

im being watched everything i do, my phone checked thru, told that i should be grateful she was there thru my medical issues, said its not fair on her if i leave, i attempted suicide once and she choked me for it, she says she should be my only priority and forced me to block any one she sees as a threat regardless of what happens, made me flirt with a friend just to test her etc
if i go for a walk i cant go out for long and she always msgs or calls to check im "" ok "" 
calls me ugly and says i dont deserve help, mostly in arguements but thats often. 

im just stuck and want to get out, i dont have a lot of stuff, clothes and my desktop, i have amotorbike but its not in the best state to sell on for money so id rather just take it with me

im rly stuck and afraid. 

if anyone who can help or wants to, want any proof of my medical situation or anything else i will try my best to provide it, im just wanting some help or advice"
"Where Can I buy a shirt with the design of a Wetherspoons Plate?


Friend works for Weatherspoons. I want to get a shirt with the same floral design.

I believe the design is [Burleigh Blue Calico](https://www.burleigh.co.uk/collections/blue-calico) (though I may be wrong).

[Spoons' plate inspired shoes](https://i.imgur.com/AecSgpM.jpg), or any other item of clothing are also welcomed."
"Received letter from Equifax telling me that they have allowed my personal information to be accessed by hackers. Is there any UK equivalent to the USA class action suits I can join ?


As the title. I want to ensure this costs Equifax as much as possible, so they, and similar companies, are fully incentivised to protect mine and others personal data properly in the future."
