"Gym perv(?) Worth doing anything?


This is possibly going to sound a bit mental, but anyway...

There's a bloke at my gym who wanders up to people naked in the changing rooms and asks if he can borrow shampoo/shower gel. If you actually offer him any then he always finds an excuse to not take it (""I can't use Head and Shoulders"" etc) and then goes off to ask other people until he gets some that he likes. On occasion he doesn't seem satisfied with any of the shower gels on offer and will just start openly soaping up his bollocks with the soap dispenser above the sinks.

He always seems to approach people at *just* the moment when they've completely undressed, and has recently started knocking on the shower doors to make his shampoo requests.

It makes me feel really uncomfortable and I feel like it goes beyond just simple exhibitionism. I have told the gym about it but they (to my knowledge) haven't done anything about it.

Basically I'm deciding whether to switch gyms or to try and take this further, but not sure if I'm just being mental. This behaviour *is* mega creepy, right?

Edit: Thanks for the replies. Wasn't sure if I was just being overdramatic as it's so hard to explain to people in real life without it just coming across as comical. I'll push it and try to get the gym to take it seriously. "
"30+ people, did you keep your uni/school friends/ friends from early 20s? Is it weird that I miss them so much (be honest)?


This sounds really pathetic but I'm 36 and I desperately miss the all the friends I had at school/college, and later uni/early days of work. I just think of all the fun, laughs and carefree times we had together and compare it to my life now and that just seems so grey by comparison. 

I do have different friends now (much less, though), but it seems like we talk about things like mortgages, politics...retirement...finances...which shade of Farrow and Ball to use...terrible trouble with the plumber... etc. We go for coffee or dinner but only when people can fit it in around their responsibilities. It's dull...it's as boring as fuck at times. Everything's very 'proper'. When I think of the kind of fun we used to have from being young until, say, our mid-twenties I just feel depressed. Yes, I know it's classic mid-life crisis stuff. 

It's not that I want to go back to clubbing and partying all night, what I miss is a kind of closeness that's harder to define. Texting each other all the time, phoning each other etc. With my more recent friends, it's all very formal. A phone call to arrange a dinner, at carefully spaced intervals,  where everyone talks work/children's progress or trying for a baby etc. 
  
That's OK, I know that's the focus of our lives now, but I've never had that feeling of a close knit group of friends as I did in college/uni. I can't put my finger on it. Everyone knows that life gets more serious as you get older, but somehow it feels like I'm on a trajectory of things becoming more and more dull until I just get older then die.

I also feel like there's also something different about people who knew you when you were a kid, when you teenager or young adult. It's like they know the 'real you' or something?  

Has anyone at all felt this way? I do realise that it's a bit pathetic, somehow I'm not accepting that things change and you get older, hence my username.

"Cant afford to work!?


I am currently unemployed and have signed onto universal credits , it takes 6 weeks to process , so for 6 weeks I have absolutely no income , I've been to a few job interviews since then , and it's very likely I will be working in a week, before this I will need to do 3 days training and then start , I won't be paid until the third week,  

So while waiting on universal credit to be processed I have had no income and am unable to financially  support this transition back to work ,as I won't have the fuel to cover 3 weeks , food or  electric, besides that my car tax payment didn't go through while waiting for  a universal credits  a to be processed 


So now I can no longer paydirect debit installments and  will have to pay for 6 months car insurance on top of the money I don't have, 

Universal credits has completely fucked me here 

So no car to get to work , no fuel , no food , and no electric ,

All I can do is wait , and hope the employer will wait until I can afford to get to work , Jesus Christ 

Quite a predicament , 

I've spoken to the job centre before about the possibility of this arising whilst waiting for universal credit (6 weeks)

They said they can't do anything, ring crisis loan , 

Crisis loan is no longer operating , and the phones are never answered.

Anyone know any grants etc I could ask from the job centre , or could citizens advice help
