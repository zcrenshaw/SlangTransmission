"Career advice. 31m looking for a career change.


Hello everybody.
First of all, thank you for reading this.

I am 31 years old male. Born and raised in Spain, but I have been living in the UK for about 8 years now. My wife is Scottish and we have a 16 months old son together. We live in Edinburgh.

I am currently a pastry chef and I have been for a long time. As a chef, your salary is very limited.

Things have changed in my life in the last few years. I want to be able to provide for my family in the future, so I think a career change would be the best in a long term. 

My wife has a genetic condition called Ehlers Danlos so, while she can work full time at the moment, she won't be able to keep working the same hours in the future.

I am willing to study, maybe a degree or maybe something else. 
I went to the university in Spain for about 3 years, but I never finished my degree (family related issues).

I like numbers so something related to it would be ideal (I think). I am still not sure about what to do. My wife and I were talking about this recently and, as I was at work the whole weekend, I haven't got much time to think about it properly.

Where could I look up for advice? Anybody are/was or knows somebody in a similar situation?


Thank you again!"
"Why do Indian takeaways use the foil containers but Chinese use plastic ones?


This has been the way I've seen it in every single one of these restaurants that I've ever ordered food from.  Anyone know why?  

Additionally, do you think eventually Chinese takeaways will switch from plastic now that there's a big drive to reduce plastic waste?

EDIT: TIL I need to visit more takeaways."
"People who just up and left the UK for a new start /chance at a better quality of life how has it turned out?


Just wondering if anybody has just randomly decided to leave for somewhere else and how it turned out. 

I'm coming up 24 and I'm pretty uninspired about my life at the minute. I earn good money as a graduate with promise of much better as I progress but I'm honestly just a bit sick of the routine of it all. I am about 10k into house savings,  I earn 32k so far, I don't really want for anything but I broke up with a partner a while ago and it kind of give me a fresh perspective on just how monotonous and boring I'd become (this is solely a reflection on me not people in relationships). I'm now realising I've wasted a lot of my life just motoring along. I have no real interest in paying extortionate fees for an average house that I won't even be happy with in some random town for the sake of saying I made it. I go on holiday every now and then, see friends and hit the gym before sitting in traffic for hours.

I know it's not uncommon, but I just can't bring myself to actually really care about the emails I get over petty things and when I do get paid at the end of the month, it's still grey, rainy and meh.  My attitude and general well being seems to improve rapidly in the sun, to the extent that I have these vague dreams I can finish work and go for a run in the sun or drive to the beach for a bbq (I know, this is far fetched, but it seems a LOT of people are in these situations in places like Aus/NZ). I figure if I'm going to go and struggle over house prices I may as well do it somewhere in the sun.

I'm half tempted to jack it all in and go to somewhere and try something new. I know everywhere has its problems and drawbacks, but I see more and more of my friends leaving and not coming back.


Has anybody ever done this? How'd it turn out? Any advice? Any negatives as well as positives?

Thanks"
