"How did Margaret Thatcher fuck up the country?


What does he mean by ""Thatcher fucked the kids""? https://youtu.be/4VjbV8qi94Q "
"As a pedestrian do you 'thank' drivers for stopping and letting you cross a section of road with no lights?


Asking after a conversation with my dad about how he gets really annoyed that people don't thank him, yet he never thanks people either..

I tend to just stick my hand up and smile a little bit and most people seem to get that I'm thanking them.

EDIT: Well I didn't expect this many replies, let alone so many different replies."
"Anyone else think the quality of BBC news online has gone down significantly over the last few months?


It's something people have always complained about on Reddit. Posts about how a story about some celeb is on the front page or whatever and that's only because it's the most read story or what have you. What I'm taking about is how they seem to be targeting a buzz feed audience with memes and ridiculous phrases. Look at this very important story about potential political espionage at the height of US government elections: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40560803

The language used makes me feel like I'm reading a mates Facebook post. 

And don't even get me started on the snapchat style bullshit all over the Beeb sport Wimbledon videos. 

I'm just getting old aren't I? "
