"Asked for help in December. Wanted to say thanks.


Hi, I’m Jimmy and I posted in December looking for help because I was living rough and at the end of my rope. 

I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for the support I got here, especially a certain someone who has been an ongoing  source of support and encouragement in my WhatsApp ever since, even when I was a pain to deal with. Thank you especially to him.

I am not on the streets anymore. I can’t really take any credit for getting myself safe, my uncle - my late mum’s brother - found out via Facebook what was happening and offered me a place to stay for as long as I need. I’m there now and have been since just before Christmas. 

I stopped drinking f after new year because I don’t have access to anything since they all know about my problems. I don’t know if I’d be able to keep that up if suddenly I had the access again but I am going to try, I certainly don’t want to be like that anymore. I acknowledge there’s work to do but I feel willing to do it. 

The main thing now is tackling my depression and I’m on meds now and making big steps toward that. 

So thank you. I didn’t expect anyone to much care or to be able to do anything to help me when I made that first post and I was proved really brilliantly wrong.

"Bus drivers, why are you all so grumpy? Who hurt you?


Not saying there isn't the odd one who's friendly and cheerful, but by and large bus drivers are miserable as fuck. It doesn't seem like that bad a job... What am I missing?

Maybe it's different in places other than Leeds?"

[Edit] I realise this sounds a bit jokey, but i just inherited a crane factory"
