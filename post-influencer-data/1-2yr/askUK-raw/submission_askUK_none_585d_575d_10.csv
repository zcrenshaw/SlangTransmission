"Why is Mr.Brightside so popular in the UK?


So I moved here back in September for uni, and one of the most perplexing things about your country is the sheer popularity of this song. The Killers are a reasonably popular band worldwide, but the level of enthusiasm you Brits have for this song is unparalleled. Every single time I've gone out to a club, this song has been played at least once. It's the one song literally everyone knows all the words to, the one song you can expect loads of shrieking to ensue in the first 5 seconds, the one song everyone will break out in a frenzied dance to, and the one song you can expect a number of people to start making out to...I've never witnessed anything like this before.

And then there's the astonishing fact that on New Year's, the song was trending #1 on Spotify...

So yeah, why the love?"

"Strip Clubs


American here, it's my understanding that your lowest paper bill is £5. In America we just throw $1 bills at the strippers, but how does that work in the UK since you guys only have £1 coins. Do strippers bring likes cups on the stage and shake that shit like a homeless person? 

I can't imagine throwing coins at the strippers would be thesible because of the coins potentially just rolling off the stage. Sometimes the strippers here will make you put bills in your mouth before clapping their asses on your face, taking the bills out your mouth with their asses, do y'all put coins in your mouth? Or do you just bring £5 to throw at the strippers? 

This is a legit question.    "
"Seeking religious asylum


I'm an 18 year old boy that was born to a strict Muslim family in Belfast northern Ireland (makes be a British and Irish citizen) , we later moved to england then to Saudi Arabia. I'm doing my first uni there and honestly I'm fed up with this religion and with my dad who is a very abusive controlling person. Coming out now would risk my life and I will probably be beheaded for being an apostate or beaten badly by my dad, I want to leave this country but I can't due to stupid laws in Saudi Arabia, I can however runaway if I am in another country for vacation. So my question is, does anyone know anything about seeking asylum in your own country ( for example let's say I was in Canada for vacation and and I went to the British embassy) would I be protected from my parents and brought back home? Will I have some financial support until I get back on my feet? Or do you think I should take another course of action? Any help would be appreciated. I was advised to post this here."
