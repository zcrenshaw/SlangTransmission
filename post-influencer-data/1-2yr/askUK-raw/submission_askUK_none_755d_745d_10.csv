"Why does so much of our culture revolve around drinking?


To preface this: I mean this in the least snobby/1 upish way. I know our relationship with alcohol has always been a stereotype.

But ever since I gave up drinking 18 months ago, i've realised just how much of UK life revolves around it.

Going to watch some live sport? Let's get pissed
Got into university ? That's just a massive pissup
Work lunch or meetup? Let's get a few drinks in
Christmas and New year? One massive hoon sesh
Funeral or wedding? See it off my son

Don't get me wrong. I have lots of non-drinking hobbies: Hiking, gym, sports, reading, videography. But It seems alcohol is always involved to some extent on most occasions. 

I dunno. I'm sure there are other countries who also get pissed a lot. Russians, poles etc. What do you guys think? Are we the exception or not?

TLDR: Gave up drinking and realised how much we love alcohol. Are other countries like this?

"Is everybody prepared for the inevitable 20+ minute morning commute due to schools starting in the next week?


I'm not sure about other cities and counties but in the city where I live the schools are back in action tomorrow and I know for a fact that my quiet fast commute I've enjoyed over the last 6 weeks will come to an end :("
"Best way to actually get notified of breaking news?


The BBC don't understand what breaking news is and I like the idea just not the execution.  
  
What other option are there?"
