"Are my employers legally allowed to do this


Sorry if it's in the wrong place:
My employers have recently updated their sickness absence policy and now anybody who is off with a mental health related issue will get a disciplinary on their return to work, Are they legally allowed to discipline people for having mental health issues?"
"The clocks go BACK an hour on 29th October 2017.


Enjoy the extra hour in bed **tonight** (28th Oct) as we switch back to GMT."
"Is it selfish to leave when there isn't much staff?


I want to leave KFC (shit pay) for Sainsbury's and so I was going to give the manager a two week notice but he is saying I can't. Basically our KFC is short staffed and we are always in a rush and me leaving will put a strain on everyone else plus it's unfair on the other employees he says. I'm not really fond of this manager but he does usually give me the hours I want to work so he isn't that bad. TL:DR: manager says I'm being selfish by leaving job due to short staff in KFC (it's not my problem)"
