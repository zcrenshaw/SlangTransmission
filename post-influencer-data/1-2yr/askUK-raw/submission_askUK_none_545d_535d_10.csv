"Why is Ant's drink driving arrest already being downplayed?


I am not one for celebrity news or Saturday night TV but I can't help but notice ""Dec presents Saturday Night Takeaway solo"" is headline news everywhere including on BBC. Apparently the programme included some light hearted jokes about Ant being away without even mentioning the issue let alone addressing it properly. Am I the only one really shocked by how this is evolving, there is clear financial impact with loss of contracts, sponsorship, etc. but it seems there is little social consequence. In a world where those who have committed less socially harmful acts can be labeled terms like ""disgraced"", why is it acceptable to overlook and even joke about and play down drink driving? It is a shameful act knowingly disregarding lives, even when a liked and likeable celebrity does it, it should not be taken lightly. I don't understand why this is being treated in the same vein as a celebrity who is a victim of a personal problem like drug addiction. Thankfully nobody was seriously injured or died but the reaction and tolerance shouldn't be based on this, should it?"
"78 year old not charged with murder


Will you all remember this next time it happens?  Being arrested does not mean you will be prosecuted and shouldn't be a headline."
"[Serious] What can I do to help better the situation with my Dad, who is becoming so full of hate?


I really should be putting this in relationships, but I think you guys will get it more... it really is more of a UK-issue I think.

He's just turned 50. He's on benefits, lives with my Mum who is on benefits (they are on them for valid health reasons though).

I'm 21, frequently visit for a couple of weeks when I'm back from university.

Essentially, though, he's downloaded the Daily Mail app and spends a lot of time on his phone the last year. I don't want to degrade him as much to say ""he's been brainwashed"", but seriously - he has become so. full. of hate. He drinks every night, and by the time he's had a few he's ranting and raving:

""This country is SO fucked, get out of whilst you can."" ""These cunts coming over here putting a strain on education and health"" ""All these left-wing snowflake do-gooders ruining this country too"" ""Your generation has it so easy and need to man up""

He watches Channel 4 documentaries on benefits. He is constantly reading the Daily Mail. He's ""getting into"" Tommy Robinson, watching YouTube videos and wanted to go on the ""Football Lads Alliance"" march. His political views all align with the rhetoric of the Mail, and funnily enough he's started coming out with words like ""snowflakes"", thinks Corbyn is the devil and the BBC this left-wing establishment.

So why does all this matter? Because it is changing his character. He has no intention of seeing good in people anymore, I swear. He sits reminsiing about the good ol' days, and he's only 50. He hates my generation and is so quick to generalise it. My Mum has noticed how he's so much more angry these days.

Me and My Dad are a bit different, granted. I did well at school and study at uni in London, I'm gay and that took him time to come to terms with. He grew up in London and left school at 16, now lives in a town in the north.

I've tried time and time again to debate with him (he's normally drink) and have called him out on becoming a mouthpiece for the Daily Mail. I really don't want this to read as me being upset that he has different opinions as me - it really isn't like that. I'm just upset/frustrated that he's becoming someone so ignorant of fact, lacking any compassion and has severe hatred towards certain groups, and thinking he knows and he can like he knows about these ""left-wing students"" when he hasn't stepped foot in a university and knows one person who's been to uni: me.

I'm asking this because it kinda boiled over last night. He started saying how easy my generation has it (completely at odds with him saying the country is fucked though...), and staying saying at how he'd ""shoot the sharia fuckers in the sea trying to come over here.""

Is there anything I can actually do to try and prevent him becoming such a bigot? Because he's generally testing our relationship right now. It's easy to say ""just don't mention politics"", but its hard when I'm back at the home and he wants to put a Channel 4 doc on and is constantly reading the Mail and bringing up stuff.

Thanks."
