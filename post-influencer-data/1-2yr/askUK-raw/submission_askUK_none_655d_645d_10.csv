"Should the NHS/govt offer free first aid lessons?


I was told in a CPR course that only 7% of people survive a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital in the UK, whereas in countries with more prolific first aid training, it's up to 40%. 

And think about it, surely the money saved from someone intervening sooner in even just one stroke or heart attack (in terms of initial treatment and surgery costs, and then medication, rehab, and follow-up care for life, all in the tens of thousands or more) would easily be equivalent to several thousand basic first aid training spaces? Across the whole population, I'm sure the treatment and care costs saved by early intervention (or even just the knowledge to self-treat less serious things that people currently visit A&amp;E for) would easily cover widespread basic first aid training and more?

Sometimes I get funny looks when Im walking and stop to give a cat attention. It's only recently occurred to me that I might be the weird one."
