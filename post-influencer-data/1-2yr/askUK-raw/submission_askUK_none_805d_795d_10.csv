"I accepted a job that paid low, first job out of uni and now I regret it and want to leave. Please help


I applied to the job a week before my final hand in and the company seem really enthusiastic, young and full of potential. 

After a month of working here I hate, it's a small office (5 people including the 2 directors) I only get paid 16k as a CAD Designer. I don't know how to tell them that I can't afford to buy food because you only pay me 16k. I want to tell them to stop calling me a dog every time I sneeze.

I want to. But the company accountant and HR are the directors. They make open jokes about my pay. I keep myself to myself and just get my work done. But they always seem to find something pick on about me. 

I need to get out this place. I should be back in London with my family. But I don't know what to do with my studio flat. How do I get out of the short hold tenancy and leave?

I would appreciate any advice or guidance 

|UPDATE|

So Over the last 2 weeks, I've applied to over 30 Places. A few have gotten back to me. However, there is job offer that I'm not too sure about. It's for a Design Technician for a Private school in London. Everything seems good about it. But I'm not sure if I take it, what would be my opportunities of getting another job within the Design/Engineering sector?"
