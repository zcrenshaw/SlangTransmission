"Can anyone help me propose to my girlfriend with a high res scan of a uk rail ticket?


Hi everyone,

10 years ago I met my girlfriend on the train from London to Manchester. After a long decade I am finally doing the honourable thing and asking her to marry me. I want to recreate the ticket that we would have had on that journey. I am able to make the necessary changes to the destination, date etc. I just need a high resolution scan of a ticket ([the ones that look like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/ShereFASTticket-Example.png)) If no one is able to help I'll have to pop out and buy a scanner, but I thought I would see if anyone might be able to help me out first!

Thank you all in advance."
"Why do gumtree people all do this baffling thing?


You post something. It’s a good item. The price is extremely attractive.

Someone will answer immediately, say they want it, exchange numbers, say that they’re on the way and will be there at a specific time or day (sometimes they say they’re on their way now).

Then they don’t show up and cut contact

Everything I have ever sold on gumtree has had at least one of these doughnuts muck me about before someone normal shows up and actually buys the thing.

It’s like a psychological affliction suffered by a certain amount of the population or something.

Another large shop in administration! How long until there is no shops? Which ones will survive??


I had an amazon basket full of items for a coming up camping trip - had a few bits totalling £54. I thought instead of using Amazon I'll give the high street a go. Went into Millets and to be fair they had everything I needed. I added up all the same items and they were £143! Plus the ones an Amazon had been reviewed giving me the security I was buying a decent product. 

Why does anyone use the high street shops as anymore?
