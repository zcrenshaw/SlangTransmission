"Friend told by estate agents that they weren't allowed to let their children share a room because they weren't the same gender


As the title says - my friend and his wife have been looking for a new place and they found a 2 bedroom house they really liked. Whilst viewing it the estate agent asked them if they had children - yes, a 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. The estate agent then told them they weren't allowed to share a bedroom due to 'anti-incest laws' and was adamant about it, even though my friend wanted to put a partition in the room anyway.

Is this legit or is it a shitty way to push them to look at more expensive 3 bed places? When I heard this my reaction was to think the latter, and put a complaint in and probably look for another estate agent (because it's disgusting), but I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and what my friend should do (and whether I'm overreacting)...

"Has there been an increase in anti-UK propaganda?


Hey guys, American here, so everything I've seen in relation to this question has been on the internet.

I was just curious if any of you have noticed an increase in propaganda against your country in the last couple of weeks? I've seen several memes like, ""UK left free speech behind a while ago"" or ""The UK can tell who doesn't have a television license, but can't find criminals."" 

These comments seem to playing off an ignorance of the UK and without context or nuance shape people's perception of the UK. 

I was just curious if this was just me noticing it, or if it was a trend. "
"I need help helping an old man get his boiler repaired


Hi. The last few weeks I have had an old gentleman leaving me voicemails. His boiler is broken, he's very cold, and starting to sound very ill. He has the wrong number dialling me, and he is asking for help to fix his boiler. I believe he is trying to reach his landlord or a friend.

When I try return the call it says the number cannot be found. I also never have a missed call on my phone. My call log never shows him having rung me either (this makes me think his number is ex-directory). I have no idea why my phone never rings when he phones me though, and neither do my mobile provider. I unblocked every number on my phone, and yet still when he rang I didn't have a missed call. Just a new voicemail appeared. I also have a voicemail greeting so I'm hoping surely he recognises it's not the person he is after.

I'm starting to worry about him. The last few messages he left he sounds very ill.

I have been to my mobile provider and they can't do anything. I've been to citizen advice and they also cannot do anything. My last option is to go the police.

I've grabbed the voice mails he left me and I've shared them below. He sound like he is northern, but generally is not very coherent.  

***Please have a listen and try translate for me what he is saying***. A few times he mentions his name and the person he is trying to reach, but I can't make them out.

This is one of the earlier calls he left me [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X87WNHGL6ixeb4DMCrVTDocazyR7acYY).

Here is another call [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qi92KpZ8B4U4359h8qnGDN95G_NUqhKM/view?usp=sharing)

The second to last voicemail I have from him [HERE]
(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GYz2Ke_JF2BIucrPZVmoqYLxqm15JjrP)

And finally the most recent call where he sounds pretty unwell [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEaHv5jXvsyQU2ryqRfXVX1T1vbb7mT0/view?usp=sharing).

Any help, translation, or advice people can give would be really appreciated. My next step is to go to the police and hope they can help.

Thanks all.


**Update 1. (28/3)**
I phoned 101 and went through to South Yorkshire police. Sadly I was put on hold for almost half hour and being that I'm at work couldn't wait much longer, so I've filled in a crime report online at the South Yorkshire police website. I should hopefully hear back within 24 hours."
