"Name something that is generally considered normal in US but not accepted or outlandish in UK.


For example: In the US we typically pay for our drinks *after* we are done drinking but in the UK you pay for them as you get them. What are some of your examples?"
"What do you think about legalising marijuana in the UK?


With the recent changes about the legality of marijuana in the US and supposed medical benefits does anyone think marijuana should be made legal in the US.

Personally I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs and wouldn’t start even if it was legal. But after thinking about the medical side of the drug (I.e. Parkinson’s, arthritis, and cancer pain relief) I thought how that may have benefited they people around me.

My grandmother had been severely disable for most of her life due to arthritis and only got worse at the end. When the arthritis got much worse she was given morphine which helped but took away her passions as she could no longer knit or read properly.

So what does everyone else think about making marijuana legal?"
"How do curry restaurants make so many different types of curry so quickly?


I have wondered this all my life. The menu for the curry takeaway near me has about 25 different curries and delivers in 30 minutes.

And the curry is really nice. So if they are just microwaving it (please tell me they're not?) How come microwave curries from Tesco are so immensely inferior?"
