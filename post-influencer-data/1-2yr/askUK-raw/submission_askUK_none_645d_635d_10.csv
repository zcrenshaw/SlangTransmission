"If my partner doesn't get out of hospital in time, we'd like to offer someone our holiday ðŸŒº


My partner was admitted to hospital last night and I highly doubt he's going to be out in time to take us all on our planned holiday. The company we booked with doesn't offer refunds under any circumstances so if we don't turn up then the place will just sit empty for four days and I'm not having that! 

So if you don't have any serious plans for New Years perhaps you'd like the option of spending four nights in a little cottage in Whitby. You'll most likely need your own car and I won't be able to confirm until tonight so you'll need to be flexible. The booking starts tomorrow the 30th and runs until 4th January. The place itself is small but big enough for two people sharing (or one on the couch), not wheelchair accessible, self catering, and has a log fire, private garden and is a few mins from the beach. 

I hope there's someone out there who is in a position to take advantage of this just in case they won't let my partner out in time or if he's too tired t o drive etc... Please leave me a comment below if you're interested and I'll be in touch to confirm. 

Thanks!  

EDIT: thanks to everyone who got in touch, I have now successfully offloaded my holiday onto a hardworking Redditor from Birmingham. Happy New Year everyone!"
"Looking for UK brother I never met


Dear reddit, this year, in January, my fater died at 96 years, I discovered he had another son in UK conceived while he was POW (Prisoner of War) during the WWII. I'm Italian, from South of Italy (my hometown is the nickname I have here on reddit).

Below the info I have: 1) My father has been POW in the Spalding Camp (I suppose is this one -&gt; http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/pow/powcamp.php?pid=2884 )

2) The child name should be Tony or Anthony or Antonio (not sure..)

3) He should have been born in 1946, probably on November 17th or November 19th

4) I have a pic of this boy that has been made from ""T. GOOCH - ST. GILES ST - Norwich"" (that is what is printed on the back of the photograph, it is likely the photographer address)

5) His mother name could be ""Lilian"" or ""Margareth"" but I can't guarantee that it is correct. I have also a pic that I suppose belongs to her...but since my father is dead I cannot be 100% sure.

From what I understood my mother forced my father to cut all the links with this son when they married (he married her some year after came back from UK, in 1949 but she died too this year)

Do you have some hint that can help to find him?

I can upload the 2 pics I have if you think that can be of some help.

Thank you in advance and sorry for my poor English

Luigi

TL;DR : I discovered my dead father had another son in UK while he was POW. Looking for help to find him.
