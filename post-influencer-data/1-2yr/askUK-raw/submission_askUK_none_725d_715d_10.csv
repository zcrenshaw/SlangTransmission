"Help me! I am stuck outside my flat because my door was painted, I have no idea what to do or who to call


So I just got home from work and I'm stuck outside my flat. The management of my building have been repainting the entire building, including the doors. They did ask my permission, and I said it was fine to do.

However, they've painted the door and the door frame, and the door has now formed a glue-like seal with the frame. I can't get in at all. My neighbours have tried to help forcing the door open, or using knives to try and break the seal. Nothing we can do is working. Who do I call? The management company isn't responding, and my landlord can't do much. The fire brigade? Is there a product I can buy to solve this?"
"What are some things that the majority of the British does not take advantage of simply because they don't know about them?


Saw this thread over in /r/Switzerland and thought it would be useful to also have one just for UK"
