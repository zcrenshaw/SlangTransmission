"How are UK young adults different from US young adults?


U.S. resident here.  I grew up with plenty of UK pop culture influences, and as you know we are all pretty familiar with UK politics and lifestyle.

However...I just accidentally got sucked into a reality show of some kind on YouTube and only watched a few minutes, but it was the typical format of young adults in a house living together, blah blah.

Seeing all the British youth living together and interacting, I could not quite put my finger on what was so different about their behaviors and way they interacted.

In your opinion, how are UK young adults different from US young adults?  Of course the caveat is that this was reality TV so everything was somewhat hammed up and manufactured.

"Why aren't people who are arrested given anonymity until they are convicted?


Recently we had the banker who was accused of pushing a lady under a bus, he was cleared quickly but he still got death threats and had his reputation trashed in the meantime. 

All those celebs who were cleared of sex offences decades ago and had their lives completely ruined in the process. They couldn't get work before being cleared because no one wanted to be associated with them at the time. Many people still don't want anything to do with them even after being cleared."
