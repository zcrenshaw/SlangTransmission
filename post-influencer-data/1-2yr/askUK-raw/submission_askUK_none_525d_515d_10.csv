"Do posh men love wearing bizarrely-coloured clothing? And why?


By bizarre I mean red trousers, brightly-coloured socks, salmon pink shirts, sky blue trousers etc.

My friend claims I'm just talking about hipsters and doesn't seem to know what I'm on about, but I'm more referring to Hooray Henry, Eton and the Guards types whose family own half of Somerset etc. 

It is definitely a thing, isn't it?"
"Why am I being blinded by courgettes?


Going for the post title of the day award.

Sleeping in a room with even small courgette seedlings really irritates my eyes.  They start to struggle to focus, weep and feel heavy and bruised.  Eventually I get permanently blurred vision.

This has happened 2 different years.  Other seedlings (usually tomatoes). don't upset me, and I've been allergy tested recently and got a clean bill of health.

I did Google and apparently the plants can occasionally mutate and become violently bitter and poisonous, but the seedlings went on to produce edible courgettes last time this happened.

And yes, I can move them somewhere else, I am just curious."

How good was it? What did you get? How did you get it? Did you sell much of it?"
