"Anyone else getting really uncomfortable with these ""pedo hunter groups?""


I wake up and my phone is full of texts telling me to check Facebook because apparently a guy who I used to go to school a few years ago was caught in some sort of predator catch. 

I hate facebook but I was curious about what's going on and as soon as I log in I've loads of messages and this guy's video is plastered everywhere and instantly I recognise him as one of the school's ""special needs"" needs pupils. The video shows him being cornered in an alley and told he was being filmed for his security as bad things might happen if the camera is turned off. Supposedly he wanted to meet a 14 year old boy.

The video is pretty horrific with at least five men barely restraining themselves from hitting a man who probably has an I.Q of a child. This really isn't an exaggeration the men seemed to be looking for any excuse to hit someone who because of a severe mental handicap didn't sit their GCSEs.

The video continues to be seriously uncomfortable viewing and gets worse when you see these chavy looking men restrain a very frail, small and obviously handicapped man against a wall until he answers them and then instructs him to take them to his parent's house.

Until now I was pretty ambivalent about these groups activities I was uncomfortable with the idea of mob justice but given police cutbacks and the huge damage predators can cause children I thought they were a sad necessity. But even a quick glance of this group's page is an absolute shitshow if you ignore the usual death threats to pedos you've got:

*On the video of this special needs man being accosted you've people, from my school, in the comments suggesting that other special needs pupils who happened to be friends with this individual are also pedos. They're using the full names of special needs people and suggesting that they're somehow also pedos because of a friendship they had three years ago with another special needs pupil. Half the comments as well are outright hateful to special needs people in general and there is no way to report this to an admin. 

*Anyone posting anything contradictory to the group is immediately called a pedo sympathiser among other names. Examples include someone asking if the individuals are actually prosecuted, someone saying that it was a bad idea to physically grab a 'pedo,' and another person calling out the group for getting in an argument with the police. 

*The group posting about how the police took one of their member's phone and how the police are pedos because the man ""has his children's photos on it!"" Most people in the group seem to think the police are somehow protecting pedos and the police are subjected to vicious attacks eveytime the hunters claim the police somehwoe stopped the group or didn't arrest a ""pedo.""

*Dragging people out of their homes and threatening to tell neighbours, employers etc. if they don't comply with their video. Which they then do regardless. In one video a man refuses to leave his home and they pull him out and then take him door to door and force him to tell his neighbours he's a pedo. 

*Group drama: you've got everything from a young woman who they use as a 'child decoy,' posting semi-nude photos of herself to the group to a barrage of likes from people who are calling for the death penalty for people who talk to her with the impression she's 14. Then you've got splinter groups saying the main group aren't aggressive enough and even other groups accusing the main group of predator hunters as being pedos and using other pedos to hide their paedophilia. It's almost laughable. 

*There seems to be a really nasty trend of accusing vulnerable and lonely individuals. There always seems to be these... let's be frank attention whore woman... making wild accusations against that one ""odd-looking man who lives up the street,"" and claiming fifteen years ago that man touched her, and then loads more woman who makes up the same thing. Maybe it's all true but then surely they should go to the police instead you get hordes of really rough men offering to go speak to these men to protect these woman's honour. It's really, really disturbing especially as only last year this group resulted in an innocent's man house being burnt down.

I am not against these groups completely they might sadly be necessary given the lack of resources the police have, and I suspect this group might be particularly bad and not representative of most of these groups.  But what I saw and read today made me very uncomfortable and does make me worry about the direction of this country when we let this sort of mob justice. 

TLDR: These hunter groups are a shitshow.
