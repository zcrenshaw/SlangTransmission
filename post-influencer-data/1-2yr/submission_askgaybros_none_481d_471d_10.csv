"I came out to my Arab mom


She was cleaning the kitchen like she always does and I said I needed to tell her something, so she came to sit with me in the living room. I was so anxious I felt like my heart was about to stop and I started crying uncontrollably. She looked like she was about to cry too. Then I confessed everything. I thought she was going to be so angry, but she was actually relieved. She told me she thought that there was a death in the family and was very emotional. After that she said she wanted to invite my boyfriend over for dinner.

I will probably be in the closet (to the public) for the rest of my life because of society, but I don't care what society thinks now that I know my mom supports me. "
"I came out to my cat


At first I thought she was accepting, but later that day she took a big shit on the carpet. How should I punish her for her bigotry?"
"Guys, can we pls get past the ""I'm gay but not sterotypically gay""bullshit?


I mean seriously people, we're all simply gay. It's already hard for us to be; no need to make it harder by some sort of nonsensical division amongst ourselves. 

You can prefer to like feminine or masculine or whatever people, but that's something entirely different. Your preferred sexual attraction type shouldn't get in the way of indiscrimination amongst ourselves 

Also, if someone treats you ""well"" just because you're not sterotypically gay but gay, it simply means they'd behave the same negative way to you given the chance. 

I know it's not easy, but please do not let these so called gay-supporters-but-not-sterotypically-gay-supporters slip to your most inner circle and adapt their way of thinking in the process. 

Thanks bros.

"Not angry, just disappointed. A RANT.


I feel so old.
Not because I am old or because I feel tired, but because of some of the bullshit I hear from the younger members of the LGBT+ so-called community that I really thought we‚Äôd seen the back of. 

You think your gay, bi and trans forefathers and grandmothers faced down police, skinheads, bombs in our pubs, hate preachers at our Pride marches, discriminatory laws and employment practices and getting disowned by families and friends all in the name of acceptance and diversity and smashing out of conformity‚Ä¶ just so that you could set up a whole new set of fucking rules to judge each other by and tell other LGBT+ folk whether they were in or out?

Fuck you with your slut-shaming and your masc vs femme and your no blacks no asians and your twinks and twunks and otters and bears and your ever tinier and tinier and more restrictive boxes. We don‚Äôt need it. We went through it before and we tore it down.

I don‚Äôt care if you like football or barbie dolls or both or neither. The qualification for being gay is being sexually attracted to the same sex and not to the opposite sex. Nobody is more or less gay. Nobody is a better or worse gay. ‚ÄúStraight boys who like cock‚Äù are NOT a thing. 

Get it together, homos - you don‚Äôt hear this shit from the lesbians. "
"Bareback is all the rage, and it's terrifying.


I conducted a variety of social experiments on Grindr over the weekend, and came to the exasperating conclusion that basically anyone is fine with bareback. I live in a big city, so I had some options.

- First, I used my actual pics to get guys. I'm a skinny, blue-eyed, white bottom twink, a dime a dozen on Grindr. Maybe a 7/10.  Anyway, I managed to get 37 guys who said they'd meet me and top me over the course of the weekend (I have Grindr unlimited so I can see more people). I asked them, and 33/37 said they'd bareback and breed me. This is unacceptable! It's so dangerous! Not to cast judgement, but this needs to be remedied. 22 of them didn't even ask if I was clean! I know PrEP is a thing, but not everyone is on it (I didn't specify if I was) and it doesn't protect against anything except HIV. I was scared by my results.

- I also used some pics of my good friend (with his permission) a hot college jock type. Think 9/10. Out of the 29 bottoms who said they were dtf, 28 of them said I could breed them. Wth is this? It's not like I went looking for bare, or anything. 

- So then I thought ""Maybe the question is skewed. I'll just ask ""Condoms or bare?"" next time."" So, repeating both experiments, incidents did slightly go down of people wanting bb, but still fully 16/21 tops said they wanted bare and 12/15 bottoms. 

This is crazy to me. Also, I know I led people on and will probably get down voted for that, but it was for science and I didn't do anything to hurt them. I feel bad but it was for a good cause. And I did meet with one guy so it wasn't a waste of *everyone's* time. "
"So Takei was framed....


The Observer did an investigation and the accuser's story basically completely fell apart.  http://observer.com/2018/05/george-takei-accuser-scott-brunton-changed-his-story-of-drugs-assault/  
Besides the story completely changing over time, admitting it may never have happened, and the date rape drug he said he was given not even existing at the time, the motivation for the accusation is clear:    
‚ÄúHe was 20 years older than me and short. And I wasn‚Äôt attracted to Asian men.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúI was a hot, surfer, California boy type, that he probably could have only gotten had he bought, paid for or found someone just willing to ride on his coattails of fame.‚Äù  
His racist ass took advantage of the metoo media frenzy at the time to buy himself 15 more minutes of fame at the cost of a gay icon and role model and basic human dignity.  What can we even take away from all of this?"
"Hey bros in case you haven‚Äôt heard it today. You‚Äôre wonderful and I‚Äôm proud you made it through the day. Keep it up.

"What does your partner call you in public?



Mine calls me baby. Fairly innocuous until it's yelled out in supermarkets, rail stations, anywhere really. I'll suddenly hear ""BAYBEEE!"". Folk look expecting to see some demure female and clock me... A 51 year old, 16 stone, bearded, motorcyclist. My partner is a theatre type who will address everyone as darling. It's probably a good job this amuses me rather than mortifys."
"I figured it would be easier to answer multiple questions at once.


""Does anyone like guys who...."" probably

""is it weird that I like...."" no

""Is he gay?"" you know him better than we do

""does he like me?"" Did you ask him?

""Who's in the wrong here?"" Would you listen to us if we told you?

""I'm &lt;25. will i be single forever?"" no

""I'm 25&lt; will i be single forever?"" no

""how do I find dates?"" dried fruits aisle at your grocery store

""no really, how do I find dates?"" apps/bars/special interest clubs

""how do I find dates if I'm socially awkward?"" work on your social anxiety/ awkwardness.

""Does anybody else..."" probably

""How do I seduce a straight guy?"" why would you want to?

""Is _____ a gay friendly city?"" If it's big enough to be heard of, probably.

""what's the sexiest sex you've ever sexed?"" eh... I'll just make up an answer to help you cum tonight.

""am I ugly forever?"" with that attitude? yes

that's my opinion take it or leave it."
"PSA: Hot guys are hot


One day it's ""omg this ripped Asian dude is so fine!"" The previous day it's ""handsome middle eastern guys make my dick tip drip drip üçÜüí¶üí¶""

Today it's ""this 6'6 muscular cop daddy fucked my brains out. I usually only like smol twink latinos but I guess I can settle even tho he's not my type lol""

hot guys are hot, people. Skin color is irrelevant if the guy is hot. Your preferences are irrelevant if the dude is hot. I don't care if you usually only like thicc bear daddies. If the hunk from wherever starts barking up your tree, you're gonna fall out and land on his cock. 

That is all. "
"You know that dude that's not really your type? Give him a chance.


So, I'm about average build, white, 5'8"" 160lbs (+/- 10 or so) and I typically go for small-frame/slender, smooth guys, especially Black or Latin American guys.  

Well there's a guy who I've seen at a local bar a few times, and he's a good looking guy, he's a BIG guy, not fat, just a huge dude.  6'6"" 230, reddish/blonde, muscular, sleeve tattoos, white as the driven snow, a purebred viking if you ever saw one. Not ugly at all, simply not my type.  He introduced himself once, and from that point on, would usually give me the bro-nod whenever he saw me.  

One afternoon as I was leaving work early, I got into a mediocre car accident, the police showed up, and to my surprise, this guy was one of the responding officers.  They cleared the scene, and he offered me a ride back to my place, which was only a few miles away, and we made the usual small-talk, as I was getting out, he told me that he got off at 3, and asked if I wanted to ""grab a burger and a beer, or something""  I almost said No, but then I figured, fuck it, why not?  The day was already shit, I had just totaled my car that hadn't even been paid off for a whole month yet, and the accident was my fault, which put me late to miss my appointment that I was leaving for.  So, sure, some greasy food, and some booze sounded mighty good.  

He met me after his shift, we went to a local pub for some food and drinks.  In talking to him, he is a SUPER down to earth guy, loves dogs, we had a lot of outdoorsy stuff in common, we're both skiers, and love to kayak. We both kind of had a bit to drink, (you know where this is going) so, yeah, he came back to my place, and we had sex.  This was totally not my intent either, however, as I got drunker, I kept wondering things, I've never slept with a guy this big, I wonder what his body is like, God, he has PERFECT teeth, I wanna fuck a cop, etc. etc. 

It was everything.  I was (and still am) in awe of his body, his hair, the size of his arms and legs, the softness of his skin, the tattoos, his ass, his feet, his thick perfectly-sized uncut dick.  He left, and we did the exchange numbers thing, sent the obligatory "" I had a nice time"" texts, and that was it, well, a few days later he checked in to see how I was and the car situation, and we had another ""date"".  The dates became more frequent, then he spent the night, and it was amazing.  I had never know what people meant when they said to ""feel safe"" around someone.  But I do now, just the way he'd wrap his arms around me when we snuggle, it was like being wrapped up in a force field.  Nothing was going to ever hurt me.  

This is a weird feeling, because while physically I am not attracted to him.  Emotionally, I love him, and he makes me so fucking happy.   

We're going on a year together, and it's amazing.  I've been engagement ring shopping all day. 

So .... If someone isn't your physical type, do me a favor and give them a chance anyway, please, for me.  You never know the guy you could end up with "
"My bf is sick and im kinda happy about it


HE. IS. SO. CUTE. 

I love feeding him, holding him, and rubbing his tummy. Like a baby. Hes also really needy, so we cuddle a lot more than usual. "
"Does it piss anyone else off when minorities are homophobic?


I'm bringing this up because I just saw a post on Facebook where the comments are full of black people throwing fits over a picture of two married black men. These have to be the biggest hypocrites in the world. How can you be bigoted against an oppressed class of people when you yourself are constantly complaining about being oppressed? Now don't take this as me defending racism or the systematic oppression black people have experienced in America. I'm just saying if you are from a class of people regularly discriminated against and yet you have the nerve to discriminate against another class of people, I've lost all sympathy for your struggles, not the whole group's, just yours personally. I hate hypocrites, and you are the worst kind! "
"When I see a hot guy, I half want to fuck him and half want to BE him, do others feel the same?


I think this is one of the hardest things to get over when you're gay (male or female), and also something straight people can never understand.

It isn't so bad when it's a genuine attraction to a colleague/friend/acquaintance that you have met. But having a 'crush' on someone you barely know but see often, or even a celebrity, I get these feelings, particularly if the person has similar demographics to me (age, on my course at uni etc). It makes me feel like a low self-esteem teen again: fancying the 'jocks' in school, but also being super jealous. 

Is this a normal reaction? I don't want to wind up being one of those partners who drives their boyfriend away by being all 'you're too good for me/ why are you with me?/are you cheating?' Etc etc"
"Asian muscular guys


Please keep up what you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm at the gym right now and I keep seeing muscular asian guys with half sleeve tattoos and they‚Äôre driving me nuts. No one else can pull off earrings and tattoos like an asian guy can. Hot damn!"
"Simple math to answer most questions on this sub


Create a graph:
* Hotness (0-10) on the y axis 
* Importance of the friendship (0-10) on the x axis
* Draw a line from (0 , 0) to (10 , 10)
* Plot all of your straight friends based on their hotness and the importance of the friendship
* For any points fall above the line drawn in step 3, offer to suck their dick.
* For points that fall below the line in step 3, just be friends.

Problem solved!"
