"I just had to explain to an adult how quarters work.


This just happened. 

Drive thru, taking cash, providing adequate customer service, flirting with old ladies; that's my day.

Enter Quarter-Brain, reasoning for the namesake shall soon be readily apparent.

QB- Do you take those Quarter-Dollars?

I'm a bit perplexed by this. Was she referring to the Dollar coins that are roughly the size of a quarter? Did the US mint put out a new Dollar? What...

She then hands me a quarter. A regular quarter. One of the state quarters. Kentucky to be exact. These are, and have always been, worth 25 cents. There is nothing special about them currency wise. They also have ""QUARTER DOLLAR"" emblazoned on the front. I can understand a 1st Grader getting tripped up by the wording but this was a fully grown, adult, woman.

QB- That's worth a dollar, right?  
Me- No, this is a quarter.  
QB- But why does it say Quarter Dollar on it?

Now, dear reader, you may be wondering if she was simply fucking with me? I assure you she was not. There was no trace of irony, sarcasm, or humor in her voice. She was seriously asking me why a quarter was called a quarter.

Me, completely serious, as if I were a teacher addressing a student- It's called a quater dollar because its value is equal to one quarter of a dollar. Twenty-five cents.

She looks at me with skepticism, then her quarters, and I come to the realization that I an watching a grown-ass adult come to the conclusion that ""Quarter Dollar"" literally means ""Quarter of a dollar"". She then begins to ask about Half Dollar coins but stops herself mid sentence, hopefully from realizing that she was well on her way towards proving the criticisms of the US Education System correct.

Now, here's where it's confirmed that at no point was this some elaborate joke. She considers the money she has. It's mostly quarters. She has me remove items from her order upon concluding, after learning that quarters are, in fact, not dollars, she does not have enough money.

So yeah... fun times.

"""I'm returning this."" ""No.""


Hello, everyone! I hope you all had a happy Easter/April Fool's day/first Sunday of April. This happened earlier today and I'm still fuming over it.  
As I said, today is Easter, so all of our Easter stuff is 50% off. This lead to a massive shortage of eggs and baskets, leaving mostly candy and paper goods. A customer (we'll call him BG for Bunny Guy) comes up with only one boxed chocolate bunny. Easy enough, I ring him up, total of $1.99, and he walks away. He doesn't go very far, sitting at a table we have on display by the registers. No problem, he's probably just hungry and wants to eat it now. I keep an eye on him, watching as he slowly eats the chocolate bunny over the course of 30 minutes. As soon as he finishes eating, he gets up, walks right up to me (skipping the entire line), and drops the empty box on my counter.  
&gt;BG: I'm returning this.  

I'm. Returning. This. No arguing allowed. No complaining allowed. **I'M. RETURNING. THIS.**  

&gt;Me: No.  
&gt;BG: What?  
&gt;Me: No. I'm not returning this.  
&gt;BG: No. You HAVE to return this.  
&gt;Me: NO. I don't. One, we don't take returns on food items, period. Two, this has *clearly* been opened and used. Three, you only have the *packaging*, not the *product*. I will not be returning this item.  
&gt;BG: You're a f*cking thief. I want to talk to your manager.  

Oh, *I'M* the thief? I'm not the one returning an empty box. And he wants to talk to a manger? I'll do one better.  

&gt;Me: Gladly. (On the radio) Security to the front, please. Security to the front.  

He didn't even wait for me to finish making the call. He bolted out the door, leaving his disgusting box behind. Our ""security team"" was just the manager, who was just as angry as I was when I told him what the customer tried to do. I threw out the box, spent a minute calming down, then went back to work.  
Happy Easter, everyone!"
