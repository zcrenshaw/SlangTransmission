"""That's odd, your coupon won't work...""


First time posting here. 

To put things into context, I used to work for a major retailer. Frequent coupons were a big part of the company's business model. On this occasion, they had handed out sealed coupons for various amounts between $10 and $100. I believe each store only got 1 $100 coupon, and most of the rest were for $10. These days were typically stressful as they seemed to attract some of our worst customers.

While I'm at the register, an older lady (OL) walked up to purchase a few fashion jewelry items so she could use the $10 coupon that had been handed to her. I went through the transaction in a normal fashion, scanned her items, and then picked up her coupon and scanned it as well. I looked back at my screen, and for some reason, the system said that this coupon didn't qualify. I went through the items to make sure none of them were restricted and double-checked to make sure her total before tax is above $10. Everything seemed okay so I tried scanning the coupon again and got the same error message. I decided to check the coupon to make sure it was legitimate and what not. That's when I realize that the coupon was actually for $100 off.

I informed OL as to why her coupon wouldn't work. She was shocked, and incredibly happy about it so I told her to go pick out some more items. She came back with a handful of items, and I added them to the transaction. To our surprise, several of the items rang up lower than what they were marked at so she headed back out again. After a few more trips with similar results, she finally got her total over $100, and I finished out her transaction.

As I rang up her items, OL started to tear up, and thanked me for all of my help with her. She then asked me to call for a manager so she could give me a good review. As we waited for my manager, she began to tell me why she was crying. It turned out that she had just come from probate court where she had been dealing with the estate of a loved one who had recently died. On top of that OL's grandson was undergoing open heart surgery. The only reason OL came to the mall was to keep herself distracted from how stressed she was about the surgery. Eventually, my manager showed up, OL took a picture with me, and hugged me to thank me for helping her and talking with her. She went on her way, and I went back to work, this time with a real smile on my face."
"I'm not the store, you can't buy things I own.


This story happpened a few months ago (late May) and I work at a pretty popular garden center.

I don't really know why, but this garden center had a hell of a time trying to keep strawberry plants in stock. We would always sell out within 48 hours of any shipments. 

One day we got like 80 six-pack strawberry plants, and they were 4.99. Which is crazy cheap and we'd never had them before and of course we literally sold out in hours, but not before I grabbed three of them, bought them, and stashed them behind my register.

It was later that same day and a customer was buying some single plant strawberry plants from the same shipment, which were 3.99 each but much bigger than each little plant in the six-pack. She started complaining about how expensive these were per plant and points to the six-packs on a shelf behind me. She asks if we have any left.

""No, we sold out of those.""

""Well, are those for another customer?""

""Yes, I bought them."" (Probably a mistake to say but I wasn't expecting crazy.)

""YOU bought them?""

""Yes.""

""So I can still buy them!""

""No...""

""Why not? If you're the one who bought them, you work here, I can still buy them, it's not like another customer bought them.""

""Ma'am, I am an employee but I'm also a paying customer of this store. Things I buy from here are my property and you could buy them from *me* but I'm not selling them.""

""I don't understand. You're a part of this store. Please just give them to me, don't be difficult.""

""They're my property.""

""But you work for this store, so the store still owns them.""

""Look I'm not giving them to you, I'm sorry.""

""I'll be sending in a complaint. You can't lie about things being out of stock!""

She luckily didn't ask to speak to my manager but my manager later thought this was hilarious. I don't know what she was thinking, that the store literally owns me or I literally own the store, so the money goes right back in my pocket? It just doesn't make sense "
