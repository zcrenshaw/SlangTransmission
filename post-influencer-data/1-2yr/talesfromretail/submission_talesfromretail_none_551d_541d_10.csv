"I don't want to complaint to my ""Big Friend""


Typing on mobile and not a native English speaker, so apologies in advance.

I work at a relatively small (family owned) company that sells construction materials.

My best story ever was the following:

Client comes in and I go to him and ask want can I do for him. He tells me that he is looking for prices for a diversity of materials and he also wishes to see said materials (pretty standard).

While I'm showing him the materials he wants, he says something in the lines of: ""you better get me a good discount or I'll have to complaint with my very good friend Mr. Store Owner"".

I said I'll do my best and continue to tour him throughout the shop. (during said tour he repeated the behavior 3 or 4 more times)

When we get back at the office  I started writing the quote for him and twice more he warns me to get the discount or he will complain to his very good friend, Mr. Store Owner.

I'm almost finishing with the quote when Mr. Store Owner enters the office. Client starts talking with him very enthusiasticly like they were long lost brothers. For my part I just put my best smiled and said to Mr. Store Owner: ""Hi Dad!""

The color of the client's face stills gives me the chuckles.

TL/DL: client wanted big discount because he was such a good friend with the boss, but never saw me in his entire life. I'm the boss's son. "
"get out of my store


so im working cash and this older gentaleman is coming down the way, hes the only one there and he has a walker so hes slow but hes coming. Out of nowhere this blond woman comes from the aisle, straight to my register and says ""im in a hurry old man."" Now this gentlamn almost stumbles back because this woman made him have to stop so abruptly. She sets her basket on the counter and i say ""i'm not going to serve you, you need to wait in line, hes next."" She claims to be in a hurry and that the old man will take too long and i shrug saying 'thats no my problem.' 

She starts ranting and raving about how shes a customer and i have to serve her and blah blah blah and then she asks for my manager. I smile call my manager and of course she refuses to leave that spot. The older gentleman is not saying anything, he looks very tired and hes shaking a little so i help him sit down while we all wait for my manager. 

My manager comes and the woman says that i wont serve her the manager looks to me and i tell her that this woman refused to wait in line and just went in front of this older gentlaman. My manager looks at me, looks at the older gentleman, then looks at the woman and says ""get out of my store right now."" This woman had the gall to look like she had done nothing wrong, like she was surprised she was getting kicked out. In the end she leaves and i serve the old man before helping him to his cab, he said that he was very greatful and told me to have a nice day....I felt pretty good"
