"Whats an ID?


I work in a vape shop. Vaporizers and their accessories are classed as tobacco in the US and has an age restriction (18 most places, 21 in some) we also have pool tables, arcade machines, soda, snacks and such.

So enter a group of kids (4-5 minors between id guess 15-17 and someone who was 20) they come in and begin to play pool, that's cool I dont really mind them playing the games and such, theyre not causing any problems, its fine.

Until 2 of the girls come up to the counter and start asking about our eliquid, upon asking for ID, one young lady, asks me what an ID is, I tell them I cant sell to them, and off they go back to their group, and I can hear her asking their older friend what an ID was and why she needed one. 

Not 2 miniutes later the older guy in the group comes up, and tries to buy the liquid the 2 girls had asked me about. I tell him i cant sell to him because he has minors with him. He goes back, tells the group he cant buy anything, and then the 2 girls tell me that they wont be shopping here anymore.. when they cant legally shop here to begin with."
"The Instagram Girl


Let me preface this story with, ""I wish I was joking.""



I work in a small women's clothing store in the middle of my city's bar and club district. It was a big party weekend (pre-Halloween) which means I get to deal with some hungover ladies on my Sunday shift. This often includes my coworkers and I, and honestly, I don't mind at all.



Enter Britney. Blonde girl, still in decently glam makeup from the previous night, decked out in leopard print, comes into the shop with her equally blonde friend sporting kitty ears. Despite the music playing in the store, Britney is blasting hardcore rap on her phone speaker as loud as it can go. When the two girls enter I say hello, but they obviously don't hear me over the music. I'm busy, so I resolve to walk over and greet them again when I have a second. 



So nearly an entire minute later I walk up to my two new friends, both of whom are sipping monster energy drinks out of a straw and smell like a bottle return depot.



Me: Hey guys, how's it going ?

Britney (to her friend): Isn't it funny? Like honestly, because I come in here looking like garbage they just totally ignore me. Like I have money to spend here, and they don't even realize it. 

Me: Sorry, you must not have heard me over the music but I did say hi to you when you walked in. 

Britney: No, you didn't. It was a huge mistake because I'd love to shop here, I love this store, but you're being rude to me because of how I look.

Me: Honestly, you look fine. And I would have said hi to you regardless, because we try to help everyone who comes into the store regardless of what they look like. 

Britney: Seriously though, you don't even realize, like I'm actually gorgeous and you don't know how much you're missing out on sales because you are being so rude. No seriously, like look at this...



At this point Britney PULLS UP HER INSTAGRAM AND STARTS SHOWING ME SELFIES. We're taking heavily filtered mirror shots, added heart stickers, and some suggestive shots which make me wonder about how she got all the money she supposedly wanted to spend here. 



I am frozen. At this point it is taking every ounce of self control not to laugh in this girls face. Her kitty friend is obviously embarrassed and starts pulling at her arm, trying to get her to leave, and telling Britney that she heard me say hello to them. My co worker also came up and said that I did greet them, but Britney is having none of it. Obviously insecure, she keeps finding new pictures to prove to us how ""beautiful "" she is, and telling us what a mistake we made being so rude to her. 



So I walk away. I couldn't take it anymore and didn't want to make her feel worse by outwardly laughing at her. I sat in the back and contemplated how delusional you'd have to be to consider the instagram version of yourself to be more credible than the version standing directly in front of me. I also told my boss this story in hopes that she saves the camera footage because i think it was the most hilarious, awkward customer interaction I experienced. This was a condensed version, and it was preformed dramatically in front of other customers, all of whom took the opportunity to make fun of this girl after she left. 



TL;DR: I say hello to customer, she doesn't hear me over rap music playing from her phone. After taking offence to her perceived slight, she proves to me how beautiful she is through filtered instagram selfies. I lose my faith the future of this generation.
