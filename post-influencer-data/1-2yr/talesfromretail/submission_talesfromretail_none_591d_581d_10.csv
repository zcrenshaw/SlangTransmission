"“My Son Spends At Least $100 On Me”


I work in a florist and every year when Mother’s Day is celebrated it is a very busy time. Our florist makes many types of hampers including flowers and fruits. I had one argument with a lady who thought her Fruit Basket was a cheaply made $100 Basket. M: Me, CL: Cranky Lady.

M: Answers phone call.

CL: “I want to talk to manager”

M: “Speaking how can I help” Already knowing this was going to be “fun”

CL: “ I just received a very poor excuse for a fruit basket, I know my son would have spent a minimum of $100 on me and I think it’s disgusting that what was delivered was definitely not worth $100”

M: “I’m sorry you’re disappointed ma’am, but I have made the Basket according to the order”

CL: (Angrily) “I won’t settle for this and I will be letting my son know to shop elsewhere” 

M: “Well I’m sorry to disappoint you ma’am but you were worth $25 this year” “Happy Mother’s Day”

CL: “Well how dare you” and cranky cow hung up

TL;DR: Lady comes in complaining order is too small and that her son spends a minimum of $100 on her on mother day when in reality it was worth $25

"The soda guy


Howdy Reddit! So I will preface this story with I work in an electronics store, but near the checkout we sell some small snacks and drinks. Also, this story happened to a couple of my coworkers some years ago and not myself, but I felt it definitely belongs here.

So there are two people that have worked the checkout of this store for a very long time; I'll call them Claire and Mary. There are two parts to the front lanes of the store - general checkout and in store pickup. This day in particular, Claire was assigned general checkout and Mary was assigned store pickup. 

An older man (probably late 70s or 80s) walks up to the store pickup and Mary proceeds to process his order. As Mary goes behind the pickup counter to retrieve his items, he begins to glance about the store. That's when he notices the two coolers filled with drinks. It was a slower day, so Claire really had nothing better to do than observe this guy. According to Claire, his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and bolts over to the cooler with the sodas, much faster than you would expect a man his age to move.

He presses his hands against the glass and gleefully shouts, ""I didn't know you sold soda here!! This is cool!!!!"" He grabbed exactly 6 soda bottles and 1 water bottle and practically threw them at Claire. At this point, Mary is rounding the corner back to her register, and all she sees is the gentleman bouncing on his toes, eagerly awaiting Claire to scan all his beverages. It was like watching a child open their birthday presents. 

They rung him out for his drinks and finalized his order and left the store happy as a bug in a rug. 

So, for the next two years after this, he came in once a month and bought 6 sodas and 1 water, and always made sure to do it with either Claire or Mary (apparently making a point to not purchase them from anyone else when neither of them were on shift). But never bought any electronics, ALWAYS the 6 sodas, and 1 water.

They really got to know him very well. His name was Liam and he had been married to the same woman for almost 50 years. When asked about how *she* felt about his beverage runs, he said he was pretty sure it made her happy to see him leave the house, followed by a good laugh.

But, there was a span of about 3 months where Liam didn't come to the store. Eventually, his wife showed up specifically asking to speak to either Mary or Claire. Mary was there and the woman explained she was Liam's wife, and he had recently passed, peacefully in his sleep though. He was also on the autistic spectrum, and was in a bit of a lull before his first trip to our store, and when he had come home that afternoon with the sodas raving about how wonderful he thought that was, his entire mood had shifted and he became the man she married again. So, the wife thanked Mary  (and Claire in spirit) for making his final years so bright. 

Not the typical story on this subreddit, I know. But I thought it was really beautiful and would be a nice change of pace. RIP, Liam, you will always be remembered."
