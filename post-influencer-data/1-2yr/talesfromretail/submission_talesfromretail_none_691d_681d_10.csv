"Today I Made a Customer Cry


I work in photo finishing and I was helping a friendly lady who wanted prints off of her phone. She off-handedly mentioned that she recently lost all the photos on her phone so she was only able to get prints from the last few weeks.


I found it odd that the photos would just disappear but the phone was still working. She insisted, despite being a ""technology illiterate"" that she didn't accidentally delete them. She also off-handedly mentioned that she thought her phone had a memory card in it. 


This needed further investigation. I fully expected her to not have a micro SD card, since many older folk call the Sim Card a memory card, but lo-and-behold there was one inside. 


I put the card into one computer and it didn't show up at all so I tried our Windows PC instead and it told me the disk was unformatted. Likely corrupted somehow by her cheap off-brand Android.


I didn't want to get the her hopes up, but since Windows was able to see it I thought there might be a chance... So I took a deep breath, formatted it and threw it into our recovery software.


I was able to recover 90% of the photos and video on that card.


The lady had been waiting for her prints anyway so I waved for her to come around to my computer and take a look. She looked at the photos on the screen and literally started bawling. It was all her most important pics - her grandson's grad, her dog that had passed a few months ago, family trips... Years worth of pics that weren't backed up anywhere. In the end she bought a new Micro SD and I gave her a DVD of the pics at no charge. After paying, she ran behind the counter and gave me a big hug. 


I later found out that she hand wrote my boss a letter and said it was the best customer service she'd ever had. 


Today has been a good day."
"I want to speak with the owner.


The company I work for is employee owned. We all hold a small percentage of the stocks and we sell them back to the other employees when we leave the company. The higher ups in the company love me for some reason so I get away with a fair bit of shenanigans. Today I had a bitch customer (bc) come in. 

Bc: Yeah, give me 6 of these obscure parts that I have in this bag. 

Me: Ma'am those are non-stock items. I would have to order them and sell you box quantities of each. 

Bc: Whatever just order them. 

Me: Okay. It's going to be 7-10 days before they get here. The total is $250-something

Bc: That's ridiculous! I only need 6! 

Me: I'm aware ma'am but those particular items are sold in boxes of 100 and I can't split them up. 

Bc: You must work on commission. I bet the owner could help me. Go get him. 

At this point I can hear my manager holding back laughter from the office. I went into the office and changed to a different colored hat and went back to the customer

Me: Hello ma'am, I'm one of the owners of this business. What can I help you with? 

Bc: This is f-ing ridiculous! I'm calling your corporate office,  and I'm calling the better business bureau, and blah blah scream and yell for 5 minutes

About an hour after she left I got a call from the president of the company. We had a good laugh about it and he told me that while I was technically correct I should use more tact next time. I did find out that surprisingly while the company had been employee owned for almost 50 years,  I'm the first smart ass to pull that stunt."
