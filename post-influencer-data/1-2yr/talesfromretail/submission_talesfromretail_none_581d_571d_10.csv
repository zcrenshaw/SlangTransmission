"The time a customers husband told her to shut up.


I have posted here once before and as more stories come back to me, I might post more if there's an interest. I worked at a local grocery store for eight years. Also, on mobile, so excuse any formatting errors. 

One day, I was working at the checkstands when I saw a couple coming towards me. A fellow employee was coming back from break and happened to squeeze between the wife and a display case, as he was late to get back. I hear this lady sigh and loudly exclaim, ""Excuse you!""

Now I can understand where she was coming from as the least the guy could do was say excuse me, but there was enough room for him to get by without nudging her or anything. 

Anyway, this couple comes through my lane, and as I'm ringing them out, the lady just keeps going on and on about how rude the kid was. I'm not kidding when I say she keeps saying, ""he didn't even say 'excuse me'"", repeatedly. The entire time I'm checking them out.

Apparently the husband had had enough because he just turns to her and loudly says, ""would you just shut up already?!"" I had to try really hard not to laugh as he said this and it earned him a death glare, but she finally stopped talking about how rude that boy was. 

Definitely one of the more entertaining conversations I've witnessed at that place. "
