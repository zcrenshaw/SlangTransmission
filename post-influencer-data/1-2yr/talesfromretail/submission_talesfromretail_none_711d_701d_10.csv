"We’re closed...


If there isn’t a subreddit called ‘We’re closed, ma’am’ then there really should be!! One night when we were CLOSED not closING but CLOSED. We had sent out the *Please take your items to the register and pay for your purchases* page about half an hour ago, turned OFF THE FUCKING LIGHTS, turned off the music, done our walk through to check for any customers, pulled the shutters down, and had our coats on. 

Our walk through is very thorough so I have NO IDEA where this woman was hiding. But I looked back at the registers as I was zipping up my coat AND SOMEONE WAS UNLOADING THEIR FUCKING GROCERIES ON THE TILL. 

This was about 10 minutes AFTER the lights went off. The store was quite literally pitch black save for a few emergency lights so I have no fucking idea how she didn’t get the hint. Me and my supervisor walked up to her and the following exchange happened:

Sup: Um..ma’am..we closed about 20 minutes ago..you’re going to have to leave...

Customer: What?! Well why didn’t anyone tell me! 

Sup: We...we did a page, and turned off the lights...ma’am I’m sorry but there’s no way I can ring you through. 

C: Well this is just horrible customer service! How am I supposed to feed my family! 

(*maybe don’t do your shopping at 10pm???*)

Sup: I’m sorry, you can come back tomorrow but we really have to lock up now. 

C: Whatever, I’ll finish my shopping elsewhere!

Then she walked up to the automatic doors THAT HAD BIG STEEL SHUTTERS OVER THEM and started waving her fucking arms for them to open. We ended up having to escort her out through the employee exit and spent another 10 minutes putting all her fucking groceries back. "
"I just got robbed at gunpoint... Again


Thanks for the gold, stranger

Hey, Reddit, my store just got hit for the second time this week! This time I was alone. 

I was sitting behind the register, fucking around on my phone, when I looked up to see a hooded figure walking in. 

*Damn it, this isn't happening AGAIN is it? Maybe he's just got his hood on.*

He turned the corner, and I saw the bandana on his face. 

*Fuck!*

Robber pulls out a revolver and tells me to empty the register and give him two cartons of cigarettes. I give him the cash and go over to the cigarettes. 

""We're out of those, you want something else?""
""Give me Kool menthols""
""We only have one""
""Ok, give it to me""

I have him everything, and then everything turned around. 

""Put your fucking hands in the air!""

A childhood friend of mine, who runs a security company just happened to be pulling in for some oil. I look up to see him with his gun drawn at the guy. 

The robber pushes his way out of the store, where my friend and the robber start grappling. I step out to inform my friend that he's armed, turn around to go inside so I can talk to security over the PA. When I turned around, the robbers face was bloodied up. 

Apparently my friend popped him in the eye brow with the muzzle of his gun. 

I step back outside to relay more information to 911 dispatch,  and my friend told me to grab his cuffs from his truck. 

Local PD arrived on scene, and a gung-ho officer almost put a tazer on me, luckily she didn't have it turned on yet, or I would probably be in the hospital typing this. 

The robbers gun was apparently a BB gun, but he's now looking at 10-25 with no priors. My other childhood friend, who runs the company with my other friend showed up around this time and I got caught up with them. 

I put in my two weeks notice, and am now looking at joining my friends' security firm."
