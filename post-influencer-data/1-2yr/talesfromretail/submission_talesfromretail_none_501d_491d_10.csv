"He just wanted a #5


I work at a small locally owned deli. Today, this old guy comes in and wanted to order a sandwich. I am Me, he is Him. 

I tell the dude to fill out the order form and I'll make his sammy for him. 
Him: ‘I JUST WANT A #5!'
Me: ‘The order form is right here, sir' 
Him: ‘I JUST WANT A #5!'
Me: ‘You still gotta fill out the form, sir'
Him: ‘I JUST WANT A #5!'
Me: ‘.......Okay, one #6 coming right up.'
Him: ‘NO! FIVE!!!'
Me: ‘Four? Sure thing, sir!'
Him: ‘NOOOOOOO!!! FIIIIIIVE!!!!'

At this point people are staring because  he's like screaming at the top of his lungs. The shifty makes a face at me asking if she should come over. I gesture no. The only reason I can keep a straight face is because he's being so rude. 

Enter his ancient wife.
Her: ‘Why the hell are you shouting at this girl?'
Him: ‘I JUST WANT HER TO MAKE ME A SANDWICH!'
Me: ‘The form for sandwiches is right there, sir.’

His wife fills out the form. I make the sandwich. He scowls at me. I smile at him. He leaves. I ruined that guy’s day and I’m damn proud of it."
"""Don't lie to me, i know you buy gold""


So I work in an alteration shop, we do clothing alterations and repairs etc...

we often get some strange incidents, this is one of them.

Customer = C  Me = M

C\- \*Bursts through door and slams a plastic bag on table\*

C \- You buy gold dont you?

M \- No you must have us confused with the place that was a few doors up, they've closed now.

C \- NO, you buy gold I've done it here before, I sold some coin rings and you gave me money.

M \- Nope, sorry, we're an alteration shop we work on clothing etc... the cash for gold place closed about a year ago, it was about two doors up the street.

C \- You're just saying that, what will you give me for this? \(Pulls out a tangled thin gold chain with broken clasp\)

M \- We Don't buy gold here, I'm sorry. I have to serve this customer, thanks.

C \- How much is that jacket on the rail there?

M \- It belongs to our customer, please leave.

C\- How much are you giving me for my chain?

M \- We're aren't interested, please leave. \(As I continued to write and invoice for the other customer\)

C \- Stupid woman! I'll never be back in here again, you've just lost a good customer. \(Grabs his plastic bag and slams the door\)

My customer I was busy serving just looked at me bewildered and said she didn't envy me having to deal with people like him. 

Not even the strangest thing to happen here. "
