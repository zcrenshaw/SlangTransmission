"""No, like for free""


I work at your local resident office supply store, and I have for two years whilst getting my higher education, and during the summers. Ill be Me, Manager friend will be MF, Customer will be C. You guys know the drill.

So one day I'm minding my own business, helping people on our tech side (I'm the designated tech salesperson) and a customer walks in, she's probably right around 60, at this time I was standing next to the other elder employee who is also a manager because he's full time (you can't be a manager if you aren't full time here) killing some time. She walks up to us and before I can ever get out a greeting she says ""I'm looking for boxes"" well she caught us right at the beginning of the isle the boxes are in so I basically tell her they're right here, prices are on the examples etc. Then she hits us with a doozy 

&gt;C: *No, like for free. I don't want to pay.*

To that I respond

&gt;Me: Well We don't give product away but most of our boxes are very inexpensive

She comes back with another heavy hitting statement in a much less happy tone

&gt;C: Yeah, but you guys get product right? what do they come in?

&gt;M: Well, boxes.

&gt;C: And do you have any of those?

&gt;M: No, we got our shipment two days ago, and we crush all of our boxes(we do)

&gt;C: Are you even going to go check for me?

&gt;M: no ma'am I've been back there more than once today and we have no boxes, we also still cannot give away free versions of product we sell.

&gt;C: Well, I want to speak to a manager

My face when my buddy next to me watching all this happen is the manager, so he starts with

&gt;MF: That's me

&gt;C: And I suppose you aren't going to be of any help either?

&gt;MF: No

She turned on her heal and stormed our right after that. honestly some people just cant figure out that maybe stores don't just give things away without any prior consent, especially when we sell what they want for free. Also in working here for this long I have plenty of stories to tell god damn. So this goes over well, I got plenty more for you lovely people

"A Child Can Do My Job Better Than I Can


Hey all! Long time lurker here, and I finally felt the urge to post. I'm on mobile so apologies in advance for any formating issues. 




This happened ~5 months ago. I work at a well-known grocery store chain here in MA. I've been at it for a little over a year now, and while I've had a few asshats come in, there's one person that came in who did more good than I thought was possible. One of my jobs, when not restocking the shelves in Produce, is to break things down, make em look neat and full. Well, one afternoon, things were particularly slow, as it was always on a Tuesday. I was on with a couple other guys, restocking whatever we could so we would have something to do. 



At one point, the apple wall was neat, but still looked like a mess to some extent. I was going to do it, but had to do some refilling. As I was doing so, a mother and her daughter walked into the store. I didn't pay much attention to them, until the mother asked a few questions regarding some of our produce. Her daughter was at the apple wall the time, just looking at all the apples. After helping the mother out, I went up front to get some overstock, as well as check on a couple displays we had up front. 



As I came back, I glanced over at the apple wall and it was perfect. Like, grand opening of the store perfect. I had no idea how to process that, then things clicked. The daughter, who was probably 9 or 10 did this. I called my coworkers over and asked them if either one of them did it. A double ""No"", and I told them about the little girl who was just in who did it. One of my guys didn't believe me, so I explained how it was her, she was the only one at the wall, she was there when I went upfront, and walking away from the wall as I was coming back. 



We quickly found the girl and her mother. We asked her if she and her daughter had just stopped by the produce department. The mother said they were, and asked if there's was something wrong. We told her all was good, but her daughter had tidied up the apple wall better than anyone in the department had at any point. The girl had a big smile and her face went red. The mother laughed and said her daughter had always had a thing for making things neat. 



We thanked her daughter for the work she did, which made things easier for us, and jokingly offered her a job at the store. The mother and daughter left with smiles on their faces and certainly a story for dinner that night. 




**TL;DR : mother and daughter come into the store, girl tidies up the apple wall so much better than any of us ever could have**"
"""We tried getting you a cupcake...""


Just a little happy tale from the time that I worked retail.

A few years ago, I was working at a video game retailer. We offered free midnight pick-up for games on release date for customers who had pre-ordered. Two people were always scheduled for this to run smoothly - and guess who was chosen to come back after their 8 hour shift at 11:30pm on their 21st birthday to facilitate the midnight release? 

I understandably was a bit bummed. I had planned to meet with some friends for my first legal drinks at a really neat bar downtown, so it was disappointing. Regardless, nobody else was available to take the shift, so I sucked it up and postponed my birthday plans for the next weekend instead.

A pretty small pool of people came in around 11:45, eager to get their hands on their new game. Two of them were men that I had seen in the store before and was fond of, because they were always really funny and polite. Having a pretty good rapport with the both of them, I told them that it was my birthday and joked that I had tricked them into thinking that there was a game coming out that night; instead, it was actually my birthday party and it was the only way I could get them to come. Jokes in that vein continued between the three of us until the clock hit midnight and the games were available for distribution. They got their games, thanked my coworker and I, and left.

At the time, our policy had us stay until at least 12:30am on midnight releases to ensure that everyone had time to pick up their game. It was about 12:35 when we were shutting off our POS systems and shuttering the doors when a car pulls up in front of the store.

I sighed and turned my computer back on, expecting it to be someone who was late for picking up their game. 

To my surprise, it was the two men from earlier who walked in. Their arms were FULL of convenience store candy and chocolates. ""Here! Happy birthday! We tried getting you a cupcake, but the grocery store nearby was already closed. We hope that this is good enough!"" 

They dumped everything on the counter for me and I was absolutely speechless. I actually cried a little when thanking them, because I was just so blown away. The fact that two near-strangers had gone out of their way to be thoughtful and bring me treats on my birthday so made the midnight shift worth it! I think about them whenever I reminisce about my time in retail. Why can't all customers be this amazing?!"
