"“She obviously has never owned her own business before”


I work at a retail store. These past few days, so many people have been quitting. The normal thing is to put your two weeks in right? Well these employees put their two weeks in and then stopped showing up to finish their two weeks. It’s been making me really depressed that my favorite co workers are leaving. And on top of being depressed, I’m stressed out because these people were still scheduled but aren’t showing up so the entire workload is all on me. But whatever. I’ll just pile my emotions like I always do.  

Well yesterday this customer came in. He wanted to see our jewelry which is locked away. I’m the gatekeeper so I went to show him the jewelry. 

“Can I see shsjxozjxhbd”

“I’m sorry which one?”

“That one???? The only one of that kind that’s in there????”

He mumbled, so I didn’t hear what he said he wanted to see, so I asked him to repeat which one. He got so unbelievably rude and condescending just because I didn’t hear which one he wanted to see. Not even 5 minutes into helping this guy he’s already awful. Whatever I’m used to it. Just keep piling on more reasons for me to want to shoot myself. 

Then he asks me “what size are those rings?”

“I don’t know off the top of my head let me pull them out and check”

I start pulling them out one by one and he snaps at me. “I didn’t say take them out and show them to me I said what size are they??????” Again, condescending tone.  Rude. Awful. I want to stab him at this point.  But whatever.  I’m used to it. Just keep piling on even more reasons for me to want to shoot myself.  

I finally finish with him. He wants the rings so I bring them to the front to hold them until he’s ready to check out. 

Like 40 minutes later he comes up and I check him out. I just want this dude gone so I don’t say anything at all. I scan his items, he pays, I hand him his bag and say here you go. That’s it. He doesn’t deserve a thank you or come again or have a nice day. He’s cancer. 

He was really mad that I didn’t say thank you have a nice day. 

“*scoffs.* *here you go.* You don’t thank your customers when they’re done????”

I’m so sick of this guy’s input. The piling of stress finally collapsed and I snapped. 

“No dude. I’m not going to be polite to someone who’s so condescending and awful towards me okay??”

“Uhhhh what????????? I’m awful?????”

“Oh it’s not awful of you to scream at me at the jewelry case for not understanding what you said?”

“I didn’t do any of that??? You asked me which one so I said the only one that’s there” 

“Yeah you said it as if I’m a moron for asking you to repeat which one it is”

“Maybe if you took that stupid thing out of your ear you would’ve heard me?” (Referring to my headset to communicate with my manager and associates)

“Oh but you’re not being rude?”

Then he chimes in with my all time favorite line from customers. 

“Where’s your manager? The customer is always right”

Me being a brat, I ask my manager over the headset “is the customer always right?”

She scoffs and says no. 

“My manager said no the customer isn’t always right”

“They’ve clearly never owned their own business then”

“So you’re telling me at your business, a 20 dollar transaction warrants the customer to treat your employees like garbage? I can see why you’re shopping at a discount store your business must be failing”

“Psh. And you wonder why you’re working at a retail store” 

He finally left.  I was boiling.  All the customers were staring at me. "
"Can I return this dress? Ignore the underwear.


I used to work at a women's clothing store in a large out\-door mall in Los Angeles. The majority of our stock were jeans, tops, and ugly faux fur vests, but we also had a selection of ""special occasion"" dresses. These were usually on the skimpier side, and favored by young female 20 somethings headed to Las Vegas. Due to this trend, our store had a very strict 48\-hour return policy on these dresses, to try to deter women buying them, keeping the tag on, partying in Vegas, and returning them. When they are returned, they have to have a the original tag inside the dress attached, a tag that says ""48\-hour return policy"" that is attached to the OUTSIDE, and the original receipt. It was store policy to also write 48HRS in highlighter across the receipt just in case the customer missed/ignored the tags. 

That didn't stop plenty of customers from trying to return the dresses anyways. My personal favorite story is this: I am ME, the customer is C, and my manager is M

C: Walks up to the counter with a wrinkled bag and stands, staring at me, not saying anything. 

Me: Hello, did you want to return or exchange today?

C: Yes. I want to return this dress. \*tosses bad onto counter\*

Me: Oh no, I'm sorry, did it not work out?

C: No. I don't like it.

I took the dress out of the bag to ensure the tags were still attached. The tags were gone, the dress was wrinkled and there were pretty obvious deodorant stains on it. 

Me: Do you have the original receipt?

C: No. I threw it away.

Me: I'm sorry, we don't accept returns without the receipt, it doesn't have the tags, and this looks like it has been worn. We can't accept a return for this. 

She demanded to see my manager who I brought over and explained the situation. My manager says the same thing, we need a receipt etc etc.. while inspecting the dress.

M: I'm sorry, she's right this looks worn, and we have a strict rule to not accept returns if the item has been worn.

My manager is talking and lifts the dress to inspect it further. As she lifts it up, UNDERWEAR fall out of the bottom. Clearly used underwear. My manager and I stare at them in silence as the customer grabs them and sticks them in her purse. 

C: So can I return it?

M: \*Trying to stay professional\* No ma'am. You can't. You clearly wore it, we cannot accept this return. 

Thankfully the customer glared at us while tossing the dress back into the bag and stormed off without saying anything else. It was the weirdest attempted return I got the whole time I was there. Retail secret: if you want to return something you wore, don't leave your dirty underwear in it! "
"I'm not arguing with you, I'm just letting you know we don't do that.


Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile and don't post much so I'm not too sure how to do it. 


So, I work at a small family owned yogurt shop. The owners are family friends, and I've been working for them on and off as needed since they opened 7 years ago. Basically, I know the company in and out. 


Anyways, we have loyalty cards we swipe for the customers to get money off future purchases. They're not attached to a name or number, we take no information from the customer, just give them a card with points on it.


Enter ""I KNOW."" lady, or IKL for short. M will be me.  


&gt;M: ""Alright, do you have a rewards card?""


&gt;IKL: ""Yeah, but not on me. Look it up with my phone number.""


&gt;M: ""It wouldn't be under a phone number, its just a physical card. We don't take any customer information.""


&gt;IKL: ""Uh, yeah, you do. I use my number every time I come in here.""


&gt;M: ""No ma'am I'm sorry but that's not something we're able to do.""


&gt;IKL: ""Well clearly you must of just stopped doing it because you've always done it."" 


&gt;M: ""It's actually never been done. I worked here years ago as well and we never did it back then either."" 


&gt;IKL: ""Uh, yes you did. Just because you worked here a couple years back doesn't mean you know everything, because clearly you don't know anything. Because I KNOW you did it. Unlike you, I KNOW. I've been coming here since you were a little girl so believe me, I KNOW.""


&gt;M: ""Well, I've actually worked here on and off since we opened. We really have never done that. We don't take your information when we give you the card."" 


&gt;IKL: ""YOU'RE LYING TO ME. I've been coming here since you were a CHILD! TRUST ME! You just don't know what you're talking about! So before you argue with a customer, maybe you should get your facts straight!"" 


&gt;M: ""I'm not arguing with you ma'am, I'm just telling you we don't do that and never have.""


&gt;IKL: ""STOP ARGUING! I know what I'm talking about! I KNOW! Trust me, I KNOW! So don't try and argue because you don't know! You don't know anything!"" 


&gt;M: ""We really don't do that, but alright. That'll be $x.xx."" 


&gt;IKL: ""Oh yeah, sure. Right. Like you would know. Trust me I know what I'm talking about. I KNOW. I know, okay? So just stop. I know. I just KNOW. You've always done that. I KNOW YOU DO.""


Like a broken record, she seriously just kept repeating ""I KNOW"" in various ways. Over and over and over, the whole transaction.


&gt;M: ""Ok well thank you have a good day."" 


&gt;IKL: ""OH I WILL. AND BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I. KNOW.""


With that, she stormed out. Okay lady, repeating yourself doesn't make you any less wrong.."
