"""The competitor lets me do it!"" ""No, actually, we don't.""


A post by /u/greyhippy reminded me of an incident that happened to me a couple of years back, when an uppity customer got humiliated.

The craft store chain was having its yearly sale on fabric, and the GF and I were in the store checking out what they had, to see what we could use for costuming.  The sale is strictly by the yard, with no lesser amounts sold.  You only need half a yard, that's at full price.  Also, no coupons usable on these sales.  They're not about to give you 20% off of prices which are already 50% off.

While we're there, this woman decides that the store can violate policy.  She needs exactly 4 and a quarter yards of *this* fabric, and 5 and a half yards of *that* fabric, and wants it all at sale prices.  When the saleswoman tells her about the rules on the sale, the woman demands to see the manager.

The manager tells her the exact same thing as the salesperson did, and the woman gets all huffy.  Fine, she'll take the fabric in 5 yards for *this* and 6 yards for *that*, but she wants to use her coupon that she got in the mail like six months ago (and are obviously expired).

When she's told of the second rule, she gets huffy and tries the usual tactic of, ""Well, *your competitor* lets me do that!  And they always honor *their* coupons!""

That's when the woman next to me speaks up.  ""Actually, I'm a manager for *that competitor*, and I can assure you ma'am, we do not honor coupons during sales, nor do we accept expired coupons.""

The uppity customer got beet-red in the face, and just took her cloth to the front to check out, without another word."
"""NO! I said...""


Posting on mobile! Sorry in advance.

Little girl: LG Me: Me

I'm a cashier at a big box company. Any how..I am known to get very upset when ""guests"" (customers) yell at me. Just before this I had a customer yell at me because some of her coupons weren't working. Hint: She had the wrong product. Well she proceeded to call me stupid and tell I was worthless. All in all I ended up in tears. 

My manager loves me and let me go to the bathroom to freshen up a bit. I came back with my customer service smile. Now I know I shouldn't let someone ruin my day but it just happens sometimes. Any how the next guest is a young woman with two kids a baby boy about 9 months and a about 3 year old girl. I love kids so I'm already feeling a little better. 

LG: ""That's my toy!"" With the biggest smile ever. I can't help but smile back 

Me: ""Wow that's super cool did you get it for being such a great big sister!""

 She laughs and nods then just kind of stares at me. At this point I'm done scanning their items and tell her mom the total. All of a sudden the little girl says something but I couldn't quite catch it all but it sounded like ""so so beautiful"" 

Me: "" It's so so beautiful outside?"" 

LG: ""NO! I said that you are so so beautiful!"" 

Me: *Speechless* "" Oh my goodness well thank you sweetie! You know you are so so beautiful too!""

LG: *shyly* "" Thank you!""

I turn to the mom and tell her what an awful day i was having but that her daughter had just completely made my day a million times better. 

Needless to say whenever I am having a bad day I still think about how one little girl made such a huge impact on me."
