"Is New York safe for muslim tourists?


Me and my mom like to go to New York in a few weeks (we are from France). However, I'm scared that it's not so safe there for us right now. My mom wears a head scarf and I'm scared people are going to call her names and stuff. I would feel truly awful if something like that happened. Do you guys think it's safe to go there right now?"

"Where do I get my local news and events now that Gothamist and DNAinfo are shut down.


Went to go look to see what was happening this weekend in my neighborhood and the city only to find that Gothamist had been shut down for good. Any other sites I can use to check local news and events? I already subscribe to the skint but that obviously doesn't do it all."
