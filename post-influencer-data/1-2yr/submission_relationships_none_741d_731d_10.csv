"[UPDATE] My [M26] girlfriend [F24] has secret social media accounts. How bad is this?

"Wife [32F] made a disgusting ""sushi casserole"" that I [33M] was against for a big potluck. Dish ended up a flop and now she's mad at me.


So my wife has recently gotten into very experimental, GIF-recipe type foods that you see on facebook. Like those recipes that looks questionable at best and even worse when it's made in real life. 

Last weekend we were invited to a BIG labor day party by my wife's boss. It was actually pretty fancy and catered but also a ""potluck"" for those who wanted to show their special culinary skills. So welcome but not necessary. My wife decided on this ""sushi casserole"" or lasagna type thing that was basically layers of rice and sashimi in a baking tray. I watched her make it and she was winging a lot of it and it looked TERRIBLE. Like instead of making sushi rice, she just used regular rice, and instead of sashimi grade fish I think she just bought her own from god knows where and sliced it. It wasn't even good tuna or salmon, it was some other kinds of fish that I couldn't identify. She topped it off with cut up avocado and some Japanese mayo (like it did in the vid). 

Well, when it was done it honestly, and I mean HONESTLY, looked like a tray of vomit. The mushed up avocado (which had gone slightly brown) plus reddish fish plus scattered rice and watery mayo made it look exactly like a big tray of puke. I was frank and told her the ""sushi casserole"" looks seriously gross and that sushi shouldn't even be in casserole/lasagna/burger/cake or whatever else buzzfeed comes up with that week to begin with. I thought we were both on the same page at that point and she would laugh and throw the monstrosity away, but she got extremely mad at me. 

She told me I NEVER like the food she makes and I'm never supportive. She also brought up the fact that just because I had traveled more than she has and eaten at far more ""fancy"" restaurants than she, it doesn't mean I can be such a food snob. I told her that dish had nothing to do with trips to Japan or 3 Michelin star dinners; it was just a bad dish, period. Well, the day of the party comes and she brings the casserole. As suspected, it looked SUPER out of place on a table full of nicely arranged, catered foods (turned out very few people brought their own and the only ones that did made desserts). The day passes and everything else is polished down except for her sushi casserole. It remained sadly full and by the end of the party it was glaringly untouched and people were making subtle jokes about the ""mystery dish."" My wife heard some whispers about it and became visibly upset. 

So we got back home and I tell her not to worry too much and that there was just too much food overall which is why hers wasn't as popular. She ignores me and walks off. So ever since then she's been cold and giving me the silent treatment on most afternoons. Apparently she's mad that I didn't get some of her casserole myself and didn't encourage others to try it. She said I humiliated her by not touching the dish and telling her it looked gross when she was making it. I told her I can't make people eat things they obviously don't want to eat.

"Me [25 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 4 years, found some shocking stuff on his phone. Feel so paranoid and anxious that I'm going insane. Is it truly possible to earn back trust?


Fair warning that this is going to be a pretty long post, but if any of you are willing to read and give me some clarity and insight on my situation, it means the absolute world to me. 


My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years now. We bought a house together and moved in about 7 months ago &amp; recently adopted a dog also. I genuinely believe we are both deeply in love with each other and if there were soulmates out there, we easily could be each others. He is very affectionate and sensitive and honestly my best friend. I can talk to him about anything &amp; everything and we have so much fun together. Even his friends have said they’ve never seen him so in love before me and vice versa with my friends. This is what makes my judgement of him and our current situation so damn foggy and distorted and I don’t know what to do anymore.


About 2 1/2 years into our relationship, I went through his phone for the first time ever. I have never condoned going through a SO’s phone &amp; have always been against it. However, it was 4 AM, I was drunk, and he was dead asleep so I stupidly went through it. Long story short, I found two conversations he had with two different girls, one from high school &amp; another from Tinder, basically trying to hook up with them and saying he didn’t have a girlfriend. The conversations only lasted like a week or two and unfortunately I was too drunk to remember if the conversations went further as far as planning to meet, but regardless, I was obviously devastated and shocked.


I confronted him and he explained that nothing ever happened and he never met up with them. His reason for texting those other girls was that he was ‘doubting’ us and our relationship. I remember looking back at our texts during the time he was texting these girls, and we were totally fine, not fighting or anything, and he had been acting totally normal. Whatever it was, it crushed me. 


Ever since i can remember I have had some serious body image issues that I tend to hide pretty well. I developed a eating disorder when I was about 15 and have had disordered eating habits and body image anxieties ever since. I am not nearly as extreme as I once was in my teenage and early 20’s, but I still struggle with the need to be in control of my eating and always have the daunting fear of never being good enough. There will always be women out there who are better than me, prettier, more artistic, more outgoing, with a better ass and more sex appeal, the list of ‘betters’ never ends. I am well aware of how irrational this type of thinking is but unfortunately I can’t stop thinking in such a way. I’ve never been very open about my eating disorder or body image problems besides with therapists, because it’s not something that needs to be shared. Hell, it’s pretty much the norm these days for woman to hate themselves, what makes my issues any different?

The point is that any girlfriend would be devastated to find out her boyfriend was texting other woman, but for someone like me, I feel like my entire being and spirit was crushed and officially confirmed that I really will never be good enough.


I decided to give my BF another chance but also knew that if I did stay with him, I couldn’t hang this over his head forever, so I didn’t. However, the trust I had in him was pretty much gone and I have been very insecure with our relationship and can’t help but feel anxious and paranoid whenever he goes out with just the guys. 


Fast forward a year and a half later to now, our relationship has come a long way since that entire incident occurred and we had bought a house and moved in together. I had not looked through his phone since the first time until a few weeks ago. I have no idea what motivated me to look through it again, but my gut must have been telling me something. 


I found a few texts from the night before from a woman whose name I didn’t recognize. My BF texted her asking if she made it out of work on time, she replied ‘yes, almost at the restaurant’, he responded that he would be there by 6. She texted him the next morning thanking him for coming out, he replied saying he had a great time and don’t forget to text him when she returns from vacation with a wink face. Awesome. 


The night they had dinner, he had called me around 5 as I was leaving my office to let me know he just got home to shower and would feed our dog and would be home later as he was going to his parents house to finish working on the bathroom he’s fixing for them. What a perfectly executed alibi. I reverse looked up the woman’s phone number on Whitepages and discovered it was a 50 year old woman, who happened to be the mom of a girl I knew through a mutual friend. My heart sank. I texted our mutual friend and asked about the girl’s mom and she confirmed that she’s a single mom and dating a young guy is definitely something she would do, and is always trying to act younger and party with her kids. 


I then looked through his recent browser history and saw that he had recently looked up erotic massage parlors in the area, as well as watches a ton of porn. The porn really doesn’t bother me, I’m a pretty sexual person and watch it by myself also. But erotic massage parlors? That’s just sketchy and weird.  Finding all of this at once made me feel so sick to my stomach, I felt like he had some other life I didn’t know about or a sex addiction. I didn’t know what to think. 


I finally confronted my BF and could barely look at him I was so confused and creeped out. I told him that I’m looking for an apartment and that I feel like I don’t even know who he is anymore. He said he did not cheat on me and never ever has.


 One of his very close friends from work that he’s known for a long time has been battling cancer for the past 3 years, but it always seemed like he was going to beat it. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst in early August and he was put in hospice. My BF explained that he was so upset and messed up emotionally from the bad news that he just does stupid things like this for no reason because he doesn’t know how to cope and talk about his emotions. He pleaded for me not to move out and that he had no intentions of even going to those massage parlors or hooking up with that older woman and that she had approached him and asked for his business card at Home Depot randomly. He didn’t even know why he agreed to dinner and all he talked about with her was his friend. 


I distanced myself from him for a few days and kept emphasizing that I can’t do this again and will not allow myself to get hurt again. After countless talks, I decided to give him a last chance. At this point, his friend had days left to live and he needed love and support more than ever, so I decided to trust his word that he is the man I fell in love with. Sadly, his friend passed last week and I had never seen him so upset in my life so I put my pride away and was there for him. However, my trust for him is pretty much nonexistent at this point. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it’s been so badly damaged? I honestly have felt like I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the anxiety and paranoia I have about whether he’s lying or not. I am so lost.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 4 years broke my trust 2 years ago by texting other girls (claims nothing physical ever happened) when I looked through phone for first time. Gave him a second chance &amp; we have been better than ever since, until 2 weeks ago I looked through his phone for a second time &amp; found out he had been looking up erotic massage parlors and went on a date with a 50 yr old woman. One of his close work friends is in hospice, and he claims that he did those stupid things because he was messed up emotionally and upset over his friend and doesn’t know how to cope with his emotions. Sick to my stomach and so lost. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it’s been so badly damaged? I honestly have felt like I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the anxiety and paranoia I’m experiencing.

**EDIT: Update**

I'm not sure if this is the correct or proper way to thank everyone who commented (I'm really not familiar with the ins and outs of Reddit)

I did not expect this post to get as much attention as it did and am shocked. I’m overwhelmed and really grateful for every single one of your comments. It means the world that complete strangers are willing to read and give some solid, caring advice and tough love. I’m really not as naive as I may seem, but a lot of the obvious points many of you made have been so utterly blind to me until now—I almost feel as if I’ve been in some brainwashed haze coming up with excuses for him and reasons to stay, it’s almost mind blowing. 


I went home early from work today because of how distraught I felt and read every single one of these comments throughout the night and broke down. An extremely emotional but productive breakdown that was much needed and overdue. My boyfriend came home and I laid out everything without apology and without sugarcoating; how I’ve been feeling, how much he is f***ing with my head, the extent of the pain he’s caused, various tidbits of what you all brought to my attention, etc. and told him I need my space to think clearly about what is right for me and my future. I packed a bag, took our dog, and am staying at my parents house until further notice. He begged me not to leave and said that he never ever physically cheated or intended to. He said that he has always envisioned us getting married and having kids; that he wouldn’t buy a house and a dog with me if he wasn’t committed to a life together. 


I repeatedly asked him then why he would do such things when he claims he loves me so much, and that his friend dying is NOT an excuse. Are you bored? No. Am I not satisfying you sexually? No. Do you have a problem or addiction with sex? No. He just kept saying he doesn’t know why he does these stupid things, but never has actually touched another women or gone to one of those massage parlors. I explained that even if i did believe he did not become physical with these woman, it is still considered cheating, and hurts just as much. 


I came clean about my eating disorder past and body image issues. I told him that he is quite literally ruining me, and if I stay, this stress and anxiety and fear of never being enough for him is going to drive me back so far deep into my eating disorder and will kill me and ruin any progress I have made. 


I got angry and I got very real and I have never felt so empowered (anger is not an emotion I am good at expressing). I feel like this is such a bad dream and he’s a little boy that got caught doing something bad who doesn’t know what to say. I told him that maybe when I’m gone, he will finally know how hurt and lost he makes me feel. I have been nothing but loyal to him for 4 years, and when I love and care for someone, I do it with all my heart. Unfortunately, I don’t think he has an ounce of loyalty in his blood, regardless of how much he might love me. 


I can’t stress enough how truly thankful I am for everyone’s input, you all quite literally gave me the power and the voice that I have not had the courage to express. It’s safe to say that I am so emotionally drained from all of this and still extremely hurt and scarred, but I refuse to let a relationship or a man ruin me. I agree with those of you that said therapy is essential, and I agree, as I have a lot of my own internal issues to work out, and plan on working on these avidly with my therapist. I am so so so scared of what all of this change has in store for me, but I am also so scared and ready to stop living the way I am.


For those of you that private messaged me, I am planning on responding to you all tomorrow after a much needed night’s sleep. Thank you so much. 

This really is a wonderful place to vent with some pretty amazing and compassionate people who listen. "
"I [16M] go to this private school that has a bunch of rich kids and I'm not rich. I've been invited by [15F] to a party and I really don't know if I should go because I feel looked down on most of the time.


I have been sitting in my room for the past hour thinking about this. I'm not rich. I live with my mother in an apartment that's pretty decent. I don't have a father anymore since he's decided to go live somewhere else. My grandpa died and that's how I ended up in this school. He always wanted me to have private education for a long time now. He left money for me to do it and here I am. I'm going to be frank, I hate it. I go this school that has all these kids from these wealthy families. I didn't go to this school trying to go about the money I have. It became fairly obvious unfortunately. I don't dress like I'm wealthy. Today for example I just have my white T-Shirt, Black jeans and black hoodie. I was honest about my mom working as a nurse. 

All I did was be honest. I'm not going to lie and say I'm rich when I'm not. I get these snide remarks from people every now and then. Just this past Friday I was in the cafeteria and I just bought a bottle of water. I heard someone say that's it all that I can afford. I'm not poor or rich. I'm middle class, and the medication for my hart really eats into my moms money. I could have bought more, I just wanted water. Friday in my final class for the day which was chemistry I was invited to my partners party. She randomly asked if I wanted to come before class ended. She wrote down her address, date, number and gave it to me. She told me to come because it will be fun. I looked up her address and she lives in a mansion. That's the only way I can describe it as. I know for a fact some pf the people that make these snide remarks will be there.

Previous post: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6xvm8d/me_19_m_with_my_dad_67_m_just_tried_to_attack_me/)

Many thanks to all the people that posted advice on the previous post :) 

Alright so I just had the talk with my Dad with my mum next to me, which I recorded to be on the safe side.
I told him that I recommend that he went to the doctors and had a mental evaluation, as enhanced aggression is a sign of dementia. I also told him that ""if [he] ever fucking touches me again, I will call the police."", to which he told me to ""Mind my language"" (because him attacking me is fine but me swearing at him is apparently too far). He then went on to say (after saying ""now that you've finished your lecture"") that somehow I pushed the wrong buttons last night (insinuating that it was my fault he attacked me) and that the only other time this has happened was also with me. 

I held my ground and told him that regardless of me ""pushing the wrong buttons"" attacking your own son is completely unacceptable and that if it had been anyone else, they would have called the police and he would be in jail.


I then added that it would be a while before I could trust/ talk to him again, and that all the effort over the past year to have a better father / son relationship has been completely wasted. 

I don't think he fully understands the gravity of the situation, but fuck him if he thinks he can do that to me and get away with it. I'm a god damn adult.

So I've been with Andrew for six months. I met him very shortly after switching schools and he was the first real person I knew here. I fell for him very quickly. He is handsome, the sex is good, and he seemed to really have his life in-order, which I admire, because I kind of don't.

Andrew has been good to me and I thought we were moving towards a future, but something I found this weekend has thrown all sorts of doubt into my head.

Basically, I was staying at his place for the weekend. I woke up way earlier than him on Sunday, and I wanted to check my e mail for something I have been waiting on from work. I figured there would be no big deal if I hopped on his computer and checked it real quick while he slept.

I got on the computer, and it was opened to Andrew's Facebook. I intended to just minimize it and move on, because I'm typically very opposed to snooping, but when I saw my name on the chat log that was open, I couldn't help but read. I kinda wish I hadn't.

Basically, Andrew and his friend were chatting in quite explicit detail about me and his friend's gf. Friend mentioned that he thought I am ""actually pretty annoying"". Andrew responded to that ""Yeah, but she's a good f***.""

I felt my heart drop when I read that, because I really couldn't believe that I was reading what *my* Andrew would say about me. 

The chat continued with Andrew mentioning that he plans on dumping me after school and he is basically just keeping me around for sex until he graduates.

I felt like my heart was torn out. I know it was early in the relationship, but I personally only stay in a relationship if there is potential for it to last, and Andrew knows this and has always told me he felt the same. I've already imagined what it would be like to marry this person!

I was disgusted and already starting to cry, so I just grabbed my stuff and left his place before he woke up.

He texted me a couple hours after I got home asking where I had gone. I didn't answer and instead asked him if he was sure he loved me. His response was ""Yes?"". Then I told him ""But that isn't what you told [friend]"" and I quoted part of his conversation back to him.

He didn't respond for almost an hour, which I figured was his answer. He finally texted back while I was ugly-crying into my pillow, just to ask me why I looked at his chat logs.

I explained how I found them and then said that my snooping doesn't undo those things he said, and he told me it was all just ""guy talk"". He said that all guys talk like that in private, and it's basically just to get out criticisms so they don't ""do it to a girl's face""

That seems like complete bullshit to me. I'm having a really hard time right now, though. I do love Andrew, and I thought he loved me. Part of me just wants to believe it was harmless banter.

But I also feel like I will never be able to unsee what he said about me.

"My [23F] parents [55F/62M] bought a house they can't afford. Now they want my savings. Do I have to give them my money?


So my parents bought a house that is way out of their budget. It costs twice as much as they can afford. I strongly recommended them not to buy it and to wait. They hoped to get money from my late grandpa's inheritance, but that didn't work out as planned. But they already signed the contract and made a deposit. They have to pay the remaining money until next month or else they will lose the house and the deposit.

 Now on to my problem. They know I have quite an amount of savings. Most of it came from my grandma as a graduation gift, she specifically wants me to buy a car from it. I have been actively looking for a used car that is good enough since she gave me the money. I planned to buy it this month, because my post-grad program starts next month and I would like to use it to drive to university and my work place. I am currently using public transportation and it's a pain in the ass in my area lol. My parents went to the bank and asked for a loan, but the amount they will be getting wont be enough to fully pay off the house. So now they want my savings (and btw also my brother's savings) for the remaining amount. When I initially heard that they don't have enough money for the house, I offered them help. But now I regret it, because now they fully rely on my money instead of looking for alternatives, like selling their other property or possessions and I really need and want a car.

I don't know what to do. Should I do as I promised and give them my money (I wont get it back at least the next couple of years, maybe never since now they see it as a family investment)? I feel like an asshole if I don't do it, they are my parents and I want to help them. But I also have a bad concscience towards my grandma, she wanted to give me a special present and I think she would not want me to spend it on something else. Should I tell her? She will definitely ask me about the money if I don't buy a car soon. So Reddit, what is the right thing to do in this situation?


EDIT: Thank you all so, so much for your advice. I couldn't answer everyone, because I'm at work and have to be sneaky with my phone lol. But I read all of your comments and took them to heart. You helped me realize that not wanting to give them the money is not selfish, but a valid thing to want. I have to think about what is best for me too sometimes. I will call my parents and tell them that I really need the car and maybe help them find a different solution. 


**EDIT 2**: Oh my god I didn't expect so many comments. Thank you all so much! I'm sorry that I can't answer you all individually, I'm a little overwhelmed by the amount. So the dreaded phone call happened after I returned home from work. I didn't know if I should make a new post or update here, but since the story is not over yet I will do it here. So during the phone call I got some new information. They have time to pay the money until the middle of December. I don't know if they initially told me a different date (=next month) to make it more urgent so that I will feel more pressure or if the date simply changed. Some people had problems understanding the circumstances of the whole house purchase, I'm also confused but maybe I didn't explain it right (English isn't my first language). So a guy called ""the investor"" sold them the house. I guess he's also the guy who built it and owned it. My parents gave him one third of the price in advance as safety or something and until a certain date they have to pay the rest of the price. There was no bank involved so far. So during the phone call I heard for the first time that not only my parents will take a loan from the bank, but also my brother. These loans are not specifically given for the house, in my country you can get a certain loan according to your salary. So my parents will get 20k and my brother also 20k. I was a little shocked that my brother would do this, since he wanted to buy his own house for him and his family soon. I guess these plans are off the table for now. So I was on the phone with my mother and told here that I found a car that I would like to purchase (that was kind of a lie, I just saw some interesting offers) and that I need my money for that right now. I also explained how important it was for me and so on. She paused for a moment and asked how much the car costs. I told her the exact amount my grandma gave me. Then my mother said I should buy the car. She apologized for asking for the money and told me she understood that it would be the right thing to do for me to buy it. She said I shouldn't worry about the house, they will find a way to pay it. And here was the moment I made a huge mistake. I currently work two jobs, one of them is a summer job for only 1 month, but my boss asked me if I could work for another month. I planned to say no to the offer, because then I would work until university starts again and I would have liked to have some time to relax and prepare instead. The thing is my brother told my mother about my bosses offer right before my phone call (they talked on the phone before I spoke to my mother). So like the idiot that I am I offered her to say yes to my boss and give here my earnings from this month and the next one, that would be 3k. She was satisfied with this solution. But I regretted it instantly. I hate this stupid job and to do it for another whole month would be torture. I tried to back paddle immediately and said that there has to be a better solution. I reminded them of their other property and suggested that they should at least borrow the missing amount from my uncle who wants to buy the property. It could be like a down payment until they find an acceptable price for both parties or give it back eventually. My uncle's finances are way better than mine and I know he's a good guy and would help them out. My mother agreed to discuss this option with my father. We will see how that will turn out, but at least I could save the money my grandma gave me. I just find it sad that my brother will have debt because of my parents, he really should think about himself, his wife and kid first. But he gets very angry whenever I try to give him (financial) advice, so I guess I have to accept that it's his problem now.

My wife died during childbirth. Almost 1.5 years after her death I began dating my girlfriend, Sarah. So I've been in a committed relationship with Sarah for about a year now. Sarah has been wonderful and really supported me in dealing with my wife's death. She encouraged me to keep pictures of us up in the house and always encouraged me to talk about her and keep her memory.

About 6 months into the relationship (this is about when I let Sarah meet my son), my son began calling Sarah ""mama"". I've never taught him that or referred to Sarah as that. I was confused but Sarah said he must've picked it up from other kids at playgroup or something. That seemed plausible until later I heard Sarah on the baby monitor saying ""mama! mama!"" to him until he repeated it back. I told her I'd prefer if he called her Sarah and she apologized. So son eventually goes back to calling her by her name but occasionally calls her mama still which breaks my heart every time.

There's been several instances since then that really bother me. Maybe I'm being too sensitive about this so I'm asking for some other opinions. For example, Sarah posts to her private Facebook group (where the people she is friends with but has not met in person) and refers to my son as *her* son. ""my baby boy"" ""he makes me proud to be a mom!"" etc.

This bothers me because she isn't his mother. I love her and she is great with him, but she's not his mom and I hate feeling like she is replacing my wife. 

yesterday we went to dinner with her coworkers and she introduced him as her son. I've spoken to her about this and told her it bothers me. She's apologized but said that it just feels natural and it just comes out like that. Anyway, so she said ""this is my son"" and I didn't say anything, but I felt so frustrated inside. Later she said, ""come to mama!"" and I said, ""Go to *Sarah*.""

I could tell she was really embarrassed that I did that, and maybe it was wrong of me, but I've asked her not to do it? She's still upset with me and just kind of crying on and off saying that I shouldn't have done that in front of all her coworkers.

I don't know where to go from here. I don't know who's wrong here. Sometimes I feel like I'm being unreasonable, but I also can't imagine doing this to her if the situations were reversed

tldr: girlfriend keeps referring to herself as if she is the mother of my child. I called her out in front of her coworkers and now she is very upset.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. The conclusion seems to be that I have handled my entire relationship with Sarah poorly. While she might have slightly overstepped, I probably encouraged that by allowing her to move in with me. The situation was that she was out of an apartment and since I have a home, she asked if she could stay for a bit while she looked for a new place. I was apprehensive and it seems like I should've listened to my gut. I don't want a coparenting role with Sarah at this point because I don't feel like she is committed to his care so much as the fun things that come with having a kid. For example, if he makes a mess then she won't clean it up because it's not her kid. But in public she loves to play and baby him. I will have a talk with her tonight and I think it would be best for her to move out and to end things. I think I will be done with relationships because you guys have pointed out that introducing new people too soon is confusing for my son and the only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing

I should also probably clarify that Sarah did not kidnap my son after she picked him up from daycare. Yes, it was very scary to come home and have no idea where they were and I was very angry with Sarah for not letting me now. But I was able to get ahold of her after a bit. Had she not responded for hours then yes I would have called the police (not that I would think she'd do something to him, but out of concern for them both)"

"My [26F] husband [30M] cheated, I don't want him at the hospital when our baby is born and I'd like advice on how to handle the situation.


My husband (of 4 years) recently told me he's cheated 3 times. There was a ONS before we were married, a FWB situation 3 years ago/they ""only"" hooked up a couple of times, and another FWB he saw off and on for a about a year but ended it right before talking to me about the cheating. I've had suspicions but no evidence, he'd tell me I was crazy or insecure and assured me he would never do anything like that. I eventually started questioning myself and feeling bad for thinking such terrible things about my own husband. 

I'm pregnant with my first child (due next month) and I think he finally admitted to cheating because he felt guilty. I've spent my entire pregnancy feeling like a complete psycho and started seeing a therapist, thinking I might have some kind of mental illness. He sat down with me a few weeks ago and told me I'm not crazy, I was actually right all along and he was cheating. He apologized but I'm still not sure if he's truly sorry or even capable of grasping the severity of the situation.  

I'm not shocked but definitely hurt and very angry. I'm staying with my mom for now and I'm pretty sure I want to get divorced. I don't think I'll be able to trust him again and he probably isn't worthy of it anyway. I feel like I'm in a fragile place mentally right now and need to stay strong in order to be a good mom to my daughter when she's born. Because of this I don't want him at the hospital for my c-section or any time after her birth. He's accusing me of using the baby to punish him and said keeping him away makes me just as bad as him. I'm not planning on preventing him from ever seeing her but I don't feel obligated to allow him at the hospital considering the circumstances.

We argue about it every time we talk lately and I've started avoiding contact with him because I'm sick of the stress. I don't want him there. I don't want to fall for anything or be reminded of how much I love him. I also don't want to ruin my daughter's potential bond with her father. How can we go about this without anyone getting hurt?

**Edit**: I'm open to the idea of him seeing her separately in the hospital. I'm going to try suggesting that as an alternative. He really wants to be there for her birth/the c-section but hopefully he's willing to compromise. I'm not trying to hurt him, more like protect myself and by extension my daughter. 

**Edit**: This has received a lot more attention than I thought it would. I'm at work today and I can't reply to all of the messages and replies but thank you for all of your advice. 

My OB/GYN knows he cheated and I've been tested for STDs. She has two days per week in the hospital and I'll be 38w6d when I have the csection. I want my baby to be as close to full term as possible so changing the date isn't an option. 

Regarding some PMs I've received: I'm not a bad person or anything. I want him to know his baby but I'm not willing to put his feelings ahead of mine or my child's well being. If I wanted to be mean about this and make it really hard on him, I could. He put both me and the baby at risk by sleeping around. He had no concern for her health or safety when he had unprotected sex with me after sleeping around. The impact of his lying and cheating is documented with my therapist, GP, and OB/GYN. I've had panic attacks for the first time in my life (which probably isn't great for the baby?). I could have filed for divorce and required him to get a paternity test, then a court order for visitation. I can change my doctor and go to another hospital. I have family out of state, I could have stayed with them and had her there. I have plenty of options if I want to fuck with him and really hurt him but I'm not. I'm here asking for advice on how to go about this in a healthy way.

"The neighborhood me (41F) and my family live in is really, really dangerous. I am desperate to move, my husband and children (17 and 19) refuse to move. I do not want to abandon them but I feel like I have no choice.


Hello, the area I live in is hellish. I am originally from the USSR and the area we live in is one of the worst parts of the city. There are murders here at a frightening rate, and robberies and rapes and a severe problem with drugs. It mostly got better in the 2000s but recently has gotten much worse, very suddenly. 

Just to give you a recap of what it is like here. We had a man with a pistol shoot at our neighbor over a drug dispute a month ago, killing him in our apartment hallway. A shooting from a car hit 2 teenagers a few days ago a couple of blocks away. My son (19 years old) was stabbed 3 months ago by a drug addict trying to rob him. The nearby grocery store was held up by 2 men with masks while we were there, ending with a near-hostage situation and one innocent person dead. A car bomb killed a city councilman 2 months ago near our apartment. There are men outside our apartment building day and night who check our pockets for goods almost every time we go outside, so we cant have any valuables. We have all been beaten physically by them at times. Girls are kidnapped and sold into trafficking day and night here, easily close to third who are raised here are involved either volunteerism or taken and drugged. 

I can go on and on. These things happen constantly. In my area last year, there were 51 murders for 90,000 who live here, which according to my mother is extremely bad statistically. I am done, I have BEEN done for the past 4 years, I feel like I had no choice to leave because my kids were growing up still. But now they are old, both can hold themselves down, they are men mostly. I feel as if they do not need me as much as they used to. 

My husband refuses to move, in fact he gets upset every time I bring it up. 

I am thinking of simply moving on my own, just leaving and not making a thing out of it. I can move with my mother in Moscow which is so much safer. There no point in me staying in this place waiting for something bad to happen, having my anxiety be in a constant high level for me stress. I need to think of myself here, I just cannot live this way. Not only that but my family has also been hardened by this way of living. Both of my sons are roughed up young men, especially my oldest who is turning into a gangster more and more. He brings girls that I presume he bought to our apartment constantly and thinks we dont notice him sneaking them in. He carries a little silver pistol with him everywhere he goes. He dresses like a street gangster now. I am terrified of something happening to him, and also about what dangers he might bring home. My youngest also looks to eventually get caught up in that lifestyle, he has already begun drinking and staying around other local gangsters in the area. I want to help them but there is almost nothing I can do for them at this point. 

I love my children and my husband. But is this the right choice? I need advice, I have no idea what to do. I will feel like awful mother if I move away and leave them there. 

sorry if english is bad, I had friend write it and she is not a natural speaker of english! 


tl;dr: My neighborhood is very dangerous, not sure if I should abandon my family and leave."
"Me [31F] with my boyfriend [30 M] of 4 years. He told me he doesn't find me attractive anymore and refuses to have sex with me. My confidence is destroyed.


[removed]"
"The last thing I (29F) ever said to my ex's best friend (33M) was, call me if you ever want to actually date me. 5 years later, he called.


6 years ago, I was in a long distance relationship with a guy named Alex. He wasn't right for me. I wasn't right for him. We eventually broke up.

This question for r/relationships isn't about my ex boyfriend, Alex. It's actually about my ex's best friend, Sean. 

As it became clearer that Alex wasn't the guy for me, his best friend, Sean, and I became closer. Sean lived in my city, unlike Alex (who lived on the opposite coast). Sean was a lot of fun to be around and easy to talk to (unlike Alex who didn't seem to enjoy my company). 

Sean was also single. At the time, I wanted to be respectful of Alex, even if our relationship wasn't meant to work out for the long haul, so I friendzoned myself. I decided to help Sean find a cute girlfriend so we could all double date -- all the while secretly having feelings for Sean and trying to suppress them.

Near the end of our relationship, Alex was out of town more often than not. So Sean and I would hang out as friends, grabbing beers, going to concerts, strategizing how to get Sean a girlfriend. It was fun. Deep down inside however, I wished Sean was my boyfriend. 

After a while, Sean and I became each other's default option. I was his wing woman after all. Being young, I hid how I really felt about him, and instead let him make me an option rather than a priority. So I'd go to events with him if he couldn't find a date. We'd do dinner if Alex would blow me off. If one of us got invited somewhere, the other would sit this round out. After a while, it started to hurt when it became apparent I liked spending time better with my boyfriend's best friend than my actual boyfriend. 

One night, just after I broke up with Alex, I was hanging out with Sean, complaining about my relationship woes. Out of the blue, Sean kissed me. It wasn't the best kiss. Just unexpected. We stopped immediately, feeling guilty about what we had just done. 

The next week, Sean started dating a girl I set him up with named Kate. He still wanted to hang out with me as friends, he told me over beers the next week, but we couldn't repeat what we had done out of respect for Alex and Kate.

I agreed. But then, after a while, Sean began to disappear -- as one does in a relationship. I would reach out -- and he would barely answer my calls. And if he did, he'd make plans at his convenience only. 

Now, five years later and way more mature, I realize I had no right to be upset. Sean was finally happy -- with a girlfriend I had set him up with. This was my fault. 

But back then I was only 24 and stupid. So I called him. And decided to be try and be honest for once. 

I told Sean I was tired of being an option. That I liked him. That I was sad he wasn't in my life. That if he ever broke up with his girlfriend, to give me a call. But until then, not to bother me any more.

He agreed. We hung up. I cried I think. And then, as a young girl in her 20s does, I started dating someone else. And I forgot about Sean.

Since then, I've had two relationships and a year of being single. I've grown and matured. I've become calmer and more conscious of how I treat others. Mostly, I've grown up.

Now, fast forward to last month.  A mutual friend casually mentioned Sean had broken up with Kate after 5 years. I too had just broken up with a recent boyfriend. I didn't really give it a second thought. Why would I? It's been so long.

Now, fast forward to this past week. 

Out of the blue, I get a FB message. 

It's Sean.

He asked how I was doing. If I wanted to get a drink and catch up, talk about old times. 

I'd like to.

My question is, should I do it? Alex and I haven't spoken in years. Sean is single. So am I.

Am I getting ahead of myself? Does Sean really care about just catching up? Am I reading into this? Should I make my intentions known? I don't wanna come off too strong or make things weird. Really, I'd just like to see him again. 

The last thing I ever said to Sean was, call me if you ever want to actually date me. 

Do you think that's why he's called? Or is it because he's exhausted all other dating options and is desperate?

I don't wanna be someone's desperate option again.

Anyways, what would you do? Any tips for me?

TL;DR: The last thing I ever said to my ex's best friend was, call me if you ever want to actually date me. 5 years later, he called.

"My boyfriend [29 M] broke up with me [30 F] after two and a half years over me not supporting his business idea


Not quite sure how to react right now. Woke up to my boyfriend having blocked my number over night after what I even didn't perceive as an argument. His last text he sent before he blocked me is saying it is over and we have nothing left to talk about. 

He's been looking to quit his job for quite some time now because they have him work 14 hr shifts most days. The problem is he's jumping from one half-baked business idea to another. The newest one was his co-worker telling him he had two ideas, one for a desaster relief app and the other one was a nightclub app. And since the co-worker only has time to deal with one app, he told my boyfriend to do the nightclub app. 

So my boyfriend asked me to do research and get back at him with results and in best case he wanted me to be the main force behind marketing it. My backstory: I already own a business. Had it for over three years. Had it before we met. I desperately need a second set of hands in my business and I've been trying to sit him down show him what I actually do every day. He never took interest in it so I left him alone after a while. 

I sat down researched his nightclub app situation. There was something very similar on SharkTank a few years ago, I remember seeing that episode so I looked it up. It flopped, despite heavy funding. His idea the way he wanted it to be looks even more money intense. So I honestly told him that I didn't think it was doable without a heavy initial investment, and I also think it won't be successful. He claimed I was being unsupportive and he would do it on his own now and overall he took it very personal which is crazy to me. I didn't mean to attack him. I just think this is not a good business idea. I put a good bit of time into researching it. Today I woke up and he dumped me. I'm not sure what to do.

"Im (24F) madly in love with a guy (22m) (18 mths) who my parents wont approve of due to his profession and image. How can I make them at least give him a chance?


Hey there Reddit, longtime reader and firsttime poster. Hoping for some answers here. 

Im a freelance photographer who frequently does events and magazines. Just shy of a year ago a club owner hired me to take some pictures of a big band rolling through supporting a larger act for the flyers and social media ads. Immediately I hit it off with one of the band guys, as a rule I dont date band guys but he seemed very down to earth. Immediately told me he wasnt interested in a hookup but would be delighted to take me to dinner. He plays the Bass and spends most of the time airborne onstage and singing along, like a big adorable kid. I caved and began seeing him and he's very intellectual, being  incredibly mature for his age as a bonus. He reads frequently and was studying to be a secondary school history teacher before this took off. We moved in and have a dog called Ernie together, I anxiously wait for him to come home when he toured recently. Although he swings between immature and intellectual like a set of newton balls I love him dearly.

The problem however is that my parents and siblings want to meet him now and they could not be more opposite. I was always different from the family which is shown through my profession and choice of partner. My parents are both doctors (Pediatrician and Urologist) and my siblings all attend private schools. My parents dont allow rock music in the house and encourage classical, hate tattoos, smoking and drinking and frown upon dating someone without a university education. They are very white collar and rude to people who they dont like. 

My problem being how do I manage to make them give my new guy a chance? They see him with bleached hair, tattooed from neck to ankles and all down his hands with a cigarette and find out his profession they will immediately close off and be rude. I want them to at least give him a chance and speak to him and find out how intelligent he is. Yes he plays music for a living but that is irrelevant to him as a person, hes so sweet and caring and would do anything for me. As a person there is no one easier to like. 

To make matters worse I know my guy and if anyone starts talking down to him and sticking their nose up hes going to laugh and tell them to Fu*k off with that shiteating grin that dares you to do something about it.

TLDR: Parents wont approve of boyfriends appearance or profession even when hes actually smart and down to earth. How can I make them give him a chance??

"Stepchildren [17's, 16f] steals my stuff and plays pranks daily on me [33f]. How can I talk to my husband [39m] about this?


I have been married to my husband now for two years, together for 3. His children didn't live with him at first but we still spent time with them together, and they were civil toward me at first. They moved in with us about 6 months ago and since then all hell has broken loose.

They're prone to pranks and as much as I love my husband he does absolutely nothing about their behavior. I don't expect them to love or like me but considering I don't try to parent them or intrude I don't understand the bitchiness. Yesterday I caught the youngest one scrubbing the toilet with my toothbrush, and when I told my husband he told me she would never do anything like that. A week ago he literally found some of my missing makeup in the twins' room and told me just to hide my stuff better. They still continue to steal my makeup and necklaces, and when I confront them about it they just shrug and tell me to leave them alone. 

If its one thing my husband is sensitive about its his children. How can I address this issue with him?

"My (24F) husband (30M) doesn't want me to earn more than him...


My husband of 1 year (all in all, together for 4 years) and I have a nice marriage. I recently got hired for a flexible job. I can choose my hours. How many hours I work - it's how much I earn. So, no ""fixed"" salary. However, this job pays very well. My husband has a nice job too and it's paid well. He works 8 hours a day and has a free weekend. If I worked 8 hours a day and had a free weekend at my new job, I would earn double the amount he earns.

That's where the problem starts. He doesn't think it's necessary for me to earn much more than he does. He thinks I should be fine with working 4 (or maybe 5) hours a day, as we would still be able to live debt-free and would have much more than enough for a nice lifestyle we've had so far. (I used to have a job where I had the same income as he does, but I quit).

I told him that I would use the extra money to pay for some language courses and to save for when I get pregnant, but he said that I could still pay for that with 4 hours a day of work. :/ But I'm a big shopaholic (yep, that's my addiction) so no, I wouldn't be able to save that much money for later.. I mean, I still can save, but not a big amount. He doesn't seem to understand it and he thinks his income will be enough to support us both when I am pregnant / have a kid. 

His reasoning is that it's unfair that I earn much more and that it would create a huge difference between the two of us, because money changes people. And I told him I would help him with my excess money, get him stuff etc, but he says that it wouldn't be right because he doesn't want me to provide for him and it doesn't ""feel okay"".. I mean, what the f! 

He's not really mysogynistic or anything. We share house chores and stuff. (I wash dishes, he cleans the bathroom, I clean the floors and surfaces, we both cook, we both wash clothes). So he's not the patriarchal type. He's not even religious or anything like that. Not controlling either. I am actually very happy with him.

But we are arguing a lot about this. He also thinks that my flexible work is too pressuring and 8 hours would be very stressing for me. He is right about that, though. But I think that excess money would benefit us both a lot.

I don't know if he's being unreasonable. Is he? Is he right wirh his concerms? Should I give in and work only 4hours a day? Or is he definitely not right? I really want to work more so I could earn more money, but he argues me about it.

Tl;dr - Husband thinks I should work only 4 hours a day of my flexible job. If I worked full-time, I would earn double the amount he earns and he thinks it's not okay."

It was really a relief that he died. My mom has always refused to acknowledge his abuse after he died. It used to bother me when I was younger because I wanted it to be acknowledged and for him to be remembered as who he was, but now that I'm older I understand it's just how she grieves. Didn't really bother me much that she needed that. 


Now, I'm getting married and she's really pushing for a photo of him there. I got upset about this the other day and she did acknowledge his abuse but says it was due to his alcoholism and he was actually a great man. 


This is just an important day for me, and I found a partner that I really want to celebrate being married to. Am I being petty about this? I've made a lot of concessions when it comes to wedding size, style, etc for my mom.


She is paying for the wedding but it's because she wants to have a big Indian wedding and I do not. She's paying for it because otherwise I would have likely eloped. Don't really want to be on the hook for 300 Indian people I've never met coming to my wedding so I already feel like I've made concessions about that. 



Do I need to suck it up and let his photo be there? He was such a horrible man the thought of having to think about him even once on my wedding day is causing me a lot of grief.

"My[21] Husband[26] Has Only Child Syndrome


My husband[26] and I[21] just had a baby boy[6mo]. My husband was an only child and had no contact with babies for pretty much his entire life. I accepted that there would be a learning curve and he eventually warmed up to holding and being more involved with the baby as he got older (as I anticipated). 

The trouble is, I've noticed more and more that my husband has a terrible case of only child syndrome. I was raised in a huge family where sharing was mandatory and we forced to spend as much time in the company of the family as possible, I remember often growing up if I went upstairs to play on my computer and my family found out that they would take all my electronics away. My husband however was raised in a low income home in a poor city area. Both his parents worked so he was alone often with the tv and video games. He is quick to claim things as 'his' and he doesn't seem to grasp the concept of sharing or being a part of a centralized household (we are living with some of my family for the time being as we just moved back to my hometown). 

For example: we have a PS4, it was originally mine but I now refer to it as 'ours' because he had one when we moved in together but we agreed to sell it because we didn't need 2 PS4s. Ever since then he says the PS4 is 'his' because he sold his original one, he jokes that if we divorce he gets the PS4 because it's 'his now'. When I point out it's a family console he gets defensive. He thinks of himself as a separate entity from the baby and I, and he says when he gets home from work he needs 'his time'. He acts like he is allowed to move and act independently without thought for his family and that his needs and wants are most important. 

How can I help him see the bigger picture and realize that we are all in this together?
