"HAPPY BIRTHDAY ASKREDDIT!!


*[""What day is today? It's AskReddit's birthday. What a day for a birthday. Let's all have some cake!""](https://i.imgur.com/c3Tkb7b.png)*

That's right, January 15th is the 10th year of AskReddit as a community. 10 amazing years full of so many, many memories and stories. As most of you know, we have been building up to this day for a while now and I am happy to announce that the AskReddit 10th Anniversary T-shirt is available to purchase with 100% of the proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders, which the community voted for as the charity of choice.

**[Here is the link for you to purchase](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/askreddit-10th-anniversary)** 

As you can see, there is more than a t-shirt option. We wanted to have a variety of options available to everyone in case you were not a t-shirt person, so we have a hoodie, a hooded tee, a baseball raglan, a ladies tank top, and a higher quality shirt. 

We are also happy to offer alternative options for a hat, tote bag, and blanket featuring the second place winner of the contest and like the t-shirt, 100% of the proceeds of all these products will be going to Doctors Without Borders. 

**[Here is a link to the collection where they are available](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/askreddit-10th-anniversary-collection)**

For those of you that wish to support the cause, but do not want to buy anything, there is a **""Donate Only""** option when you click on the ""Buy/Donate"" button. Also, if you could share on social media after your purchase or just in general to increase awareness that would be really awesome.

---------

Now, a few thank yous need to be said.

Thank you to /u/mrscrankshaft. She is a representative from CustomInk that reached out to us and was a tremendous help throughout the whole process. 

Thank you to /u/woodpaneled. He is the admin that gave us the gold to give to the top designs and has helped throughout this process.

Thank you to ALL the artists that gave up some of their time to create a design for this. Even if you didn't make it to the final choices, we want you to know that we really appreciate the time and effort you put in. It means a a lot.

Finally, a thank you to the community. None of this would have been possible without you. This is one of the greatest communities on reddit and I am proud to be a part of it.

Today is a day of celebration, so let's do that! Please use this post to discuss your favorite AskReddit posts from over the years.
