0,"Mega/Meta thread: /r/Incels has been banned from reddit. All your questions, comments, thoughts here.


Many of you will be familiar with the term incel, but for those of you who are not, they are self described: ""Involuntarily Celibate"", primarily men who feel that they are second class citizens due to their inability to have sex for a wide variety of reasons including, but not limited to; lack of attractiveness, ""social status"", money, ability to socialize with others, sense of humor, charisma, or whatever. 

Even those who aren't familiar with the label may recognize some of their rhetoric or even notable incels (like Elliott Rogers). You may have seen reference to ""Chads"" (men they feel have all of the above qualities they lack) or the idea that women should be assigned by the government to men for sex, or that their day will finally come when sex robots are common and they can finally do away with ""femoids"" all together. 

It's been a particularly peculiar branch of self-loathing that has grown more and more outwardly hateful and hostile over time. Reddit has banned it today due to violations of their violent content rule. 

Please use this thread to direct all your incel related thoughts, feelings, and yes, questions (It looks like they're looking for places to go- as their home base has been taken and no- we're not going to host 85 threads on ""why male models"" and ""How threatened are you by sex robots plus VR) from the newly displaced population)

But please do remember our general rules which wll be enforced which include 

* No disrespectful/hateful commentary
* No graceless generalizations of gender (yes, that includes claims of women only liking money or looks)
* No Invalidation 

So please report comments that violate the above and any of the rules in this sub. And of course, please use the search bar for previous topics on virginity and attraction. 

Edit- Note that this is being discussed on a wide number of subreddits right now. We felt we needed one here due to their oh so common presence in the new queue and so many of our inboxes and the violent rhetoric that got them banned was typically aimed at women.  "

3,"Women who ended long-term relationships with generally supportive partners who are not abusive: what ultimately convinced you to end the relationship? Was it the right decision?


I find that most people don’t honestly talk about the reality of the day-in-day-out of their relationships unless it’s in jest or a particularly high high/low low: the mundane/occasional loneliness/shittiness, etc... leaving us all with a grass is greener illusion. "
