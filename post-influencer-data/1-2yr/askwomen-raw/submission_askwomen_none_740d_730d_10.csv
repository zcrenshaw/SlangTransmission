Every time the OP's lover thrusted into her, he would count out ""one million babies. Two million babies"" etc. I found it hilarious and read the post to my boyfriend. It's become a joke that we reference semi-regularly. What's yours?"

What would you make the contestants do? What's unique about the show. There's no moral guardians at all so don't worry but keep in kind you can ""only"" show an hour long episode a week. Unless you want to do it big brother style that is.

So yeah 52 episodes a season. So what kind of show would you create?

Also please keep this at least somewhat ""realistic"" because I don't want to derail it like the r/askmen thread."
