This is probably stemming from the fact that we (my parents and me, when I'm staying at their house) take care of my Gma who has advanced dementia. 

I've grown pretty close with my mom over the last few years. If I have a big decision to make, I call her to talk it through. If I have a bad day, I tell her. If I get great news, she's the first person I tell. She had me late in life so she is 60 while I'm 24. The concept of losing her one day actually makes me sick to my stomach and brings tears to my eyes...."
