Manic Pixie Dream Girl is an archetype, that taps into a particular male fantasy: of being saved from depression and ennui by a fantasy woman who sweeps in like a glittery breeze to save him from himself, then disappears once her work is done.

16,"FAQ Q&amp;A: ""What are, in your experience, the best and worst things about being a woman?""


Hello, AskWomen!

In a new post series over the next several weeks, we will be updating our sub's FAQ to include a great many topics that have lately been coming up with high frequency (and repetitive answers).  There will be one new topic per week, generally going up on Tuesdays (western hemisphere time) and coming down on Sundays.  

**These threads will be HEAVILY MODERATED.**  The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible.  If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What are, in your experience, the best and worst things about being a woman?**

Please especially keep in mind when answering this question or reading the responses of others:

* Trans women are welcome and encouraged to answer.  

* Nonbinary people and trans men who once were and/or currently are largely perceived as women may answer about that experience.

* While responses about the physical aspects of being AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth) are welcome, not all women have ovaries/a uterus/a vagina/boobs.

* Generalizations about men/other women should largely be understood to mean ""most people of this gender in my life.""  Blatant ""all men X"" and ""all women X"" statements as well as obvious parroting of trite stereotypes will still be removed per our rule against graceless generalizations.  

Thanks for contributing!
