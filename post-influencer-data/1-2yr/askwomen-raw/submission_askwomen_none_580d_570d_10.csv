0,"Do you think lottery winners should be allowed to remain anonymous?


There was a case in British Columbia not too long ago where a guy won $50 million and went to court to fight having his name and picture published in order to collect his prize. He lost. One concern I've heard is that they don't want to be flooded with people coming out of the woodwork asking for money. Another is for their personal safety because knowledge of their new wealth might make them a target for crime.

What do you think? Would you fight for anonymity? Do you think it's a right to keep your identity out of it, or one that you forfeit when you buy the ticket/claim the prize?"
