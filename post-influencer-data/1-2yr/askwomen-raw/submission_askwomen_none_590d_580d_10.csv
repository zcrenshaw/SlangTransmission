0,"What did your partner do to give you the best organism you ever had


"
1,"What are some hobbies you and your SO do together?


My husband and I are in a bit of a rut, so just curious what others like to do! Maybe we’ll get some new ideas to try. "
2,"What is your favourite, ‘Let that sink in,’ fact?


"
3,"What complaint about women are you absolutely sick of hearing?


"
4,"What makes you feel very comfortable on a first date?


"
5,"What delicious meal do you make that is so much simpler than it seems?


like people would easily believe it's so elaborate and complicated because it's so wonderful and delicious, but it's not!"
6,"What's the coolest thing you've seen in someone else's house that you'd never want in your own house?


"
7,"What are the awkward “creepy guys” like in real life?


I enjoy reading the posts in /r/creepyPMs. It’s full of (mostly) men writing the most cringeworthy texts ever. Unwanted sexual invites, random emoji stories ending in an awkward compliment or question. Sometimes it’s creepy, but mostly it’s just... cringe and awkward.

Someone must have met one of these guys in real life. What are they like during a date or any real life encounter?"
8,"Students and young professionals: do you ever feel overwhelmed, distracted, worried about spending your time doing the ""right"" things?


What goes through your mind when you’re feeling this way? 

If you could make one change in your life as a 20-30 year old, what would it be and HOW would this change your life? (ex: be social but not spend a ton of money, eat healthier, get in shape, spend more time relaxing)

What is your biggest barrier in making this change? 

When do you feel the most valuable? When do you feel the happiest? (ex: when you spend time with your closest friends, when you accomplish big projects, when you invest time towards your passion/hobby, when you have an amazing workout, etc). 

What “distractions” do you face on a regular basis that keep you from feeling productive, happy, or self-confident? Have you tried to overcome these distractions? If so, were you successful? Why or why not? 

Am I the only one who struggles with these things? "
9,"What are some downsides of being conventionally attractive?


I asked this over on AskMen a while back and forgot to here. What would you consider to be the negatives of being conventionally attractive?"
10,"What is something your pet does that makes you fall in love with them all over again?


Sometimes our pets are lovable monsters, and sometimes they're just lovable. Maybe your bird curls up against your cheek or your rat shares his snacks with you. What kind of pet do you have and what does it do that reminds you all the cleaning, training, and vet bills are totally worth it? 

Photos totally optional but always welcome!"
11,"Have you ever regretted being friends with someone? What's your story?


"
