0,"What’s the saddest story your parents ever told you about their lives?


My mom (who’s been in several abusive relationships and has now been single for over 10 years) grew up with alcoholic parents. I’m going to write from her perspective:

“Honey, you have to make sure you always have a plan for just yourself. When I was five, my parents were drunk and fighting again, and they were threatening divorce. They were ‘splitting up the kids’ (she had three older siblings) and saying who they wanted to take. My father wanted Lucy and Sarah, and my mother wanted Bill. And nobody picked me. 

“I ran out the front door and laid down in our grass, looking up at the stars. I sang ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’ while crying, and then I said ‘I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.’ And I wished for my OWN man, one who would take care of me and love me and want me. And I thought because I put it out there into the universe, that it would happen.

“I was always looking for MY man. I went through the rest of life looking for him. And he never came. And now I’ve accepted that he’s just not going to come. 

“And sometimes I still look for him. At church today, I took a peek around. ‘Nope, no one here.’ I have to be okay with just being on my own.”

Coming from my mother, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. Mostly because I know it’s a reality and a possibility for me (and anyone else), and that she may be right. She may live the rest of her life alone."

Hi. I'm a woman in my thirties who sort of feels like I missed out on a few things due to past mistakes. I'm just turning my life around and hopefully I can enjoy a future. If it's not too late.
