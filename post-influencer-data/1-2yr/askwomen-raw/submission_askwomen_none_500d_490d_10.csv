Hello, AskWomen!

In a new post series over the next several weeks, we will be updating our sub's FAQ to include a great many topics that have lately been coming up with high frequency (and repetitive answers). Based on the commenting patterns on the first post, we're bumping up to a 2/week schedule.

In case you missed it, the most recent FAQ Q&amp;A threads before this were:

* [What are, in your experience, the best and worst things about being a woman?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/89dh0n/faq_qa_what_are_in_your_experience_the_best_and/)

* [How do you make friends after your early 20s?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8aaosv/faq_qa_how_do_you_make_friends_after_your_early/)

* [How do you take care of yourself after a breakup?  What has made it easier for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8b7m3b/faq_qa_how_do_you_take_care_of_yourself_while/)

* [What challenges have you encountered as a woman in STEM?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8c2cj1/faq_qa_what_challenges_have_you_encountered_as_a/)

* [What are your favorite life hacks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8cvnim/faq_qa_what_are_your_favorite_life_hacks/)

* [How do you feel about ""friends with benefits"" situations? Have you/would you have one? What have been your experiences with them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8dpbfv/faq_qa_how_do_you_feel_about_friends_with/)

These threads will be **HEAVILY MODERATED.** The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible. If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What birth control methods have you used, and what have been your experiences with them? Which is your favorite?**"
