"Rude lady thinks she can eat for free and leave. Now banned from our store!


Hey there! Back with another weird story. I’m on mobile so formatting blah. Also, kinda long story, but worth it.

Backstory: There’s a lady who will come into our store, usually around noon with four (annoying and loud) misbehaving children. Of course, she’s completely oblivious to all of this. Yay. She would pack all of them into the cart, pick out some sort of produce (apples, bananas, oranges, etc) and give it to them to “hold” and the kids would eat all of it. Then she would come up to the register and give me the whole, “Oops, sorry. I didn’t even see that they did that!” 
I would call my manager and basically ask “Wtf am I supposed to weigh?” and usually they would either get the same amount of whatever produce and she would complain that she’d “not gotten that much!” or “mine were WAY smaller!” So my manager would just wave it off and let it go. 

Today, she didn’t get away with it because my manager and I were in a bad mood. 

I was QUIETLY working at my register when I heard the parade of obnoxious children run into the store with the lady on her phone completely ignoring them. Shocker! She piled all of them into the cart and headed straight for the produce. I continued working at my register and lost track of her until she came up to my register. She huffed and puffed at the little old lady in front of her writing a check while all of her children were screaming in her cart. She’s still on the phone and I hear the (R)ude (L)ady talking semi-quietly on her phone.

RL: “Yeah, I’ll be home soon, there’s a slow ass hag in front of me.”

Thankfully, the little old lady (Who is literally maybe the nicest person I’ve ever met) doesn’t hear that well, so she’d missed RL’s comment. After hearing that, I purposefully take my damn sweet time processing her check and asking her how her grandchildren are doing. I finish bagging her groceries and set them in her cart. As she’s pulling away, RL decides she’s not going fast enough and ACTUALLY PUSHES HER OUT OF THE WAY WITH HER CART. When the little old lady turns to look at her, she’s smiles smugly.

RL: “Sorry.”

The little old lady frowns and walks away. Now the real fun begins. Before she says anything, I notice that each child has banana peels in their laps and the youngest has banana all over their face. There’s even a peel inside RL’s purse.

RL: “My kids ate these. Here.”

She proceeds to grab and dump all of the peels on to my register and starts to leave.

Me: “Ma’am, I need some sort of payment, you can’t just leave after eating all of these.”

RL turns and glares at me. She backs up a little. 

RL: “Just weigh the peels or something, I don’t have time for this!”

I glare back at her.

Me: “Even if I was allowed to do that, I’d need ALL of the peels.”

I gesture to the one in her purse (gross). She throws it at me. 

RL: “Here’s your peel. Now weigh them!”

Her face is getting angrier by the minute.

Me: “I’ll have to call for a manager.”

That’s when I notice the ‘Organic’ sticker on all of the peels, which means it will be more expensive. $1.29 /lb in fact. She slams her hand on my register as I’m about to call.

RL: “This is ridiculous!! Just weigh my hand or something!!!”

As she’s pressing her hand down, she’s also squeezing the peels as hard as she can, making a huge mess of peel and banana mush. I’ve had it.

Me: “MANAGER TO THE FRONT. Please.”

The (M)anager thankfully was not far and came rushing up.

M: “What can I do for y-“

He sees it’s this particular lady and the mess on my register. Before he can open his mouth again she wails at him.

RL: “Your cashier has been so RUDE to my family and I! All we want to do is pay for our bananas and GO! She’s being incredibly difficult and even made this disgusting mess!”

I’m fuming at this point and my manager is getting a little ticked off knowing this lady is a liar because I would never do something this childish. 

RL: “What are you going to DO about THIS for us???!!??”

I turn to my manager.

Me: “Her and her children ate an entire bunch of bananas, tried to leave without paying and when I called her out on it, she told me to weigh her hand and squished these peels.”

The manager nodded.

M: “Go ahead and weigh her hand. Whatever it comes out to, she can pay that. Then, she’s no longer welcome in our store.”

Of course she’s shocked and stammering trying to claim that I lied about the entire story and it was nothing like that. Obviously my manager was having none of it and told her to put her banana covered hand back on the scale. She did and pressed as hard as she could.
Well, she’s not too smart and forgot how scales work. She’d pressed it down and it came up as about 30 lbs. 

Me: “And your total is going to be $38.54. Will you be using cash or card?”

She was completely outraged and started yelling at my manager and I calling us crooks (ironic) and that she’d never pay something so ridiculous. My manager threatened to call the police and report her for theft if she didn’t. She screamed some more and threw two $20’s at me. I gave her the change which she snatched out of my hand and continued to scream and curse down the exit and out the door.

Me: “Thank you for shopping, have a nice day!”

EDIT: Wow! This blew up. Thank you so much for all of the comments, I loved reading other stories! Thank you for my first gold too!! So cool!

For those asking why she came through my line when she didn’t plan on paying: In the backstory I provided, my manager would either grab new fruit and she would complain, or just wave it off and let her go. Basically she would either pay less than what actually would have been owed or nothing at all. 

For those asking about cute little old lady (her name is Eda) I asked a coworker to text me if she saw her and ask if she’s okay. Nothing yet, cross your fingers.

To clear up some things: No, she had nothing else except banana peels. 
I asked little old lady about her grandchildren in the time it took for me to process her check, maybe 15-20 seconds."
"You didn't have to do what you did either.


Not me, but an older lady I work with told me this story from yesterday (when our store was observing Veteran's Day.)   

A little back story: We have a regular customer who is a Korean War veteran and he'll often come into the store (like every other day) I guess to pass time and talk to people. Whatever, he's no bother, and a genuinely nice person to talk to.

So yesterday, there was a huge line at the front of the store, so he walked back to the customer service desk where my coworker was, and asked if he could buy his shirt there instead of waiting in line for 15+ minutes. She said she could absolutely do that for him. He was dressed in his navy uniform for Veteran's day (I think he had gone to some event in the morning) and there was a couple standing nearby. When my coworker read the total ($19 or something like that) the husband from the nearby couple walked up and put a $20 bill on the counter and said ""I'll take care of that. Thank you for your service, sir."" and the old veteran said ""oh thank you, you really didn't have to do that."" and the guy replied ""well you didn't have to do what you did either. It's my pleasure.""    

It was a nice little interaction within the craziness of the store yesterday and it brought a smile to my face :)     

Edit: clarification that it was Friday the 10th, when the store observed Veteran's day, not Veteran's day itself. "
"The Time I Was Offered $200 to be Shot


So a few years back when i was working retail, i was employed by an army surplus store which i worked selling airsoft and paintball guns. Having been playing airsoft for nearly 6 years at my time of employment i was a pretty knowledgable employee. 

Working at a surplus store we sold old demilitarized police vests among other tactical gear. We get the same question asked about them ""will they stop a bullet"". The short answer? Probably - the answer we legally tell everyone to save our ass if someone tests it out? No. 

One day a customer comes in asking about the vest and i run through my internally scripted memo about them when he offers me $200 if i put the vest on and let him shoot me. Now working in the airsoft section i just assumed he meant airsoft, so i asked ""with an airsoft gun, right?"" (For $200 I'd take an airsoft shot). He replied no, and went on to talk about one of his higher caliber rifles and how he wanted to shoot me. After a few minutes of me explaining the store rules against talk of violence against another person especially an employee, after arguing about why you can't just tell people you want to shoot them, we had to escort him out of the building. 

Never saw him again, but god damn if i don't still remember his ugly mug. 

EDIT: I figured it was noteworthy to mention i live in Canada"
