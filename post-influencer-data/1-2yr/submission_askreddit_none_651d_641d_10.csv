"Announcing a very special contest...


January 15, 2018 marks the 10-year anniversary of the AskReddit community and we wanted to do something special to commemorate the event. So, we are having a contest to design an official AskReddit 10th Anniversary t-shirt that will be available for you to purchase, with all of the proceeds going directly to charity. We will keep this contest open from now until December 29th and we will pick the design we feel best represents the spirit of the sub, similar to how we did for our [mobile design contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/46c00m/the_askreddit_mobile_design_extravaganza_contest/) last year. The best designs will receive reddit gold courtesy of generous admins (thanks /u/woodpaneled!) and we will gift a t-shirt to the creator of the winning design. 

Following the contest we will have another post with a list of charities for you to vote on to decide where the money raised will be going. The idea is to have a t-shirt to celebrate the community, created by the community, with all the proceeds going to a charity chosen by the community. We are aiming to have the t-shirt available for purchase on the day of our anniversary, January 15th.

After doing some research and speaking with other moderators that have run their own charity t-shirt events, we have decided to go with CustomInk to print the shirts. One of the big reasons we chose them is because of their [""Verified Charity"" option](https://i.imgur.com/0QfeVzr.png) that allows all the proceeds to go directly to the charity we choose instead of going through us. That means that **none of the money will touch our hands** and CustomInk will ensure the money raised goes directly to the charity. CustomInk also had some of the best numbers to ensure that the charity gets the most. We will be keeping you updated on how much exactly, but [here is an estimation of the profits for selling just 50 shirts to give you an idea.](https://i.imgur.com/VTGjVtH.png) 

**A few guidelines:**

* Please no NSFW designs (sorry that means no cumboxes)
* Please keep designs limited to one side (either front or back)
* Please have the images be as high resolution as possible and note the maximum file size is 10MB. These are the accepted file types: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .pdf, .ai and .psd
* Please avoid using anything that is trademarked, except for Snoo. We will work with the admins to get permission for the final design.

Please use this thread to submit your designs and also feel free to ask any other questions you have. We look forward to seeing all your designs and to working together as a community for this event!
