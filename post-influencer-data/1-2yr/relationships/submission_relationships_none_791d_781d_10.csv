[Link to original](https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6muq1a/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_3_years_he_makes/)

Okay wow! So I want to start off saying how much I appreciate all your feedback and support! I did read **every** comment in the thread! I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did but the support has helped me in many ways!

I talked to my boyfriend last night after we had settled in, ate dinner, and relaxed. I asked if I could talk to him about something and just told him ""I really don't like it when you come up to me and say things about my body like 'hey babe you need to hit the gym, when are you going to do squats, etc'. It's not very nice and I don't say things like that to you.""

I could see the gears turning in his head and he really did seem surprised it bothered me so much. He apologized profusely and told me he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thinks I am beautiful and he loves everything about me. I told him I appreciated his apology and that pretty much summed up the conversation. He apologized again a little bit later so I think it was still on his mind.

So that was that. It truly was as simple as most of you told me it should be. However this has brought my relationship with my dad to my attention and made me realize why I put up with those comments from my boyfriend for so long. I really have been conditioned to brush those things off because of the reaction I expect when I say something about them. Habits die hard I guess!

I put a lot of thought into how to handle the situation if my boyfriend did anything but apologize. I plan on using those ideas and what I have taken from my last thread to confront my dad. Next time he says something rude about me or one of my siblings I plan on asking him why he does it and telling him I don't like it. When he tells me it's a joke I will tell him it isn't funny. I will ask him if a joke is really worth damaging his relationship with his family. I have realized that I have to approach this situation differently than I have before and I hope in resonates with my dad.

I do want to say my dad is not a bad person. He is definitely an asshole sometimes but he is a product of circumstance and there is a lot going on in our lives. This is no excuse for the mean things he says but I do want you all to know that he loves his family deeply and has sacrificed all of himself to keep our heads above water. I wouldn't trade him for the world!

My boyfriend is also not a bad person. He does stupid things and so do I but we do love each other. It's always easy to demonize someone by getting only one perspective and knowing nothing about the people involved. While it will never be okay to say things like that to someone, when his comments initially started I did not properly communicate with him about how it made me feel and by laughing it off I was condoning it. I know why now, but that also doesn't excuse my poor communication with my boyfriend. I will learn from this!

I will add in that I of course expect him to follow through with this apology. Sorry only counts if your actions reflect it as well. I don't expect to encounter this problem again but I do know how I will handle it if I have to, thanks to you all!

So I do want to end with another thank you! Sometimes the psychology behind small problems can reveal large problems and it takes a lot of support to face those! All of you that take time to think critically about other's problems and type up advice are really doing something great!

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend apologized when confronted. I intend to also confront my dad in the future and have learned some lessons about communication!"

"I (M/16) want to stop parenting my dad (M/34) [UPDATE] happy ending


[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6h1ol5/i_m16_want_to_stop_parenting_my_dad_m34/)



I thought long and hard whether I should update this, but I really wanted to thank the people who gave me so much advice when I was in a tough situation.


I posted here about a month ago and even though, I do appreciate all the advice I got, most people wrote that I should be patient for a couple more years, till I’m an adult and then leave my dad on his own so he can either swim or sink. 



Though, I can see the logic in that, I hated that scenario. Reading all the responses was beyond painful so the second I saw my dad that same day, my brain exploded and long story short, I had a massive meltdown in front of him which involved an excessive amount of yelling, swearing and tears on my part, and complete silence and shock on his. 



I said this before but my dad is not a bad person, he loves me and our relationship is very good…he’s just lazy, childish and immature. All of which he admits! But apparently never thought of them as bad traits until he saw my meltdown. He told me that he never thought I would feel so affected by his actions and he only let me do all those things because he thought I wanted to do them, “because I’m the bright one”.



After a lot of things were said, my dad “promised” to change. It was decided that I would still help out, do chores, and do my part as a member of our family, but from now on I won’t be alone. At first I thought this would be another empty promise (an educated guess), but somehow he was serious this time. 



We started off with some easy stuff, like going to the market. He hasn’t been to one in over a decade. It took much longer than usual but it was actually very fun. We also made a deal to take turns with the laundry and cleaning the house (if either of us breaks the deal, we have to pay the other a fine of 20£). 



Cooking will still be done primarily by me because I don’t want a food poisoning, but he promised to watch some tutorials and try cooking from time to time. So, at least when I go off to uni he won’t starve or marry the pizza delivery guy. Baby steps.



As for the taxes, I’ll keep doing them because I don’t mind it too much and chose it as one of my chores (he took loading and unloading the dishwasher so I consider myself the winner). But once I get to uni an accountant will take over because otherwise my dad will end up in jail.


Overall… though I’m still embarrassed for that tantrum, I think that getting those things off my chest was very helpful. Not only I now don’t worry as much about my dad for when I move out, but I think it actually made our relationship even better. 


So, thank you, kind strangers for all the advice. I really do appreciate it.

"Problems [32M] with my GF [33F] of just under a year who just informed me she's part of an MLM program


Hi everyone!

So, I'll dive right in. My gf took me to a ""meeting"" that she said was important to her the other night. Turned out to be an MLM presentation for World Wide Dream Builders which is basically an AMO (amway motivational organization).

Basically, it's amway but they tell you that you have to earn a mentorship from them (by buying things and going to paid events) and then they will teach you to be a debt free cash flow something or other.

I was floored and shocked at what I was at and as you can probably guess, I have a less than stellar opinion of these things. This was the first I was hearing of this. She had gone to some conference a few months back and wouldn't tell me what it was because ""I would probably just google it"" and ""that's not the way I should learn about it"". 

The people speaking to the 1500+ people at this event the other night are the ones that she is trying to ""earn"" a mentorship from. She feels as though they are her best friends and some of the greatest people she's ever met and I should feel privileged to have gotten the chance to hear them speak. 

I felt dirty, not privileged when I left the event. She told me that ""these are the two best people that YOU will ever get the chance to meet in your life and you should feel privileged to even have the chance to hear them speak."" I don't want to use the term brain-washed, but I want to. 

We talked about it last night and it did not go well. I told her that if she wanted to do this, I would support her but I did not want to be an active part of it. This does not seem to be okay with her and she is ""disappointed in me."" and she will be dedicating a majority of her time to ""building this asset"" going forward. 

I would really like to make this work but I'm not really sure if that is possible.  Any suggestions or similar experiences? We are supposed to talk again tonight when she gets off work.

"My sister [17f] and I [17m] finally found out the real reason our parents got divorced. How can we deal with the feelings of hatred we have toward our mother?


We don't really have anybody else to talk to about this, so we were hoping maybe we could get some advice and second opinions here. Our parents got divorced when we were around 7 years old. The memories are kinda blurry but I do remember that one day dad was in the house with us and the next he had his things packed and told us he was leaving. As little kids we were sad but eventually got over it as we were able to see both parents and they did everything they could to make us happy. 

I am not going to take trash about our mother, but she has been in and out of relationships so much we usually can't even remember the names of her exs as little as 4 months ago. We also have two younger siblings (7 &amp; 8) but we know they're only our half siblings. She has always told us that their relationship problems and why they divorced was none of our business and that what's in the past is in the past. We never dared to ask. But recently we heard her talking to some of her friends (they all get together and catch up at least once a month) about her and dad. I don't know if they forgot we were up there or just didn't realize how loud they were being but we heard all of it. Mom was telling them how when dad had his surgery (he was going through a illness but is fully recovered now) he was weak, depressed, and ""useless"" and she had another man that was ""giving her what she wanted"" the whole time.

The whole conversation is too long to repeat here but she kept on insulting him and calling him some cruel names. My sister started crying and left to go to her room. I went to comfort her but she was pretty shaken at some of the things she had heard. She told me that she hated mom and now that she knew the real reason why they divorced, she didn't want anything else to do with her. I understand how she's feeling and I'm furious about it as well, but I'm also confused on how we should handle this/or even if we have a right to be mad because it was so many years ago.

Honestly I don't see her in the same way anymore and I guess feel kinda ""betrayed"" (as dramatic as that sounds) because of how she treated dad. I know exactly how my sisters feeling. And I feel like if we don't control it we're just going to create more drama that we don't need.

[Link to previous post]  (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jvw8k/me_27f_with_my_boyfriend_29m_of_two_years_he/)

Well it's been three weeks, and a lot has happened. First of all, thank you to everyone that took the time to read and respond. I sat him down the day after making that post, and I broke up with him. He was devastated. Didn't see it coming at all (even though I had said we should wait to live together, and we'd had a discussion about me being unhappy.) 

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't cry. I wasn't even that upset. I think tells me that I was getting over the relationship slowly, and had known for a while that it wasn't meant to be. I mentioned the trip situation, as well as the different sex drives, and some other reasons. 

&amp;nbsp;

He asked if there was anything he could say or do and I said no. I was very nice to him, but very firm that it was over between us. I left that evening and we met up a week later to talk at his request. We have some friend overlap, so I thought it might be best. 

&amp;nbsp;


He told me he never thought I would leave. It never even crossed his mind that I would ever be frustrated enough to go. He said that several times. That he always thought there was ""always tomorrow"" to make things better. That was odd to me, I mean, we'd had like 5-6 conversations over the two years with me saying ""Hey, I am not feeling loved and I am not feeling fulfilled here."" Here is where it gets bizarre. He told me that the reason he hadn't wanted to hang two nights in a row ever, and just did his own thing, and never wanted to grocery shop together or go do things was that he was PREPARING for moving in together (FOR A FULL YEAR) by getting in as much ""bachelor time as he could."" I asked if this was a conscious decision and he said yes. That just blows my mind. I asked him if he thought making the relationship weaker made sense for me to want to move in with him. He said ""well when you put it like that, no."" 

&amp;nbsp;


R/Relationships, I'm baffled. I don't know whether to believe that explanation or not but it really doesn't matter. It just affirmed I made the right decision, something I have not doubted for a second. Of course now he's all chatty cathy and trying to show me he cares but I told him we need to not talk anymore. There is literally nothing he could do that could change my mind. I told him that an effort after a breakup feels hollow to me, that I don't want a foundation like that for my relationship. That actions taken after a breakup are typically just to reduce pain, they aren't real change. That if he had wanted to hang more with me, or initiate sex with me, etc he would have especially after many conversations. 

&amp;nbsp;


Oh and the low sex drive thing. Turns out he is addicted to pornography. He was lying about it the entire time. I never knew because we didn't spend enough time together for me to understand, and I of course never checked his stuff so I had no clue. Usually I am intuitive, but I trusted him when he would turn me down after I was gone on a 7 day trip that it wasn't because he had done things a bunch. The fact that he was lying about it and chose to do it over see me...it's so disappointing but I know I can do a lot better. He told me he would think about me and want me, but it was just ""easier"" to do things himself rather than call me up. I told him numerous times I would love to spontaneously come over (it's a fifteen minute drive.) And he never once took me up on that. I am not going to let it make me feel badly about myself though. I know there have been people in the past that really enjoyed sex with me and there will be someone in the future. I am over it. He told me that it ""wouldn't be an issue"" if we got back together. That is insulting because either he just wasn't interested in sex with me, but suddenly is if it means we can get back together, or he was just lazy about it or something. I don't know which is worse. 

He said he feels like he made the biggest mistake of his life. I knew he didn't have a lot of relationship experience but damn. 29 seems like a tough age to learn this particular life lesson, to value what you have and not take it for granted. 
  
&amp;nbsp;


Ps I am on the trip now with my family, and having an absolute blast. Not one ounce of me has missed him or wished he were here.

"Stepmom(45F) acts like I'm(19F) the ""other woman""


A little background: I am 19 years old, and I'm away from home attending college. I'm really close with my Dad and two younger sisters. My parents are divorced and my dad remarried my stepmom about 7 years ago. 

Anyway, I don't know what it is, but my stepmom has never made an effort to get to know me. It might have something to do with the fact that when my dad was still married to my mom, he cheated on her with now-stepmom. Long story short, I found out, and sent stepmom a really mean email. But, it was a mean email coming from an immature 8 year old, who didn't understand the complexity of the situation. But I feel like it would be really unfair to write me off because of something I did when I was 8. I digress. 

Continuing on, due to my biological mother's mental health issues, I was not a part of my dad's life until I was 15. When I was reunited with him, I was genuinely excited to meet his wife and my half brother. I was hoping she could be a mother figure, or even just my friend. I've tried really hard to make this happen too. I buy and make her gifts during the holidays, I try and get her to do stuff with me, and I have tried to tell her directly that I want a relationship. 

But she still does not like me. She barely speaks to me. Every time I see her, she acts like everyone wants to get rid of her, despite everyone reassuring her that we want her around. She will often just leave the house with my brother whenever I am around, I think to make my dad feel bad about her perceived victimization. 

She will also say passive aggressive things that imply she is a perpetual victim. For example, I was visiting my dad for the 4th of July. She was planning on leaving to go to her parent's house, so I asked her if she was going to stay for fireworks. She responded by saying she was going to leave the next day, but since I wanted her to go, she would leave immediately. We all begged her to stay, but she left anyway.

My biggest problem with her is that when my dad spends time with me, she acts like he is having an affair. She will call him and say things like ""Rowan(half-bro) and I are learning we can have fun without you, so just stay with missmolly314"" or ""I think you should just go to Mexico with just missmolly314 and her sisters instead of all of us like we planned"". She gets so jealous, and I just don't understand. I'm his daughter, not a stripper. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't feel welcome at my dad's house. My dad is a major pacifist, and he's aware there is an issue, but he doesn't really confront her about it. Knowing he is not much help, how should I resolve my issues with my stepmom? Should I be direct and tell her she is acting like a baby? Or should I just wait until their marriage falls apart (hint: their relationship is having serious issues because of all this and money issues)?

TL;DR: stepmom doesn't like me, no matter what I do. It's affecting my relationship with my dad, because she gets upset when I'm around.

EDIT: First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to this post. It made me realize that I'm not alone in this issue and that I'm not just imagining things. Per the suggestion of many of you, I have told my dad that this issue needs to be resolved if he wants a relationship. I suggested family therapy, and he is going to talk to her about that idea. If we can make progress, great. If not, it's going to become a painful and unnecessary her vs. me situation. 

Also, next time she starts the passive aggressive shit with me, I'm going to confront her about the way she is treating me. "
"My friends neighbour (36M) invited himself on our cottage trip. I (28F) now have to Un-Invite him.


Hi guys, Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am just looking to get some outside perspective on this. 

My best friend (BFF) has a neighbour, Steve (36M). My friend has young kids that play outside and thus she is often outside watching them and since Steve is unemployed, he is almost always out there as well. While Steve considers them VERY close friends, my BFF does not and once she moves away, they will no longer be in contact. Steve is not a terrible person but has a very grating personality. Always says the wrong thing, can be quite blatantly rude, etc. I try not to spend time around him and my husband very much dislikes him.

I dropped by my friends place a few weeks ago and Steve was outside hovering around, as always. Myself and my husband are renting a large cottage for a week in August and my BFF and her husband and kids are coming for a few days. My BFF is very excited so she mentioned this to me, in front of Steve. Steve then INVITED HIMSELF to the cottage, saying he had nothing to do that weekend. I did not say no as I was so completely caught off guard. I had absolutely no idea what to say, I find it very unfair that he would ask me that, I mean, we barely know each other!!!! (I later learned this is a very 'Steve' thing to do, he imposes on people and invites himself places all the time)

I told my husband about it later and he was a little ticked at me for not saying no right then and there but holy shit it was just really a shock to me, I had no idea what to say. I wish I could have thought of something at the time, but unfortunately I didn't.  

The bottom line is, Steve is someone who we do not get along with and we do not want them at our cottage vacation. My husband and I literally get one vacation a year and this is it. I'll be spending $800+food+ time off work for both my husband and I (neither of us get paid vacation time). This cottage is a big, expensive deal for us when you work in our lost wages and we want to spend it with our close friends. My BFF thinks we should just let him come and deal with it, but I know she's just dreading having to hear from Steve how sad he is that he's not coming. I get that and I feel bad about it but I'm pretty resolved that this has to be the outcome.

I absolutely know I'm going to come across as a jerk in all of this, and who knows maybe I am being one, but I need to let Steve down gently. All advice is much appreciated!!

My idea right now is to tell him that the owner has a strict limit of how many people can be at the cottage and we are over the limit. (I have had rentals where the owner stipulated this so it's not too far out)

 

TLDR: My best friends annoying neighbour invited himself to our once a year Cottage Trip. I have to let him down gently. Halp!"

I have been witnessed to twice this year, once during a sale from offerup and again today at work with a coworker.

It ended up taking an hour because he spoke for so long and he also kept poking his finger super close to my chest and did make contact a few times.





Today at work a coworker I was working side by side with asked if my partner and I are the same religion and when I told her we weren't religious she was so surprised and asked me a lot of questions about what I believe(nothing) which I don't mind at all. It was harmless and she wasn't being judgemental or anything but then she talked for thirty minutes about how much she loves Jesus and how she prays and he speaks to her in her dreams and all this other stuff about atheists changing their minds and it was just so much. All I could do was make polite listening sounds and say ""wow that's crazy"" the whole time. 


 I am very shy and nonconfrontational to a fault but how can I politely tell people I don't want to be witnessed to? I don't want to be rude but I really am not going to change my mind on it and I don't really want to talk about how much someone loves Jesus for so long.

TL;DR of Original: Learned that my Dad was cheating on my Mom, and immediately torpedoed his affair with some heartless manipulation. Feel guilty about what I've done and am struggling to see a path towards forgiving my father. 

***

Wanted to post an update since the OP got a decent amount of attention and the advice was really helpful!

Firstly, thanks to everyone who commented. I got some really reassuring advice, some challenging points of view that helped me be more introspective, and some rather flattering remarks about my quick thinking. Y'all really helped me feel in-control and added some context to my perspective, so thank you!

Since my post, a few things have happened. 

* My parents spoke as a pair to each of our family members individually (my siblings, but also my aunts &amp; uncles, grandparents, etc) to let them know about the divorce, the affair, and about what went down between me/my father/this other woman. 
* My family is pretty universally upset with my father. Not that I want everyone hating on him, but he did (at best) screw up royally and it's good to know that no one is choosing teams instead of acknowledging who did wrong. 
* My parents have both blocked this other woman from all phone lines/social media, etc. This is in part why the rest of the family was notified, so that they'd be aware if this woman tried to make contact. 
* After the above, we learned that this woman had attempted to contact my 17y.o. sister *24 hours before* the events of my OP. My sister missed the messages and didn't see them until after everything happened and was out in the open. 
* Still not speaking with my father, but have talked with other family about what's going on. 

As for how I'm feeling about the situation, any guilt that I had for what I did vanished the second I learned that this woman tried to contact my sister first. While my response was to tear this whole thing apart as quickly and effectively as I could, I cannot **imagine** what my poor little sister would have gone through if she'd had contact with this woman. I'm livid that she thought this was even remotely appropriate, and I'm livid that my father at any point thought this was a safe or stable person to involve himself with; therefore, I don't feel even a bit guilty about what I did any longer. 

I'm staying no-contact with my father until I sort through what I want to hear from him, and seeking counseling to talk through how my anger in this moment/at this situation is undoubtedly linked in all sorts of messy ways to my upbringing, etc. Crazy how hard it is to find a LPC with a &gt;3 month waiting list... but I'll get there!

Thanks again for the great comments on my OP. It really helped me judge which of my feelings were valid, and where I needed to cut myself a break. I think I'm in a better place now, but of course would love to hear any further advice/similar stories that y'all think might be helpful, or answer questions. Cheers!

  **tl;dr**: Family is handling the situation correctly though it is hard. Other woman is (1) definitely nuts and (2) completely cut off/out of the picture. I'm remaining no-contact and seeking counseling, but feel much better about what I did and where to go from here. "
"[32M]: My sister [35F] and her family moved in with our parents. She is now calling the shots on when my wife and I's children can go to grandparents' house, and no time seems like a good time.


Updated

My wife [31F] and I [32M] have lived within 5 minutes of my parents since we've been married (9 years). We now have 3 kids (2 boys, one infant daughter) My parents usually keep our boys on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. My sister, her husband, and 9 month old baby moved in with them 2 months ago, which happened to be a week after our 3rd child was born. They moved here from out of state to get a new start close to home. Educated people, had good jobs where they were but wanted to come back.

So right away, my sister said that Tuesdays and Thursdays are no good for our kids to go over there. She has to do teleconferences those evenings and needs ""total silence"" in the whole house. Turns out many other days are no good because they go to the gym, play soccer, and various other recreational activities. I can count on one hand the amount of times our kids have gotten to go over since they moved in over 2 months ago. My mom will offer to keep the kids only to back out because my sister can't have them over for one reason or another.

We talked to my parents before they moved in, worried about this very thing, and they assured us it wouldn't happen. My sister is a very controlling person. There has been a laundry list of times she has shit on us during times of our lives that should have been happy milestones.

Today I texted my sister asking if we could come up with some sort of compromise as to when our kids could go over there, and she basically said no to all my requests. My dad then called me telling me that my sister's family is in need right now and to stop pushing the issue, which I have only just confronted today. I don't get it. I would never move in and tell my parents their other grandkids aren't allowed over. I'd take my ass somewhere else to do my work if I needed silence.

I work 2 jobs, my wife works and takes online classes, we have 3 kids including a newborn and now our structured help (only 2 afternoons a week but precious time for us) is gone. Temporarily, but with no timeline.

Is this bullshit or are we being childish and insensitive?

TL;DR: My parents (our children's grandparents) used to have our kids over on a regular schedule. My sister and her family moved in with the grandparents, now my sister is determining when the kids can come over and no time seems to be a good time.

Edit: I'm a little late on this. Several people have asked why my mom can't come to our house and see our kids over here. She offered to once but it ended up not working out. We even said that she could bring my sister's kid over so my sister could work. She liked the idea. When I talked to my dad about it he said that's no good because he didn't want to ""change anything up."" He didn't give any other reasons as to why.

Also, I left out some back story that apparently would have been helpful. My sister's disrespect to my wife has been profound and in plain sight. My dad always basically tells us to deal with it to not shake things up. 

To name a few, my sister asked us to not name our second kid that name because she wanted the name. Dad said to comply. We named our kid the name anyway because he's our kid. Recently, we had the first granddaughter after 6 grandsons. We never flaunted that at all. At Christmas, when anyone would congratulate my wife, my sister would cut off the conversation and say ""look at my baby."" Then she last-minute moved in with my parents from another state the week my daughter was born. Also at Christmas, my sister, her husband and child, and the husbands parents moved in with my parents for 2 weeks and basically made the house off limits for any time but family gathering time. That's like a drop in the bucket for how toxic she has been in our lives but hopefully can shed some light on the current situation.

Update: I just want to say thank you so much for all of the thoughtful replies and PMs. My wife and I have taken them all to heart and I am blown away by the support shown here. I feel equipped with some fantastic advice to move forward in this situation."

"My [33f] wife's spending habits are becoming such a problem for me [35m] that I'm considering a seperation.


Married 5 years, together for 15.

My wife makes twice as much money as I do, but is always broke and asking me to make up the difference. We're up to our eyes in debt, which I've been trying in vain to make our number one financial priority. Despite having effectively zero disposable income, she's constantly throwing away hundreds of dollars on things we really don't need. Its just so frustrating when my clothes are falling apart and she's buying new furniture.

We've agreed to a scale system, so I don't pay half of our combined bills, but I'm still giving her $500- $600 a month. I might be able to manage half, but she will just spend herself back to zero. I gave up on keeping a budget long ago because I have no money to keep track of, and she won't stick to one. I tried the trick of putting her credit cards in the freezer, but she just thawed them out without telling me when she wanted to go buy things.

I told her today that I wasn't going to give her money she's been asking for to pay for a dog training class (we've already put the dog through one and stopped home training after that). She wants him in this class so we can prep him for getting *another* dog that we cant afford. I've been livid all day about the situation.

I'm getting to the point of looking at rentals on CL because this is affecting our marriage so badly that I'm considering leaving. I've also considered counseling, but if it's going to cost me anything then I'm SOL.

TL;DR How do I curb my wife's compulsive spending before it destroys our marriage?

EDIT: I hope I haven't given the impression that my wife is some callous, high-maintenance golddigger. She really is a saint, just one with very poor financial sense. She knows this is a problem, but like with all compulsions/addictions it's not something you can just switch off.

EDIT2: Or the impression that I'm wholly innocent in the situation. A good chunk of our older debts are a result of problems I've had in the past maintaining steady employment. Granted, it was also during the ""financial crisis"" so jobs weren't exactly plentiful, but I wasn't overly proactive in seeking them, either. It's just becoming increasingly frustrating that I've been working so hard these last few years to do my part and we're still just as broke as when I was unemployed. "

"[Update] I [30/F] have been feeling insecure about my performance at work these past two weeks due to various events and my anxiety and tomorrow I have to do a presentation to all the office. I'm scared I'll have a panic attack and I don't know if it should be good to talk to my boss [32?/M]about it


Hi hi Reddit! Yesterday I came to you asking for help for my presentation at work. Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6olwzm/i_30f_have_been_feeling_insecure_about_my/) for more details!

Honestly, your comments helped me a lot! And for some reason the ones telling me that I wasn't suited for my job, telling me to quit and to hide my worries to my boss striked a cord in me. As I was reading I was thinking ""Wait a minute, this is not the situation at all!"" and made me focus on the good things I've done in my work and all the situations where I had a problem and my boss have been nothing but helpful without judging. I just had some bad weeks, and I'm still learning.  I guess my stuborness did me some good, haha

I want to thank also the beautiful people who provided support, experiences, and suggestions for my anxiety. Just reading them made me feel so at ease!

Sadly between reading your comments and the nervousness I couldn't have a single hour of sleep! None! I don't know why, but I tried to close my eyes but it was imposible. Time passed very fast and was morning already. I felt like the day increased a difficulty level in me because I didn't feel rested at all, but I said ""Fuck it, let's do this zombie style!"".

So, I got up and prepared, I used my make up in my best abilities to hide the bags in my eyes and I left for the office. We have flexible work hours but my boss arrives very early, and my intention was talking to him at first hour.

I got to the office and he was the one who opened the door and the first thing I said was that I wanted to talk to him about something. I told him that I was feeling very nervous about the presentation, that at first I wasn't sure that I was able to do it but yesterday I read things on the Internet (I don't think he heard that as I asked a bunch of online strangers) that made me feel better about the issue.

He probed a little about my reasons to feel nervous. I told him that I was feeling stressed and I felt vulnerable when I had to speak in front of other people. I compared the situation of playing a game and trying to beat a Lv 10 boss with my Lv 1 Warrior. I felt that it was very overwhelming to me.

He listened very carefully and told me ""Alright, but what would happen if the Lv 1 Warrior has friends of higher levels and play with him?"" I answered ""Well, the warrior would level up more easily"". He really emphasized the need for the more experimented members of team to help the newcomers and he told me that I should see the office as a safe space where I didn't feel vulnerable since everyone would be helping me during my talk.

We started rehesal my presentation. At first I kept forgetting things and babbling and he gave me feedback, especially with my language because I couldn't use technical words since the whole office would be present. I didn't have the chance to practice the whole presentation but I already felt way more relaxed though the day. It also helped that he invited the team pizzas celebrating the fixing of some critical bugs :)

The presentation was ok. Everyone gave feedback about the things I talked about and my boss and my other team members made additional comments when necessary. When I was talking I felt like my voice was shaky and quiet, but my boss told me I was perfect. So, there's that! Incredible how distressed I was about this whole thing. 

And the best thing was at the end of the day, that my boss made the team play Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes (google it! It's a cooperative game about deactivating bombs). We got some good lessons about teamwork. Next week we will play Left 4 Dead :D

Well, sorry for the wall of text, it seems that everything is going good and I'm confident the bad weeks are behind... for now! I learned many things these days and I'm grateful for that.

Now I can't wait to go back home to sleep.

TLDR: Talked to boss, he's still the best, made a rehelsal of the presentation and everything turned out good even though I was in a zombie state. Also pizza and games at the office :)"

Boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. Got into a stupid argument which escalated into a massive fight because neither of us could let it go earlier this morning. Some yelling and blaming was done on both parts but I refrained from any name calling or taking any irrelevant hurtful jabs. We were yelling and stopped for a second and stared at each other when he said to me ""You are cancer in my life."" My mom had stage 3 cancer for 4 years. He knows about it and he knows it's a word that holds a lot of emotional ammo. I cried. A lot. We fought a little more, but I was too tired and cried out to keep going and he had to head to work. He's been at work for a few hours now but ive been sitting in my bedroom just feeling kinda numb after hearing that. 

How do I deal with this? No one has ever said anything remotely this hurtful to me before. Is this forgiveable? Do I talk to him about this? 

Tl;dr: boyfriend of 2 years said im cancer to his life. Don't know how to deal with this. Advice/opinions welcome. Thank you.

"My friend/bridesmaid [28F] dropped out of the wedding/ended our friendship sent me [25F] a text months later... I'm not sure how to/if I should respond.


Diane and I had been friends for 5 years and I thought of her to be one of my closest friends. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding last year and she was supposed to be one in mine this year. 

Things seemed normal.  We work at the same company and had lunch most days, she went dress shopping with me and got her BM dress for the wedding, we got our nails done together regularly, her husband was super excited for our wedding, etc.  Nothing really felt out of the ordinary to me. 

Then in Feb, she told me she couldn't be a BM anymore.  I initially thought it was a time/money thing but then she said it was bc she didn't feel like our friendship was in a good place and that our lives were going in different directions and there was too much rivalry between us. I honestly didn't know what she was talking about. I asked her what this meant then... Were we still friends?  Was she coming to the wedding as a guest? 

She said she didn't know but still wanted to have lunch once in a while.  I told her I couldn't do that.  It felt too much like trying to stay friends with an ex.  If she felt so strongly about us then I'd rather not have a half assed friend like that. 

So I deleted her number, threw out the trinkets from her wedding and such.  It honestly felt like a romantic break up haha.  But I got over it. 

Today out of nowhere she texted me a screenshot of Facebook of a pic of my cat with a toy she bought her (hence she was tagged) 4 yrs ago.  It was one of those Facebook ""remember this?"" things and this text:

""I know you still don't want anything to do with me and that's cool but this came up on my Facebook news feed and I thought I would send it along. I almost forgot how little she was when you first got her. And happy anniversary with her because I know that was last week.""

I feel like she makes it sound like I ended our friendship for no apparent reason.  I'm not sure how to feel about this and just haven't replied.  I probably won't, but I was just feel confused and maybe just needed to vent.  What do you thing? 

tl:dr:  friend cut off friendship randomly and then randomly texted me again as if I was the one to cut her off.  Unsure how to feel. "
"Me [33 F] with my husband [32 M] of 10 years, he does more cooking and unhappy with the balance but SUPER particular about it


My husband and I have been married for 10 years, together since high school. We love each other a lot, have a ton of fun together, and we're a great team, but like a lot of couples we have the same fight CONSTANTLY.  

Ours revolves around chores, specifically cooking. Back when we first got married, we moved for his job and I did almost all of the cooking while I was looking for a job and then for a couple of years after I got a job. Over time that's shifted--my job got a lot more demanding and his got less demanding, we moved and both started working from home and he started making us lunch every day (I usually am too busy during the work day to cook, I'm happy to have leftovers or canned soup or just little snacks when I'm making my own lunch, he wants ""a real meal""), he got into cooking as a hobby and started voluntarily doing a lot of grilling, etc.  

The problem is that he now complains that I don't do enough, but when I do either cook something on my own or ESPECIALLY when I pitch in on something that he's planned, he expects everything to be done the way he would have and complains when it isn't.  So, for example, last night he had planned either salad or this zucchini, sausage, tomato sauce thing with some pasta. We don't usually eat pasta but we have 2 boxes of gluten-free stuff that he bought on accident a few weeks ago. We had just gotten back from the gym so I said I'd take care of making dinner while he went to play some video games and grab a shower. I'm a pretty good cook myself and I made a really solid dinner, used an entire box of pasta and all of the zucchini and sausage to make a huge amount so we can have leftovers and it'll take some pressure off of him for lunches. 

He haaaated it--apparently he only wanted like a quarter of the pasta in the box to be made plus all of the zucchini so he could eat mostly vegetables, started saying a bunch of stuff like, ""oh I thought about measuring out a quarter of the box for you but I figured you could handle yourself.""  I pushed back saying that if he wanted something specific he could have given specific directions and if he wants me to make dinner he can let me make dinner.  He ended up bringing it back up this morning and said I've been ""terrible help"" this entire week (there was another thing on Sunday where I threw away some extremely sad looking basil while I was cleaning the kitchen, turned out that was the GOOD basil that he had picked out of a bunch and washed up and for some reason had left laying out on a cutting board on the counter) and that I make decisions in the kitchen that are ""insane"" and that if I ""just think about things for ten seconds"" I would obviously make the same decisions that he makes.

It's basically like--he wants me to do more work in the kitchen but ONLY if I can be a clone of him or like, his employee or a robot automaton. If I do anything wrong, whether it's actually wrong or just deviates from how he would have done it in some way, he gets really grumpy and often insults me.

"My [21M] girlfriend [19F] of two years is jealous of my boss' [33M] daughter [10F]!!!


In my opinion, this is all truly psychotic and my girlfriend has SERIOUS issues but a part of me is giving her the benefit of the doubt.. and so I've come to Reddit to ask for your opinions and advice. Yes, you read the title correctly. The antagonist of my girlfriend's story is a TEN year old girl.

I recently began working for a friend of my dad's, Kris, and he is an amazing boss. He's super friendly, genuinely nice and we have a great time working together (it's just us two atm). He owns a company that is built pretty much next to his sister's house and so whilst his wife is at work he brings his daughter to work with him and his sister takes care of them for the day whilst he works right next door.

His daughter is ten years old, and she's adorable. I'm not a weird person, please don't think this like my girlfriend did.. she's just a cute kid. I was telling my girlfriend how Kris thinks she's got a crush on me and how I think it's really sweet because every time I walk past her whilst at my boss' sister's house, she begins to try get my attention by modelling and posing and showing me her new bags/shoes. Kris and his sister think it's hilarious and we all laugh about it. I talk to her, obviously, but it's just normal adult-child conversation. I know I'm probably making myself sound more suspicious by having to state that nothing is sinister.. but it feels like my girlfriend immediately assumed that of me when I told her.

She freaked out a little, telling me she doesn't like how this kid has a crush on her man and how I PROBABLY ENJOY IT? I said it was sweet, she's ten.. every ten year old has a crush but in no way do I enjoy it. I didn't even feel like I needed to mention that to her because it's so obvious! Anyway, she's said she's worried if I continue working with Kris eventually the girl will get older and somehow we're going to fall in love and run away together.

Please, Reddit.. please tell me this is way out of line? Have I seriously done anything wrong at all? I feel like if I had Kris would have beaten the shit out of me by now but I feel even disgusting speaking about the subject. This is obviously 100% innocent yet she's making me feel like a freak. It's a CHILD'S CRUSH.

I don't know what to do or say. I honestly believe she's troubled with something to assume I'm going to wait ten years for this girl to grow up and then fall in love with her.. especially when it's all stemmed because she grabbed a purse and started modelling it off. It was all a laugh, she's a child and we all found it hilarious. Seriously, I don't see the big deal.

But I still want an outsider's perspective. I need you guys and your opinions and advice. Please just give me any thought you have on the subject, me and my girlfriend both need to hear it. Thank you in advance.


tldr - my boss' ten year old daughter has a crush on me and tries to get my attention whilst at work.. girlfriend is now worried I'll someday fall in love with her when she's old enough if I continue working for my boss... I think she's insane, but I also want an outsider's perspective."

"My [24F] friends staged an intervention to tell me my boyfriend [27M] is abusive and they can no longer stand by. I still don't know what to think.


Help me out, r/relationships. I live in a foreign city with my boyfriend with a few friends here and far away from my family. I need an outsiders' perspective on this all. 

So last Sunday 4 of my friends took me to one of their homes and sat me down to say that they all think I've been in an abusive relationship of 1 year. Right now I'm caught because I feel like they're half right half wrong. 

Their arguments are that they've seen my boyfriend when he's been really angry at me, and they say the stuff he says/way he treats me is beyond the pale of a normal ""angry partner."" They said that my boyfriend say things to me that no one should say to anyone ever, and I get upset and nearly non-functioning when it's happening. But their biggest argument is that my boyfriend will always apologize after a week of verbal torture so as to drag me back on his side. 

The truth is my boyfriend has had major anger blowouts maybe 2 times in the past year. One time he got mad because he thought I lied to him about my romantic past, and he accused me of sleeping with one of his friends. The truth was I did go on a date with this friend, but we never slept together and this was way before I met my boyfriend. Anyways he blew up and called me names and told me really hurtful things like I'm a ""worthless partner"" and this is why he'll ""never love me"" and things like that. Like really deeply hurtful things that weren't just part of the argument. So during that time I had my friends as my only support. They saw me at my worst, when I couldn't eat and I was crying and throwing up from all the anxiety. They also read all the texts my bf sent me, the really bad ones, and were shocked at how incredibly cruel they were. At the end of the week, my bf called me and gave a really long apology. It turned out he had a friend at his ear who was telling him all these terrible things about me and getting him riled up. He told me he finally saw the light and was so so so sorry he put me through all this and he still wanted us to work things out. I agreed because it made sense to me. I couldn't recognize him when he was that angry and it was such a relief to have the old-him back. I was still hurt, but he took time to talk to me and make me feel better. 

So the next time something like this happened was maybe 6 months later. I won't get into why he got so mad, but we were long-distance at the time and he blocked me on all social media for 48 hours. Since we were LDR, I had absolutely no way to contact him and was convinced we were done. He just told me he was dumping me and promptly blocked me. I couldn't go to work for those 2 days and had the same friends around to comfort me. After the block, he went on the same kind of path and said a lot of hurtful things like how our entire relationship meant nothing to him and that he was sorry he ever met me, etc. At the end we reconciled and he told me it was the stress of the business trip that set him off and he promised to keep his anger under control and to never, ever say these things to me ever again. 
 
These were the only two instances stretched over nearly a year of dating. My friends have told me that these were still 2 times too many, but I am really caught on the fence. To give credit to my boyfriend, he has sincerely apologized after each time and took steps to comfort me and repair my feelings. However, my friends are convinced that he has absolutely no respect for me. They pointed out a lot of other small things they've noticed where they said he makes small ultimatums to me to make me do the things he want. Like he threatens to break up with me if we don't go somewhere for vacation, or see certain friends, or do certain things. I don't really remember these instances well, but my friends apparently do and they are livid about it. 

I know all of this puts my boyfriend in a terrible light, but it's hard to convey over text what a wonderful person he can be as well. How loving and kind and absolutely sensitive he is when my friends aren't around. How our personalities and interests click so perfectly in a way I've NEVER had with anyone else ever. We have had so many good memories and time together that it feels like a waste to throw all of that away over a few days of roughness when he wasn't even himself. I've always thought that this was the man I wanted to marry. Anyways, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I need an outsiders perspective on this. Preferably someone who has/is in a similar relationship to mine.

"[UPDATE] I [27f] just ended a toxic relationship [43m/2yrs] and I needed to tell someone...


Relationships can be so hard, so understandably there tends to be a lot of sorrow in this sub. Well, here is something a little bit brighter as well as some life lessons...

[Original post here.](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ndfkk/i_27f_just_ended_a_toxic_relationship_43m2yrs_and/)

**Sometimes the hardest thing to do is also the right thing.** Note, this is coming from someone with no kids involved and no marriage. I can't tell ya what to do in that situation, I have no idea. However, I ended a horribly toxic relationship over half a year ago. Reddit, y'all were very helpful and supportive! After months of therapy, moving into my own place with some new friends in my old hometown, focusing on my hobbies/community/family/friends, I can actually say I'm doing well. I even met someone new that honestly... treats me so well that I think I could cry! I've never felt so loved and heard in my whole life!

So, I've learned a couple things:
 
* When you **close the door on people that hurt you, you make room and open doors for good people that will lift you up.**

* Also, **being alone is not the worse thing; being with the WRONG person is far worse.** Sometimes in a break up you think, *""Oh, the years I wasted!""* But that's ridiculous. Just imagine how many more years you could have wasted in that failing relationship! Relationships are work but they shouldn't be THAT hard...

* Finally, it's okay to make mistakes. **Don't let your pride and ego fool you into staying in a toxic situation.** My ex said that he didn't want to break up because he didn't want to ""seem foolish."" Breaking up is ""admitting that you made a mistake."" As if that's a good reason to stay together! Nah, get out and live your life.
  
So thanks again for all the support, and **feel free to share your experiences/advice after leaving a toxic relationship too!** Also, if you suspect that you are in an abusive/toxic relationship or that you may be with a narcissist, PLEASE reach out, even if it's just to this sub! I wish y'all the best! 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**:  Ended a ridiculously toxic relationship. Reddit, y'all were very supportive and I just want you to know that I've never felt so good. Therapy, focusing on friends and hobbies, learning from mistakes and choosing to only spend time with those that lift you up were essential. 

Again, if you suspect that you are in an abusive/toxic relationship or that you may be with a narcissist, PLEASE reach out, even if it's just to this sub! Take care of yourself!  "

"I [19M] feel like my sister's [24F] girlfriend [24F] really doesn't like me and I don't feel comfortable being around her. What can I do without coming off as rude or homophobic?


First of all, I just want to say that I've known my sister has been gay for many years, even since she was in the closet back when we were teens.  I was the first person she ever told and I was the only person who knew for 5 years before she openly came out to our family and friends.

So I'm definitely very supportive of her, and I've been supportive of her my whole life.  I definitely don't have anything against it and all I want is for her to have a happy and amazing life and find love with whomever she finds. 

I'm just saying all this so you know that I have no issue at all with LGBT relationships and I'm wholly supportive, and my discomfort does not stem from any bigotry or anything, but from this particular person and her attitude towards me.

Now, this woman who is my sister's girlfriend, my sister has been her partner for about a year now, I believe.  They have a very excellent relationship with each other, and there's no issues between them that I know of.

When I first met my sister's girlfriend, we got along close, but as time passed I always felt that she kind of really doesn't like me, and that only got worse.  I don't know why, but I've been as nice and polite I can to her, and I've tried treating her like she's my own sister and being open and friendly with her, but I still always get the feeling she doesn't want me around.

The only thing I can think of is perhaps it's some kind of jealousy.  She's jealous that since I'm my sister's little brother, I spend much more time with her than she does (my sister and I both still live at home with our parents though my sister is planning and saving up on moving out, things are just a bit expensive at the moment).  I think she's kind of envious that my sister and I have a close relationship and she wishes she could spend much more time around my sister like I do, and she get's envious of any affection my sister shows to me.  She kind of feel my sister is ""hers"", hence she gets angry at me the brother whenever my sister remotely spends any time with me.

I don't know if this is true or not, it's just my theory.  I haven't brought it up with anyone.  I've asked my sister several times if she thinks her girlfriend hates me or doesn't like it when I'm around, she says it's ""nonsense"" and that ""she thinks I'm funny"" and has no problem with me.  I can't help but feel that's not true at all.

In the past the three of us used to hang out a lot, but recently I've been trying to make an effort to avoid being with the two of them, but I kind of run out of excuses eventually.  It's little things in the girlfriend's behaviour that indicate to me she doesn't like me: for example, occasionally I catch her scowling at me or with a grimace on her face.  Whenever there's an interaction between me and my sister, or I say something or try to join a conversation or voice my opinion, she rolls her eyes or sighs.  She answers my questions abruptly like ""yep"" or ""i dunno"", never full sentences of anything.  She get's really seemingly unhappy when my sister displays any physical affection towards me, like if she hugs me, or kisses me on the cheek, or says ""I love you"", and stuff like that.  My sister is really warm and kind-hearted towards me and still treats me a bit like a child and spoils me sometimes even though I'm 19, but she does that stuff a lot to me, and her girlfriend always would like sigh loudly or fold her arms or start pacing when that happens.

Whenever I'm talking on the phone to my sister, and I know her girlfriend is with her, I kinda get the sense her girlfriend is rushing her on the other end of the phone to hang up with me and end the conversation.  I feel like her girlfriend is impatient at any time she spends with me.

My sister and her girlfriend are over at our house a lot, and I'm also there a lot, so I do inevitably run into them a lot.  And that's when we're not out at the cafe or shops together (as I said, we used to do that stuff the three of us a lot more before, but I've been trying to do it less recently to give them more time together but not piss off the girlfriend).  Unfortunately it's usually my sister who always insists I come hang out.  Her girlfriend would say stuff like ""oh, he doesn't have to come if he doesn't want to"", and my sister would say stuff like ""no, he has to leave his batcave once in a while"".  As I said, whenever we're at home, or out together, my sister always likes to be overly touchy or affectionate, always hugging me or whatever, and I feel like she's almost completely unaware how obviously pissed her girlfriend gets at this.  Like sometimes the girlfriend would loudly mutter ""oh my god"" or sigh loudly and get irritated.  She'd give me the evil eye, and ignore or give abrupt answers to my questions.

A few times it's even resulted in an open argument, between my sister and her girlfriend, and I can't help but feel I'm the cause.  Like I'd say something, and her girlfriend would either rudely shut me down or say something sorta rudeish or insulting towards me, and my sister would angrily reply ""don't talk to him like that"" and would start defending me over-aggressively, and then her girlfriend would back down.  It's really intense and it makes me feel worried that there might be something going on in their relationship that I don't know about.

Any idea what I can do?  I really want to get along with both of them, but I don't want to jeopardise the relationship between them.  I'd like to get along with my sister's girlfriend but I feel she just hates me and there's nothing I can do about it.  What should I do?

  **tl;dr**: My sister's girlfriend seemingly really doesn't like me and I get really uncomfortable around her because she's kinda mean to me.  What can I do to handle this situation without being rude and without jeopardising the relationship between her and my sister? Thanks."

"My (33M) brother (34M) has become distant over the last 2 years, my mom (62F) says I ""shoved my life in his face""


My brother and I are only 10 months apart and were inseparable growing up, we only started to drift apart when our lives took very different turns when I was 21. That's the year I moved across the country to go to grad school, while he knocked up and married his deadbeat ex. Despite the different directions of our lives, we remained in fairly regular contact and had a good (albeit less close) relationship for most of the next decade. Once a year I'd pay to fly him up individually to spend a weekend with me, and every alternating year his whole family would take a vacation here (I live in a very scenic part of the country). 

After I graduated I started working my way up in a large professional firm, and along the way met and married my wonderful wife (31F) who is in the same profession and also on the partner track. We each make &gt;6 figures per year and have been able to make a nice life for ourselves, aided by the fact that we have remained childfree thusfar (we may have one eventually, my wife would be making the bigger career sacrifice though so honestly that's up to her). He, on the other hand, married his ex, had another kid with her, and got stuck in the same small town we grew up in. She was always an issue (In 8 years never held a job for more than a couple months, and was always on/off the NA wagon) and he filed for divorce 3 years ago, shortly after which she got knocked up by her new boyfriend and ran off to god knows where, leaving him with their kids now ages (11F) (8M) and her daughter from a previous relationship (15F). He now lives with my mom (62F) in her house while she helps him raise the kids. 

The first summer after all of this happened I offered to fly him out to visit me for a weekend and my mom agreed to take care of his kids. I knew that year had been hard for him and I wanted to show him a good time. My wife and I don't live a very flashy lifestyle (I still drive the used Subaru I bought as an entry-level) but that year we both got promotions and decided to buy ourselves a cottage in the Rockies as our weekend getaway. It's a small and rustic place but it suits are purposes, perfect for hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter, and getting away from the city year round. It's also home to our marijuana garden (we live in a legal state) and reptile breeding operation, both of which are hobbies my brother and I were heavily into when we shared our first apartment a decade ago, but ones he had to give up on account of the kids and living with my mom. I thought he'd have a good time hiking, smoking, &amp;  interacting with the snakes, and while he was here he really seemed to! But ever since that trip when I've reached out to get him to come back he avoids the subject or comes up with lame and obviously false excuses. I've offered to fly not just him but he and all his family up to stay with us and he's declined. I've said we can stay in the cottage or the city and he's declined both. It's been bothering me that he seems to no longer want a relationship with me, he was the only family member left I felt close to since our dad has passed and my mom and I have a strained relationship on account of the moved across the country/haven't given her grandchildren thing. 

The other day I was talking on the phone to my mom and told her that it upset my he doesn't want to visit. She responded ""well maybe if you didn't go shoving your life in his face every time he visits he'd want to go more!"" I asked her what she meant by that and she said last time he came back he acted depressed for weeks and kept complaining about their town, his job, being a single parent, etc. She says being around me and spending time in my homes made him feel jealous, and subsequently guilty for feeling jealous, and that's why he doesn't visit anymore. 

I felt terrible when she told me that, I'd never meant to make him feel jealous I just wanted to show him a good time. He's never personally voiced these feelings to me and it's unlikely he ever will, so I don't know how to apologize or otherwise confront the problem directly. I do want to maintain a relationship with him though, he's a great person and brother and I admire him for putting his kids' needs above his own, which is more than I would have done in his shoes. I don't know how to talk to him about it though, because he hasn't voiced any problems to me personally. What should I do? 

Tl;Dr My mom told me my brother doesn't visit anymore because he's jealous of my lifestyle. How should I deal with this situation? "
