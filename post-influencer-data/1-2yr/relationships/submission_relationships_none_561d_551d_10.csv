"I [20/F] found out my boyfriend [23/M] has been poking holes in our condoms.. now I'm pregnant.


Hi Reddit.

I could desperately use advice.

I recently found out my boyfriend, of 1 year, has been poking holes in our condoms.

On Saturday I missed my period which is very uncommon for me. I assumed it was nothing but decided to take a test to reassure myself. When I took the test, two very clear pink lines appeared. I thought it was a mistake, so I took another. This led me to take one more test that also came out positive. In a panic, I ran to Target and purchased more tests, including digital ones. All of them were positive. Incredibly baffled and in disbelief I went to the doctor today and it was confirmed.

I honestly had no idea how it happened considering we always were using condoms. I told my boyfriend he needed to come home right away when he gets off of work . We he finally got home, I told him that I was pregnant. I was expecting a very confused and scared reaction, but I was embraced with a very happy and excited reaction. I was incredibly taken aback by his reaction and I asked him what was wrong with him? He proceeded to tell me that this is going to be a good thing and that we will be okay. I began explaining to him that I do not want kids right now. He tried to reassure me by saying ""things happen"" and sometimes they're not planned.

I honestly couldn't piece together how it happened. We always used condoms. I would not let him do anything otherwise. A little backstory: I was on birth control for 3 years and decided to get off because I was couldn't handle the side effects. I talked to him about this and he said it was fine and that we would only use condoms. He completely supported me.

I'm feeling incredibly guilty because I should have known better. I honestly do not want this child with him. I do not see a future with him and I do not want children with him. During our year, he was not a bad person. He did not treat me horribly or anything along the lines of that. I thought this was a very good relationship, but again I did not think anything long-term would come of it.

After questioning how this could happen, he finally admitted that he was poking holes in our condoms. In incredible disbelief and anger, I asked him why he would do such a stupid thing. (About a month ago we got into an argument and I told him that I did not honestly see a future with him or that I didn't feel like we would work out long-term.) He told me he did it because of our argument and he thought it would make everything better, and it would make me want to be with him. And that maybe I would also see a future with him.

I told him that I was going to get an abortion. A lot of me wants to have an abortion, however at the same time I feel guilty, because again I should have known better. I should have been on another method of birth control. He became a furious when I told him I wanted get an abortion. I also told him that he needed to pay for it because he did this to me. He told me he would not pay for it and he could take legal action against me if I decided to have an abortion without his consent.

I packed a bag of my things and left to go to my mom's house. While I was trying to leave our apartment, he kept blocking me and grabbing me so that I would not leave. He did become a little bit forceful when grabbing me. I told him to let me go or I would call the police. He let me go because he did not want the police to be called.

I do not know what to do. He keeps texting me apologizing, telling me to forgive him and begging me to not get an abortion. I do not want this child. I do not want this with him.

My mom suggested that I go to his command (he is military) to get him in trouble. However I do not feel comfortable doing that. I wouldn't want to ruin his career in the military.

Please help.

tl;dr: My boyfriend of one year got me pregnant on purpose by poking holes in our condoms. I told him I want an abortion. He does not want me to have one and told me he would take legal action if I did. He refuses to take any responsibility for what he has done.

EDIT: so I really like to thank everyone who has commented so far. I really appreciate all of your advice. Everyone's comments are coming in so fast I figured I would clarify a little bit here. Yes, I I'm going to get the abortion. I've contacted Planned Parenthood and I was able to immediately get an appointment. Unfortunately none of his texts actually say he poke holes in our condoms. All of them were apologies and how this could be a good thing. I'm struggling whether I should talk to him and try to get him to admit or just go to the police and my attorney with what I have. "

"UPDATE: My (36F) cheating boyfriend (M45) of two years is finally out of my life


Original post here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ystmz/just_found_out_my_36f_boyfriend_45m_has_been/

So after my post, several of you lovely people explained not to get back together with him.  I completely agree, however there was some unfinished business


Over the course of two weeks I’ve been talking to his ex who of course was in pieces.  I told her she needed closure so I suggested to my ex he meet up with her.  Even offered to watch his son so they could meet.  He said he would be an hour tops.  


It was two hours.  I found out after that they did met up and sat in her car and talked.  He claims nothing happened but I don’t care at this point.  I’ve spoken to her since and she’s thankful I set that up so she could say goodbye to him.  Unfinished business number one done.


I’ve talked to his son a fair bit over the last two weeks.  He understandably has a lot of trust issues.  Talking with my ex he has set up therapy to also include his son and I’ve encouraged his son at length to speak his mind during these sessions.  I’ve talked with him and with my ex’s mother present who also agreed to this so I feel comfortable now that he will somehow be able to advocate for himself going forward.  Unfinished business number two done.


But now I have unfinished business number three to deal with.  The ex texts me every day.  He’s shown up on my doorstep and we have talked at length about the betrayal and how inconsiderate he is to me.  Promises alllllll over the place about how he will NEVER cheat on me again and how he will put me first and will be considerate to my feelings blah blah blah


Flash forward to today.  His son asked me to go to his hockey practice.  I’m feeling good and think I can handle being around the ex (who is a coach so he will be on the ice so I don’t have to talk to him) so I agree.  I drove the twenty mins and sat there enjoying myself.  They get off the ice and go get changed.....


The ex and the son are together and we meet up in the atrium.  Son asks his dad for a hot chocolate.  Sure, why not.  The ex then proceeds to buy himself a coffee and his son a hot chocolate.


 I’m standing there like an idiot.  No offer for me.  No thought of if I want something from the canteen. 


And it hit me.  This is what my life would be like if I stay with him.  I’ll never be thought of; I would be an after-thought.  No I didn’t need anything from the canteen, that’s not the issue.  I stepped up to be there for his son and he can’t even think of me or my needs.


I hugged his son goodbye.  I told him if he needs anything to send me a text.  I said goodbye to the ex and walked away.  For all I know he’s still standing there wondering what just happened.


I’ve deleted him from my phone.  I can’t have contact with him.  I don’t have the heart for it yet but I’ll cut ties with his family on social media as I don’t want the reminders of the life I could have had but was in fact all a lie.


This is all just to say THANK YOU for the advice on here.  I’ve never been in this situation and I hope I never am again.

TL;DR I finally was able to let go of my cheating boyfriend- thank you for all your help Reddit!"

We have 2 young children and we are in the classic ""room mate"" phase. 

We seem to have the same discussion every 2 months or so about not being in love any more and we always come up with new things we wanna do to try and fix it... (date nights, call and talk more etc etc) but we always fall back into our rut. 

We are both very motivated to try and get this thing back on track and we both desperately want to re-ignite our love for one and other but its just so hard at the moment to think of a way to turn this around and stick to a plan of sorts. 

I feel like a lot of people will say: ship has run its course, let it go. But we really have something special, but its just that the fire is gone... 

TL;DR: lost the fire in our relationship but both willing to try. How do we make more than empty plans / promises?

Edit: You guys are really awesome. I know this is a throwaway but i have been on this sub for a while. Im getting a lot of feedback to start doing instead of just talking -- I will do this right now. I am going to get flowers and I also really want to make sure we continue to talk about our issues.

*edit.* this is way longed than I intended to write, thanks in aadvance to everyone who reads it


I moved to a new city two years ago. About a month into my move I met Ann. Ann and I got along and have been friends ever since. tge problem I am having is in no way her fault. She has done  nothing wrong and I have no right to be upset with her. I am actually not even upset with her, it's more that I am upset by the situation.

 Basically, Ann is very pretty. She is blonde,blue eyes, and has features/body that is considered conventionally attractive. Since we met, whenever we go out togethere on the weekends Ann always gets a lot of attention from men. She is constantly getting complimented and having drinks sent to her etc. I on the other hand, have the opposite experience. I am not incredible ugly or anything, but I'm black. I live in a mostly white area and men simply do not speak to me at all here. 

Usually when we are out together, groups of guys will come up to us to speak to Ann, and completely ignore me. It happens every single time I go to a bar, club, comedy show, any type of event with her. Two or three friends  will come up to us and ask her her name, start to make conversation with her, and completely ignore me to the point that it seems like I do not exist.  While I don't love being ignored, I am used to not getting any male interest here so usually I just try to not let it bother me. In these situations Ann usually tries to pull me into the convo or include me. For example after the first time it happened she then started to make sure to introduce me as well when someone asks her name. She makes a point to say 'hey I'm Ann and this is my friend Uglutuv'. She will also try to loop me into the convo while they are speaking. This doesn't really work though and what usually happens is that they acknowledge me for that second then go straight back to ignoring me. Again... I know that none of this is her fault and that she is doing everything right. 

Anyways, at this point, since it happens so often and I know what to expect, I usually excuse myself as soon as guys come up to speak to her if I'm around. I'll go to the bathroom or go get a drink or something until she is done speaking to them. If she meets someone she likes I usually leave after she lets me know they will be sticking around.  This strategy has been working fine and I've been doing it for about 6 months or so now. 

Yesterday though, something changed. We were out together at a bar. I left our booth to go to the bar to get more drinks. When I was at the bar, a guy came up to me to speak. This threw me off because it has litterily never happened even once since I moved here. He was cute and funny and seemed interested in me. we spoke for about 15 min while waiting for our drinks to come and he told me he was there with a friend and invited me to come sit with them so we could speak more. I told him I was with my friend but that we would both come over to sit wth them. He said 'more the merrier' and that it was cool. I went back to the booth and told Ann what happened. She agreed that he was cute and agreed to wing woman me and we both went to his table. We met his friend who seemed nice, and his friend spoke to Ann while he spoke to me. 

We hung out with them for about 5 hrs until the bar closed and we had to leave. Most of this time, I spent one on one with him while An remained with his friend. We played pool, and just spoke about life. He seemed like he liked me. 

When the bar was closing and they started kicking people out, we went back to the table with ann and his friend. He then told me  that it sucked that the bar was closing because he wanted to spend more time with me. It turned out that Ann also hit it off with his friend, and his friend shared the sentiment about her. He (my guy) then said that if we wanted, we were welcome to go to their place to continue hanging out. He said they had a game room and we could continue our little pool tournament there if I wanted. 

Honestly, I was really happy. We agreed and went to their place. We stayed there for about 2 hrs and I had a really good time. When it was time for is to go home, I exchanged numbers with my guy and Ann with his friend. They both told us that they wanted to see us again. Between last night and right now, I was so happy. I had honestly let go of any hope that I would be able to date while I live here. I was ok with that. I accepted it. But this completely changed that. I actually felt hopeful that maybe I actually met someone who was interested in me. 

Ann and his friend kept texting and she let me know that they are going on a date today. I realized that he did not text me since yesterday even though he seemed like he REALLY wanted to see me again soon. So I messaged him just saying what's up. He has red reciepts on so I saw that he read it, but didn't reply. After a few hours of no reply, I decided to try to call him. He sent it straight to voicemail. Then he replied with this 'hey, you seem very nice but I'm not interested. I was my buddy's  wing man yesterday and he wanted to speak to your friend so I was just helping him out. You were a lot of fun to speak to, and I'm sure you will find someone. Have a good night'


I feel like shit. I have never felt so bad about myself until that moment. Ann just texted me raving about how her date with his friend is going and saying we should try to set up a double date. I don't want to reply. Honestly, I really don't want to go out with ann anymore. I don't want to be around her in a bar or a club or bowling or anything public. Because of our work schedules, most of our together time is spent out doing something 'fun' in public. I know that if I decide to stop being around her in these situations, it will eventually lead to the friendship growing strained since that would mean that we barely see each other. But I just can't do this anymore. Ann is a pretty great person and I love having her in my life, but I just can't. I feel like my self esteem has been cut in half since I met her. I know that it is in no way her fault, but I don't want to keep experiencing this. Am I overreacting by even considering limiting our time together because of this?  

Whatever I decide I will tell her tomorrow since we have brunch plans. I will show her the message so she can get where I'm coming from.

"My [25f] mentally unstable sister [26f] is ""pregnant"" with twins and is probably about to destroy my life. I don't know what to do.


I don't even know where to start with this. I'm sick to my stomach and spent the majority of last night crying/laughing at how absurd this all is. Definitely not the response you'd expect when you find out your sister is pregnant. Sorry if it's long, there's just a lot to it.


Backstory: I am the youngest of 3 sisters, ""M"" [26F] and ""C"" [32F]. My fiance [26M] and I are renting  the attached apartment in my mom's [53F] house until I finish school next year. We pay her to live here so it's not like we are free loading, we both work and it helps her out financially. 

""M"" is just straight up mentally unstable (Narcissist/Sociopath). She is a pathological liar, manipulative, violent, aggressive, and just a terrible person. She has attacked me and other members of my family physically. She has now been to jail for domestic violence (twice) as well as credit card fraud.

Just one example of her past relationships: ""M"" was dating a guy a few years ago who was close with my family. He was a EMT and in order to manipulate him into wanting to ""rescue"" her she told him her ex had beat her so badly he blinded her in one of her eyes (wtf?) and broke her arm. She also told him (and his whole family) that she was undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer, faked having seizures, and pretended to be addicted to drugs over the course of their relationship. All of this is obviously some crazy bullshit. So the truth(s) come out, he leaves her, and she's forced to move across the country with my grandma because my mom can't deal with her anymore. My mom did not cut contact and still bails her out of jail/helps her with money semi-frequently.

It was absolute hell growing up with her and I got it worse than the rest of my family. She manipulated my parents constantly but they never believed me. She turned friends or boyfriends against me, spread rumors about me regularly. She **constantly** terrorized me, most of it being emotional but also sometimes she would get angry and kick/hit me. I still attribute a lot of my anxiety/low self esteem/depression to how she treated me. The worst thing for her was for me to be happy, she always tried to ruin it to make herself feel better. When she moved away I felt like I could breathe for the first time in my life and things were so calm.

Present day, she is still across the country but has been desperately trying to find a means to come home. I haven't spoken to her in years because I just cannot handle her. I have cut her out completely, no contact, no apologies (my mom and ""C"" still speak to her daily). I am getting married in about 6 months...obviously didn't invite her and it really, really pissed her off. I repeatedly told my mom and fiance that I was terrified she was going to pull some extra crazy shit around the time of the wedding because how dare I A)Be happy B) Not invite her C) Do anything that would take attention from her. 

Surprise! I was right! I (secretly) overheard her telling my mom last night over the phone that she is pregnant....with fucking **TWINS**. First of all, *she absolutely hates kids* and has never wanted them. She does not possess empathy, patience, our any sort of selflessness. She also has no money, a place of her own, and makes just above minimum wage. She just met this guy like two months ago, too. Obviously I want to just push it away and say this is all a complete and total fucking lie but my gut is telling me it isn't. And either way everyone else believes her. To be honest, her being pregnant is the perfect plan for my mom to let her move back. Maybe she'll ""miscarry""once she moves in, and then what? My mom is delusional and will do anything if ""M"" manipulates her enough so it wouldn't surprise me. Also she could never turn away her pregnant daughter. At the very least she is moving back within a few miles. 

Sorry this got way longer than I intended. I genuinely fear for my own safety, the safety of my dog, and my things when she is around. My mental health will also suffer as she is like a soul-sucking demon. My comfortable, calm, happy, drama free life with my family is going to end and I am so angry and sad. 
  

How do I deal with this and reason my mom and ""C"" before it's too late? I don't think my relationship with my mom (which is often strained because of ""M"" already) will ever recover and I can't stand seeing my family be manipulated like this. *What if this is  seriously all some ploy to ruin my wedding?* (I know this sounds so paranoid but it is actually totally reasonable to assume). How do I talk to my family now before this gets worse...? My mom and I haven't spoken about it yet and she doesn't know I know. My fiance and I have discussed extensively that we will move out as soon as shit hits the fan. I just guess i'm in shock with all of this. Moving, wedding, crazy sister getting pregnant by a guy she just met, trying not to let it  make me angry and depressed. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My mentally unstable sister is possibly pregnant with twins, or pretending to be, and I don't know how to talk to my family before this turns emotional and chaotic as they are easily manipulated by her. My wedding is also in 6 months and i'm a mess. Help.

Edit for clarity: Moving out isn't really the issue here, it's repeatedly having my sister manipulate my family into ""saving her"" from herself. My fiance and I are capable adults who can find a place to live and have enough money saved to do so. I'm more concerned about my family, how this is going to impact my relationship with them moving forward, and how can I do more than watch it burn. Also, having those relationships still standing on solid ground for a really important day for me and not having my sister ruin that too from the sidelines. "

One of her friends said my letter was beautiful, and my girlfriend would love it, but I'm still having doubts about it. I'm not sure if I should still give it to her. 

My girlfriend and I set expectations that we'd be giving each other gifts for our anniversary, and that letter was supposed to be my gift for her. I spent hours working on it, trying to handwrite it neatly, making the letter itself look nice, etc. 

Should I still give her my letter, and is it even good enough for a one year anniversary gift? How would you guys feel if someone gave you a love letter as a gift?

"UPDATE: Me [16F] I am trying to transition from giving away my knitting for free to selling it, people are not getting the memo and I’m slowly losing it.


OP: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/809szo/me_16f_i_am_trying_to_transition_from_giving_away/

OTLDR:

no longer able or willing to give away knit hats I️ make for free due to now using pricier nicer yarn. Now charging $30-$35 for $20-$25 of yarn and about 8 hours of work. I’m sick of people disvaluing my work and insisting they shouldn’t have to pay. I’m not handling it very positively at the moment as I tell them to leave me alone, which won’t make people like me over time. How can I politely handle these situations but be firm in my stance? Side note- is that price really ridiculous? People have told me it is multiple times even when I break it down for them :/

**************************************************
Not really a happy update, more like a neutral one. I decided to really take a good hard look at my business model. I realized there's just no way I can sustain it. 

Several factors went into my decision:

* There are costs other than just yarn. My interchangeable needles were $120 and I would need to sell 12 hats to make that back (not paying myself for labor)

* Mass produced knit products have driven down the price to something I can't compete with

* I don't have the money to buy enough yarn to build up my inventory upfront.

* One hat takes me a week. Custom orders so that I don't need to front the money would be difficult due to my anxiety relating to deadlines and the fact that a backlog of orders could cause a ludicrous turnaround time. 

I simply can't afford to continue knitting with nice yarn without somehow making that money back.

So, I've decided to stop knitting for a bit until I can find another job. I'm broke currently. I have the yarn for the hat I'm currently working on and then I, unfortunately, have to take a break.

My knitting used to be funded by a job dog walking, but a chronic injury made me unable to continue that job. I've been looking for a neighborhood or retail jobs for awhile but haven't found anything. The market for employees is really saturated around here.

I'm sad as this was a very anxiety reducing thing for me but such is life :) As soon as I can find a job the knitting will restart!

Sidenote: I got an order through my first post for a hat! So actually I have two projects. Thanks, Reddit, you're pretty cool! My business made one sale before I figured out it wasn't gonna work!

Oh and on the classmate aspect: I told everyone I was closing shop today. People were bummed but didn't bug me. That's done. Will use your advice when I restart.
  
  ---   
  **TL;dr**: Took a hard look at my business model and realized I simply can't do this financially. Taking a break from knitting once next 2 projects are done due to being broke and needing to find a job. Sad because it helped with my anxiety and depression, but such is life and I have decided to focus on what I can be grateful for. No longer have a problem with classmates b/c no more knitting."

"Me [37F] with my bullies [8-10M/F]. They are still here three decades later.


I was bullied badly as a child. So badly that I was afraid to go to school and often faked sick. When I couldn't fake sick, I would just sit in a bathroom stall at lunchtimes to avoid them. I did my best to disappear and became very skilled at it.


This bullying has given me a lifelong fear of people and socializing that has never quite gone away. These bullies would manipulate me and pretend to be my friend for weeks in an effort to 'set me up' for future take-downs. I never really understood why they hated me so much.


So I lost my ability to trust people. With effort, I can be sociable for short periods, but I prefer either being alone or talking with people one-on-one. Being with groups of people makes me anxious and afraid. I also find that many people are often not at ease with me, and I can't seem to change that.


I have dealt with this by finding work I can do alone. I don't socialize, but I talk with my family and a few friends online. My hobbies are solitary. I am married and love spending time with my husband. He makes me feel safe. I have a good life.


However, these incidents also cultivated extreme self-hatred. For a long time, I blamed myself for what happened. I was a weird kid etc., all kids get bullied yada yada yada. This self-hatred exacerbated an eating disorder (which is thankfully under control after two years of therapy and work).


I feel like these early experiences truly crippled me, and it makes me a little bit sad to think that way. I don't want to change, and I am not lonely, but I still think a lot about those experiences, and I guess I wish I could let it go.


But it was so formative, it truly changed the course of my life and who I am as a person.


How do I let go? I've worked with several therapists but I still can't seem to get over these experiences. In some ways, they are the core of my life, and that just feels really sad. This happened so long ago, why is it still here? Why does it bother me so much?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses, advice and compassion. It means a lot. I can't respond to everyone but I am reading everything.

EDIT2: This got ... a little more traction than I anticipated. Thanks to all for freely giving me your advice and support - it is very much appreciated. I'm also sorry to read all the tales of bullying you experienced. I wish you all peace, love and happiness in your lives.

"My (29f) brother (18m) is changing is name to ""Typhoon"" with an equally unique last name. My parents are apoplectic. Do I stay out of it or should I try to convey that these are different times and adults have an expectation of autonomy?


Going to try to keep this short as possible. As it is, my parents had 4 girls and when my brother was born he was almost seen as a god delivered from heaven to my dad. My dad is ""John Smith V"" and I think it actually ate at him that he wouldn't be able to give the world a ""John Smith VI."" 

Well my dad and brother never really got along because my brother never wanted to play football, baseball or any of the other things that my dad thought ""men"" should do. My brother from the time he could turn on TV was fascinated with professional wrestling and it's been his passion ever since. Though he's not big enough to be in the ring, he works for a local wrestling promotion, does wrestling podcast, and even did an internship for a small WWE connected promotion and even met most members of the McMahon family encouraged him to go to school keep with the internships in order to work for them someday. My brother is a living example of someone recognizing their passions and making them happen. 

My brother just turned 18 and decided that he's no longer going to be ""John Smith VI"" he's legally changing his name to ""Typhoon Torturer"" (it's not exactly that, but you get the idea). My parents are beside themselves, my dad especially. My younger sister got pregnant when she was 14 and I don't think they took that as hard as they are taking this name change. 

Why I'm asking the question, I am the oldest sibling and it's always fallen on me to be the ""peacekeeper"" between my parents, siblings, dogs, cats, you name it. I can see both sides of this argument but what it comes down to is that I think my brother should be able to change his name and I don't think I'm actually neutral in this. 

Should I try to talk to my parents (as I usually would) or should I finally just stay out of it and let them figure this out?

This is my first relationship. She lives kinda far away and I don't have a vehicle due to an accident I had a little while ago. Not only is it difficult to spend time with her, but she has a kid and has hinted at getting married. 

Now, it's not just her. I was terrified of pissing her off and making her leave me so when she started saying I love you a week into being together, I said it back. I may have not shot down the idea of getting married either.

I'm in the military so I feel like she's trying to move so fast simply because of the benefits I can give her kid. I hate to think like that but it's been a constant thought in my head.

I know I screwed the pooch by returning the ""I love you's"" but how do I back out of this with some tact? I don't want to seem like a dickhead but I need to look out for number one here.

"Feels like husband (45M) and I (35F) are living in different realities


My husband and I have been together for nearly 12 years (married for 8). Our relationship hasn't always been perfect, but we've both worked hard on it over the years, and the last few years have been some of the happiest, until a couple months ago.  

We had a daughter last year after many years of infertility, and while we faced the usual new parent challenges I thought we were coping pretty well. But all of a sudden it seems like he is, honestly, experiencing a completely different version of reality than I am. He accuses me of all sorts of behaviours that I do not believe I am engaging in and it is really starting to mess with my head.  

For example, he has the tendency to be quite negative - this person's an idiot, this thing is pointless, the weather is terrible, etc. A few years ago I really started to focus on eliminating negativity from my life and consciously embracing the positive. So, when he does this I either try to reframe it as something positive, or, because I know that can be annoying, just let him vent without adding to it. Then, finally I will make the smallest gripe about something and he jumps down my throat and accuses me of 'always complaining.' For instance, last night I pulled a pair of pajamas out of my daughter's drawer, discovered they were too small and said, casually, 'Oh crap, guess I'll have to go buy a couple more pairs.' To which he responded, fairly vehemently, 'Oh my god, do you *ever* stop complaining?'   

For a more major example, he just got home from a 4 day golf trip he goes on with friends every year. During the time he was away, I didn't call him once, and I only messaged him to respond to messages he sent me, other than to ask what time his flight was due back. Then the first night he gets home, out of the blue he starts going on about how controlling I am and that I never let him do anything. WTF? I honestly don't know how much more relaxed and *less* controlling I could have been about the trip. 

I've asked him a number of times if he is happy in the relationship and he assures me he is, but if that is true I cannot comprehend why he keeps telling me I am acting in ways I am not. I am a fairly reflective person and willing to admit when I am wrong, and I know I am not the ogre he is making me out to be. It feels really destabilising to be around someone who sees the world so differently to you. I am starting to wonder if he is experiencing mental health issues - could depression explain this? I'm getting sick of trying to stick up for myself because it never gets anywhere and when we argue it feels like we're speaking different languages. 

TL:DR Husband thinks I am negative and controlling. I don't.

"My [39F] Husband [42M] of 3+ years has admitted to two affairs. We decided to pursue legal separation last night, but I'm devastated and unsure how to function moving forward.


Hi everyone.  I married my husband ""Mike"" over 3 years ago.  We met and became a couple under very unusual and tragic circumstances.  I met Mike around 2008 when he began dating ""Joy"", a good friend of mine.  Unfortunately, Joy succumbed to cancer in 2011 while they were together.  Joy's cancer battle and eventual death left those of us who knew her devastated, and I'm getting pretty emotional after typing that sentence given everything that has happened to my marriage to Mike over the last couple of months.

For 2 years after Joy's death, Mike and I didn't interact very much; we exchanged texts a couple times, but otherwise I never saw him.  I just happened to bump into him at a shopping mall during the 2013 holidays and chatted for a bit.  I invited him to my holiday/new housewarming party, and began sort of hitting it off.  I had casually mentioned that I was having maintenance issues with my new house, and Mike offered to fix them, and he did!  We didn't really go on traditional ""dates"", but after the party, we starting hanging out as friends (going to the movies, basketball games) and our friendship grew into what was eventually a relationship.  I think we were both lonely--I have a terrible dating history with only one serious boyfriend (in college), and Mike admitted he'd only had one date since Joy died.  

Less than a year later, we married in a quick ceremony at City Hall.  I really liked Mike; I remember how compassionate and helpful he was with Joy during her cancer battle, and he was always a genuinely likable and nice guy, and I can't still help but somewhat feel this way even after he cheated on me.  Everyone who knows him likes him.  The truth is though, I had settled.  Mike is a good-looking guy, but not at all my type.  Our interests don't overlap very often.  I was 36 and wanted children and felt time was running out.  Dating was becoming so futile.  Mike has a great job and is very ambitious.  He has a good family.  He wasn't a jerk, the opposite of most of the guys I dated.  So I married him.

We had a son one year after we married.  To keep it short, Mike has been nothing but a great father.  He's probably changed more diapers late at night than I have.  But as far as our marriage goes, after our son was born, we were going through the motions.  In our 4 years of together, we've probably had sex at a rate less than once per month, and that's including several tries getting pregnant.  We have busy work lives.  We have rarely had nights for just the two of us; often at home we're in separate rooms doing our own thing.  I also can't help but compare myself to Joy.  I remember Joy and Mike always being happy (until the cancer diagnosis obviously), and they were truly more of a couple with many compatible interests.

Fast forward to mid-January this year.  Mike is ""working late"" a lot, and he's suddenly very protective of his phone, never leaving it out of his sight.  At home, he's making sudden trips to the grocery store that end up being lengthy for someone who wanted just Ice Cream and a handful of other things.  Finally, after two months of this odd behavior, I got a hold of his phone last week saw the incriminating emails of them planning to meet at her apartment, erotic text messages, and nude photos from a former co-worker ""Lauren"" [28ishF].   I remember meeting her at a work function of Mike's and not liking her at all for being very flirtatious with him and playfully touching him (I do have one piece of advice in all this: Trust your gut.  This co-worker never sat right with me and I knew something was off with her behavior.  Your intuition is almost never wrong).  As much as didn't like it, I ultimately brushed it off since Lauren had a boyfriend; they had apparently broken it off though sometime last year.

I confronted Mike last week, and he admitted to an ongoing 3-month affair with Lauren.  He's currently staying at a friend's after I demanded he leave the house.  Other than having him visit our son for about 30 minutes each night since he left, I haven't talked to him at all.  After last night's visit though, he asked if we could talk.  I agreed.  In my mind, despite how angry I was, I was still stupidly considering the possibility of taking him back down the road if he was sincere and contrite, because other than his cheating, he's been a pretty good guy for the 10 years I've known him. 

First, he admitted to me that he was in love with Lauren and wanted to pursue something with her, and that he didn't see a future with me, and that ""if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you're not in love with me either, if you ever were."" This turned into a hour-long argument in which I was adamant that I loved him and went over all the reasons why, but also mentioning that we're busy people with a 2-year old son to take care of and it's not always going to be a utopia like it is with Lauren right now!  And besides, I would want out of the marriage instead of carrying on an affair if I was truly that unhappy!

Arguably worse than this whole ordeal though ... He then confessed to a 2nd affair.  He fucked Joy's married former best friend ""Cara"" [40ishF] about a year ago, while I was in Europe for a work trip.  Cara, who I only met once at Joy's funeral, was in our city for a work trip in a crazy coincidence.  This has me so upset that I just threw up writing that last paragraph.  After he revealed the 2nd affair, I simply said ""it's over"" and ""I want a divorce"" and ""get out"".  

It has been the worst week of my life.  I haven't stopped crying for the last 7 days and I can barely concentrate at work.  I feel like such a fool.  Thankfully, there's a snowstorm in the Northeast US today which closed our office, because there's no way I could've functioned today.  I'm a wreck and can literally not process any information right now.  I have contacted a lawyer, and my doctor's office called this morning with the news of no STDs.  I'm trying to be a mother to my son (my own mother is flying in tomorrow to help out a bit).  The idea of legal proceedings and custody battles is just overwhelming me right now.  I just can't stop crying.

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [28M] of three years. Can't bring myself to show him my body after a major accident a few months ago.


A few months ago, I was involved in a hit-and-run, which left me in a three day coma and hospitalised for about two weeks. There were several surgeries involved and left me quite scarred. 

My BF was a huge support through it all and I'm so fortunate to have him in my life. BUT. I feel like I can't show him my body with all the scars I've gotten. It's not sexy at all. I've also lost quite a bit of muscle mass since I've been pretty much stationary for a few months, and I used to be pretty fit. A lot of my tattoos have also been ruined by the accident, so I just looks so... Ugly, for lack of a better word. 

I'm worried he'll look at me and be repulsed by how I look now. He was already way out of my league before all of this started and I'm scared he'll realise he can have pretty much whoever he wants and don't have to stick around with the mess I am now. 

He's tried to initiate some intimate acts and I've turned him down every time. I know that sex life is important in a relationship and I realise that this is probably going to ruin our relationship.

I don't know how to handle this. I feel ugly and guilty that I can't give him what he wants. Perhaps it's better to break off the relationship?

"My [16F] mother [40sF] is strictly against me taking birth control for medical reasons.


Hello Reddit! I have had my period since I was 9 or 10 and recently (as of around three years ago) my symptoms have become absolutely unbearable. I have hot flashes, I can't sleep, I have failure concentrating, and my cramps are worse than ever. They happen in between my periods (I think that's when ovulation is?) And from a week before my period starts to a couple days in. Once these cramps start, I physically can't do anything but sob in pain. And I feel like every month it gets worse.
Edit: I forgot another important symptom; I also have really heavy bleeding during my period that usually lasts a day, and its so bad that I go through a super size tampon every hour. 

Yesterday I decided I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my mom to schedule an appointment with my doctor which she was fine with, until I mentioned that I'll probably be prescribed birth control. 

Now I have probably tried every other possible method of lessoning my symptoms possible: I exercise regularly, I eat healthily, I cut out dairy during my period, I have been taking valerian, vervain, lemonbalm, and raspberry leaf capsules twice a day for over a year, plus drinking these herbs as teas during my period, but my symptoms are still unbearable. I have been sexually active in the past but my current boyfriend and I (of two years) have decided to take a long break from that, so my birth control is strictly to control my hormones. 

Once I started telling my mom my research on how birth control can help, she started to hardcore research on any possible herbs I can use instead, even though that is all I have been trying to do. My mom and I are all about using herbal remedies, but I am sick and tired of guessing and taking herbs in place of something I know has over a 90% chance of fixing all of my symptoms. 

My appointment is today and my mom keeps repeatedly suggesting to cancel my appointment and try buying me cramp bark and horse medication instead and I dont know what to do. I want to ask for my doctor's and I's appointment to be private but I know that'll only make her more paranoid about starting birth control (she thinks holding hands at my age is too inappropriate) 
If you have gotten this far, thank you so much for reading this. I don't know what is going to happen today but I really hope I can get help for this. 

**TL;DR** My mom is strictly against getting me birth control for my out of control symptoms even after trying almost every other possible way of fixing my problems (exercising, good diet, herbal capsules) 

**Edit:** Wow this blew up and I can't reply to everyone so its going here. A big thing I have noticed is a lot of you guys are mentioning that my insurance can hide if I'm taking BC but one problem is that we don't have insurance so the money does have to come from our pocket and I'm really concerned about that. Another is that I just contacted the clinic and the nurse told me that I might be too young to be able to have confidentiality between my doctor and I (I live in Texas, US and I'm not so sure about the laws here so if someone could give me a heads up on that it would be nice). My appointment is in an hour and I'm so nervous that my mom is going to cancel last minute because I am really worried that this could be worse than I think because I have the tendency to brush off things that are wrong a lot.

"Five years after my[29F] parents’ divorce, my dad[62M] finally showed me his apartment. It’s triggered a ton of emotions that I don’t know how to cope with.


 My younger brother and I are adult children of divorce. Our parents separated for a couple years when I was a teenager but got back together when I was in HS. Once my brother turned 18 and started college, they announced that they were divorcing, which completely blindsided me because I had assumed they had made amends after my father moved back in. So they basically stayed together for the kids. I was devastated, but my brother had seen this coming and wasn’t surprised. I knew it was the right decision for them to make.

It was an amicable split, and my mom helped my dad find a new place nearby. After he moved out, he became distant from us. He didn’t invite us over to his new place and hardly replied to texts or calls. For the first couple of years, the only times my bro and I ever saw my dad was always on Father’s Day. So once a year. I worried about him because I thought he was pulling away due to depression and the shame of being divorced. In our culture there’s still a stigma and he’s rather old-fashioned. I respected his need for space and texted him from time to time to show I was thinking about him, and I figured he needed some time to sort himself out.

I was pleased to see that my dad was reaching out to us more and more in the past year. We’ve been seeing him more often, usually for meals out, and he seemed happy. I assumed he was finally getting over the pain of the divorce. He eagerly tells us all the time about how involved he is with his local church (quite the change from when he resented being dragged to church when he was with my mom) and his camping/hiking adventures (he’s an avid outdoorsman).

Some background on my parents: They are Asian immigrants who went from dirt poor to comfortably middle class. Despite very limited English, my mom lucked out with a great job after working minimum wage for years, and was the main breadwinner in my family. My dad has always worked manual labor, and is self-employed doing pool maintenance. He’s highly educated but his degrees mean shit here. After living in apartments in the first decade of my life, they finally saved enough money to buy a house in their dream neighborhood in suburbia. My mom is still living in our family home.

This past Sunday was my dad’s 62nd birthday, and my brother and I hung out with him at the spa. After the spa day, he invited us over to see his apartment. I interpreted this as huge progress on his part. My mom had reassured me after the divorce that his new place is nice and to not worry about it. She told me he had a nice, new condo.

In reality, it’s a tiny studio apartment in an old building. Seeing his place set off a range of emotions that I don’t know how to deal with. It’s not like he’s a hoarder or anything, he’s quite neat and clean. What triggered my sadness was seeing my old, dinky, irregular twin sized bed in the corner of the apartment. He’s sleeping in the bed that I grew up sleeping in as a teen. It’s a bed that I hated, the frame ugly and plain, that my dad had procured secondhand at the time without any input from me. He’s even using my old sheets. The apartment was full of other pieces of furniture that my parents had split up between themselves and this brought back a torrential flood of memories. It took everything in me to not cry when I realized this.

My dad is a practical, un-sentimental, and frugal man. In his mind, he probably doesn’t give a shit about using my old bed and the family’s old furniture. We also live in a high COL area, and this apartment is what he can afford. I now realize how unrealistic I was, taking my mom’s reassurances about his living situation to heart, for thinking he had nice little condo with new furniture to start his new life as a single man. To me, he is living in the dregs of his married life despite mentally moving on from the divorce and seemingly enjoying his life.

I’m trying to rid myself of my preconceived ideas of how a 62 year old man should live. But I can’t help the feeling that my father--who had worked so incredibly hard working manual labor to support us through school, who was the main parent at home while my mom worked long hours—that after everything he and my mom worked for to finally buy a home and stop renting shitty apartments… he’s back at square one, living in a small apartment. It’s like everything he worked for is gone and he’s starting over with about as many assets as I have (which is very little). This thought is killing me inside.

It also doesn’t help that I know nothing about his finances or retirement plans. I do know he’s good at managing money and budgets, and never misses a bill. But being self-employed for decades, I have no idea if he has retirement accounts like my mom does. I asked him when he’s planning on retiring, and he said it looks like he’ll be working into his old age. The thought of my elderly father, hobbling around and cleaning pools has haunted me since and messes with my sleep. I feel like my brother and I need to start planning out our finances so that we can support him in a couple years.

He also doesn’t have a familial safety net (except my brother and me) like my mom does. My mom’s family lives within half an hour from where she lives. My dad has a sister who lives in Canada, and my grandma lives in his home country. My brother and I generally spend holidays and such with my mother’s side since she has a bigger family that all lives close by.

I honestly am at a loss to how to cope with these new feelings. I feel like the wound of my parents’ divorce has been opened again but I’m not sure if it can heal this time. I would love for either of my parents to start dating other people, but neither are interested. When I was a kid, my dad would often fantasize about living alone without family, but now that it’s reality, I’m not sure if that’s truly what he wanted. There is no evidence that he’s unhappy—he indulges in his hobbies, has friends within his church community, and has an even healthier lifestyle than I do. But I also know he’s not one to share his emotions with me and he has a history of putting on a happy front to appease my worries. I’m resentful that my parents didn’t divorce after their first separation; they would have both been younger and have more energy to meet new people, and maybe my dad would have been able to save for a down payment. I feel so much guilt that they suffered through their marriage for years in order to wait for us to become adults before finally divorcing.

It’s depressing enough to see sad, lonely elderly people, or elderly people who are working far longer than they should be. I’m terrified that this is my father’s future. I have plans of my own to move out of the area, maybe out of the state in the next couple of years, but now I feel I cannot leave my parents behind. I’ve been dwelling on the thought of taking care of my parents in their old age and it sinks me into depression and fretful, disturbed sleep. My brother has also been dejected since the visit. I'm sure my dad would be extremely upset if we knew how sad we are. He certainly wants no pity.

TLDR; my reclusive father finally showed me his apartment five years after the divorce and it depresses the fuck out of me. It reopened the pain of my parents’ divorce and made me realize that I will likely have to take care of him financially into his old age."
"My (26/F) boyfriend (28/M) of three years kicked me out of his car in the middle of an argument last night, and is now angry with me for taking a ride home from his younger brother (25/M) who had offered on his own.

"GF [27/f] of 3 years just told me [32/m] she wants to take a break via text about 30 minutes ago. Recently made some major life changes (like taking an new job and selling my house) at her request. I'm frozen at work right now, very much emotionally compromised. What do I do?


So on the 25th we will hit our 3 year mark. It's something of a milestone with me, and I don't know where to start with the post, there's so much history between us and every little thing seems relevant to me.

For starters, I took a job across the state because she wants to relocate to this specific area. I've sold my house, and have been crashing with friends and commuting during the work week while we look for a house. I also have been sitting on an expensive engagement ring that she designed, saving it for when we close on a house.

I've had some reservations, but I think it's perfectly normal. We're different people and sometimes it shows, especially with the house hunt.

There's a couple things I'm looking for that she doesn't really care about (more than a single car driveway for parking, storage, good wiring, a back door to let the dog out instead of having to walk around the house, and whatnot). On that note she has a good number of deal breakers that aren't really issues for me. To add to that,what she wants has been subject to random change; it seems somewhat impulsive to me. Ultimately no matter what we look at, finding a house with what we want in the area she desires is well out of my price range.

She very much has a penchant for immediate gratification. Things that are important to her are a ""comfortable"" house in a ""hip"" area (with culture with in walking distance), and in her mind draining our little savings and managing a monster mortgage payment is worth not having to wait a year or two.  I'd be more comfortable with a nest egg for emergencies and more expendable income; delayed gratification is a long-term game and I expect a significantly larger gallery as soon as I am able to move on from my current job.  I should also probably mention that her parents are more than financially stable and have given a feeling of financial security I've never had. She's told me that her family is close, and I need to accept the idea of them bailing us out if we ever need it. I get that, but I'm just more risk averse than she is, it shouldn't be our plan B, maybe C or D in my opinion.

Lately she either is super excited for a house I don't like or can't afford (and she CRASHES when I say no), or she gets melancholy and says stuff like ""whatever. It doesn't matter. Get what you want. I'll just have to get used to not being happy."" It seems melodramatic to me, and there's not much I can fucking do with it, but I do want her to be happy, and I've been trying. It's been 4.5 months of looking while I couch surf or spend 4.5 hours a day in a car, she puts in a 7 hour day and lounges around her house, yet she seems more stressed than me.

Another point is she has some emotional baggage, and with good reason, that I won't get into. Part of that is she often has trouble receiving criticism. Even a playful teasing by a close friend registers as a severe insult and she reacts. Typically I'm good about avoiding that nerve, and I've been trying to work with her to not be so sensitive.

Only last night we started to argue about another house. It lacked some things I'd really like, but I tried to entertain the thought of making an offer. I honestly just wanted to vent about dislikes and talk about concerns. I was told every time I tried to bring up an issue that I have ""a bad attitude"" and hate everything. I tried to expand and explain my view... and ended up doing most of the talking. I've been very stressed recently and talking just felt good, and I thought I could do it and offer incite in why I had these thoughts. She was unusually quiet, and went from ""perfect house"" to ""whatever, don't get the house"" if I said anything that wasn't 100 positive, and in favor of purchase. We ended on a quiet note and I crashed on a friends couch. I thought she was acting a bit childish, but I wrote it off.

I ended up calling her this morning, and trying to smooth things over. I ended up pretty much repeating what I said last night, like I had a script, until I let slip that it worries me that if I dedicated so much income to get a location she wants in a social part of the town (not to mention the drive to work), I would end up being frustrated if she continued in her recent habits of inactivity. She never wants to go out, doesn't want to have people over, and has spend most nights i'm around watching netlix and playing on her phone while I walk her dog. It's been a point of stress for me, especially when I think about how active she was when we met. I hate that I would impose expectations, but it feels like a concession in the relationship and I know I would resent making it if things stayed as they've been lately. making it worse, I likened it to a treadmill purchase we argued over a few X-Mas seasons ago; it seems petty but I didn't see it as an ""i told you so,"" the situation seems similar - just on a much larger scale. And it was a legitimate worry of I mine, I didn't want to bottle it up.

Well the conversation ended with her crying and saying she felt attacked. She didn't understand why I was so mean, and didn't get why I was so negative. I thought I was opening up, and felt a deep level of intimacy talking to her about this, but she didn't feel it and it drove her away. I've profusely apologized, but now I've gotten texts saying ""I can't do this. It's not working,"" ""I need to take a break, can you stay at friends?,"" and I don't want to talk, or listen right now.""

I'm freaking out. I'm 32 and thought I had the rest of my life kind of mapped out. I'M FREAKING THE FUCK OUT right now. What should I do? I can't imagine life without her, and the thought of having to start a new plan without her has me utterly frozen with a cocktail of negative emotion. What the fuck am I supposed to be doing right now. Sorry to bring my problems here, but I don't want my friends or family to know a fucking thing about this.

tl;dr: Relocating to start in area my GF wants to move to. Have a job. Have a ring. Have been stressed looking for a house, and we have different expectations and budget ideas. After some really shitty phone calls last night and this morning where I was talking to much, she's gotten upset and is pushing for ""a break."" She's said that she can't ""do this"" and thinks we can't ""make it work."" Do I try to give her space? Not thinking clearly... just want to be with her.

Update:

She just texted me: ""I'm going to send you these houses because I'm more interested but I don't know if this is even going to work out."" and then links to 2 houses...

I don't know what she means, but she's still taking time in the day to look at houses.  Before anyone says she's bei g manipulative, I truly believe she's genuinely confused by a tornado of emotions...  She just acting without thinking through, not being machievellian"
"[Update] How can I (18M) convince my parents (50M) (49F) to let me skip graduation?

I just wanna say thank you to all of you for the advice. Reading through these responses the general consensus is that I should go, and I guess that’s what I’ll be doing.

Don’t get me wrong. I still hate high school. I still think graduation is a waste of time, and that I have nothing to be proud of... but yeah. You guys helped me realize that it’s more for the family than the actual student, and I love my parents. If it’s important to them, I’ll suck it up and go.

I just turned in the form to buy the cap and gown (with my own money) a few minutes ago. I don’t have many good memories at this school, but hopefully graduation can make up for all of that in a way. Once again, thanks for all the advice and PMs :) It really means a lot to me.

TLDR: I’m sucking it up and going to graduation. Here’s to the class of 2018."

"My(24F) narcissistic, toxic mother (65F) wants me to make her best friend's daughter(25F), (a constant source of misery for me in high school btw)who i havent spoken to in 2 years my maid of honour/ bridesmaid instead of my actual best friend


Just a bit of background info my mother and this friend has always been the source of my low self esteem and depression issues from 11yrs-18yrs to the point that i literally moved to the other side of the world to study and get a job as soon as i turned 18, as soon as i moved away from them and their weird bubble of life i felt so much better i didnt need ANY medication anymore. i havent been back home for more than a week or so for five years but now i've moved back due to visa stuff and planning a wedding.



In high school this girl,her mom and my mum made me feel soooo low and downright hideous, my mum made go over to hers for a sleepover once when i was 11 and it ended up being her saying how ugly i was and that i need a makeover so she cut all my hair to an uneven bob cuz she was 12 and not a skilled hairstylist at all, she pierced my ears with a needle and plucked my eyebrows to the point of no return she then told me i needed to lose weight ( I was already bulimic AND anorexic and weighed 105 pounds at 5'2 which is a normal healthy weight btw, she's taller so her legs naturally look skinnier than mine (think thigh gap) and my mum is constantly saying why i cant get down to her weight but i literally weigh less than her ffs whatever if you cant already tell i have extreme body issues and disordered eating issues) Stuff like this happened regularly all throughout high school. The girl is also the same race as my mum, Im not because im mixed and this has also played a part in this weird obssession of my mum's with her.



Fast forward to now I havent spoken to this person in years and feel much better because of it now my mother is screaming throwing huge sometimes PUBLIC tantrums EVERY SINGLE DAY about how im ruining her friendship with the girls mother by not making her MOH/bridesmaid and they wont invite her to their trips anyore if i dont do it. Today she said the only reason I dont want to make her MOH/bridesmaid is because she'll obviously steal the show and make me look soooo ugly in comparison and everyone will be focused on her instead of me. honestly just typing that out makes me want to cry so much because I know its not true but its like high school all over again, i have basically zero self esteem again, my anorexia is back after having been recovered for about 3 years. i was in suuuuch a good place just a couple of months ago and now its all gone back to square 1. 



I know people might be thinking its a stupid thing to make such a big deal out of but I want to actually be happy on my wedding day and i dont want such a toxic wreck standing next to me on the altar, i wasnt even going to invite her but my mother already has, im also having a very small wedding with my two BEST friends as MOH and bridesmaid and NO groomsmen as my fiances friends couldnt afford to fly to my home country for the wedding. ive already planned to just have two bridesmaid so that one person can stand behind me and the other behind my fiance. so apart from generally hating her it also just wouldnt be symmetrical anyway. also who the fuck expects to be made someones maid of honour when you havent spoken to them in fucking YEARS!?!? 



Am i right in disagreeing with my mum over this or am i just being dramatic? how do i not let it affect me?! my mum is paying for most of the wedding so she keeps throwing that in my face as well



TLDR: My mother wants me to make my highschool ""bully"" my maid of honour or bridesmaid because if i dont i'll ""ruin the relationship with the girl's mother (my mums best friend) and her friends and she'll never be invited out with them again. She also thinks the only reason i dont want to do it is because ""she will outshine me on my wedding day cuz she's so gorgeous"" (she isnt, shes completely average and i dont understand why shes so obssessed with her ew)"
"My (25F) friend (27F) keeps hitting on my husband (26M)


Okay I’ll try keep this short. 

I am married to an attractive guy (I’m biased but it’s true lol) women hitting on him is not new or shocking and he never encourages them but I’ve recently been having issues with a friend (Ali) I consider quite important to me. 

Hubby and I haven’t been married long and she has only met him maybe 2 or 3 times bc we no longer live in the same state since I moved to hubby’s area when we got married. 

She has always “playfully” flirted with him and comments on his IG posts (mostly innocent comments) But the most recent time she came to visit us for a third friends birthday. We all went out and we’re having a great time. Or so I thought. Hubby pulled me aside at the bar to say Ali was grinding on him and aggressively flirting while I was getting drinks. When I saw her dancing on him myself a few minutes later I guided her away and took hubby’s hand. She was wasted and just laughed saying she was joking. 

The rest of the night was fine and we headed home Ali and another friend were crashing at our place. Ali tried to sit next to hubby constantly as he brushed her off. Eventually she went to bed and so did hubby and I. 

So here’s the advice part. In a normal situation I would tell her where exactly to get off. But since moving first from another country to the USA and then from one state to another I am sorely lacking in friends. And Ali is right in the middle of the group of maybe 5 friends I do have. How do I go about this in a way that won’t result in losing all my friends. 

Just to add this is not and was never about cheating. My husband tells me any time she looks/ talks/ comments anything toward him. This is purely about navigating what I believe has to be the end of the friendship 

Thanks in advance! 

Tl:dr good friend hits on my husband. She is part of my limited friend group and I need help navigating my next steps. "
"I [24 F] am beginning to resent my boyfriend's[28 M] ""Peter Pan Syndrome"". Is it time to leave?


[removed]"
"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] have recently learnt that his parents want us to divorce because we don't want children. What do I do?


For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. 

Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. 


However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions.


My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. 


At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren? 


EDIT: You guys are so awesome, thank you so much! I think I need to clarify something, however: It's not that I want him to have a relationship with his parents (I'm not masochistic), but there's two reasons why I've stated that I'm worried(?) about that changing. The first reason is: I'm worried that if I vent too much/express too much of my feelings to this situation - however valid they may be - he may be making decisions that are influenced by me, and I don't want him to blame me after x amount of time has passed because he felt like I pressured him. The second reason is that he's the type of person who is very likely to change his mind, and sometimes he forgets to inform me of big decisions like this. I'm worried that if I get too used to the idea of them not being in my life, I'll be hit with some bombshell revelation in the future so I'm trying to be pragmatic about the situation. I hope that clears up the idea that I think he should be involved with his family because they're 'family'. And I have no intention of trying to orchestrate anything - they don't and won't speak to me, and I have no interest in engaging them whatsoever. Again, thank you all!!! "

"[UPDATE] I'm [29 F] looking for some outside perspective on a fight with my bf [27 M] of 1.5 years


I thought I should provide an update as the comments to my original post were overwhelmingly in favour of breaking up. Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7x1qee/im_29_f_looking_for_some_outside_perspective_on_a/

Unsurprisingly, you guys were right. We broke up shortly after I posted. It seemed to go relatively smoothly at first, except he was dragging his feet about moving out. Once he did move out, he insisted on leaving some of his things and hanging on to the keys until he could pick up the rest of his stuff.

So, last night I was out with some friends and he starts sending me angry texts (and called repeatedly) that I am at such and such address with such and such person, how could I do this to him, etc. It turns out that he had shown up at my apartment, gone through my computer (though I had changed the password recently), read my messages, and determined both my location and that I MUST be having sex with someone right then (I later learned that he also deleted all of my photos). I was afraid to go home that night so I stayed put, but had to return in the morning to get some things. He wasn't there when I arrived, but shortly after he burst in to scream at me, call me names, and scare the hell out of me. He again refused to return his set of keys.

SO, I am having a pretty lame time. I'm afraid to go back to my apartment, and I'm not sure what to do about the lease. I'm also worried that he has a keylogger on my computer but I haven't been able to find anything yet. I'm staying elsewhere for now and I'll talk to my landlords in the morning. 

Moral of the story: if you feel like your SO is being abusive, they probably are. Get out early. Don't sign a damn lease with them.

Together for 15 months. Her father did a fantastic job of recording/photographing her life ever since she was born (there are multiple bookcases of photo albums at her parent's place). Maybe too fantastic. Her need for me to catalogue her life is slowly draining my soul. 

I understand and enjoy taking pictures just as much as anyone else when it comes to dates, vacations, and even food. But when I have to take &gt; 400 photos (yes, you read that # right) on our date to the sand dunes or &gt; 100 photos of our fine dining experience last night with another couple, is it really so hard to believe that I would get tired, start to not enjoy the experience, and eventually become visibly upset? 

I try my best to humor her, since I know she enjoys getting photographed (different distances, poses, lighting, gopro/camera/phone). And after our 2nd to last fight about this, I told her I would try to improve my attitude (not fake smile, smile only with teeth, don't become solemn and sulk). But when I have to enjoy salvation mountain through the lense of her gopro as I follow her around filming/photographing, or when I have to stop every minute during a hike to photograph her, it becomes difficult.  

When we discuss the issue, she sums it up as these are once in a lifetime experiences and I should suck it up. And she wonders why we've been cooking more and I've been taking her on less dates... To help cope, I've thought of taking caffeine, adderall, weed, mdma, or just running onto oncoming traffic; anyone have any healthier alternatives?  

side annoyance #1: she scolds me for taking bad pictures all the time. I've read on how to improve and try implementing it, but then she scolds me for taking too long to take the pictures (again, all the time).


side annoyance #2: she uses up her phone memory so fast (even after uploading to her laptop) that she makes me use my phone for pics/vids and now i have to deal with memory issues.

"My (28F) manager (50sM) called me ""like a mom"" in a public praise instead of acknowledging my achievements


I recently got a public feedback from my boss (a middle manager in his 50s) which makes me a bit uncomfortable. 


We had an event in our department where every single member got a few sentences of public praise in order to increase the general motivation. While the pre-dominantly male members mainly got praised for their skills, results and knowledge, there seemed to be almost a pattern of female members getting praised for “efforts” and soft skills. Most extreme example was a female colleague, who got only praised for being cheerful. On the other hand, it was also “praised” and laughed about how much a male (married) manager likes women and alcohol, so I guess you get an idea on the atmosphere.


When it came to me, my boss pointed out how difficult my job responsibilities are (but not whether I would be able to handle them) and that I’m one of the youngest department members. He praised my communication skills, but then proceeded in telling everyone that I would be “like a mom” to my team of interns. I immediately called out that I do not want to be called “mom” by my team and not by anyone, but it didn’t seem to bother my boss. 


Given that I bring a lot of unique skills into my job (that saved the company money they used to spend on external vendors) and that I bear three different roles with a significantly lower salary than my male predecessor, I’m honestly not happy with this sort of praise. 


This is also not the first time, that he characterizes me as someone “soft” in front of my subordinates which I feel undermines my authority. Feedback on my own performance usually includes that I’m doing a fantastic job but wouldn’t be committed enough. Given that I’m on a 40hrs/week low staff level, I already do overtime regularly and came to work even with a fever. It seems however that he’s comparing me with my manager peers that do not have any time restrictions and often end up working until into the night and on weekends. (Additional information: in my country unpaid overtime for staff is illegal, and our company has ongoing government inspections for thousands of violations)

  **tl;dr**: My boss called me a ""mom to my team"" and criticises my work commitment based on how much higher paid managers with unlimited hours can output.

"My [31/F] boyfriend [33/M] keeps failing his test for residency as a doctor and is unwilling to consider other career options other than retaking the test year after year


Please bear with me, as this is long and somewhat difficult to explain, so please feel free to ask questions and thank you in advance for your help.

I have been dating my boyfriend for almost four years, and when we first started dating he had finished med school and was studying for a test to begin his residency. He's from and lives in Europe so the whole doctor thing works differently than in the US: basically, there's a test once per year that everyone in the country takes, and then you are ranked based on your results. Depending on your ranking, you get to pick what specialty you want and where to do your residency. 

The first year we were dating, he failed the exam. Each year we've been together he has retaken the exam, and failed it again. I just found out today that he failed the exam for at least the fifth time. Each year he takes classes and studies during the day, but something is clearly blocking him from getting a high enough score to pass. He got really good grades in med school, so he's an intelligent guy, which makes it even harder to reconcile.

He insists that he still wants to be a doctor, but to me he just doesn't seem motivated. He studies during the day, but he's easily distracted and (I feel) that he does more procrastinating than studying. He gets way more excited about other projects, like researching things to build or even doing experiments with cooking/baking. I say this to demonstrate that it's not that he doesn't have the focus to study, just that it doesn't seem like he's very passionate about studying...and honestly who would be after taking the same test over and over?

He is not working, just studying for the exam. His family has money, which is what enables him to keep retaking the test instead of opting for a different career or going back to school. To me, this is very frustrating, because his mom doesn't even treat it as a big deal when he fails. This year she told me, ""well if not this year, then next year!"" But each year he retakes it he has to compete with people who are just finishing med school, who clearly have an advantage because all of the material is fresh in their mind. 

I have spoken to him explaining that I support him no matter what, and I asked him if he still wants to be a doctor and he insists that he does. I told him that I would support him going back to school or changing careers in whatever way he would like, but he insists on retaking the test year after year. I feel like we're stuck in a holding pattern, because our lives can't really move forward (marriage, kids...and we've talked about and agreed that we want both of those things, with each other) without him having a job. I also feel like he can't really move forward with his life..he doesn't really have any commitments other than studying and I feel like for his own mental health it would be good for him to be doing something on a regular basis, even just volunteering.
I moved to Europe to be with him a little over a year ago because I thought it might help to have me here instead of worrying with the travel related to a long distance relationship. Luckily, I was able to find a full-time job, so at least I am working. However, I did have to make some concessions in finding a job, which makes it even more frustrating to me since he seems to be unwilling to make concessions of his own.

I don't want to sound unsympathetic...I know it's really hard on him to keep failing the exam and I know it's taken a toll on his self-confidence. But I'm also frustrated by his lack of flexibility, and really, lack of drive to figure out a solution other than just restudying for the exam.

I feel like there are so many great things about our relationship...he's supportive, kind, loving, fun, we have similar interests and values, and our sex life is good. But this unwillingness to adapt is worrying me, and I feel like there's little I can do and I'm just along for the ride.

Redditors, what should I do?

**TL;DR:** my boyfriend of 4 years keeps retaking and failing the same test he needs to be employed, and he's unwilling to explore other options.

**EDIT:** Thank you for the responses, everyone! Just to clarify a couple of points: I told him that I would support him in a career change or going back to school. I told him before he took the test the most recent time that if he failed this year I was NOT okay with him taking the test another year and that he would have to make a decision. I haven't spoken to him about the results this year yet because he doesn't know that I know (the test results were published online and I just found out this morning). Out of curiosity I'm waiting a couple of days to bring it up to see if he brings it up on his own first.

The test is multiple choice, and there is no interview or other step to get a residency. To my knowledge, you literally take the test and are ranked, and then you choose the residency and the hospital doesn't get a lot of say (except for unusual circumstances). I have more or less confirmed the process on the medical board website, so I don't think my boyfriend is lying to me.

When we lived apart, I didn't get to see him study, and now I get to see him sometimes...and as I mentioned above, he seems very unfocused/procrastinates a lot, which I have mentioned to him and he acknowledged that he was doing it (but didn't ultimately change anything). He did take classes 1-2 days per week this year from July-December in addition to studying from home.

I really appreciate the responses, and support, because I have been feeling like it's a little selfish to give him an ultimatum, but I also have life goals of my own. I wish it were simple and that other parts of our relationship suck, but they don't. But this is obviously putting a strain on our relationship, at least from my end.

**EDIT 2:** As I said before, we are in Europe, so he's not taking the Steps. It's very similar to the situation that someone mentioned below about him competing against all the other people taking the test: there aren't enough spots for everyone. I understand that the test is very difficult, which is why I've been understanding so far. I also understand the concept of sunk cost, that he's invested so much time and energy into being a doctor that he wants to follow through. But as someone else mentioned, if he were really wanting to be a doctor, I feel like he would be more dedicated than taking a couple of classes per week and studying for a few hours at home every day. He just doesn't seem passionate about it. That's fine...I'm not with him because he'll be a doctor. 

I've considered the option that he may have ADHD, but considering that he got good grades in med school (yes, he graduated, I've seen his degree, but I had a friend that found out her husband had been lying about graduating from university and she found out and of course divorced him right away), I assume that this type of difficulty would have impacted his performance before. 

I feel conflicted because yes, I want kids, and I want to be married before I have kids. He's a great boyfriend (see my original post) which is what makes me hesitant to break up with him over the test.

Also, no, I am not financially supporting him, and he actually chipped in a lot more than me for expenses when I first moved to Europe and was waiting for my work permit to go through. I'm not worried about the money, more that he seems to be stuck.

I'll try to respond individually to everyone's comments; I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you again for all of your responses!

**EDIT 3:** I'm updating since someone said that I hadn't explained what my boyfriend does in his spare time, and maybe he was doing something good for society other than working (and that some people resent family wealth).

I don't have anything against family wealth and 
I don't think he's a spoiled brat at all. He's a good, caring person. But he doesn't have anything tangible that he's doing in his spare time to help the world at large, or even the community. I've suggested volunteering to him and he said he didn't have time because he had to study. If he even said he wanted to be on an advisory board or something that independently wealthy people stereotypically do, I would be cool with that. I just want him to make a decision that isn't studying for the same test for another year.

To clarify, during the day before the test, he would study a few hours per day (and go to classes a couple of days per week, about 4 hours each class). Other than that, he likes to cook a lot, he does stuff around the house, helps his mom when she needs it, and spends time with me when I'm not working. He also hangs out with his friends. 

Now that his test is over, the time he's spent studying he's looking into stuff to build for our house, doing cooking experiments, and the other things listed above. He also plays video games on his phone and watches TV.

Also, yes, he is from one of the countries someone mentioned (Spain/France/Italy). I doubt I'd dox myself with this single post by saying which of the three it is, but I'd prefer not to specify just in case.

**EDIT 4:** A lot of people have pointed out that you can have ADHD and make good grades, and that it manifests itself in different ways for different people. Thank you to everyone for pointing this out, and it's something I plan to discuss with my boyfriend getting checked out just in case."

The next day we talked about things and she was open to working things out and just postponing the wedding until she was more comfortable which I agreed was the best option. 

  We own a house and pets together as well as having all our bill, bank accounts, and cell phone plan together so if we did split up it would be a ton of things to take care of. Since the “breakup” last Wednesday night she went out with a friend over the weekend to bars and got pretty drunk Friday-Sunday. While she’s out I don’t bother her and I let her be with her friend and enjoy her time as I don’t want to pressure her or stress her out more. Then Saturday night she was out with her friend and so was I. I got home around 11:30 and went to bed after texting her and saying I hope she was having fun, I loved her and that if she needed me to just call. 1:45am comes around and she’s calling me more drunk then I had ever heard her and asked for a ride home and sounded extremely upset. I pick her up and on the way home she is just extremely drunk and stumbling on words. I ask what happened while she was out that made her want to come home and she said midway through the night she lost control and started crying at the bar. I ask why and she says because she though about me home alone while she was out and that she felt bad and missed me and wanted to come home to me. So I felt a little better about the situation. I get her home help her shower and change and into bed. 

  The next day she has a nasty hangover so I get her breakfast and help her out how I can. She thanks me again for the night before and we spend most of the day together. Cut to later in the day her friend is texting her and poof she’s getting ready and off to go drink all night again leaving me high and dry. I get upset and confront her and she brushes it off and says she just wants to go out and not worry about the situation. She goes to the bar I talk to her once or twice all day and then nothing and I go to bed as I have work in the morning. Monday she text me and is sending me snapchats and such all day and things seem to be better for the next day or two. So here I am today and I’m off all day due to the poor weather as is she and we spend the morning doing running around and such and things seem okay. We get home and she wants to read a little in bed by herself so I leave her for a few hours. When I go in to check and see how her book is and just see what’s up she just says she wants to be left alone today and not deal with anyone as she is emotionally drained. I respect her wishes make a bath up for her and let her be. The main problem I’m having with the situation is that she won’t give me any answers or anything about where the situation is going and anytime we bring up the conversation she just brushes it off and gets extremely flustered and stressed. She is like that with everyone she’s close to since the break up and won’t talk about it to anyone, not me, not her mother, not her maid of honor, no one but all day she is on her phone texting her best friend and friend she goes out with non stop. This is driving me insane and draining me not being able to get a conversation out of her while she talks to her friends all day. I don’t know what to do or how to proceed. I’ve been letting her be and doing what needs to be done to help her through this process but don’t want to press the subject and push her further away but I need something. I’m just looking to get some advice and maybe some female directions on how to proceed and get things to work out and back on track?!

a\ *bolded tl;dr. Fiancé called off wedding 10 days before. We live together and are trying to work things out but need a little direction on where to go from here? 

Update: I got home from work today and said hello and asked how her day was as normal. We got into a talk again about how she hasn’t really told me where we stand or what we are right now. She got upset and said that as of now we are workin on things and that she isn’t sure we can work these things out and that it will take a lot for me to fix the mistakes I’ve made and the let downs I’ve put on her for a year now in her words. Things got a little out of hand and I got upset as did she and we both were beyond stressed. She suggested a 2 month “trial” or last chance kind of situation and we can take it day by day. I agreed as long as she can give it a positive shot and really be into it and give me time with her, a real positive attitude and stay faithful to me. She said she’s not going to be happy and cheerful non stop but she can try and work on it as a last effort to save the relationship. We talked a little more and things got a little out of hand and we agreed that one of us should spend the night somewhere else as to not make things more tense so I left for the night to stay with my parents and let things decompress until tomorrow when we can be more calm and have another hopefully helpful conversation."

"Closest male friend [M/28] proposed to me [25/F], I don't know what to do.


Hi reddit,

To preface, I suffer a lot from anxiety and depression. I have always had low self-esteem from my family's verbal and emotional abuse. I also am quite terrible at keeping in touch and have almost no friends. These past few years I have it much more under control now.

Anyhow, my closest male friend, since college, knew about this and yet, had a crush on me for the longest time. He approached me and I declined since I didn't have any feelings for him. Regardless, we stayed as friends. By the end of our respective program, he moved back to his home country and did mandatory military service and I stayed in the States looking for work.

A few years went by, he still kept in touch with me. He knew how much I struggled with finding a job and struggling with low self-esteem. I found a job, but then after two years, quit to travel. I visited him in his home country. We kept it completely platonic (he even had a open relationship with his girlfriend at this time), until the very few last days.

After our fling in his home country, our feelings started to emerge. We traveled together in another country for two weeks and then he confessed that he loved me. I also loved him dearly in return, but didn't realize he was actually in love with me. We never settled for any labels nor anything, and I ended up dating some douchebag for the wrong reasons (while returning to the States)

After I broke up with the dude, he later reached out and told me that he would visit me in the States. He proposed to me and sees us having a future. I told him it might not work out even though we are traveling again together. I loved him so much but I don't know if I'm qualified to even have a future with him. He has his shit together and I don't. The reason why I'm posting here because I don't know if its my perception of myself, afraid that I love him because I'm lonely or for the wrong reasons.

**TL;DR**: My male best friend is Forrest Gump and I'm Jenny.. and I'm wondering if a happy ending happen in real life."
"I [32M] am concerned about this bachelor party my girlfriend [28F] is attending


My girlfriend (Rachel) &amp; I have been dating 5 months, and so far it’s been great, but recently an issue has come up that I need some advice on. Her very good (male) friend is getting married, and will soon be having a co-ed bachelor party, which will involve a weekend of outdoor activities, drinking, etc. My girlfriend’s ex (Todd) will also be at the bachelor party. The two of them only dated for five or six months, and that was five or six years ago, and my girlfriend was the one who ended things. However, they’ve kept in touch until recently, when my girlfriend broke off contact because Todd was repeatedly trying to get back together with her. Todd was actually the one who reached out several weeks ago to invite her to the bachelor party.

My girlfriend originally asked for my thoughts regarding the bachelor party, and she even suggested that she could skip it and meet up with her good friend (the groom-to-be) separately to wish him well. I told her that I thought this was a good idea. However, now she’s saying she wants to go to the bachelor party. I won’t be going with her, and have concerns about her spending a weekend doing bachelor-party type things with her ex, who was the one to invite her and, based on his prior behavior, could well use the opportunity to try and get back together with her.

So I’m uncertain how to handle this. On one hand I’d hate to ask her to miss a cool weekend with some close friends she doesn’t see very often. On the other, I’ve had several relationships end due to inappropriate behavior with exes (cheating, etc), so this is an area I’m particularly sensitive to. Maybe too sensitive? There’s a line here between establishing healthy boundaries and demonstrating trust, and I’m having trouble determining where it falls. Would really appreciate some additional perspective.

**TL;DR;** : Girlfriend wants to attend bachelor party with ex, unsure how to handle."
"How do I (30F) uninvite our creepy neighbor (70'sM) to my son's 1st birthday party?


We moved into this house 3.5 months ago. Our neighbor across the street introduced himself right away. In the weeks/months following we've chatted outside a few times a week. He's brought us food a handful of times. I baked him cookies for Christmas. He seemed just like a typical older man/nice neighbor. We invited him to our sons first birthday which is coming up soon.

I sent out the invite and received a verbal confirmation that he's coming. That was 2 weeks ago. Since then he's done and said some things that make me really uncomfortable and I don't want him at the party anymore.

Creepy thing #1 - he's been inviting us to happy hour since we moved in saying he has a babysitter for us. I would just kind of ignore him on the babysitter front because my son is breastfed and doesn't take a bottle and frankly I'd find my own babysitter if I wanted to which I don't. I haven't been away from my son since he was born and I'm just not ready yet.

We thought he just wanted to hang out so my husband went out to lunch with him. He still insisted on happy hour/babysitter. So I invited him to our place for dinner thinking he wanted to socialize with both of us. He declined. But continued pushing happy hour/ babysitter.

Then he brought this lady to our house unannounced to introduce us. I was polite and said hi and they left.

He kept bugging my husband about happy hour so finally I said to him ok let's go I'll bring the baby and wear him in a carrier. To which he responds "" why don't you trust the lady I introduced you to?"" I just explained the breastfeeding situation and used that as an excuse.

So he basically keeps pushing this sitter on us. I didn't think much of it until the other creepy things happened.

Creepy thing #2 - He comes to our house the night of the happy hour already a little buzzed and makes a comment about how cute my son is and that he could probably get $50-$100 if he sold him. No one laughed. My husband said something like ""no we're good"" And he said he was joking and moved on.

Creepy thing #3 - while out to happy hour he asked how our son was sleeping. I said he still wakes frequently and he responded by saying ""well you can just throw him in my spare bedroom tonight and pick him up in the morning"". I gave a disgusted look and he responds ""sorry I have a sick sense of humor""

Creepy thing #4 - my husband was outside playing with our son and neighbor walks up and says hi then immediately tries to pick the baby up. My husband basically intercepted the baby and turned away from the neighbor guy who just started walk back to his house. He's never held our son before and normal people usually ask first.

Anyway all of these things together weird me out, pushing the baby sitter super hard, making disturbing jokes and trying to hold him without asking. Am I overreacting? I really don't want him at the party around my son or other kids now. How do I keep him from coming?

TLDR invited neighbor to my son's party now he's acting creepy and I don't want him there"
