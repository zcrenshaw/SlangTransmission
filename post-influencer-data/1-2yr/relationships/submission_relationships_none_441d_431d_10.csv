"[UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.


[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt ""forced"" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me."
"I [21 F] sent an embarrassing text screenshot to my whole sports team of 30 people. The screenshot was of another team member's [30s M] creepy texts to me.



Last night, I went out for drinks with my friends from work. I got a text on Facebook messenger from an acquaintance from my fencing club, Bobby, asking how I'd like to see his big cock. I had hardly talked to this guy before, so I obviously texted back ""wtf no"". He then texted me some other creepy stuff, like talking about how he likes my boobs and thinks I really do want to see his dick but I'm playing hard to get. 

I was drunk and annoyed, but I thought it was best if I didn't reply again. But I wanted to tell my three best girl friends from the club about it, so theyd know to watch out. So I screenshotted the conversation and sent it to our group chat saying ""WTF bobbyyy Don't talk about my boobyyyy!"" 

My phone was dying so I put it in my bag. This morning I woke up really hungover, and charged up my phone and saw a lot of messages in my fencing team group chat (of about 30 people). 

I realized that I'd not sent my text to my group chat with my 3 close friends titled ""Fency Gals"", I'd sent it to the group chat for the whole club, of 30 people, titled ""Fencing [club acronym]"". A bunch of people had sent messages making fun of what Bobby had said, then the club vice president removed Bobby from the group. People started sending memes, making a joke about everything. 

I sent a message ASAP when I realized what I'd done saying ""Sorry all, didn't mean to send that to the group! 😓""

And a few of my friends from the club said stuff like ""yeah right""

I don't know what to do now. I feel like stuff is going to be really awkward if I see Bobby at the club meetings. And I do feel a little bad. Even though he was being sketchy as fuck, I didn't mean to send that screenshot to the whole group.""

Should I text the club VP who removed Bobby from the group, to see if she's going to remove him from the club or something? Or hope it all blows over?

It's kinda embarrassing, putting my business out there for everyone to see tbh.

tldr : I accidentally texted my whole fencing club a screenshot of this other club member's creepy messages.

"I (31 f) called in sick to work today so I could have some time alone from my partner (33 m)


My partner is always around. Some people will say I'm lucky that he wants to be around me all of the time, but it's feeling so smothering.

We've been together for 10 years. He has no friends he hangs out with, and the only time he'll do his hobby (fishing) is when I'm busy doing something else. If I suggest he should go fishing, he asks why I'm trying to get rid of him. If I want to hang out with my friend (which we only do once a week), instead of saying ""that sounds fun, I hope you have a good time!"" he'll say ""well what am I going to do? You've been at work all day, I haven't seen you, I'm going to miss you"". He makes me feel guilty for leaving him alone.

I'm just feeling overwhelmed. How do you tell your partner of 10 years that he's smothering me and I need guilt-free alone time?

**tl;dr** Feeling smothered, don't know how to tell my partner."
"[UPDATE] Girlfriend [21 F] is furious at me [21 M] after my grandmother spoke badly and derogatorily about her in Spanish right in front of her


Original Post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sf4ql/girlfriend_21_f_is_furious_at_me_21_m_after_my/

(tl:dr- grandmother said racist and derogatory things about my girlfriend in spanish right in front of her not knowing she could understand some spanish.) 

People gave me a really hard time in my original post and it really made me realize how much of a dumbass I was being. I apologized profusely to Olivia and called out my extremely stupid behavior and basically begged for forgiveness. After a couple more days of being mad at me she was willing to talk to my parents and my brother who apologized and told her that they really loved her and that they didn’t mean to hurt her. They tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and why she behaved the way she did and they were just trying to minimize drama but that what she was saying was wrong and they should have stood up to her. My mother got her a gift set from bath and body works, costume jewelry and chocolate to go along with the apology. 

So Olivia did forgive me and my family which I am so relieved about because I really am crazy about this girl. I’m definitely not going to take this for granted. A week ago my brother, Olivia and I went to an amusement park and my brother and her actually got along really well and she’s definitely convinced he doesn’t secretly hate black people. (I never thought my brother was racist - when he was in middle school he “dated” a black girl.) He's only 15 so I definitely don't blame him for what happened. It was my dad's fault for laughing. But yeah he really likes her and is glad she doesn't hate him. My mom invited Olivia to a beach with our family on Saturday (My abuela stayed at home) and although she mostly stayed by me and my brother she seemed to get along reasonably with my parents and seems to believe their apology (she was a bit hesitant to go). 

I have told my grandmother that if she wants me to be actively part of her life she must apologize to Olivia. My grandmother actually agreed to apologize but my gf doesn’t want to talk to her and I told her I will not force her to be around her but I did tell her that my grandmother is sorry for the way she behaved. 

So yeah that's my update. I appreciate all the replies no matter how harsh. It really made my realize my stupidity. Still have a lot of growing up to do but I am really happy she took me back.

  **tl;dr**: Olivia forgave me after my parents and I apologized and we are still together. She still  understandably doesn't want to talk to my grandmother though. "
"Me [27 F] with my Husband [28 M] married for 2 years. I got a call from his 'friend' that he has been cheating on me but things don't add up.


My husband 'Sean' has always been a huge fitness and gym enthusiast. He is extremely good looking and always has multiple women flirting/hitting on him and this has always been a big insecurity of mine so maybe that's why I am so paranoid.

Recently about 7 months ago a new couple 'Dylan and Flora' moved into our area. They are both 23 and out of college. Flora and my husband met while playing tennis as they both go to the same club and they get along great. I always thought she had a crush on him but as she is(was?) respectful, so I left it at that. Soon my husband invited her to the Gym he goes.

Now, a week ago I get a call from Dylan saying that one of the guys in the Gym had seen my husband and Flora kissing just outside our apartment building. He also gave me three instances when Flora was out and asked whether I could account for my husband. I said I’d call him back so I could check my calendar. I’d been with him all three times. When I called back he said she had condoms in the glove-box of her car and she’d been checking out hotel sites. She’s also very secretive about her phone now. 

I went through his phone and social media as we are very open about these things and there was no sign of an affair although they had been texting quite a bit(about tennis etc.) and she has always been very complimentary but my husband has not responded/flirted back. It sounds like Flora is up to something but I pray to God it’s not with my husband. So why phone me? We have very loving relationship and he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who would cheat.

Even worse, the guy called me again last night asking that I go on some sort of stake-out with him. She says she’s away with work next week and he’s sure it’s not true. He’s hoping to catch her at it. 

Should I go too and keep everything crossed it’s not my husband? Should I just confront my husband or just lay low and hope for the best. This is tearing me apart now and I have not been able to sleep since.

tl;dr: Friend is concerned that his Gf is cheating with my husband but I am questioning the circumstances.

"My [21F] brother [32M] scheduled his wedding over a festival that I am running


I'm the chair of this big music festival at my university, and I'm running it this year alongside one faculty member and my larger group's president. I've been in this position since about January, and we set the dates for the festival shortly after: a Friday and Saturday this November.

Yesterday, I got a call from my brother (who is de facto engaged) telling me to keep those dates open. I told him that's not possible, but if those have to be the dates, ok, I guess. I did send him another message later telling him that this is in fact a big deal; I have been applying for grants and attending hearings for months. We are flying in a composer and paying him $3,700 to attend and to commission a piece that will have its world premiere on the Saturday evening concert of the festival, as well as having lots of smaller groups and concerts to manage that day. I asked that if there was any flexibility on his end, to please look into it.

Today he tells me tough luck, the wedding is Saturday. I will be very upset no matter which I choose to go to. I can get a stand-in trained for the day (and probably to take over my position next year), catch a cheap flight home Saturday morning, and return sometime the next day before classes on Monday. Because of our \~10-year age difference, my brother and I have never been very close. Now that I'm closer to being a real adult we've started talking more very recently.

I honestly think I will be more upset to miss the festival that I have been and will keep planning for months, but that I should go to the wedding. My sister \[30F\], whom I haven't seen in three years, told me to ""skip the dumb wedding"" and she'll send me a video. It was nice to have someone care about what I'm working for. I should go to the wedding, right? I have several months to be upset and get over it and try to make sure I don't cry about it at the wedding.

**tl;dr**: In charge of university music festival. Have to pick between being present there or attending brother's wedding."
"My (24/F) Boyfriend (26/M) Called me cheap cause I don't get him expensive things


My boyfriend of less than a year wanted a really expensive watch for this 26th birthday, but instead I got him a Basketball Jersey of his favorite NBA Player as well as basketball shoes.

I’m a 24 year old woman who works as an engineer.

We got into a fight and he told me “You got me a fucking $100 Jersey and $200 shoes, cause you can’t afford what I really want”

The matter of fact is I CAN AFFORD it and he knows I can.

I just don’t feel like now is the right time to give him a $6,000 watch.

He hasn’t given me anything not even flowers, and I don’t expect nor demand anything from him.

Are Nmen really like this?

tl;dr: I never demanded nor got any gifts from him, not even flowers"
"[UPDATE] How do I (29M) talk to one of my co-workers (59M) about him talking too much?


[HERE IS THE ORIGINAL POST I MADE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8k0522/how_do_i_29m_talk_to_one_of_my_coworkers_59m/)

Okay, since I last posted, things have turned into a bit of a shitshow. Allow me to explain what has happened with John. 

I used the advice to positively frame his talking and let him know that he's our strongest salesperson and that he is at his strongest when he's quiet and takes the time to listen. I told him that we has to back off when other salespeople are giving their presentations and only speak if he's needed. We all have our flow and people like me don't want to lose it with interjections. He got a little defensive when I told him this over lunch but eventually said he will work on this. Also, I've been catching him in situations when he's talking too much, telling him ""let's not talk about anything until we/I finish this"". Things like that. Just shutting down non-constructive conversations he tries to have at any time I can. 

Now here's a few things about John:

\-he can sell the shit out of our products

\-he knows EVERYTHING about our products 

\-he's making us a good amount of money, not the top salesperson at the moment but definitely not in last place

Here's what has happened. 

Despite what I have told John and done with him about his talking, he is now kicking back in with the behavior. He will stop talking when I tell him not too but he will slowly and surely build it back up and start the behavior again later in the day. Apparently when I'm not at the office he will talk and distract people just as much as he was before our ""talk"". The other employees will do the same thing I've been by telling him ""no talking until we finish this"" and he'll quiet down for a bit but very slowly start back up again. He hasn't changed the behavior and it's absolutely bizarre to me that he doesn't get it at this point especially with other employees flat out saying ""you talk too much and you're distracting me"". As a goof on Wednesday the co-owner and I told him that we were going to get lunch and said bye we'll be back later. He was staring at his laptop screen and started talking about lunch places as we were walking out the door. We said we gotta go, be back! and shut the back door behind us as he was still talking. We listed through the door and he, no lie, did not stop talking for almost three minutes straight. He was even addressing us directly even though we left. Saying things like \*\*I'VE BEEN TO THAT WENDY'S NEXT DOOR AND ""my name"", I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THEY COOK THEIR BURGERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. BY THE WAY ""co-owner's name"" I KNOW YOU LIKE JAPANESE FOOD, ME AND MY WIFE WENT DOWN TO THE PLACE ON HIGHWAY 101 AND BOY..... THEY'RE GREAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD...""\*\* 

He didn't even stop talking abruptly, he just kinda slowly trailed off. It's extremely bizarre. 

In the past week he's lost two salespeople two different sales because of him butting in. One of which was yesterday and ended with the customer leaving the office while telling John ""You're fucking crazy"". I sat him down and had one last serious talk with him about this and I feel like I'm talking to a different person now. He said that my claims about him causing people to lose sales is ""bullshit"" and he asserts that he does not talk that much more than anyone else in the office. He flat out denied anything that I was telling him was true and said that he ""doesn't know where this is coming from"". He literally did not believe one goddamn word I was saying. 

tl;dr: I'm going to have to fire John on Monday. I don't want to walk on eggshells at my workplace and I even dread him calling me on the phone now. Everyone is pissed off and his behavior is bordering on insane. Even criticizing him about his talking makes him begin to over-talk. He just can't wait to defend himself. I think he's addicted to talking. I feel bad about this because he's very friendly to me outside of work, but I can't work with him. "
"I [40M] began working from home to save the commute, but my wife [43F] won't let me work in peace!


Hi Reddit, I appreciate your help.

I'm a graphic designer and up until a month ago I worked in a corporate office downtown. The commute there always ate up more than an hour each way, and it was draining. My boss looked over my responsibilities and together we agreed that, if I wanted, I could work from home for four days of the week, and check in at the main office only on Mondays for our weekly team meetings and other sundry office tasks. Such a schedule would allow me to take the metro or even a bus to work on Monday, as our team meetings didn't start until later. My boss did mention that it would entail a small pay cut, due to my not being present for certain tasks. I talked it over with my wife that night, and although she didn't like the pay cut (it was about 10&amp;#37;) she agreed with me that the gasoline, and to say nothing of my time, would make up for it.

So, I began my home office career. My wife and I started our family later in life, and have a four year old daughter daughter. We live in a two and a half bedroom apartment, the ""half"" previously having been our child's playroom. I thought this might be an issue, but my wife assured me that our daughter can just play in the main living room during the day, or in her own room, and that anyway she will be in preschool in the fall. My wife is a stay at home mom but we've agreed that when our daughter starts kindergarten or first grade, she can return to office assistant work, which is what she did previously, or finish her bachelors degree in English at an accelerated pace, which she had been steadily working on for several years. 

Now  that I work at home, I put myself on a strict schedule. I start at 9am, and complete all the tasks that I can before 5:30pm, which is when the downtown office closes. I give myself two, fifteen minute coffee breaks (going to the bathroom doesn't count as a break, LOL), and one hour for lunch, just like I had at the downtown office. The rest of the time, I am at my computer working. This compares very favorably to my previous schedule, but involved me waking up at 6am to shower and dress in the morning, and me showing up exhausted at home around 8 o'clock at night. Now I just waltz into my workspace in my house clothes, unless I'm doing face-time with coworkers or the boss, where in which case I will dress more respectfully.

All this sounds really convenient, but right away, my wife seems to think that the fact that I'm home means that I am on vacation and have endless free time on my hands. She will constantly interrupt me and want me to take walks with her, our child, and our dog (I forgot to mention we have a pug). I tell her, why not wait until 10:30am when I have a break? Or that, since I'm taking my break early, I can't take another one when she interrupts me yet again later. Or I tell her that I am in the middle of something, but she thinks I am just being mean. I certainly spend my lunch hour with her and my child, but oftentimes my wife will assume that I can just blow off work because I ""just work in front of a computer anyway"" and that I can just ""catch up with work later,"" as if my job is so easy.

I know she means well but she seems to believe that my work is easy or not a real job (even though it pays for the roof, lights, food, and everything else) and that I can just ""phone it in"" and no one will notice. She has actually barged into my office with the kid asking us to go out shopping when I was on a tele-meeting with my boss. And although my boss has met her before and is friendly, and gave all the polite niceties to an employee's spouse, after she left, I could tell he was annoyed. Since then I've taken to locking the door during my meetings and telling my wife ahead of time when it was important for her to help our child be less fussy during those times, sure enough, whenever I have a meeting my wife or my daughter will be banging on the door asking for me to come out and play.

I love my wife and I know she thinks she isn't being disrespectful or bad, but any advice on how to deal with this situation? Honestly the home office has saved a lot of stress, but the constant interruptions are stressful too, to the point where I'm starting to fall behind! Advice is appreciated.

"I [24F] work my butt off to achieve what I want in life and feel like I’m coming up short. My husband [27M] seems to get through life with nothing but luck and a good poker face and it is making me bitter and jealous and I hate it.


Charlie and I have been together for six years. I don’t want anything here to come across as me not loving my husband. I do love my husband, very, very much. And thats why I think I’m getting so torn up about this, because there are *still* moments I want to scream at him over it.

I guess I’m a “planner”. When I have a goal in life, I study what I need to achieve that goal, prepare resources, designate milestones, and I work *hard* to get there.

I don’t always achieve everything I set out for, but I *always* know I earned what I achieve through hard work and perserverence.

Then there is my husband. He is not a “planner” by any stretch of the imagination. His whole philosophy on life sometimes seems to be “fuck it.” He takes dumb risks with little chance for a good outcome, but somehow....*it always works out for him!!*

I hate the attitude that is coming across in this post because I *should* be happy for my husband when he succeeds in life, I *want* to be happy for him, but when everything goes his way I find myself thinking “I work my butt off and still come up short sometimes.......he just *shows up* and does his Charlie-thing and suddenly he’s the King of Good Luck and Fortune?!?”

I guess I’ll have to give more concrete examples for the above to make any sense, though, so here ya go....

I have known what I wanted to be when I grow up since I was 12. By the time I was in high school I was already doing everything I possibly could to prepare for that career. I got the grades, I studied hard, I took the right classes and sacrificed time and energy to practice, practice, practice. I eventually got into the best training program in my area for that career, stayed up late, worked through the night and graduated after a long, grueling process. And I’m still looked on as a rookie these days who has to work under a mentor to make sure nothing gets messed up. And that’s fine, I get it.

Then there is Charlie....

Charlie, who joined the Army because he thought the humvees were cool. Charlie who’s idea of prepping for a post-military career was watching the Speed Channel and showing up to job fairs just for the free food. Charlie, who can’t seem to focus on a single goal for longer than it takes to clean his motorcycle. As the time for him to get out of the Army got closer I was constantly reminding him that *maybe* he should put together a resume, or actually spend a second or two looking at that linkedin profile the Army forced him to create. He constantly brushed it off.

In an effort to help like a good wife, I basically asked him to give me the cliff-notes version of his job and I put together a very nice, professional lokking resume for him. I suppose I was kind of hoping it would inspire him to take life a little more seriously and drop the “whatever happens, happens” attitude.

But that didn’t happen. He randomly texted me one day that he saw a job that looked “cool” and filled out their online application. I did my best to be supportive. Congratulations on filling out an application, I guess? When he told me what the job was I almost giggled. It was a supervisory position at a big business in an industry he had never worked in. I just kinda told him “Well good luck babe, don’t get discouraged if this one doesn’t work out.”

Four hours later they responded to his application and asked for a resume. Fucking *minutes* later he got a call from someone wanting to set up a phone interview.

As he told me all this I asked him what the hell he had sent in, because it *couldn’t* have been his own damn resume. He explained he made a few “changes” before sending it up. 

When I looked at it......I guess nothing was an out-and-out lie, but everything was very heavily exaggerated. Being a supervisor to a couple other soldiers meant he was “the head of a major office”. Attending a month long course that basically everyone in the Army goes to was made out to be “graduating from a highly selective military leadership academy”

And aside from all that, he’s never worked in this industry. *I* know as much as he does about that industry. I asked what his plan was for when they actually have him start that stupid job, and his answer was “Eh, I’ll figure something out.”

I braced myself for the inevitable crash and burn. It never happened. He did everything wrong and he got *promoted*!! I asked him a couple months in how he was possibly getting by at work, and he told me he just kinda pretends he knows what he is talking about. He. Got. Promoted. 

He’s making almost three times what I do.

I don’t want to go tit-for-tat.....but........I fucking struggled and sacrificed and *made* myself an expert on my craft. I still fight for raises of a couple dollars an hour and have to get my work checked by a mentor before I can declare it done.

He fucking filled out an application because he was bored on his lunch break without knowing anything at all about what he was doing, now he’s the fucking boss and getting money hurled at him?!? WTF!?!?

As you can probably tell, I am maybe feeling a bit of bitterness over the whole situation. When I see him get to upgrade his car because of a job he did *nothing* to earn, I get pretty jealous.

And it sucks, because he *is* still my sweet, lovable-idiot husband. He is my best friend and I love him more than anyone else in this world. I don’t like feeling bitter towards him.

But I also can’t help but look at him going to work sometimes and thinking I did everything “right”, he did everything “wrong”, *why does he still get to win?!?*

Can someone please help me figure out how to release these bitter feelings without ruining my relationship? How can I feel better?

***TL;DR*** I worked hard and poured my blood, sweat, and tears into getting my job, and I’m basically bottom of the pole still. My husband just tripped and fell onto the escalator of success. I’m bitter and jealous and I dont want to be.

"I [27, F] don't like my husband [28, M] anymore.


We had a pretty quick romance. We got pregnant very early in our relationship and were so in love that it was an exciting surprise rather than a devastating one. That was four years ago-we now have a three year old. 

There are many issues in our relationship that we have been working very hard on although it honestly seems that I am the only one working. We are terrible at communicating. I feel that every conversation we have turns into a gas-lighting mess. 

But all of that aside; I have realized that it comes down to just not liking him as a person. We used to be best friends. But if we met as who we are now, I wouldn't want to be friends with him. He acts as if our daughter and I are a job he doesn't want to show up to. Any family outing ""isn't something he wants to be doing"" and he ruins it for everyone. The way he is as a dad turns me off to him as a partner. Even as a partner he is unavailable and uninterested. He makes me feel silly for being happy day to day. When I bring up any of this, he has some way of turning it all on me and not taking responsibility for anything. 

The thing is, I have tried to talk to him about the potential of depression, for wanting out, asking what I can do, everything. But I'm at the end of my lead. It's at the point where it doesn't make me sad anymore. 
I'm just exhausted and quite frankly, annoyed. We make each other worse people rather than better. Is this just marriage stuff that you have to work through? Growing pains? I don't know. I'm just a little lost. 

**TL;DR** I feel at my breaking point with my husband who I've realized I just plain don't like. He isn't an involved partner or father and refuses to acknowledge or change any of it without saying it's all my fault. "
"I [24F] just found out my ex [32M] cheated on me by way of STI results. I need to tell my boyfriend [25M].


I had always suspected that Andy cheated on me but could never prove it. I had gotten cryptic messages from his female friend saying they’d been hooking up, but Andy swore up and down they hadn’t — he let me read their texts, and cut off contact with her, saying she’d always liked him and had always been “crazy.” He said he loved me and would never cheat, and even though he’d cheated on his last girlfriend to be with me, I stupidly believed him.

That was early 2017. He and I broke up that spring — the inability to trust him just one major facet of our dysfunctional relationship. We had dated a year.

About six months later, I met my current boyfriend, Jeff. He’s the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. Kind, gentle, intelligent, passionate, deeply empathetic and caring. He’s the absolute sun and I’ve never been more in love, never had a healthier, more loving, more fulfilling relationship.

I went for my annual OBGYN checkup this month and found out that I have chlamydia, and I was shocked. Jeff definitely didn’t give it to me, as he hadn’t had a partner in 2 years, and had never had unprotected sex. My doctor and I did the math and deduced I got it sometime after January 2017, when I had taken a big antibiotic that would’ve killed anything existing before that. 

Of course, that lines up perfectly with when Andy would have been fooling around with that girl. 

I don’t care about Andy. I knew he was a bad dude; if anything, I just feel relieved that I was right, that I’m not crazy — I knew he cheated on me and now I can prove it.

But I feel terrible. I know it’s not logical, but I feel tainted and dirty. I feel ashamed. I am dreading telling Jeff, who has never even had unprotected sex before me, who has only had a handful of partners and is a bit conservative about sex, that he and I will need to take an antibiotic because of this.

I know it’s not my fault that Andy is a cheater and a liar, but it is my fault I told Jeff we could have unprotected sex. I had gotten a screening after Andy, in August, where I assumed they’d tested for everything, but it turns out the screening was only for viral infections so the chlamydia presumably went unnoticed. I know it’s a quick fix — I’m lucky it’s “just” chlamydia—but I’m so upset.

How do I tell Jeff? Am I going to lose the best relationship I’ve had because of what my ex did? Do I tell Andy (the guidelines for my state are to tell any partner from the past 90 days; Andy and I haven’t had sex in nearly a year.) 

**TLDR**: found out my ex gave me chlamydia near the end of our relationship because he cheated on me. I had gotten regular OBGYN appointments since, but evidently not the kind that test for bacterial infections like this. It’s likely that my new boyfriend has it too and I’m worried I will lose him over what my ex did."
"My (28) girlfriend (30f) overworks herself doing chores and has meltdowns when she gets overwhelmed


This is gonna be quick because I’m venting just before work. My girlfriend is an awesome, kind person who supports me and loves me and she’s great, I like her a lot. But recently we moved in together and I’ve noticed a pattern with her and it’s really starting to bother me.

Basically she goes above and beyond to do stuff for me, ends up stressing herself out, then gets upset with me. She has a stressful job that she doesn’t like, and that adds to it. I get home after her, and by then, she’s already cleaned and made dinner and walked the dog and done any other stuff that needed to be done, without talking to me. Then we’ll watch tv and I’ll think everything is fine, then suddenly it’s midnight and she’s doing the laundry she didn’t do because she did all that stuff for me, and she’s furious and angry and making mistakes and getting angrier because she’s so stressed out. And I’m stressing out because she’s stressed out.

Like, I’d be happy to clean and make dinner, especially if she had other stuff she needs to do, but I can’t do it if it’s already done. She’s told me that she gets really stressed if there’s things that need to be done that aren’t done, whereas I’ll wait to do stuff when it’s convenient (and not immediately after work). She has a work ethic that I can’t match, and that I honestly think is unhealthy. I should add that a lot of the tasks that she gives herself are things I can’t actually help with and don’t know that she needs done, like organizing her closet or hand washing her delicate clothes. 

I want to convey to her that I appreciate all the stuff she does for me but I’d rather that she does less, and is less stressed and angry.

TL;DR My girlfriend stresses herself out doing chores and stuff for me and it’s stressing me out."
"I (22F) think my boyfriend (27M) for almost a year acts creepy about kids sometimes. Help me figure out what's going on, can't tell if I'm crazy.


Here are the things that have struck me as inappropriate or creepy

1) Before we met he was dating a girl who was in high school. He'd told me she was 18. Later I saw her on his fb and clicked her profile. I saw she's still in high school now as a junior. So she was a freshman or sophomore when they were dating? I asked him and he said he didn't know. He acted like it was the first time he knew that. Either she lied about her age or he lied to me about it...

2) He said he wouldn't date anyone older than me. What about when I get older? it's not like I'm gonna be 22 forever. He said, ""well the actual age isn't that important it's more that you look young"" Idk this just felt kind of weird to me. I'm also worried now that I'm going to be too old for him eventually.

3) He always tries to talk to kids in public like mainly pre teen girls. But he also will randomly compliment preteen-teenage girls on what they're wearing or how pretty they are... this makes me feel really insecure. Parents give him weird looks. I've seen the girls are uncomfortable.

4) He takes random babysitting jobs off craigslist. This wouldn't be an issue in itself if not for all the other things. I recently realized there's always at least one girl wherever he babysits, I don't think he's ever looked after only boys. 

5) A few months ago he kept wanting to know when I'd started masturbating. I told him sometime in high school (honestly don't really remember more specific) He kept asking if I was sure I hadn't ever tried it before then? I was like no? To be clear he didn't mean like when I was 13 or something he meant when I was an actual child, before puberty started...I don't know why he was so fixated on this, no one masturbates before puberty. Even if they did wouldn't that be a weird thing to want to talk about? It was like he didn't believe me that I hadn't started doing it earlier. I remember one time he started telling me about how ""even 5 year old's can have orgasms""?? it was so uncomfortable to me.

6) He's got some girls on his fb, Instagram and Snap chat who I don't know who they are. They all look VERY young, some even say they're 13-14. Some kids lie about that to get past the terms of use and are actually even younger so who knows. Most of these girls post very suggestive selfies where you can tell they're trying to imitate how adults dress and act to look sexy. The whole thing makes me extremely uncomfortable. He says they're just friends and there's nothing going on between them.

How normal is this? It feels really off to me. I'm confused because we have a good amount of sex and he's clearly into me, so I don't know if I'm just imagining that he's into underage girls.

tl;dr: am I misunderstanding to be creeped out by some of the things my boyfriend does about kids?"
"My Cousin (29M) Added His Girlfriend (25F) Of 4 Months To His Current, Savings and Credit Card Accounts....


My cousin has asked me to keep a secret for him which I don't think I can. He is 29 year old guy who earns about $150k a year finance, he is an only child and his dad died when he was 1 so it's just been him and his mom. He doesn't have many friends. I am 30M.

A few months ago we all went to a house party and there was a beautiful girl there. Since that night she's all he has spoken about. He was hooked. We'd never seen him like that. A few weeks in he complained that she never pays for anything. But eventually he just accepted it. I do not know WHAT this girl did. He said the sex was good and i don't think he has had a girl as fine as her before but he was CLEARLY in love/lust with her. He is sure this is his one true love, this is it for him. He said apparently she was the best sex, best everything. She told him she's madly in love with him.

This all happened in 4 months

WELL

WELL

WELL

Today he was speaking to me and told me not to judge him but as a sign of his 'commitment' to her he added her on to:

1. His bank account (to make it joint) where his wages go every month (so that's now joint and no she's not adding anything to it)

2. As an additional holder on his credit card account

3. HE MADE HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT JOINT!!!! WHICH HAS HIS 200K SAVINGS FROM THE PROCEED OF HIS RECENT HOUSE SALE AND INHERITANCE. HIS LIFE SAVINGS.

I said did he ask or tell anyone before doing this. He said no, he really cares for her and he wanted to show her he was committed and she suggested a joint account. So he added her to all 3 as all are held by the same bank.

Apparently they went in together yesterday and signed a heap of forms. For the bank accounts it became joint for the credit card it's an 'additional holder. 

He said he will marry her anyway and trusts her so why not and if she needs to buy anything she will have his cards.

It's been 4 months....

I did ask why also the savings. 

He said 'oh i just thought i'd do all of them'.

**EVEN WORSE. HE HAS TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS MOTHER 'WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND'.**

I don't think I can keep this to myself as this seems like it's just such bad, bad, bad news. He would have never done such. I do not know how this girl has convinced him to do this. He had 3 girlfriends before this. I do not get why he is doing this so soon for this new girl. 

**WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS?!?!**

**SURELY IF SHE'S JOINT ON THE ACCOUNT SHE CAN RUN OFF WITH HIS MONEY.**

What can I do? Or do I just keep this all secret and say nothing? It doesn't fell right. I want to tell our family but I don't want to betray him. This just all feels wrong. 

TLDR: Cousin wants me to keep financial details of new relationship secret from family. I do not think I can. I believe this situation is a danger. I do not want to invade his privacy but I want to tell our family and betray his trust."
"My [37F] husband [36M] is obsessed with moving us into a ""Tiny-Home"" but I cannot handle tightly enclosed spaces: He wants to do it anyway.


We've been wanting to buy our own plot of land for almost 8 years, we came close about 3 years ago but then a serious financial setback happened *(I lost my job, we basically used our savings to live off of until I could find a new one.)* Now that we've rebuilt our credit and have a savings again, we've begun looking for some land to buy and build on. Obviously, building a livable structure takes time and money, trust me I get it; I grew up in-and-out of a house that my parents seemed to be constantly working on (*I even learned the basics of sheet-rock and spackle when I was 12 years old.)* 

But he's completely fixated on this idea of us temporarily living inside of what feels to me like a prison cell with nicer furniture, and I've told him many times in the past that tight spaces and lack of privacy make me anxious and depressed but he keeps bringing it up every time these plans come up in conversation. My new job allows me to work from home, right now I have an entire room that is basically my office and he seriously thinks that the two of us can actually live in a space only slightly larger than that: ABSOLUTELY NOT! Look, I get why these things have become popular with some people who see appeal in simplifying their lives, but I'm just not one of those people and after having been together for 11 years he should really know that by now!

""If we want to do this then we need to make certain sacrifices"" he says, but does that mean that stuffing me into a fancy/trendy/well decorated box is REALLY the only option? Because if he really feels that way then I think that that shows a profound lack of imagination on his part. I can manage living in something like a double-wide mobile home until a real house is finished *(or just living in the double-wide if it's in good condition,)* but I need to be able to walk around and breathe or I will go insane. ""It's only temporary!"" He says, but what if something goes wrong with the house plans and we're set back a few months? As I said earlier, those things look and feel like fancy prison cells to me and I will lose my mind cooped up in there *(furthermore, I'd rather die than go to prison.)*

   
   
I honestly don't see our marriage coming to an end over this issue, but the next time he brings it up *(and I know that he will, it's just a matter of time)* I'm sorely tempted to tell him that if he really wants to live in a Tiny-Home so badly that he'll be doing it by himself. Seriously, I'm fucking DONE with this obsession of his but he won't let up and I'm done repeating myself.  
   
**TL,DR: My husband insists that we absolutely have to live in one of those trendy ""Tiny-Homes"" until our (someday) permanent house is finished being built, but I cannot do confined spaces that small for my own sanity and well-being. He refuses to consider other alternatives and I'm tired of explaining myself. HELP.**"
"I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving


Dont know how to explain all of this, basically was snooping around last night when i saw her phone ticket off, it was a message from her friends about the party. I stayed up like one of those stalkers you seen on tv and been checking the computer, fb messages with her friends and found iut she cheated during her bachelorette party. By cheating i dont mean getting a strip tease or something (which i would be ok with, i understand its a bachelorette party) but she actually gave a stripper a blowjob and ended up going home with ANOTHER guy that night.

She has this other guy added on facebook but the chat merely consists of a ""had a good time and it was nice to meet you convo, which dates back to the bachelorette party. i have however read the messages between her and her friends, they have a small group, found out what shed done there.

it all seems as if it was a one time thing that happened then but im a fucking mess. i havent slept all night and she is headed for work in an hour or so when she wakes up (its almost 6 am here). I dont know what the fuck to do, we are supposedly getting married in 3 weeks.

I am thinking of simple packing all my bags after she is going to work and just leaving the flat, its her familys flat anyway, we were planning on buying a fucking house, having kids, grow old. i feel i want to throw all of that out the window. i am sitting here smelling like alcohol, feeling drunk and depressed. i dont know why but im more of a angry depressed than sad depressed, i havent criend since i found out about all of this.

should i confront her? should i just get out? should i hear her side of the story? honestly i want to just go and stomp her fucking face in right now but i dont wanna do something rational.

please help!

sorry for the typos, im typing from my ipad and am not in a good place in my head right now (also, i am european, not english)

TL;DR just found out wife cheated during bachelorette party and dont know what the fuck to do. she going to wake up soon"
"The way my boss [40’s F] talks to the delivery guy [25ishM] who comes into our office makes me [22F] want to throw a stapler at her head. (Reposted because I accidentally broke a rule)


I started working as a receptionist at a law office about three months ago. My direct boss is the office manager, Janelle. Janelle has always come across as kind of coldly professional, but not mean to me.

But its like she is a whole other person to the delivery guy. We ship enough junk that we are a dedicated stop on his route, and of course, I’m the one he usually talks to. He has always seemed like a really nice guy to me. He’s always super polite, generally on time, asks how my day is, and I’ve never known him to have any trouble with getting his job done. And he’s gotten in the habit of dropping me off a starbucks when he comes in, which is unexpected but very,  very welcome.

But whenever Janelle has to talk to him its like she’s talking to some peasant. Just some examples of what I mean:

-First week I worked there, it was raining outside. Janelle was at my desk and we both watched him try to shake off the water as best he could before he came in, but of course he was still a little wet when he came inside. I was about to make some joke about the weather, but was cut off by Janelle angrily shouting at him “Can you *please* not drip water all over the office?!?” Deliverybro and I just both kind of looked at her, since he was only barely stepping inside and.....what the fuck is he supposed to do? He’s carrying a bunch of boxes in the rain. I figured she was having a bad day or something and when she walked a way I quietly told him I was sorry for her talking to him like that. He said it was fine and she has always been like that with him.

-A few weeks after that. Deliverybro is supposed to be here at 8. One particular day he gets in at like 8:04. He came up, started picking up what we had for him, then all of a sudden Janelle comes stomping down the hallway yelling “You’re *late*!” Deliverybro apologized and tried to explain that his last stop had run a little longer than normal. Janelle cut him off and told him that late is late and she was going to call his company to complain. This is literally the only time he has been late since I started working here.

-Just a couple days ago. Deliverybro was in doing his usual pickup. Janelle called my desk and told me to ask him to wait so she could bring him some other package. He waited and chatted with me. And waited. And waited. At twenty minutes he was telling me he really had to be moving on with his run, so I went to find Janelle. She was at her desk, typing an email. I asked her if she had something she wanted me to take up, but she told me that she would bring it herself. I told her that deliverybro had to get going, she told me she had to answer her email right then and “he can wait.” I told deliverybro she wasn’t ready yet as apologetically as I could, and he told me he was sorry but he had to roll. Janelle then put in another complaint to his company because he didn’t wait on her.

Thats not every instance, but it is the big ones. For some reason Janelle just does not like the guy and is just mean to him and I don’t understand why. I always get secondhand shame when he comes in and gets berated and talked down to by her while he is being so nice to me (and to her if she’d ever pay attention.)

I don’t really understand what is going on here, but I’d like to at least make the guy feel a little better when he comes in. Help?


**TL;DR** Delivery guy who comes in my office is super nice and polite. My boss is mean to him and it upsets me. Anything I can do?"
"I [25f] won the lottery. When do I tell my boyfriend [27m]?


Hi everyone. You're the first people I'm telling this to, so I'm a bit nervous. A few details have changed/throwaway used because obviously I don't want anyone to find out who I am.

So I won the lottery. A pretty life changing amount. I won't say how much but it's in the millions. It happened a couple months back now and everything's come through and I haven't touched any of it yet, bar paying off my credit card and an ASOS shop. I'm a bit scared to spend it if I'm honest!

I plan to buy my mum a house, buy my brother a house, set them up for life, but I know my mum can't keep a secret to save her life and if she suddenly retires and becomes a full-time jet-setter, people are going to clock on. I'm going to tell her, but I don't know how or when.

I want to buy myself a house too, but I'm on an average salary and house prices are ridiculous where I live. People will know if I randomly can afford a house.

Also my boyfriend, let's call him Ryan. We've been together over a year now, and I love him to pieces. He's amazing, so kind and we're so happy. I can see myself being with him forever. But I'm not stupid, it's only been a year. I don't know if I should be honest and tell him about the money? Is it disloyal to hide it? Or am I naive to tell him? I'm really nervous that it would change our dynamic, because he earns more than me and we tend to split costs proportionately.

Should I hide this? It feels stupid to have all this money just sitting in a bank collecting dust, when I could be upgrading our holiday flights to first class when we go away in a few months, and buying a new car that isn't a heap of shit, and working 50 hours weeks stressing myself out. But I see all this stuff about lottery winners losing all their friends and going mad and bankrupt or worse. I've got financial advisors but they're not great on the relationship aspect.

TL;DR : Won lotto, do I tell family and boyfriend and risk changing our relationships, or hide it and let it sit in a bank collecting dust?"
"My homophobic mother calls my girlfriend 'it'. Is NC excessive?


I (20) came out to my mother (50) two and a half years ago. We were a very, VERY religious household, and u I spent my childhood and adolescence feeling such deep shame for being gay, and tried obsessively to 'cure' myself for it (I don't remember if I did it, but I at least thought about tying a rubber band on my wrist and flicking myself with it if I felt attracted to a girl/had gay thoughts). Before I came out, my mother and dad expressed their disappointment that gay sex was decriminalised. Hardly a day would go by without them saying 'yuck' when they saw an LGBTI person or doing something similarly homophobic. A lot was subtle (changing the program because it was 'too gay'), but some was explicit.

Anyway, when I finally came out to my parents they said I'd betrayed them, lied to them, etc. In their mind my lying was gratuitous, not self-preservation. We've never spoken about it much and it's been a bit of an elephant in the room. However, my sister (16) has kept me updated with what my parents were saying. Firstly, they outed me to everyone in my family (despite knowing that some weren't necessarily averse to the death penalty for gaydom). Secondly, they said they would not permit me to have unsupervised contact with my sister because I was a 'corrupting' influence. To add insult to injury, they even told her that she was not allowed to drink from anything I had drunk from. 

After some months, I finally saw my parents in person with my new girlfriend (now 21). We visit every now and then, and my girlfriend is always polite and respectful. My mum is upset I don't visit her more, but despite me asking them if they would like to come for dinner *more than once*, they have refused. I have lived in the same apartment for years, but they have avoided it like the plague. They even gave my Christmas presents to my workplace - a few hundred metres from where I live! 

And so that brings me to my current situation.

In unsupervised conversation with my sister, she revealed that the reason that they haven't visited is because it would put them in spiritual danger - whatever, but at least I know for sure that it's a conscientious objection and not just because there's some resolvable tension. As long as me and my girlfriend are there, they don't want to be in our apartment. More shockingly, I found out what they've been calling my girlfriend - IT. That's right my pals, not she, he, they, her name......but IT. They've even ""corrected"" themselves from 'she' to 'it'. That's crossing a line. It's not necessarily the two-letter dehumanisation that even bothers me the most - it's their willingness to consciously dehumanise my partner that infuriates me. For people who talk so much about God's love, they seem to possess very little of it.

I want to make it clear that I had hoped for a relationship with my mother. I have gone out of my way to contact her, I have told her about my life despite her only ever asking about my health, I have been civil and polite in all of our encounters since my coming out. I have tried to overlook the pain her homophobia (and unchecked mental health problems, but that's another story) caused, tried to excuse it, minimise it, confront it in a constructive way...but I don't see how I can let a woman in my life who intentionally dehumanises me and my partner. She doesn't do it to our faces, but the knowledge that she would do it at all is enough. Idgaf that she was nice in person if she was hiding that.  I don't want to hear an apology any more. I want genuine change, and she is clearly willing to put in effort to *not* change. I really can't keep up this relationship, as pleasant and superficial as it has been. I have never recovered from the internalised homophobia, and I have needed therapy to help me overcome it. I have been exhausted by her bigotry over the years, but this insult is too much. I have spent time and energy hoping that she would come around, but I have lost hope for that now. I can't keep wasting my love and energy on someone who views me and my partner so lowly. 

I'm now in the process of writing a letter in which I lay it all out to my mother and tell her that our relationship is conditional on her changing. I need to love myself and set strict boundaries, but I still love my mother and don't want to hurt her. Going NC with her is the only way forward that I can see, but I don't want to make a truly big mistake. I feel like I'm overreacting, but my mind says it's time to let her go. Am I doing the right thing? 

**TL;DR** My mother's vile homophobia has culminated in her calling my girlfriend 'it'. An apology is no longer enough, only genuine change is. I'm afraid that by going NC I'm overreacting, but my mind says it's reasonable, and I can't keep damaging myself for someone who is that horrible. Should I go ahead and send my letter of NC?"
"My (M26) best friend (M26) of over 20 years just confessed his love to me.


Hello everyone  


Me and J are best friends. There's no doubt about it. We met each other in kindergarten at five years old and have been friends ever since. We see each other a couple of times a week to play sports, hang out or go out for beers. We've been there for each other through both good and bad times. My girlfriend jokingly says that when we got together, she knew it was a half-half-deal, where my time was split between her and him. And it's not untrue - we're really, really, good friends. He's also pretty much my only friend. I have a few friends from college, but I don't see them very often.

So it only seemed logical that he asked me to be his best man at his upcoming wedding. J has been with his fiance for five or six years, and she is THE girl for him. She compliments him perfectly. I like her a lot and can see how she brings out J's good sides. She's funny, intelligent and beautiful. I thought their relationship was happy and fruitful, at least I had no reason to believe otherwise and J is good at talking about things that bother him. They're getting married in august and both me and my girlfriend are pretty excited to go.

However, last weekend, I went out for beers with J. We started talking about the wedding and he confessed to me that he has his doubts about the marriage. I told him I believed it was perfectly normal to be anxious about such a big decision and not to be bothered by it. However, as we got more and more drunk, he ended up confessing to me that he loved me. I said: ""Hah, I love you too, man."" Because I really do, he's my oldest and best friend afterall. He then shook his head and said that he loved me in more than a ""bro way"". After a while it became clear that J not only fostered a friendly love for me, but was in love with me. I didn't know how to handle that, so I think I ended up hurting him a little by saying that ""Yeah, that can never happen."" He also tried to kiss me when we said goodbye, which was awkward.  


I'm not gay, and hell, I'm not even sure he is based on how he has handled women and his girlfriend previously. We haven't talked the entire week and I am worried if I bring it up, it will mess up his wedding. I also have no idea on how to bring it up with my own girlfriend, or if I even should. Should I mention this to his fiance? She's become quite a good friend to me, so I don't know if I can keep it secret with her.  


tl;dr: My best friend confessed that he was in love with me. I rejected him. He's getting married in august."
"Boyfriend [28M] doesn’t want me [25F] to post any pictures of us together as he’s not sure we’ll be together forever


I met my boyfriend on tinder about a year ago. We clicked and started seeing each other pretty often. After a few weeks he told me he wasn’t the relationship type but really liked me. We did have a relationship after a month but he broke it off. I won’t go into details but It was a really tough period of 6 months of back and forth with him repeatedly telling me he wanted me in his life but I wasn’t his girlfriend,. We could meet Thursday evenings but not weekends or couldn’t do these things cause they were too coupley etc. 

One day he really hurt my feelings on something so I just drew back. I met someone soon after and hit it off. He found out and something switched. Suddenly he was completely in the wrong the whole time. Sending me long messages on Snapchat, WhatsApp, messenger text. Telling me he loved me and was just too proud to admit it. That if we got back everything would be different, he’d give me all his weekends, do anything I wanted etc. He showed up to my work told me he couldn’t go to work, couldn’t eat or sleep etc. 


After two weeks of this I took him back. It was rocky at first and it was clear he wasn’t wanting to publicize anything about our relationship. I got over that and we’ve been mostly good. It’s now about a month and a half down the line and we just got back from a holiday together. We had a great time beach, pool, theme park, water park and everything. I want to put up one photo of us but he doesn’t want to as we still have small arguments (he referred to the argument we had today which was about uploading the photo). I feel this is really offensive as he has no problem with other people uploading pictures with him, has many photos with other people on Facebook. 


I backed down on having the Facebook relationship that he had promised me when we got back together and have still only met one of his friends once (just because he lives with him and he happened to be coming in the door the same time). He made so many promises if we got back together, like he wanted to take me to meet his parents that weekend, which obviously has not happened. He’s now so flippant and if I tell him I love him he will just jokingly tell me to shut up same thing if I compliment him. He doesn’t really say anything nice to me unprompted. I feel like the arguments are stemming from him being cold to me and I feel like I’m being hidden away when in the past boyfriends have wanted to introduce me to people, jumped at sharing holiday pics etc.


Am I being too dramatic? I really want this to work cause when we are together it’s so easy most of the time and we do have a lot of fun. 

TL;DR Rocky past with boyfriend, he begged for me back and promised to be all in . Now hasn’t really introduced me to anyone and doesn’t want me to post any pics or relationship status on Facebook.

"Friend [19F] keeps mentioning I [19M] am likely to cheat. She said it around my GF [23F], I got angry and now I’m worried about what’s on GF’s mind


I’ve been friends with this girl for about two years. I can tell she likes me but I don’t feel the same way. Maybe that’s what’s been fueling her recent behavior but I’m not sure.

It started when we were hanging out after a lecture and she said from nowhere “I feel sorry for whoever’s going to marry you” and when I asked why she said “it’s literally written over your face”. 

I don’t want to brag but I’m good looking to the point where girls (and guys sometimes) constantly stare and flirt and get nervous around me. 

I laughed and she said “it’ll get worse as you get older because you’ll have money too and I can’t see you being faithful at all.”

I brushed this off but over the next two weeks she kept bringing it up when we were with our friend group. “Oh I don’t think OP is into monogamy” when we were all discussing marriage and LTRs and “OP could  have 6 girlfriends and 6 mistresses if he REALLY wanted” when discussing how one of our friends was having trouble picking up girls. I didn’t say anything since she’s goofy and seemed to be playing around but I was getting a bit annoyed. 

So yesterday my GF, friend and I were hanging at my place and I cooked and it was terrible and we were making fun of me when I sensed the direction Friend was taking the conversation and I tried to shut her up. She was saying to my GF “If you ever get married, this’ll be the least of your problems because OP is very likely to ch...”

I made a noise to quieten her but GF had heard and laughed but seemed confused too. It looked bad because it seemed like I discuss cheating with my friends or that I’ve already cheated on her. Things just seemed a little awkward. Friend sensed that she’d maybe fucked up and left not long after. GF left at almost the same time saying she had to go to her parents to get something and when I asked if I could accompany her she said she really had to rush and she left.

I confronted my friend over phone and I kinda lost my temper, nothing over the top but something I still shouldn’t have done. She started crying and I feel bad. How do I apologize to her? And although my GF is talking to me something’s obviously off. She hasn’t kissed me today and is avoiding eye contact. How do I carefully bring this up with her and not fuck up?

Tl;dr  friend constantly brings up how I’m likely to cheat and it’s messed things up

"UPDATE: I (33F) feel like my BF (40M) is only staying with me because I’m good to him


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86gq3h/i_33f_feel_like_my_bf_40m_is_only_staying_with_me/?st=JJA1M6AF&amp;sh=eee76109


My first post wasn’t widely seen, but I wanted to update anyway. 


We broke up. And I’m so incredibly sad. 


I finally told him we needed to talk, and it went about as well as I could’ve expected. He pushed blame back onto me for some things, but for the most part, it was amicable. I gathered what little stuff I had at his place, and restocked his fridge with groceries (he was at work when I got my stuff). He texted me at 11:30pm and thanked me and said he’d set aside anything of mine he found, and get ahold of me. 


We left on good terms (at least I hope so in his mind), and as cliché as it is, I hope we can stay friends, even if only on a basic level. 


I’m sad, but know it was for the best. Cried last night, but doing okay today. It only gets better from here, right?


Single again at 33 is a shitty thought. 



Tl;dr: Broke up with my LTR boyfriend. Things were left on an okay note. Back to single life at 33. "
"I [25F] am discussing children with my fiancé [36M] - we’re fighting about our future roles. 4 years.


Currently, both of us work full time jobs. He earns over twice as much as I do, and he is in school for his second masters. Ever since we’ve been together, we’ve basically fallen into traditional gender roles. I would prefer that we shared more of the household / emotional burden, but since we don’t have kids and he has less free time than I do, it hasn’t bothered me too much up to this point. 

When it comes to kids, I’m finding out that we are disagreeing in many areas, and it’s got me concerned. For example, I mentioned that I wouldn’t want to start trying for kids until he was done with his masters and had more time to help out / be with his family. He stated that this was ridiculous and meant that I wasn’t a supportive partner. He said his mom would come and live with us for six months to help out. I said I do not want this. I don’t mind if she visits, but I would like us to be co-parents. 

To be honest, I’m kind of afraid that I will be shouldering all the kid work and he will just swoop in to be the fun dad. His best friend has this relationship. His friend travels 2 weeks out of every month, his mom lives at home, and his wife takes care of everything. More power to her, but I don’t want this. When my fiancé brought them up as an example, and brought up his coworker who has three kids, a new born and is getting a masters as an example, I said I was really happy for them. I told him I know life can throw punches and curve balls, but insomuch as I can choose when / under what circumstances I have a baby, I will. And what I want is a strong co-parent who is involved in the nitty gritty and doesn’t just enjoy the fun parts of kids. 

What I’m afraid is going to happen is that because he gets frustrated / irritated easily, because he doesn’t deal with a lack of sleep well, because he can’t stand messes, because he can’t stand loud noises, that the whole kid burden is going to be up to me. And then if I bring up that I want him to help more, he will bring over his mother. 

I’m extremely frustrated and I don’t know how to talk to my fiancé about this without him painting me as an unsupportive partner who doesn’t really want kids. Help?

TL;DR - I’m worried that my fiancé and I have fallen so much into traditional gender roles that I will have to shoulder the vast majority of the kid burden and the emotional labor that comes with it. When I try to say things like I want to wait until he finishes his masters, he says I’m not a supportive partner and points out all the people who have families under more stressful situations. I just want a good co-parent. We both work. How can I get through to him / talk to him about this? "
"My (26m) girlfriend (27f) of 1 year is moving into her first “solo” place. As a housewarming present I went to Lowe’s and got her a tool set. She freaked out and called me selfish and insensitive. Is that true or is she showing me an immature side?


Keep this short. My GF was living in a very crappy apartment with roommates. At least once a month something would go wrong, the complex management wouldn’t care so I’d bring my tools over and fix the problem. It was usually minor stuff like a leaky faucet but since she never had tools I always brought my own.

She got a really great promotion and is moving into her own apartment. It’s a much nicer complex but still i reasoned that having a good set of tools would be a really nice and practical thing to have. I went to Loews and isnread of getting one of those cheap pre assembled ones, I spent quite a lot and got her exactly what she’d need for minor repairs of all sorts.

I gave it to her and she flipped out. First she said it was a shitty gift and that housewarming presents are things like cheese trays, wine and “practical” things like small appliances or chef knife sets. I said it seemed Tools we’re incredibly practical and at the very least I wouldn’t have to lug my tools over if I wanted to fix something. She said that make me selfish and insensitive. She stormed away and locked her self in her new bedroom. I didn’t want all her boxes to get stolen so I unloaded my truck of all her stuff and left which took me like 1.5 hours and she never came out. I haven’t heard anything from her, good or bad so I assume she’s still mad.

Was I really being selfish and insensitive? I truly meant the tools as a nice gift that was super practical. Or did she just show me an insensitive side that I need to be aware of? 

**tl;dr: I got my girlfriend a tool set as a housewarming gift for her first solo apartment. She accused me of being selfish and insensitive. Is this true or is she showing me an immature side?**"
"I'm [26M] not sure how to get this tinder girl [22F] out of my apartment


I'll try to keep it brief. I downloaded tinder because with work and other activities I don't have much time to go out and meet new people. I matched with this girl in question and after a brief chat we decided to meet up for dinner and herb smoking my place. In retrospect, not the best idea to have someone you just met come to your home. 

Anyways, things went ok that night but I could tell she was waaaaaaaay less mature than me, which was a turn off. However, I don't have many other options and hung out with her a few more times. She sleeps over a few nights but goes back home in the morning, until one day she comes with 3 big bags from her mom's house. 

I'm kinda freaked, but she assures me shes only bringing so much to have options when we go out. One thing led to another and that was a week and a half ago and shes still here. I've made comments I like my space, but she doesn't seem to get the hint. This is especially annoying because she doesn't do anything, no job not going to school literally nothing, I am very with work gym and sports and I get worried leaving her in my apt someone I just met. 

She helps around the house and has done my dishes laundry and even cooked dinner, but I don't necessarily need her to do that for me. 

This weekend I need to go out of town and I told her I'd be gone for a few days so she should go home. When I woke up this morning she had not packed by the time I needed to go and she told me to just go and she'd wash my dishes and laundry and lock from the inside and leave later. I was skeptical but I said fine. Currently, I'm out of town but I'll be back in 3 days and shes already planning coming over then. I'm afraid she might not even leave at all and just leave an hour before I arrive and pretend she's been gone, or leave a bunch of stuff back to have an excuse to go back. 

How fucked am I? I don't want to be an asshole and kick her out because she's veeeeeeeeeeeeeery immature and I'm afraid she'll get petty and try to screw me somehow. She knows where I work and live. How can I get her out nicely?

**TL;DR:** Met tinder girl. She came over. She slept over. She slept over again and hasn't left. Tinder girl does nothing with her own life but smoke and chill. I need her out. How can I get her out without being the asshole?"
"I [25 F] just bought my first house. My boyfriend [28 M] wants to move in, but I think that would be moving too fast.


I was lucky enough to have parents who helped me financially during college, and I landed a great engineering job right after. I'm also really frugal, so I was able to buy a house just two months ago. Pretty much everyone I know is renting or living with their family, so my situation isn't the norm. 

I bought a 2 bedroom rowhouse in a fun urban area with lots to do. A lot of my friends have apartments close by. I love my house, and have been having a lot of fun making it my own, moreso than I could have done with an apartment.

I really like living alone. I was an only child, and the few times I lived with other people, during college, or during my summer jobs, I missed the quiet, tidyness, missed being able to be alone when I wanted, and have people over when I wanted. So I decided against renting my second bedroom out to a roommate. Rent on the second bedroom wouldn't bring in too much money anyway, the room is small. Plus, tenancy laws can get complicated, if a tenant wasn't working out, I've heard it can be a big legal battle to evict them. Not to mention if they damage the place.

----

My boyfriend of a year and a half, Jake, knew I was going to buy a house for a long time now. I'd been talking about it from the start. He also knew I wasn't ready to move in together. I told him I'd only want to move in with someone if we were thinking about making a life together. Ideally, I'd live with someone if we were talking about marriage, but before getting married.

Jake's lease on his current apartment is ending at the end of the summer, and he hasn't found a new place yet. I think he put off apartment hunting for too long, I always started looking much more in advance, when I was renting. He wants a nicer place than his current apartment, but all the places up to his standards are apparently out of his budget. I tried to help him by giving him references to old landlords of mine that I liked, and landlords my friends recommended, but he hasn't found any apartments he likes through them.

He asked me about moving in together, and I told him the same thing, that would be moving too fast for me, I don't want to room together based on convenience, I'd want to live together due to wanting to build a life together. 

He keeps asking though, talking about how it seems like every landlord in the area is a slumlord, even though I gave him a list of trustworthy landlords. And he talks about how all the places near enough to work are shitty old buildings, even though I know a lot of those buildings that look old on the outside are nicely renovated inside.

I feel like he's just dragging his feet on finding a place, hoping I'll let him move in when his lease on his apartment expires.

What do I do if he hasn't found a place to live when his lease expires? 

Am I wrong for wanting to live alone for now?

TLDR - My boyfriend wants to move into my house, but I want to live alone for now. I'm worried he's dragging his feet on finding a place to live before his lease expires, so he can move in with me."
"My wife [40F] insists on telling our son [8M] and everyone else that he is autistic, has ADHD, and other conditions despite the fact that multiple doctors have said that he has NONE of these things.


My wife and I have been married ten years. I am a computer programmer and during our son’s first years my wife was a stay at home mom. Now that our boy is in school she has a small Ebay business (to be honest it costs me more to help her run it than the profit she earns, but she likes it and it keeps her busy) where she sells homemade bracelets and scarves. Once a week she also hosts a book club meeting that features a lot of other women from the neighborhood who are around our age.

My wife reads a lot of articles and watched a lot of talk shows where the topics are mental conditions like autism and ADHD and aspergers and other things.

Our son is a totally average, typical kid who never showed any signs of conditions like autism or ADHD, but now my wife insists that he has not one, but BOTH. Over the months we’ve taken him to a slew of different doctors available through my employer’s insurance network, and every single one of them gave our child a battery of tests and a thorough examination, and pronounced him to have NONE of the conditions.

My wife insists that they’re all wrong and “they don’t know my child like I do.” She says there must be some conspiracy with my insurance and they don’t want to pay for treatment. 

She tells all our relatives and her book club girlfriends that our son is autistic and has ADHD. Our kid now knows exactly what those conditions are because my wife is “educating” him about them. He’s even started to exhibit certain behaviors around my wife, but when he’s alone with me, he’ll act like he did before he got “woke” to his condition.

Also at school it’s a huge mess because my wife insists to the teachers and administrators that our kid has the aforementioned conditions, and needs to have certain, educational accommodations generally unavailable to non-autistic or ADHD kids. They demand doctors’s documentation and when she cannot produce any they deny our son the services. She threatens the admin and finally they relent but have to put a bunch of asterisks on my son’s file to account for none of my wife’s claims are proven.

I keep telling my wife that five doctors who graduated from prestigious universities ought to know better than is if our kid has autism and whatnot, but my wife is of the attitude that she knows better.

I’m afraid for my son because we all know how kids are and they tease him for his alleged condition, since they all know about it after my wife blared it out to the world.

Why is she doing this? What do I do about it?

**tl;dr: my wife insists our son has autism and ADHD. Doctors say he doesn’t. My wife says she knows better than the doctors.**"
"My boyfriend [24 M] often wants my [23 F] help with his ""fun"" programming projects. I'm starting to get annoyed because it feels like work; I work as a software engineer.


Most of my interests are athletic stuff. (Hiking and camping, biking, martial arts, lifting, going out and dancing with my friends) I work as a software engineer so by the end of the day, I'm sick of looking at computers, I'm itching to get outside. I like what I do, but to be honest, I'm doing it for the money, it's not my passion.

My boyfriend is a Masters student, studying computer science. He thinks that what I do for work is really cool, and a lot of his hobbies, along with his studies, revolve around computers.

So, I listen to him talk about his pet projects, and he listens to me talk about my hobbies. But I've started to get annoyed how often he wants me to help him debug something, or help him with a programming project.

I started joking with him that I'd charge him an hourly rate for consultation, trying to bring up the fact that I was sick of doing free work so often. Because the stuff he thinks if as fun feels like work to me.

He got really annoyed about that joke, saying ""I wouldn't charge you for my time, if you wanted to take me camping or something!""

I tried to explain that it was just a joke, but I really had started to feel like working on his projects with him was like work to me, and not fun, or quality couple time. And if anyone else wanted me to debug their code or help them design something, I'd want to be paid. 

He was still upset that I basically didn't seem willing to engage in his hobbies anymore.

I don't know if I'm in the wrong to be fed up right now. My boyfriend took that ""consultation fee"" joke really personally.

TLDR - I joked that I'd charge my boyfriend a consultation fee, for helping him with his hobbyist programming projects. He took it really personally."
"My (19f) friend (18f) has insanely high dating standards and constantly complains to me how she can't get a boyfriend. I don't know what to tell her.


I should preface this post by saying that I believe that looks aren't everything and having some sort of standards when it comes to dating is a good thing. 

I'm friends with , but in the process of slowly phasing out because of a lot of different reasons, this girl Sarah (18f). 

Sarah is a very shallow person and about 40% of our conversations consist of her taking about guys, how she wants a boyfriend, etc. 

Sarah has been largely unsuccessful in dating (has gone on one date in the past few years)  and blames it on guys only wanting one thing (she's strictly a no sex before marriage Christian)

However I know this to not be the case. In truth, Sarah has SO many unrealistic  dating standards to the point where she's never going to find a guy to fit them. 

She's only interested in guys who look like literal models, are at least 6'0, have six packs, can't be into drinking or partying, etc. 

Sarah is objectively pretty physically average looking. And her personality doesn't make up for it either (she's pretty dull and not a very good person). 

She doesn't want to ""date down"" (as she calls it) and date someone under 6'0, or who doesn't look like Chris Hemsworth or young Rob Lowe. 

Sarah also views instagram as her main way of finding guys to date; she follows random attractive guys who are friends of other attractive guys she follows on the app  in hopes of finding someone to get into a relationship with. 

She gives out her Snapchat to all of her instagram followers and gets upset when guys from instagram ask her for nudes on Snapchat. 

I've tried telling her that maybe instagram isn't the way to go and that she should join clubs, bible studies, etc. instead because most guys who hit her up from instagram are probably only going to want to hook up. 

She responded by telling me that ""I'm just talking to the wrong guys and it's not like tinder""

I've tried telling her to pay more attention to guys' personalities because there are some really great guys out there, but she doesn't listen. 

Sarah went on like two dates with this guy she met off of instagram last August. After two dates, she was already talking to me about them dating and going up to visit me at college. It didn't work out and almost a year later, she still talks about the guy, who got into a relationship a couple of months after their dates. 

Sarah's shown me instagram pictures of this guy's new gf before and she was going on about how his gf is so ugly and fat (she wasn't...) and how he was only with that sl-- because she probably puts out.  

Another point of contempt  is that I am very successful in dating/hookups and have been involved with several guys, many of whom could be considered Sarah's type, since we've become friends. I put her on an information diet about my love life a while ago because she would always ask me about my love life, I'd be honest with her, and then she'd grow more frustrated (probably because I think she views herself as  much more attractive than I am) 

It's none of my business really, but I've heard her complain to me so much about not having a boyfriend that I'm sick and tired of it. I'm already trying to cut this girl from my life all together, but she keeps on texting me about either this or asking me how I'm doing. 

I'm pretty sure I'm Sarah's only friend and I don't know what I should say or do. 

TL;DR: My (19f) friend Sarah (18f) is essentially a nice girl who only wants to date guys who look like supermodels while she isn't objectively that attractive/has a good personality. She's largely unsuccessful in dating and vents/complains to me about not having a boyfriend. I've tried telling her to pay more attention to guys' personalities, but she doesn't listen. I don't know what to do.

"Marriage is failing after having a baby. No sex. Resentment. Loss of respect. [34m] [34f]


 I \[34m\] am in a failing marriage with my wife \[34f\], and am here to seek some kind of advice, support, or at a minimum, a place for me to get my thoughts together.

**This is the fact pattern:**\-We've been married for 5 years-Our first 3 years of marriage were great, and the years of dating before that couldn't have been better-I thought I had hit the lottery. I found her perfect in every way and she made me the happiest I had ever been-We both had good jobs (relevant for context below)-We had child 2 years go and that's where it went all downhill (as an aside, we were specifically trying for a child and love our child with all our hearts)-She had a good job, but was stressed out and ultimately hated it in time. She begged to be able to be a stay at home mom-A well-timed lucky promotion on my end right before our child was born allowed for that to happen-She's just never been even close to the same person since. She did suffer from post-partum depression and has been seeing a therapist regularly for about 18 months-She feels she gave up her career, body and sanity for the family-At the same time, she does NOT want to work again to avoid daycare and has become accustomed to being home and loves spending so much time with our kiddo-At the same time, my career has skyrocketed, and she is very resentful of it-The word ""divorce"" is now as common in her vocabulary as ""hello""

**Control**For context, she counts me going to my job as ""going out / getting alone time"" as I am not physically in the house. Again, she is a stay at home mom so I do get her mindset to an extent.

As such, I am forbidden from going ""out"" other than work, such as seeing friends. I am allowed to see my friends once per year now, and when I do, I still get a 1-2 hour long reprimanding when I get home. Last time I did, I lost track of time and got home 20 minutes after her stated curfew of 11pm (yes, I am on curfew). She said me missing the curfew shows lack of respect for her. I was sent to sleep on the couch that night.

Even when I unfortunately had to go to a funeral 6 months ago for the untimely passing of a 30-something friend, she was upset about me leaving her, and told me I needed to stay for 30 minutes and then come right home.

She goes out with her friends without me at least once per month. I encourage it, despite the double standard.

**Sex**Saying we have a bad sex life would be implying we have one at all. She has declared that she cannot be intimate with me due to her resentment of my job, her new role in the family and her mental changes. She had asked me for a ""full body"" massage a few weeks back (nice! I thought she was maybe in the mood!) where she was completely naked, and then got angry and grossed out that I became turned on during the massage, wondering ""why I can't just control that thing"".  What did you expect to happen!?

She has stated that she's ""asexual"" and is ok with never having sex again. She also things it's weird why I might want to have sex. This is the ""new her"" and I need to take it or leave it.

**Social Settings**

She has the unique ability to bring down an entire room of people. She's like ""Debbie Downer"" from SNL and she's aware of it. She has been extremely nasty and unwelcoming to my family in particular, as she believes they must be seeing our issues and are likely unfairly taking my side in their heads.

Her own family even gives her grief over how she treats me. That leads to her shutting them out for a period of time.

**Not Consistent**

All this said, she can have good days and weeks where she's otherwise normal (outside of no sex). These days sort of tend to wipe out all the bad for me, and make life more livable, until it happens again. The 10 days before her period and period do tend to be the worst of it....

We've tried therapy. I'm not sure therapists are supposed to take sides, but this one sort of implied I was right or at least did nothing wrong in every circumstance.  We are going to give that another go.

I know this is where I should say ""well, but I'm no angel"", but honestly, I consider myself a good husband (especially considering the circumstances) and a great father. I've said well look at our friends, family, etc. She said, you may be better husbands than them, but it's not about comparing us to others. I do get that, but I do at least like to see what a baseline looks like.

She has stated that the only reason she's still married to me is she wants to continue this lifestyle (we're very financially comfortable), and a secondary is our baby.

I'm at a loss.

**tl;dr - good marriage turned bad after having baby. No sex. Wife resents me as she gave up her career (by choice) and freely talks about divorce**"
"My (30F) husband (40M) of 5 years, we have a very stupid and gross bathroom problem


My husband poops on the back of the toilet seat. I don't even know how it's possible, but he does. Just a tiny little hint of a turd on the back of the seat.

Once when it was particularly egregious I sent hm a picture and asked him to please be more careful. He was, for a few days.

We're sharing a house with friends right now, and he's still doing it. I am so fucking disgusted and embarrassed. I need help figuring out the right words to say to him to communicate that (1) this can NEVER, EVER, EVER happen in public and also (2) it actually also shouldn't happen in our house either.

Help!!?!??!?!?!??!?

tl;dr: husband poops on toilet seat, asked him not to once, how do I ask him in a way that makes him never do it again!?"
"Dad’s (61M) wife (34F) was gifted a shirt at her baby shower that’s insulting to my late mother. I (23F) want her to believe that I’m not upset.


Kind of (very) complicated situation. Names changed except for my mom’s because it’s important to the story. 

My mother died 3 years ago. She had cancer for several years and we knew she was dying about 2 years before she did so Dad and I had time to prepare for it and grieve before it actually happened. 

Right around 2 years before she died, Mom met a woman (“Dallas”) who was a lot younger than her, but they hit it off right away. My parents had a lot of friends in their neighborhood and Dallas was included in that circle. Anyway, I’m not positive on all the details, but after my mom died my Dad and Dallas started dating. They were really quiet about it and asked me for my thoughts about it first... I love Dallas. She was there for my mom and she makes my Dad laugh so... ok.  I was ok with it. It was hard, but I like them together. 

Dallas being closer to my age than his was a little hard. But she’s really beautiful, she’s an amazing mom to her three kids from her first marriage, she’s a lot of fun. I get why my Dad fell in love with her and it’s ok. I’m happy he’s happy. 

Anyway, they got married and she got pregnant. It’s a girl and I’m so excited for my little sister. Dallas didn’t want a baby shower but I really wanted to plan one so I threw her a surprise shower for the 4th of July. 

Which is where everything went to shit. I invited friends of hers that I didn’t know well and I guess she hadn’t given some of them a lot of details because as a gift for the baby shower, one of her friends gave her a shirt to wear for the day that’s obviously a play on an old song, but it was also really horrible in context. 

It says:

“Omg Becky look at this bump”

My late mother’s name is Becky. 

Dallas cried when she saw it, she refused to wear it, she was obviously upset with the friend that bought it... it was awful. Her friend tried to insist that it was just for fun, no one was taking it in the way she thought... it was just a joke. She practically forced Dallas to take a picture wearing the shirt and she was devastated by the whole thing. She pulled me and my dad aside, apologizing profusely and saying she was so embarrassed because it felt like she was slapping my mother in the face. 

Honestly, I think my mom would be happy for my Dad and Dallas. I had a feeling when she introduced them that it was almost her giving her blessing for something that might happen later. 

But seeing that shirt hurt. A lot. For all of us. 

Still, I want Dallas to know that I’m not upset with HER. She’s absolutely mortified and i get why, but it’s not her fault. How can I make her feel better about it without making her even more uncomfortable?  She’s 7 months pregnant and I’m sure the stress of this isn’t good for my sister. 

TLDR- dad’s wife’s friend got her a shirt for her baby shower that says “omg Becky look at this bump.”  Mom’s name is Becky. She died two years ago. Dad’s wife is mortified, I want to make her feel better. "
"UPDATE: My partner [33M] doesn't have a lot of time for me [23F] at the moment. I am trying to be supportive but it's getting me down. How long to wait for improvement before giving it up as a lost cause?

Well, shit got real fast and in the worst way possible. On Thursday evening I got home from my bf's house feeling pretty bummed because he'd still had no time for me during my two days off, and it was hot weather so we didn't even cuddle and I was feeling touch-starved and miserable.

I then received a call from my mum saying that my grandad (89M) had had a catastrophic brain haemorrhage and was unconscious and never going to wake up. The doctors had turned off any life support and were just doing end-of-life care, as per my grandad's wishes. I promptly got in the car and hammered the 200-mile trip to get to the hospital to be with my family and say goodbye, after calling my boyfriend in tears. He had worriedly encouraged me to calm down and take the train as he didn't think I was in a state to drive, but I insisted on driving and got there safely very late, but I saw my grandad, who with characteristic stubbornness and toughness, survived until Sunday morning. We spent a lot of time at the hospital talking to him and stuff. I don't know if he could hear us but I hope so. He looked peaceful, like he was sleeping, except my grandad always used to talk in his sleep about his time in the Army.

My grandad was my best friend. We were incredibly close. He introduced me to jazz music and encouraged me to perform and chase my dreams. He was there to comfort me through any setbacks and problems, and he celebrated every success. I will miss him terribly. He had been declining recently and was starting to lose his independence which he hated and fought against (we are very alike this way), he was about to lose his driving licence and car after an accident, he was struggling terribly with his mobility and we had suggested he get carers in to help him which he furiously rejected. So as sad as I am, I am happy he got to stay independent until the very end. It would have been awful for him to go into a home also. As much as it sucks, he is at peace now and it was painless for him according to the doctors. It was probably the best case scenario other than him going in his sleep.

However I am of course grieving terribly. I was extremely close to him and spent as much time with him and my grandma (who passed away 9 years ago) as I did with my parents when I was growing up. Just writing this now I'm sobbing like a fool. When I text my boyfriend on Sunday morning to say that he had passed, he replied with one word: ""sorry"", and then ignored me for the rest of the day. The whole time I was at home with my family he didn't call me once. As stated in the OP, he's never much been one for a lot of texting and calling and he isn't verbally expressive about feelings at all as it ""makes him uncomfortable"", but if ever there was a time to get over himself and just step up and be there for me, this was it. And he failed me completely.

I returned home yesterday evening. There was nothing more I could do and my colleagues and managers had been great, saying I could take as much time as I needed but I knew they were busy and needed my support. My boyfriend text me asking me to make the 45 minute journey to his place to see him when he got home from work at 11.30pm, and then travel back to my place of work the next morning which would have taken an hour. I said no as I was completely exhausted mentally and physically and had spent 5 hours in a car in very hot weather and didn't want to travel more. I asked him to come to see me instead. He said no because he didn't have time. I felt so upset, hurt, abandoned and unloved and cried myself to sleep last night because of this on top of the horrible bereavement. At work my managers and colleagues were all brilliant and supportive. I am very lucky to work with such great people.

The same thing happened today. After everything I've been through these past few days and his complete and utter lack of support I don't feel like it is on me to make the effort to see him, to beg him to find time for me, to spend my time and money travelling to see him just to beg 20 minutes of conversation out of him before he goes to sleep. It's humiliating and hurtful. I feel so unwanted and unloved.

It is quite clear to me that this relationship is over and he clearly doesn't care for me or love me at all. My question now would be, how do I end it? I want to do it with dignity and pride and I don't want to be the person that dumps someone by text, but he doesn't have time to see me or even call, even at a time like this. I could just block his number and ghost, but that wouldn't give me any closure and I would feel worse. And I am better than that. What should I do?

I am heartbroken in every way. Not only do I have to deal with losing my grandad and best friend, but I also have to cope with breaking up with someone who until a month ago had been the perfect partner, with whom I'd imagined a future, and whom I do love very much. But he clearly doesn't love me, or else he would be here with me comforting me, or at least make me understand he was doing his best to see me ASAP, calling me and texting me to comfort me, doing his best to find a time. I feel like I don't matter and never did. I feel so lonely, so sad and so unloved. I don't deserve this.

**tl;dr: My grandad died and my boyfriend didn't text or call me for days and doesn't have time to see me. The relationship is over but how do I leave him with dignity and class when he won't call me or meet with me?** "
"Should I [24 F] tell a single mother I never met that her BF [28 M] is cheating on her?


I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Let me know if you need additional details.

Me \[24f\] and the guy \[28m\] dated for \~11 months in the U.S. He moved to China and has been there for 9 months. I am in China right now on business and he wanted to visit me before I leave (July 4).

He came to stay in my city at my hotel a few ays ago and I wanted to keep it platontic because I didn't want to catch feelings. The first night he was very cuddly in bed and tried to initiate sex, but I rejected him because I was uncomfortable. By the second day I warmed up to him more and we held hands, hugged and had fun while we explored the city. 

We went out for dinner and I asked him his most memorable date in China. We were both drunk and he said without a flinch ""when me and my girlfriend got dressed up and went to an event"". Wait. What? Girlfriend? He quickly backpedaled and said they are on a break because they were getting serious too fast and it made her nervous, because **she's a single mom. He has met her son.** He was still drunk and I got very angry at him - a break means intentions of getting back together and didn't talk to him the rest of the night.

When we got back to the hotel, he asked why I was mad, I told him, and he vehemently denied having a girlfriend, saying he misspoke - they weren't on a break, they had broken up a month ago and it was a sensitive topic and he doesn't want to discuss it. I apologized. We had sex. 

Next morning when he was sleeping I went through his phone. First message conversation that pops up is a girl. Find out it's his girlfriend. He messaged her ""my beautiful sexy girlfriend"" the night before, and a bunch of other lovey dovey stuff, and she replied as well. They were definitely not broken up, or even on a break. 

I have her contact information. I have incriminating photos of the guy and messages as proof so she will believe me. Should I tell her?

TL;DR: I \[24f\] met up with an old flame \[28m\] in China who said he didn't have a girlfriend, and we had sex. I looked through his phone the next day and found out he does have a girlfriend, who is a single mother and he has met her child before. I have her contact info and can message her photo/message evidence that he's cheating. Should I?"
"I [27M] believe my wife [28F] is cheating on me with another woman [??F]


(throwaway account)

I've been in a relationship with my wife for 10 years of which 2 years as husband and wife (no children, planning somewhere in the next year). My wife and I are quite open about our sexuality; we watch porn sometimes and she sometimes comments on how other women are pretty. I asked her multiple times over the last 10 years whether she was bi-sexual but she always insisted she isn't. My wife is a really feminine gal who is in great shape and takes care of her appearance. Our sex life is good.

Roughly 2,5 years ago my wife met a woman (let's call her Anne) through work and even though Anne lives 300+ miles from us they meet up once every 1-2 months to do some city trips. From my perspective, they just became great friends and I was happy for my wife that she found a good friend. Anne visited our home once; to me she looked a little chubby/manly and had short hair. The first thing I asked my wife when Anne left was whether Anne was a Lesbian (I have no issues whatsoever with homosexuals, I was just curious from her looks). My wife said Anne was not and that she actually had a boyfriend.

Over the past 2 years, I sometimes found inconsistencies about what my wife told me when she was meeting with Anne. The most major one was when my wife went partying with another female friend in another city for the weekend, but when I couldn't reach her (and called her friend) I learned that after the first day- my wife switched hotels and spent a day with Anne without telling me. I was really surprised but since it was just ""another female friend"" I did not give it too much thought. It did leave me suspicious.

Skip to this week, my wife had been using my laptop because hers broke down and logged onto her mail. When I opened my laptop, her mail was still open. I should not have looked at the mails, but my curiosity got the better of me and found the following mail from Anne about what seems like a fight that they've had:  

&gt;*\[wife's name\], please!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Talk with me!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*You know that I need you and that I love you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I never wanted and want to hurt you. I simply want to see you and nothing is an effort for doing so.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I'm freaking out without you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And I want to make you happy and show my love for you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Please talk with me. - Anne*

Really the only way I can interpret this is that my wife is having an emotional- an probably sexual affair with Anne. I had an incredibly tough week at work and I plan on confronting my wife about this on the weekend. I want to give her the opportunity to: 1. be completely honest about what is going on   - 2. break all ties with Anne if she wants to give the marriage a shot  - 3. don't expect me to trust her anytime soon because it is currently at an historical low.  If she refuses any of the above, I will pack my bags and leave. 

Really looking for some opinions on how to deal with this and whether my interpretation of everything makes sense.

tldr; found mail which indicates wife is cheating on me with another woman - not sure what to do."
"My (19F) mother (46F) is insisting on calling my boss (30sF) because she is unhappy with my internship


Let me start by saying I am currently finishing up a 6 month internship with an international magazine brand. This internship is part of my school curriculum, compulsory and will play a heavy part in influencing my GPA.

When I first came on the team, it was clear from the get go that they never really needed an intern. As such most of my job happens at oddball hours/late in the week when people start assigning me tasks they can't finish. As I am getting my diploma in the media industry, this is nothing new and in fact pretty standard. Additionally, the magazine will be shutting down shortly after I leave.

My mother has grown increasingly irritable when it comes to my odd work hours and the fact that I am coming home ""late"". (I am coming home at about 9pm when I have to run last minute errands for my job; I am hardly late.) She gets angry when I have to bring certain things from work home, like clothes, equipment, products.

My mother has started to call up my supervisor to yell about my job. She has already called my supervisor tonight and is planning to call her again later tomorrow. Obviously, I DON'T want her to do this because I will be humiliated in front of my boss and my boss is in fact grading me, but it is too late now and I am trying to figure out how to do damage control.

Is there anyway I can get this whole situation under control before I get humiliated in front of my whole office?

TL;DR my mother has called my supervisor to complain that I am returning home late from work. Is there any way I can even save face at this point?"
"My wife (32) needs me (31) to love other people more and be more compasionate and kind.


TLDR: I need advice on how to learn to love people. How to be more kind, feel more empathy towards others. How treat everybody as they were my friends. Any courses, practices, or consultants anybody can suggest or share the experience?

Since my childhood I have never been a very warm or open-hearted person. This probably has to do with the fact that I grew up in an abusive home where my dad was a heavy drinker and my mom was emotionally distant and cold because of that. 

Through my life I knew I am that way but it didn’t affect my own wellbeing that much.  Apart from the fact that I did not have any long-lasting friendships or relationships. Most of my relationships with girls, with employees, colleagues, classmates, coursemates etc. ended right after I had no need to see the person anymore (changing jobs, finishing school etc.).

Never felt any regret for it and never put too much thought into that because I myself felt quite comfortable with that. 

Now that I have a wife and my own kid this is really becoming an issue. For all of us. My wife hates that my default state towards other people is cold and distant, we fight a lot because of that. And with a baby in the house I have realised that I don’t want to be that way. I don’t want my kid to learn that this is the way how to treat other people. I don’t want my kid not to feel any empathy towards others or have no compassion.

I have to change, but I don’t know how.Self help books and motivational instagram phrases are nice and powerful for exactly 5 minutes, but then the effect wears off and I become myself again.

I want to be better for my wife, for my kid, myself and other people around me.  
Any suggestions, advice how to approach this and how to fix myself?"
"My husband (30m) wouldn’t let me (30f) reschedule a conversation at 1:30 AM


I’m kind of at a loss here. This is a sanity check. 

I came home from work late, my husband had started drinking. He doesn’t drink that often, but like me, when he does drink he tends to hit it fairly hard. It’s especially rare on a work night, but whatever. He’s the boss of him. 

I was getting ready for bed since I have to wake up before him. He asked me to stop messing around on my phone and have a heart to heart with him. I said okay, moved away from my phone, and heard him out. 

I’d rather not get into the details of what he said - it was about the state of the world at large, not about me or us. He seemed concerned that I would hate him for his opinion. I reassured him that I didn’t, I reflected back that I could tell he was frustrated and angry, and felt helpless, and so do I, and it all seemed normally productive at first. 

Then, as sometimes happens when he drinks, his talk turned a little less gentle and more angry. He said something very dramatic, and even then I just sat and listened. I figured he needed to vent. 

He pressed me for my opinion and I said there were parts I agreed with and parts I disagreed with. He insisted I tell him he parts I disagreed with. I said I didn’t want to, because I knew he’d fixate in them and try to have an argument and not let me go to bed. He claimed it was because I just didn’t care or was “scared” of losing an argument, and pressed me again. I briefly explained the bit I didn’t agree with. It was purely opinion. 

He demanded examples. For every one I had, he has one for his side, and he did his best to invalidate mine and say they didn’t count. Being as the whole thing is again, pure opinion, it was going nowhere. We could tell competing anecdotes all night and get nowhere and I just wanted to go to sleep. He said I was only trying to end the argument because I knew I was “losing.”

I reminded him that I had work in the morning. He responded “yeah sure go to bed, I see where your priorities are.”

I said, “sleep?”

He said, “yeah, you only care about normalcy, about maintaining your routine, not about having a real conversation with me, your partner.”

I got frustrated and accused him of sealioning me. I said that if he wasn’t doing that, then he’d be fine with rescheduling. I offered tomorrow or the next day to talk as long as he wanted, on any topic he wanted. 

He said I was being dismissing and flippant. 

I explained that I do care, and I’m happy to have an emotional conversation, but that right now I can’t emotionally or mentally engage enough to do it justice. 

He said “wow, that’s some spin” and accused me of being belligerent. 

He also said it was a “power play” for me to try and reschedule the topic. 

I don’t know how I let this all go so wrong. I’m so frustrated. I don’t know what to do in the morning, I don’t know how to respond to his tactics when he does them, I really thought I was doing the right thing this time and still went this way.

 I guess I feel frustrated because I need more respect and trust when I communicate how I feel (that I care, etc.) and more consideration for my needs (sleep in particular.) 

I feel worse than I even usually do when we argue. Almost used. I don’t know. I just want someone else’s eyes on this. I feel alone in trying to process it.  

TL;DR husband won’t let me out or a conversation without insisting I don’t care about him, and i don’t know what to do next or how to avoid these situations. "
"[UPDATE] I (27F) don't know what to do about a coworker (M) who's starting to make me uncomfortable.


 [This post explains the story I'm about to continue below](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8v2ob0/i_27f_dont_know_what_to_do_about_a_coworker_m/)

I spoke to my coworker Chris today, when I told him I needed to talk he started blushing and smiling as if he thought he wore me down. I decided to have the conversation in the warehouse where there are cameras and a lot of persons/witnesses. I started out by telling him that the rumour he may either have heard or possibly will start about myself and the other coworker is completely false. That made him smile even wider which started to irk me but I had to keep my cool in order to finish the conversation civilly.

I then went on to tell him that he needed to understand that he's making me extremely uncomfortable and uneasy. I made reference to what he said on Friday about his anger issues which he tried to brush off as ""I was only talking I didn't mean anything"". I didn't want to leave it at that; I told him I didn't take it as a joke and that was a serious comment to say. I went down the lists of things he does such as calling me baby/babe often, always asking for my number, always flirting heavily and talking about how much he needs to be with me and how they made me feel. HOPEFULLY he understood me when I told him that I only see him as a coworker and nothing more and he needed to stop with the excessive flirting and creepiness. He insisted that he understood where I was coming from but he didn't apologize for all the shit he did/say before.

**TL;DR Talked to coworker about his creepy tendencies which I didn't like or appreciate, he said he understood but we'll have to wait and see.**"
"I (26F) broke up with boyfriend of a year (27M) because I found out he'd been serially unfaithful. He wants me to hear his side of the story, I've blocked all contact with him - have I done the right thing?


Some background: my boyfriend and I met through a mutual friend and, after less than a month of dating, decided to officially become bf/gf. There was an instant connection, we had tonnes in common and fell in love very quickly. Throughout most of the relationship there were no major issues; the few times we ever fell out were because of his slightly erratic behaviour when drunk and his tendency to call me frequently whenever I went out alone with friends. However, over the past couple of months, I've had an uneasy gut feeling that something wasn't right, but couldn't put my finger on what - I loved and trusted him so it never crossed my mind that he would be unfaithful because, as he frequently told, he loved me more than anything else in the world. We had also had several discussions about cheating and were both vehement that if the other cheated, that would immediately end the relationship.

We celebrated our one-year anniversary with dinner this past week and I discovered just hours later that he had been cheating on me for months . The discovery was prompted by a message he received before we left for dinner from a woman whose name I didn't recognise - it said 'Hey, whatcha up to?' He noticed I'd seen it and didn't reply at the time, but during dinner, when he got his phone out to show me something, it opened on the Messenger app and it was clear that he had responded to the message. I queried him about it and he opened the message to show me what it said: that he was busy right now caught up in a volunteering meeting. This was the red flag for me: if the woman was a purely platonic friend, why not just say 'Sorry - I'm out to dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary'?

That, coupled with the uneasy feeling I already had, persuaded me to do something I'd never normally have done - take his phone while he was sleeping to look through his messages. I found a plethora of them, to and from various different women (across several messaging platforms), a number of which made clear that he must have been periodically downloading, using, and then deleting Tinder so that I wouldn't find out. Some of the messages had gone no further than talking, others had clearly resulted in a date, and others had led to actual sex. At this point my heart was racing and the feeling of confusion and betrayal was overwhelming. I actually left him sleeping in my apartment and went to stay with a friend. 

The next morning, I arranged to meet him at his place to confront him about what I'd found out. This was the part that really hurt: when I presented him with the evidence, face to face, he denied everything and claimed that he didn't understand what I was upset about because he hadn't done any of those things. I left feeling even more angry and upset, and minutes later he sent me a string of messages reiterating his confusion and claiming that I had misconstrued everything and that he would like to tell me his side of the story if I was willing to listen. I ignored the messages and blocked all contact with him, because as far as I was concerned, there was no possible explanation that could excuse the fact that he had slept with other women. 

Knowing what I now know, I feel stupid for having ignored a number of other red flags over the past year: taking his phone with him every time he went to the bathroom; finding an excuse every time I arranged for us to hang out with my family; constantly texting and calling me any time we were apart; saying he would come and stay the night, then messaging me later to say he was staying at his because he was feeling sick/too tired/had a headache; changing his mind several times about us living together; and more recently, an unwillingness to hold hands in public. There was even one time when he was scrolling through his apps and I saw he had Tinder, but he explained it away by saying that his friend had stolen his phone while they were out drinking and dowloaded it for a laugh.

The problem is that, even given all of the above, there is a part of me that's still curious to know what ""his side of the story"" is. Because I don't understand how there could possibly be a rational explanation for any of this, but he clearly thinks he has one. Am I right to have blocked all contact with him so that he has no chance to give an explanation or should I hear him out?

TL;DR: found out on one-year anniversary that boyfriend had cheated numerous times, confronted him, he initially denied everything, then later asked for me to hear his side of the story. Have blocked all contact because other red flags were present. Have I done the right thing?"
"My (26F) husband (26M) told me that he thinks being married to someone in his field would be a better fit and won't compromise with me on going to counseling.


My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for four months. I thought everything was perfect. We had some communication issues in the past but we worked through them and I really thought everything was going well. We’re both Post-docs in different fields of STEM, and I always thought having different interests enriched our marriage but, well…

The other day we were in the kitchen cooking dinner and he was telling me about this project one of his colleagues was working on. I kept having to ask him questions because even if I don’t know much about his field, I am interested in what my husband does and try to be engaging in our conversations. He then randomly blurts out, “You know sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I was married to another \[title of scientists in his field\]. I feel like it would be such a productive marriage.” I was super appalled by that statement because I feel like he low key told me I was stupid for not understanding him and also holding him back. I said “oh, you mean like one of your coworkers?” He replied, “Yeah, I feel like they would understand me more we could collaborate on projects. It would be so cool and overall a much better fit.”

I called him out on this immediately. I said, “you know that is an incredibly insensitive thing to say to your new wife. You basically told me that you’re questioning how well we work together.” He didn’t quite realize what he had said and tried to backtrack saying “that’s not what I meant. You’re taking it the wrong way. I just wish you knew more about my field of research.” I asked him why he is saying this now, and if he felt this way while in grad school too. He said no, because he was mostly working with men in the past and he never thought of what it would be like to work with his partner.

At that point, I left the kitchen to go snuggle my bunny because I was so freaking upset and sad that my husband just told me he wanted me to be a different person and would prefer it if I was more like his female colleauges. I told him that I was hurt and he needed to give me space but he followed after me and we started fighting. I told him he shouldn’t have said it. It’s okay to be interested in other people and have these “what if” thoughts, but you wouldn’t have said it if it wasn;t something you were seriously bothered by.  I know I am not interested in his subject, but I try to understand what he is saying because I love him and want to know what he is doing, but if it were not for him I would have zero motivation to learn about what he does. I told him that he is not remotely  engaged in my subject and I understand why. It’s not his passion, but I’m fine with that. I love how excited his work makes him and he had told me he felt the same way. I feel like he is questioning our marriage and he isn’t truly happy with me. He told me he loves me and he didn’t mean it that way, but I told him you can’t back track and the damage is done. It’s nice to know you are having these regrets. Thanks for being honest with me, but I am very hurt and I need a little time to feel comfortable. 

He has basically been silent about it since then and I just can’t look at him the same way. Whenever I see him texting his colleaugues, my stomach churns.  I don’t want him to touch me, I don’t want to look at him. I’m usually the one with the high libido but I had to turn him down the last few times he has initiated sex because now I feel so used. I told him that I think we should go to marriage counseling because I can’t get over feeling inadequate now. Maybe I am taking it far, but this is what I need to feel “safe” in our marriage again. He said he would prefer to try and work on it ourselves and I said this is not an option. I have been in relationships where I felt unappreciated before and I am not willing to do it again. He has never been great with expressing his feelings but he  doesn’t have anything else to say beside “I’m sorry, but you took it the wrong way.” 

I can’t let it go! I just can’t stop feeling like my husband wished I was someone else and the fact that he doesn’t want to go to counseling so we can work through OUR problems is so devastating for me. He kept telling me I was blowing things out of proportion and I snapped and told him that if he doesn’t want to have our marriage annulled, he will do this with me because my image of our relationship is shattered. Am I over reacting?

TL;DR

Husband told me that he thinks about what it would have been like to marry someone in his field and that it would ultimately have been a better fit for him. I am so hurt by those words and requested marriage counseling but he refuses to go. This is my hill to dies on. Am I being unreasonable?"
"Do I (30M) tell my girlfriend (31F) what I really think of her parents?


My girlfriend's (dating 6 months) birthday is coming up in a few days. She’s insisted to not do anything for her or get her anything because she hates her birthday. She even warned me that she may be upset, or angry on that day. I was really confused, so I asked her why. 

She feels this way about her birthday because her parents ruined that day for her from a young age. My girlfriend was born a twin, but her twin unfortunately died at birth. Ever since then, my girlfriend tells me her parents have ruined every birthday for her.

Not only did they never celebrate that day with her, my girlfriend and her parents would argue or fight on that day very often. Mainly because her parents felt that day’s attention should be spent on her deceased twin, not her. So much so, that my girlfriend tells me when she was a child and would run up to her parents and say, “Guess what tomorrow is?!”, they’d reply with “the anniversary of your sister’s death”. 

All this to me seems entirely fucked up to do to your own child. I’m very fortunate that I come from a very loving family and my parents would move the world for me. And here, I come across parents who won’t even recognize or celebrate their child’s birthday because of her twin dyeing at birth. 

This is just the start of a medium sized list as to why I don’t really like her parents. They come from a very religious background, which I was not, and they’ve even criticized where I go eat with my own mother, on my own time, because it doesn’t fall in line with their dietary laws. Just picture your typical, religious, hypocrites. 

Either way, her parents are something I’m willing to overlook so I can continue to date my girlfriend. But, do I tell my girlfriend how I truly feel about them? How I think it’s fucked up how they treat her birthday? To me, all of it just feels gross and wrong. I’m begging my girlfriend to spend her birthday weekend at my place so I can show her what it’s like to have your birthday celebrated by the people that love her.  

TL;DR: My girlfriends parents have never celebrated her birthday because her twin died during birth. They instead make my girlfriend feel guilty on that day by focusing that day on the ""anniversary of her sisters death"". This has in turn made my girlfriend hate her birthday and insist I do nothing for her on that day. The way they treat her on her birthday has made me really dislike her parents. Do I tell her what I really think of her parents and how they treat her birthday?"
"My (37M) MIL (70F) wants a huge 50th anniversary blowout. Am I wrong to be put off by this?


My in-laws are generally lovely people and I am happy to have them in my life, but a couple months ago my MIL started dropping hints that she wanted a 50th anniversary party thrown for them. This is all well and good, and my wife and I were wanting to do something nice to celebrate such a huge milestone. We were thinking along the lines of setting up a party at a church hall or the like and getting a nice gift - I know they’d been wanting to upgrade their TV. Wife’s siblings were on board with this plan.

Over the past 6 weeks or so, MIL has been setting expectations for a country club style reception. A bit forward, but OK, we can work on setting up a cocktail hour or whatnot. Last week we got the guest list and it’s about 150 people! The party has grown to include a DJ, photographer, flowers, etc. Our budget can support 75 without really limiting the menu too much. MIL mentioned she could kick in money, but when we mentioned we’d need help for each guest above 75  she got upset, said to cancel the whole thing and wouldn’t answer texts or phone calls.

Am I wrong in feeling that I don’t even want to do anything anymore? This is now an obligation and isn’t fun. Frankly, I have no confidence that the party is going to meet expectations and is just going to keep resulting in fights. We’re trying to plan this thing remotely and it’s just a big stressor. Any advice on how to handle this without a bunch of resentment bubbling up? The siblings think it’s a bit over the top here but are of the mindset that it’ll all work out.

**TL;DR; : Wanted to do something nice for MIL’s 50th anniversary - she went bridezilla. Am I selfish for being upset about this?**.

"My [24F] boyfriend’s [27M] student [20F] is coming onto him but he doesn’t see anything wrong with her actions since she credits him with her academic success


 Throwaway as my boyfriend reddits.

My boyfriend is ‘Samuel’. Samuel and I have been together for 3 years after meeting at university while I was an undergrad student and he was completing his masters. Currently I am studying for my own masters, while Samuel is starting his first year as a junior professor at the same university after finishing his PhD. Although we are both in the same field, we each specialise in different areas, meaning that no one on the staff at our university views our relationship as an issue since we have nothing to do with each other academically.

As it’s his first year as a professor, Samuel has his own students for the first time who are doing his own course - he’s taught before, but never his own stuff. I would never have even thought that there would be an issue here until I first started hearing about ‘Karen’.

Karen is a student on Samuel’s course. He doesn’t bring home work on such a personal level as mentioning all of his students all the time, however Karen seemed to be an exception. The first time she was brought to my attention was when Samuel and I were both attending a talk being done by one of my professors/Samuel’s colleague and she came bounding over to us and squealed that she was so happy to see Samuel there. I got introduced to her as Samuel’s girlfriend, while she was presented to me as ‘one of the leading stars’ of his course. If you can imagine the reaction of someone winning an Oscar, then that is what this girl practically did at hearing this. She went on for about 5 minutes about how great Samuel was, how different he was to her other professors, and how committed he is as an educator, which is all well and good, however for the last minute or so she started stroking his arm, something he did not stop. I asked him what all that was about after she had finally left, and he said that it was obvious she had a little crush on him. I was upset that this was the first mention of someone he sees frequently having an obvious attraction to him, and asked to be kept in the loop.

I wish I hadn’t asked. Karen sends Samuel 4 or 5 emails a day ranging from asking questions about the course (acceptable) to asking for private tutoring (less acceptable) to then asking him out to dinner to ‘talk about the course’ (absolutely not acceptable). He says that she is the first person at his door during his office open hours, and she often eats into the time he’s set aside for other students who have real questions and issues. Apparently during one of their latest meetings she started asking about me - Samuel said he mentioned that I was doing my masters in the department, and at their next meeting she happened to mention that she was casually reading the university handbook and saw that students were not allowed to date academics, and that she would keep our ‘secret’ in return for a favour in the future. We were not so stupid as to let Samuel pursue his application to teach at the university without first consulting his accessors about our relationship, and for a number of reasons (we didn’t start our relationship after he became a professor, we are not academically linked etc.) - in short, everyone who is important knows we’re a couple.

I’ll throw in here that I have no reason to believe that Samuel is interested at all in Karen. He might be getting a bit of an ego boost perhaps, but he is showing absolutely no signs of wanting to act on Karen’s hints and actions. He has however made it clear that he will not be bringing attention to Karen’s activities higher up in the department because it benefits him in the long run - the more praise she heaps onto him, the more he is viewed as a good professor and a good person to have around at the university.

It’s this that makes me uncomfortable - if other students see Karen flirting with Samuel and he’s doing nothing about it, then they might start doing the same. Seeing 10 or so students fawning over my boyfriend at every turn is something that I could not handle. Would I be in the right to ask him to shut this down, even though it may benefit his career?

TL;DR - Boyfriend is a professor who has a student crushing on him, won’t do anything about it since it makes him look good as a professor, am I allowed to say how uncomfortable it makes me?"
"Should I the school janitor(28m) ask a teacher(28f)out?


Ok for context it’s a very small school in a tiny community and I clean it a few times a week to help out when I have time away from my other work,there’s a teacher there who is the same age as me as is very nice to talk to and very beautiful and smiley and just seems like a really nice person,anytime I go there to clean and she’s still there she always comes over and talks to me and asks how I’m doing,she is always smiling when we talk and she even laughs really hard at my jokes even when they aren’t that funny!



My dilemma is I don’t want to make things weird for her or me by asking her out Incase she isn’t interested but going on how we interact and how she seems genuinely happy when she sees me i feel like she might like to get to know me more so I’m unsure what to do,I’m not a full time employee there and I work after hours when the kids are gone home and only the teachers are left. I really don’t think the principal would have a problem with it cause she’s very relaxed and free spirited so I’m good on that end but I’m still not sure whether to message her and be like “hello it was nice getting to know,let me know if you want to hang out sometime over summer”. 

Also there’s the fear that I’m completely wrong and she’s not interested in my on any level other than as a casual pal she sees at work sometimes.

Tdlr: I like a teacher at a school I work at but am unsure whether I should ask her out or leave things as they are,help!"
"Me [32 M] with my wife [30 F] of 6 years, she didn't tell me he was the other guy


Years back my wife had an almost affair with another man. Before it happened she told me how she was feeling, what he wanted and what they had done. I verified that nothing major happened and we moved on. 

About two years after that she brought her good friend from work to to our house. This woman was nice and we hung out for a time. Soon this woman brought her husband around and we all became couple friends.

I've recently found out he was the other man. He wasn't married yet then and pursued my wife. She brought him around without ever telling me. They are now both our good couple friends and have been for a long time.

I'm mad because I feel I should have known at the very least that he was the man. I feel like I've spent years hanging out with a man who would have used her and ruined our marriage. She's upset that I'm mad, saying she handled it at the time, was honest before anything too serious happened and that it was years past. 

I know all this but I still should have been told. However I worry I'm taking a good marriage and a good friendship and threatening it all over again. But it seems unfair that I have to deal with it at all, let alone hang with someone who did this. What is right and what can I do?

---

Tl;dr: My wife almost slept with another man when we first got married. She came clean before it went that far. Years have passed and now I find that our couple friends include that man, without her ever having told me."
"My (40f) boyfriend (42m) can’t seem to discipline his 18 yo daughter. He thinks since she’s 18 that he can’t do anything.


My bf and I have been dating almost a year. He moved to a city so that his daughter could finish out her senior year at that particular high school she’s been attending. She used to live with her mom (his ex- they’ve been divorced over 10 years) but had to move out bc she is toxic and not a very good mom. 
He recently bought his daughter a used car. And she has a job to pay for the Insurance on said car. She has came home now - 3 times- with scratches, dings and the like on the car. When confronted she denies anything. Or said she doesn’t know what happened to the car.  Recently he was out of town for 4 days and asked her to feed/take care of/ watch the dogs. Which when he came hime the house was destroyed and dogs had barely any food. He also came home one day and his xbox was gone. Eventually she came to him crying saying she pawned it! Bc she was broke. Ever since she’s been out of high school (since may) all of this has been happening.  She said she would get the Xbox back from the game store - 3 weeks ago and still hasn’t gotten it back. 
I have two small children and have no idea what it’s like to have a teen. So here I am. He is an amazing dad- hardworking- supportive. Etc.  but he has this deep seeded guilt I guess- from being away (deployment) that he hesitates to confront her or make her suffer any consequences for her actions.  She isn’t in school. He’s afraid to pay for that - that she just isn’t ready and will fail out and more money wasted.  
TL;DR- boyfriend doesn’t know how or won’t discipline his 18 yo daughter who is getting away with stuff. She will keep doing stuff as long as she can get away with it.  "
"My [44M] wife [41F] of 17 years wants to divorce me because she feels it's disloyal if I fantasize about anyone who's not her.


I'm an adult child of abuse. Sometimes it's difficult for me to be emotionally vulnerable, and to know what's ""normal"" in general, not having any models who weren't batshit crazy or would beat me if I said the wrong thing.

My wife and I have been married for a while now, have several children who are all happy and healthy. We've been skirting the edges of divorce for a while now, but a few years ago things came to a head and she was fed up with my habit of lying reflexively if I ever felt cornered or emotionally distressed. This is an untenable situation for my wife, and to save the marriage I promised radical honesty. I would tell her the truth about everything, big or small, all the time, whether it was in my own self-interest to do so or not. This hasn't always worked out for her as she had hoped.

Early in our marriage, knowing I had more partners than she did, she asked me to never fantasize about anyone in my past. I have been faithful in that. I remember some of them (it's been a while), but I don't dwell or use them as masturbation memories.

A couple of nights ago, we were in bed and she asked me about my fantasies -- if I ever thought about anyone else when I masturbated. I told her that there was nobody in particular, but sometimes I *did* in fact thing about things other than her when I do the deed.

She took incredible offense at this and told me that I was being completely disloyal.

I told her that I've never had an affair, physical or emotional, that sometimes I think about things other than her -- it's weird: never any real person, more ideas and parts; mechanical visions rather than individuals -- but I *always* come back to her. How can that be disloyal?

Implying that she never thinks about anything but me, she scoffed at me that I thought that anything goes as long as I don't have a physical or emotional affair.

I told her that even though I believe that she's not fundamentally entitled to know my private thoughts, I promised I would tell her everything, and I did, and that *yes* I really did think that it was fine to think about *not her* as long as I stayed faithful to her in the real world.

The idea that I thought she wasn't entitled to my private thoughts sent her through the roof. This isn't her idea of loyalty. I am not being loyal to her. I am, in fact, being quite unfaithful.

I asked her if she thought I should go to prison if I imagined murdering someone. She didn't think this was an applicable analogy. 

And now I'm sleeping on the couch, and I'm trying to find a local divorce lawyer to protect my rights in all of this if I can't smooth this business over.

Since I have difficulty determining normalcy, my question is this: Is this a normal definition of loyalty? Am I rationalizing an unforgivable breach of trust? Or is this a thought-police level of black and white thinking on her part? I honestly don't know.

tl;dr: Wife thinks that fantasizing about others whilst masturbating is akin to adultery, and she wants to divorce me for admitting that I did just that. Is this normal?"
"My close friend [34F] fancies herself a comedian, but I [29M] don't think she's funny, and now she thinks my company should hire her as part of the entertainment for a corporate party


""Angela"" and I have been friends for about ten years. She's a bit older than I but we have lots in common. While I think she's quite attractive physically, she's one of those rare women with whom I can share a completely platonic relationship while having no interest in her sexually. I think it's because she reminds me too much of my older sister. Okay TMI not that you asked.

Over the past six years, Angela, who usually works as a buyer for a large clothing brand, has taken up stand-up comedy as a hobby. She's taken improv classes and has done lots of open mic nights. I've always encouraged her to pursue her passions because I want to be a supportive friend, but honestly she isn't funny. I don't really think it's just me, either, because whenever she does open mic night, the reaction she gets is often very unpleasant, at times she is even booed off the stage or heckled so much that she has to end her act early. When she asks me what I think, I tell her that I think she's awesome and brave for trying, and that I'm proud of her, but that her current humor style isn't my particular taste. I also try to give her input on what would have been funnier for her to do, from my perspective as an audience member. She seems to appreciate my input.

I work for a large PR firm and every year our company has a party in a hotel ballroom. As part of the entertainment the company always hires various singers and other musicians. Over the years, Angela has been my plus-one a couple of times. I've always felt that she could take it or leave it, and she only attends because she's my friend and wants to be supportive, just like I attend her comedy acts to be there for her.

Well, she found out this year that our party is going to have comedians as well for the entertainment. 

I am close to the event organizers and have arranged for other entertainment in the past, and it's always been local talent. Angela KNOWS that I have a lot of pull as to who gets to be a comedian for the event.

My problem is, Angela takes it as a given that I'm going to ask her to be one of the comedians (we're hiring three). Her attitude is ""well, what other two comedians will you get?""

It's a well-paying gig and I know Angela would love to have this feather in her cap.

My other problem is that Angela has a certain style of comedy that uses a lot of profanity and sexual humor, and when I brought that up she said she would just tone it down and do jokes like she did on another night when I watched her do comedy (where she also bombed).

Angela isn't a loser and she has other friends, and I was SO embarrassed and ashamed of myself but I went behind her back and asked another of her friends what she thought of Angela's comedy, and the friend just practically gasped and said oh thank GOD I thought I was the only one...

Now both me and the other friend are anxious that Angela not embarrass herself and also in a selfish way I don't want Angela's lack of comedic talent to hurt my stake in the company, because I really need this job.

Any advice on how I can get Angela to stop thinking I'm going to get her the job just because I'm practically her best friend, and yet somehow spare her ego?

Her friend and I have both tried to be supportive with her without trying to crush her spirit by telling her she just isn't funny.

I mean humor is a subjective thing but personally I doubt my colleagues will find her funny either.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

\*\*tl;dr: my friend is a comedian. She isn't funny. My company is hiring comedians. My friend thinks we should hire her. I'm thinking please oh God no.\*\*  "
"I (30f) just found my fiance (30m) on an online dating site. What do I do?


My fiance and I have been together a year and a half, we moved in with one another a few months ago. Lately he has been a bit distant. I've been cheated on in the past and have been really insecure with his change in behavior. He has assured me he is just stressed about work and because his car broke down a couple weeks ago and he hasn't gotten a replacement yet. 

I couldn't let the nagging feeling go, so I did a little investigating. I didn't snoop in his phone or personal accounts, but I made a fake profile on a popular dating site and found him there. He was last online July 1st.

I don't know what to do. How do I confront him? What do I say? Can our relationship be saved? Do I even want to save it? 

I feel like I am a wreck right now

TL;DR  Fiance has been distant lately, I did some digging on a popular online dating site and discovered he was active within the past week. What do I do next?"
"My (30sF) friend (30sF) is being obnoxious about a pet she gave my (20sF) sister


I’ve been friends with “Stacey” for about 5 years. She’s a great person, our kids are friends, we share similar interests, and so on and so forth. 

A few months ago, Stacey’s daughter Becky (9), talked Stacey into one of those giant lop eared rabbits.  Stacey is one of those moms who doesn’t really ever put her foot down with her kids, so she really didn’t do her research or think it over before agreeing. (I’m not trying to be critical of Stacey, she’s a single mom who tries REALLY hard to be everything to her kids.) 

Anyway, about a month into having this rabbit, it’s more work than Stacey was really willing to take on, and Becky, who asked for the rabbit, really isn’t all that interested in cleaning the litter box or watching the rabbit when it is outside of its cage. (Wires were chewed, etc.) 

Stacey (rightly) decides that they aren’t adequately caring for the rabbit, and that they need to find it a new home.  She initially asked me to take it, but due to having large dogs, I didn’t feel that I was a good fit. She puts it on Facebook, Craigslist, etc...no luck. She is about to take it to a shelter when my sister, “Abby” steps in and says she will take it.

Abby already has 3 other rabbits, and they have their own rabbit-proof room where they can stay when she’s not in and not be caged. She works from home, so she’s not away from them much, and she understands the type of care, etc that they need. 

Stacey is so relieved that the rabbit is getting a great home, Abby is excited to have a new pet, all should be great, right? 

Well, except for one thing- Stacey keeps insisting that Becky needs to go visit the rabbit so that she can have “closure” and that she’s “grieving” ....Stacey actually took her to therapy over this.  To be honest, Becky doesn’t seem that fussed about the rabbit to me, but that’s my opinion. 

Abby lives 3 .5 hours away from us, and doesn’t really know Stacey aside from the odd kids party here and there.  Abby also works a LOT and doesn’t have a lot of free time.  We see Abby about once a month, when our schedules match up and we usually spend the weekend all together. 

Stacey wants to come the next time we visit Abby. She’s done everything from hint to flat out ask when our next visit is.  I’ll be honest, I don’t want to take Stacey or her kids with us.  Abby doesn’t really have room for more guests, and she doesn’t really know Stacey or her kids very well.  Also, much as I love Stacey’s kids, they can be a handful. Abby is one of those people who is GREAT with nieces and nephews, but not really into other people’s kids.  

Abby has been more than gracious and sent Stacey and Becky lots of pictures, and even FaceTimed so they could see the rabbit.  But still, Stacey insists that this is something that has deeply affected Becky and that Becky needs to see the rabbit to “say goodbye.” (Which she did when she gave it to Abby...) 

I’m not really sure why Stacey is so stuck on this. It’s gotten to the point where she texts about it at least every few days and brings it up every time we are together. I’ve already told her that it’s Abby’s house and I can’t just invite an extra 4 people with us. (Stacey+ 3 kids).  

It’s really starting to annoy me. I know it’s really silly, but I feel like Stacey is being obnoxious.  I’ve shut her down multiple times and she still won’t drop it. What’s really going on here, Reddit?

"I [F46] can't understand a word of what my daughter's [F18] boyfriend [M20] says.


My daughter [F18] brought her boyfriend [M20] of around 6 months home to meet the parents. He seems like a nice young man but English is obviously not his first language. I can barely understand a word he's saying. My husband confessed he is having the same problem, although my daughter seems to understand him fine. I feel rude to ask him multiple times to repeat himself or just smile and nod when I didn't really understand what he was saying. Several times my daughter had to repeat for us what he'd just said. Any idea how to handle this in the future? 

TLDR Daughter's new boyfriend has a strong accent and my husband and I can't understand him."
"How can I(21F) stop being awkward around my brother(32M)?


Me and my brother have a huge age gap and he lives pretty far away, so we aren’t very close.

To summarize, he moved to our city and organized a huge family dinner, which is pretty common when we need to tell something important.

He came w/a male friend(I kinda guessed what would happen and wasn’t really worried about). I was wrong. The moment he said he was gay my mom looked like she would throw up and when he said that the guy on his side was his fiancee my dad left the room... so yeah.

I honestly didn’t expect this, while I don’t have the best relationship w/my parents I was always sure they weren’t homophobic... I’m pretty sure he thought too.

Long story short, a homophobic wave of hate came upon them and it was ugly. My siblings were super happy bc they’re cunts, my extended family looked disgusted and my brother looked like he was gonna cry. I startes calling them out but I think I only made it worse bc I’m enemy n•1 in the family... 

We left and I offered my ap since they intended to stay at our parents(also, sharing a studio flat with your heartbroken distant brother is so awkward omg). It was pretty uncunfortable but they were super nice and left as soon as they could(they also cooked, which is nice but I suspect they just didn’t want to eat burned rice lol)

They’re now confortable in a nice house with plenty of friends. He hasn’t really talked to our family anymore and they’ve cut me out too, which, while it’s not unexpected, it does hurts me. I think he noticed and has been inviting me to dinner, lunch, bbq, cool things

He’s great! But I feel so awkward close to him. It sounds so stupid and childish writing but he’s *very* smart(as is his SO), works on a similar field as mine, is crazy successful and all of his friends are amazing. I’m not jealous but I guess I feel a bit intimidated. He’s amazing in everything I wanna be amazing. And balances this with stable romantic relationships/friends/mentally as well as does sports, looks amazing and even doing all of this he still can talk about GoT... 

I like him a lot but I always feel kinda embarassed around his friends... I know it’s something I should work inside my own mind but I really have no money for therapy(I tried at the uni but the therapist and I didn’t really mesh) and I don’t wanna get distant...

TL;DR: after a bad falling out with my family, my brother and I are much closer but I feel very intimidated by him. How can I get better?"
"Coworker (40s-50sM)'s son died unexpectedly this week and is letting coworkers visit house. I started at this workplace just a little while ago and don't know this coworker well, but his desk is 20 feet from mine. Would it be polite to briefly drop by his house with flowers and a card?


So like the title says, my coworker lost his child this week. The way I (female, 20s) found out about it is because my company's management sent out an email to everybody announcing what happened. With permission, the coworker allowed management to give out his address and say he's opening up his house to coworkers who want to drop by. 

Would it be weird/impolite if I stopped by his house with a vase of flowers and a simple card expressing my sympathy? I just started at this company several weeks ago. 

TL;DR: Coworker had a family tragedy this week. He sits close to me at work but we don't know each other well, although we're polite. Is it weird to go to his house if he released his address to basically my entire company?"
"My husband [28M] started taking steroids, abusing alcohol and illegal drugs, talking to his ex, flirting with women in front of me, emotionally abusing me... and he somehow is able to make me feel like I am [25F] delusional and it is me who damaged our marriage... how do I move on?


I am a 25 y/o F and he is a 28 y/o M and we have been together for \~6 years.

For the first four years, he was an incredible partner and we both enjoyed our lives very much. We had a “slow” bedroom, due to some insecurities stemming from my childhood abuse (my previous post speaks on this), but otherwise we were very respectful, loving and generous with each other and honestly felt that we were each other’s perfect match.

My husband takes steroids, and for anyone who doesn't understand the world of steroids, I will tell you that steroids are grossly misunderstood and are not a ""single"" substance... when someone says they take ""drugs"", they have to be specific, as there is a world of difference between weed and meth. SO, my husband has been taking a generally safe steroid for a couple years as it has improved his energy, sex-drive, mood and general well-being. A lot of men go to an MD for hormone therapy, which is what he was basically administering himself.

This is all fine and dandy, until we remember that it is ILLEGAL and can be charged as a felony offense... and it was not something that was discussed with me at all before he decided to take them. I just slowly came around to the idea of accepting that this is what he wants with his life, he is taking the risk with his body and with the law, but I have to accept it.

Anyway, we went on a three-week vacation to Asia in December and he thought because he wouldn't be able to administer his steroids for three weeks, that he needed to ""double up"" the weeks prior to get him through the dry spell. If you know anything about hormones, you would know what a disaster this is. 

Doubling your dose for weeks, only to abstain completely for another extended period of time is setting yourself up for a complete crash--and that is what happened. 

His testosterone levels have been increased for years via a foreign substance, which means that his body no longer produces testosterone naturally. Another important point is, that by increasing your testosterone levels, your body naturally increases your estrogen levels, which means that when you no longer have an unnaturally high testosterone level, you will be left with very high estrogen levels with no testosterone to offset it… which results in things like bitch-tits and mood-swings.

In short: my husband was in Asia with devastatingly low testosterone levels and high estrogen levels.

He found a pharmacy in Thailand that had a very strong breast cancer medication available, which would completely wipe out his estrogen levels. He did this to prevent his bitch-tits from continuing to grow, but now he was left with a completely crashed testosterone AND estrogen levels.

On the second last day of our trip he ate raw oysters and contracted a very bad case of food poisoning. He was a complete and utter mess. I didn’t think he would survive the 30+ hr worth of flights home and that we may have to cancel our flights so we could check into the ER. He was completely disoriented and was throwing up/diaherra every 30 minutes or so. He pushed through and we made it home, but was completely bedridden once we got back and within a week he had lost over 15 lbs.

I did my best to comfort him but also gave him the space he needed to cope with the horrific crash that he put his body through. Once we came back from Asia he became withdrawn, moody, suspicious... our “slow” bedroom became completely nonexistent—even with me initiating sex, I would be met with a limp dick and dispassionate kiss.

I was very hurt with this sudden change of behavior towards me, but I did my best to meet him with love and understanding. This went on for two months until I finally got suspicious that something else was going on… I checked his phone and saw he was messaging his ex-gf--who in his words--was a total witch who attacked everyone around her physically and emotionally. She was horrible to him, his family, his friends… they ended on a horrible note and the entire relationship was a dark and evil cloud. It didn’t make sense as to why he would be talking with her as they had blocked each other on everything. I confronted him about it and he started crying, telling me that he “was sorry for the way that things ended with her and that he was sexually, emotionally and physically abusive to her and he wanted to apologize to her”.

I took that seriously and thought that was really commendable of him, but at the same time felt that what was in the past was in the past and he shouldn’t have reopened an old wound. He said that he would stop talking to her and move on, that he got his peace that he needed.

A few weeks had passed and he continued acting withdrawn and suspicious so one day when he was in the shower, I looked at his phone again… sure enough, he was still talking to his ex. I learned that she had just moved back to the city we were living in, in January (when he started acting horrible to me)…

I sat him down and asked him to explain the attitude he has had toward me and if that he had been cheating on me with his ex, as that may explain his horrible moods towards me for the last two months.

He told me that he was happy to rekindle the relationship with her and that he was unhappy with our life and that he didn’t find me sexually attractive—that I was overweight, dressed too conservatively for his taste, didn’t like my boobs, my hair, the way I did my makeup, my personality…

Completely devastated, I moved to a relatives house for a few weeks to give us space to figure out what the next steps were.

Within this time I also learned that he started taking a very strong steroid when we got back from Asia, which was a complete no-go. His steroid-friends warned him that this steroid was the devil of steroids and that he should never ever fuck with it.

So here I was, left with a husband who wouldn't stop talking to his ex and taking very harmful steroids that totally fucked his emotional and physical systems.

We fought a lot for several weeks... I wasn't going to let him just ruin our marriage and my life over this bullshit. I begged, fought, screamed for him to get back to normal. After one devastatingly intense night of fighting, he came home in the morning like he was back to normal... so we continued with our life for a couple months, with things seemingly ""fixed"". I still had a really hard time trusting him, but I was forcing down my insecurities, hoping he was being good to me.

I lost 30lbs in less than four months (I am 6ft, now 135lbs), changed my hair, got rid of all of my clothes and got new stuff that I thought he would like, worked hard at suppressing the qualities of my personality that he doesn't like, etc... but I wasn't met with the love, excitement or appreciation that you would expect after making such drastic changes. He never told me how beautiful I looked (instead would continuously bring up ""how fat I used to be""), be supportive of my successful business... nothing.

Then one night he went out with a friend. I asked him to be home by midnight as we had things to do in the morning. Around 2:00 a.m., I got a text from that friend saying, ""I am so pissed \[husband\] left me here \[at the club\]"" and so I started calling and texting my husband... and you could see he was online, just not responding... around 2:30 a.m. he texts me back telling me was with that\^ friend... but then this friend was still texting me ""I still don't know where he is""...

He finally gets home after 3:00 a.m., totally fucked up on coke. So angry. So defensive. Yelling at me asking, ""Do I message your friends when you are out partying?!"" and ""Do I call/text you when you are out asking where you are?!""

I was obviously trying to explain that I didn't message his friend--that his friend messaged me--and that this was all really shady and he screams at me, ""I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU!"", and ended up leaving and sleeping at his office.

I was so embarrassed, thinking that I was acting like a controlling, insecure wife and that I was ruining our marriage...

But a few weeks later, I met up with that friend of his and his friend proceeds to tell me, ""I want you to know that I love \[husband\], but I also love you... and the way he has been treating you is not acceptable... and I told him that, I told him that he was fucking up and that I would kill to have what you guys have. He is not acting like a husband and he straight up told me that he didn't understand the level of commitment marriage was when y'all got married and he just doesn't want to be married anymore. He crossed the line.""

He proceeds to tell me that the night he came home at 3:00 a.m., they had gone to the strippers... and ended up back at the strippers house. I am unsure whether or not they were physical, but I don't think you end up at a strippers house being a good husband.

I decided that night that I had to leave.

I didn't know how to explain this entire story and WHY I am leaving, because my husband looks so perfect. WE look so perfect. We portrayed ourselves as this wonderful, happy couple (we were) and it slowly turned into this disaster. I am so devastated at the loss of my husband... the man that I married, not this manipulative asshole that I have now.

He has been telling people that I am ""on a trip"", so people think I am just galavanting around, avoiding responsibilities, when really, I am just trying to escape the negative hell-hole.

I have been gone for several weeks now, living with friends/family, going on trips, trying to find a new place to live... and this pain comes in waves. I am so angry. He tells me that I am irrational and delusional and I was unappreciative of all the things he did for us...

I asked for a divorce after I was gone for a little bit and he has been acting like this is a big surprise... has been telling people that I just left. PEOPLE DON'T JUST LEAVE HAPPY MARRIAGES.

How can I move on? How can I find someone that was like him, to begin with? I have never been so infatuated with another human being as I was with him when we first met. He is/was perfect for me. I don't know how to accept that he is no longer the same person. How can I trust another man after this? I was supposed to live the rest of my life with him... I committed to this... and he just will not even try.

**Tl;DR - My husband started taking steroids, abusing alcohol and illegal drugs, talking to his ex, flirting with women in front of me, emotionally abusing me... and he somehow is able to make me feel like I am delusional and it is me who damaged our marriage... how do I move on?**"
"My(31F) Boyfriend (32M) texts me that he wants to have sex with his friend


New boyfriend two weeks, 32M, 31F. We had exclusive conversations about our status before getting into a relationship. I made it clear I wanted monogamy, he claimed that's exactly what he wants too.  We agreed if we wanted to do threesomes, we'd need to talk extensively about it and set strict and clear boundaries, and LATER on in the relationship.

Well my bf just TEXTS me if it's okay if he messes around sexually with his friend while hanging out. I told him if that's what he wants, then he should go ahead but then we'll have to break up, because Ist of all, too early in the relationship for that. 2nd, we need to talk about it AND establish boundaries, 3rd, I'm not even there nor have I ever met this said friend. 4th, that doesn't sound like monogamy. I'm furious at this point because this is clearly not a text message conversation. And we literally just had a conversation about this topic. He then says I'm ""fucking nuts"" for being upset and wanting to throw away the relationship and he's sorry he even asked. That he was being considerate by asking for my permission. Mind you, this happened at midnight, he KNOWS I work at 630am.

I'm I crazy for being furious? Is this not wrong in ALL LEVELS? I need honest opinions please! Because I'm ready to walk away from this non-existent relationship. He presented himself as this super sweet guy, and he has been up until yesterday. I just want to know if I'm the only one who thinks this is BS and warrants a breakup! 

Tl;DR : boyfriend of two weeks texts me to tell me he wants to have sex with his friend and thinks I'm nuts for being upset or wanting to breakup "
"I [28F] just saw my husband [24M] made crazy comments in r/theredpill. How do I bring this up in a constructive way?


My husband Alan and I have been married two years, been together for 5 years total. We have a 8 month old child.

We have all our social media signed in on our shared PC. I was on Reddit and got a notification about “mail.” It was a reply to my husband on r/ theredpill. Alan said “My wife doesn’t know this but I’ll be asking for a paternity test on our child’s first birthday.” Along with a few milder, but rude, comments.

I wouldn’t have a problem with this (I can’t imagine not knowing if a child is really mine) but he’s going to “ambush” me ceremoniously on our child’s first birthday? Wtf? So disrespectful to me, how can I talk to him in a constructive way? I am willing to do the test.

**TL;DR** it’s not long."
"I [23F] just got promoted and became my boss's [50sF] boss. Weird dynamic?


I work as a CNA in a nursing home. My boss is extremely abusive, she has no clue how to treat people with respect and many coworkers quit just because of her. She's an LPN.

I just finished my RN, BSN and got promoted at work, effectively ranking higher than her.(they automatically promoted me and this wasn't my boss's decision) I think because she was my boss so long she has trouble viewing me as an equal. She is very, very rude and borderline abusive to the CNA's. I could write a novel about it but she always picks fights and does stuff like take away my phone, give me an assigned seat, etc. She believes that she can continue doing this to me. She loves doing anything to show her superiority. 

This new dynamic has been going on for a few months now. I'm not overly demanding, but it's hard for me to give any orders because I still view myself as a CNA and her as my superior. And when I do, she gets mad at me and she's obviously very uncomfortable with my promotion. 

I'm just not sure how to navigate this weird situation. How can I salvage this work relationship?

**tl;dr** got promoted above my boss, she doesn't like it"
"Should I [26F] be worried that my soon to be husband [26M] almost hit me?


My soon to be husband and I are very close. However, we have been fighting a lot lately and I’m worried about the future of our relationship.

Some background information about my boyfriend and his cousin: a few months ago one of his cousins wanted desperately to go to a strip club and I told him I’m not comfortable with this. Just to clarify, it’s not that I don’t trust my boyfriend - it’s just that this particular cousin has tried to get my boyfriend to cheat on me before. This happened six months ago and my boyfriend told me he didn’t go to the strip club that night. Two weeks ago during an argument he admitted to going that night and says he couldn’t tell me because of my reaction. To make it clear, he said he didn’t want to go but also didn’t want to ditch his cousin . 

I forgave this and we moved on. We recently went on a trip with his family (including his shady cousin). My boyfriend disappeared with his cousin for a few hours while I stayed at the hotel. He says they were running some errands and I do believe him BUT I really don’t trust his cousin. I’ll admit I was upset that he left me alone in this hotel in a foreign country with his family. Also, I was still upset about the strip club incident. 

When he got back to the hotel we fought a bit. I realize I was a bit irrational because they only went out to do errands but something just didn’t sit right. He left me alone with his family to go with his cousin who he knows I don’t like. This guy actually offered to get my boyfriend laid by a prostitute two years ago. My boyfriend got very frustrated and was yelling and he raised his hand on me.... when the impact happened it was very light and only stung a little on my arm. 

Should I be worried? This doesn’t seem healthy and I’m having a lot of anxiety. Breaking up with him hasn’t been an option because we have been together for almost a decade now. 

Reddit, am I in an abusive relationship? 

TLDR: I overreacted to a situation and my boyfriend lightly hit me. Is this abuse?"
"My bf [28M] of 3 years is oversized child that demands I [25F] get up in the middle of the night and early mornings for his benefit


This is going to sound like a petty topic but it's causing me to build a lot of resentment against Tom. 

It started harmless at the beginning. He liked having  back scratches and I thought it was cute and intimate. 

Back then we weren't living together so couple of times a week didnt bother me and I was happy to do it.

Last we started living together and there was .... a lot of teething as we had never lived with a SO before. 

I found some of his behaviour to be VERY selfish while he thought he was simply practical and that I wasn't logical 

For example once a week I finish work relatively late (8pm) while he finished by 4pm. He has the whole day to sort out dinner but he expects me to drive after work and get us take out. He thinks it's a ""one minute stop"" but I know that it takes a lot more effort and time and when im tired I just don't want to deal with it. If i ask him to order delivery he says I can do that when im home then. 

That's not the reason why I posted this though

Back to back scratches. He has become quite demanding with those. He now thinks I owe him at least 10 minutes a night of those. If i dont do it he'll complain non stop till I give in.

If I do Do it- it's NEVER enough. He wants me to litreally scratch his back till he falls asleep. He wants me to scratch his back in the middle of the night as this one time apearantly I started doing it.

Im probably seeing back scratches in my sleep that I'm doing this shit without realizing. It's very tiresome.

On my day off - he wants me to get up early in the morning so that I can give him more back scratches. 

He wont return the favor either. I dont like scratches but I would love a massage but nope he argues that it takes less effort for the scratching and as such massage is toooo hard 

He argues that he helps with cleaning and cooking when he doesn't want to and as such I need to be scratching his back in return. When I tell him id rather not scratch and just sleep he says hed rather not do any chores - as if they're the same thing !!!

Is this behaviour normal ? 

How do i break this cycle as clearly saying no doesn't work :( I already have terrible sleep problems and this is making it worse

\*Tl;Dr: bf of 3 years wants me to get up on middle of night, early morning and wait till he goes to sleep - all so that I can scratch his back "
"My (24f) best friend (24f) of 20+ years was just dumped by her BF. She was sloppy drunk and hit on my fiancé (26m), I'm devastated but can't imagine losing a 20 year friendship. Can I excuse her?


This is very much a developing situation since the whole thing went down an hour ago and Katie (best friend) is passed out in my bathroom and may have no idea what happened.

She was dumped two weeks ago out of the blue, she was madly in love with him and I thought it was reciprocated but he totally broke her heart. She spent the first week begging him to reconsider and explain why. This week she just didn't get out of bed. I begged her to come out with my fiancé just so I knew she was eating and getting hydrated, plus I thought the fresh air would be food for her.

We went to a restaurant and Katie slammed margaritas and was hammered in seemingly minutes. She was so drunk that she ended up running out of the restaurant thinking that there was a club next door basically saying  I'm single I can get laid! I asked my fiancé to go after her while I paid the bill. 

By the time I paid the she was like two blocks away and my fiancé had to more or less carry her back. On the way she apparently said things like ""I'm so drunk yiu should take advantage of me"" and ""let's leave Mad here and go do it somewhere dirty"" and the apparently as he was propping her up walking with her she forced his hand to reach down the back of her pants to see that was wearing a thong. When they got back I met them at my jeep and I very distinctly heard her say ""oh shoot Mad's still here."" 

We dumped her in the back seat and she passed out. My fiancé told me what happened and I started crying. He said to forgive her, she's been through a lot and she would have said the same thing to a lamp post.

We got her inside and she threw up several times. I cleaned her up, she said she was happy she had such a great friend and I was all she had left. I got her into my bed but she got up to throw up afain and is laying down on the floor of the bathroom.

I'm so crushed but I love her so much that I'm devastated that I may have to end a lifelong friendship with basically my sister. But right now I can't imagine ever forgiving her. I know she's hurting and I'm hurting for her but she violated something so sacred.

Can I forgive her for this?

**tl;dr: best friend of 20 years hit on my fiancé when she was really drunk and hurt from a terrible break up. Can I forgive her?**"
"Dad [42m] doesn't help me do anything because he says ""I am all woman now"" and should handle most things on my own.


He doesn't drive me to the bus stop for school, he doesn't help me buy things I need for projects (he pays almost everything, but doesn't buy them himself even if it's easier for him than for me), he didn't help when I first had my period or needed to buy a bra, he doesn't want to stay in my room for while if I want him to just be there because he says I am supposed to think of my room as a place where no man is allowed in, he expects me to handle most meals.

I can go on, but you get. I don't want any of this anymore, my friends have great dads who are there all the time for them and mine won't even drive to a soccer game.

I told all of this to a friend recently and just cried and cried and cried. She said omg I thought I had it bad but you have SERIOUS daddy issues, and I could only cry more.

I don't know what to do about anything. Just tell me something. How can things get better from here?

**tl;dr:** Dad is totally in his own world and doesn't help me do anything. I am so confused and just want advice."
"My [26F] best friend [26F] is coming home after an unsuccessful self-discovery trip (details in post). How can I help her back into everyday life?


I guess ""unsuccessful"" isn't the best word because I believe she definitely learned about herself. Anyway...

My best friend grew up in a crappy small town. You know, the heroin epidemic kind of small town. Through a series of bad relationships and family problems, she decided at the end of last year that she was going to sell all her possessions, buy an RV and travel the country with her dog. I was wary from the start. 

She set a date - she planned to leave at the end of March. She was going to work a few extra side jobs and put all her money away for the trip. First issue, she has a major FOMO (fear of missing out...because I just learned what that meant). So any money she was able to save, she quickly blew on partying. Each night it was ""i need to say goodbye to these people so i'm just going out for a few drinks"". The departure date quickly approached and she quickly ran out of money. Instead of staying and trying to save more money, she forced her departure and left at the beginning of April. 

Second issue - the RV she bought was old. Minimal miles on it but hadn't been run in years. So, right out the gate, she broke down about 2 hours after she left. Got it fixed, back on the road. Her plan was to travel to Texas to visit her aunt briefly and then move on to Colorado and California to catch a few shows with her favorite band. She finally did get to Texas but not before losing her phone, running out of gas money, and breaking down a few more times. All got fixed.

She met a local musician in Texas. Again, I was wary of the situation. She starts a relationship with this guy and says he's going to travel the country with her. Red flag but I'm a supportive friend so I voice my concerns but ultimately want to see her happy. Which I thought she was until two days ago.

She texts me that we need to talk and if I was free to facetime. We get on the phone and she just starts sobbing. Says this guy's been hitting her, he pulled a gun and knife on her, she's afraid for her life, she doesn't know what to do, she has no money, etc. Now I'm obviously upset that I'm hundreds of miles away and can't kick the crap out of this guy. Luckily she was able to leave his grasps and get back to her aunt's house. We talked for a long time and she realized she needed to come home. A tough choice because she has a hard time swallowing her pride. We make plans to have her sister fly down to Texas and drive back home with her. 

When she gets home, she says she wants to ""hibernate"" and not tell anyone but family that she's back. My question is...how can I be there for her? I know she feels defeated and embarrassed and like she failed.  I'm so relieved she lived through this experience and is able to come home but I know once she's in a better place physically and mentally, she'll want to travel again. I want to be there for her and help her back into life here but I'm not sure what she needs.

tldr: best friend wanted to travel the country, had a bad start, ended up in an abusive relationship, she's coming home and I want to know how I can help her back into life here. "
"Wife (37F) wants me (38M) to talk my cousin (38F) into letting her son (13M) go to a beach party at night after he tried to lie about it and no adult supervision because he's the new kid at school and she won't listen to me when I told her to but out.


My cousin, Emilia moved cities about two weeks ago. She's bought a property here for herself and her children to live in, but while it's undergoing renovations she's staying in the guest house in my backyard. My wife and I (together 12 years and married for 9) have been at odds about my cousins parenting choice that happened on Monday evening. 

Her oldest son, Clarke, has been fitting in pretty nicely at his new school. Clarke has been talking for about over a week about a party he was invited to. He initially told us that it was just a small gathering of friends on a Saturday night at a friend of his house by the name of Jake. Monday evening he was talking to myself and his mom when he has his first slip up in a lie when my cousin asked for Jake's parent phone number. He responded by asking who Jake was. He tried to fix it by saying it had been a long day, and he will go get the number for her from his room. 

He came back 20 minutes later and asked if he could speak to his mom alone. The gist of what happened is that he came clean about his lie. He said there is no Jake for his mom to phone. He said that his friends wanted him to come to some beach party their parents were fine with them going to. He said he knew she shouldn't say yes, so he tried to lie about it. He felt bad about lying do decided to come clean. She told him he's damn right she wouldn't let him go to a beach party until early in the morning with no adults. She told him that he was to stay home and she doesn't want to hear anymore lies. 

My wife heard Emilia chewing out Clarke for trying to pull a fast one on her and later that night spoke to me about it. She told me she felt bad for the kid because he just wants to fit in at school, and have fun with his new friends. She felt that because he came clean on his lie that he should be allowed to go because it's a 15 minute walk from our home to the beach it's happening at. I told her that we should really stay out of this because we're not his parents. I added that I honestly agree with my cousin. No kid should be wondering a beach at 3 am. She told me she agrees, but thought it's a bit harsh. She was trying to convince me to talk to Emilia about just letting him go and calling him every hour or so. I told her that I wouldn't do it, but she she should do it if I don't, because she knows how hard it is to be the new kid. I've told her to drop it and yet, she's adamant about it. How do I get my wife to drop it? 

**TL;DR: My cousins son got caught in a lie about where he was going. He turned out to be intending to go to a beach party with no adults until early in the morning. He's been forbidden to go, and my wife wants us/me to talk my cousin into letting him go because he knows how hard it is to be the new kid.**"
"One of my [M21] friends [F20] is pissed at me because I won't buy her alcohol.


I just turned 21 a short while ago, and of course I've been living it up. My friend recently asked me to buy her some alcohol for a party she was going to and I told her no. She got super upset me, saying I wasn't a ""real friend"". I haven't been able to get a hold of her for two days now. 

Normally I would, but I lucked out and I just received my conditional offer from a local police department and I start the academy in the fall. The absolute last thing I want to do is commit a crime (supplying alcohol to a minor) before I even start my career. I explained this to her and all I got was, ""Nobody would even know.""

True, maybe. But I have to have integrity now. I don't want to fuck this opportunity up. We've been friends since high school, and she's never acted like this before. WTF is going on? What do I do? 

**TL;DR Friend wants me to buy her alcohol, she's underage and I said no. Friend now won't talk to me.**"
"My husband [40M] is upset that his mother [65F] won't babysit for us when she did for his brother [38M]. Should I talk to him about this?


My husband and I have a 10 month son. His brother had children very young and BIL's kids are in their early teens now. When his brother had his children my MIL moved in with BIL and his wife to help out with the children. She has stayed with them for 16-17 years and is very much a part of their family. She babysit the kids when the kids were young, take them to and from school and grandma goes on vacations together with the family. They are very close and BIL takes very good care of MIL. My husband told me that MIL told him she would love to come help him with his kids when he had them (she made that offer years ago). My husband ended up having kids much later than planned. Initially we based our plans on MIL's willingness to help. I would go back to work while MIL watch our son. We are not poor or struggling but we could definitely use the money savings. However, MIL rescinded her offer saying that she's too old to look after young kids now and that she doesn't want to move out of BIL's neighbourhood so DH and I have to change out plans. I don't mind being a SAHP until our child goes to school and I completely understand that his mother is getting older. I can't blame her for not keeping an offer she made more than a decade ago. It's unfortunate, but I don't think it's cause for anger or hurt. 


My husband feels very differently. He finds it ridiculously unfair and upsetting. I haven't said much to him on this because I don't feel like it's my place to say anything. It's his family. DH and I are planning to have a small 1 yr birthday party for our son and he doesn't want to invite BIL, MIL and our niblings because they ""don't care about our son"". He's 100% serious about this. I don't want him to cause drama in his family or stir the pot. I don't know if my view is colored by the fact that I don't have any close family. My own relationship with my mother is strained and VVLC and my father doesn't speak to me at all. My husband's family drove 2.5 hours after I gave birth. BIL, SIL, our nilbings and MIL all came bearing gifts and flowers for the baby and MIL cooked and meal prepped for me for the week, cleaned the house before the baby came home from the hospital and that was the first time I ate hearty home cooked meal in weeks. During my pregnancy I dreaded giving birth. I felt so alone knowing I won't have any family there to support me while all my friends had so much family support. DH told his mom and she insisted on coming down here despite recovering on hip surgery. I felt so touched and happy. I do not want my husband to ruin his relationship with his family over this issue. Should I talk to him about this or just stay out of it? 

tldr: husband is upset and angry that his mom doesn't want to look after our kids when she did for his brother. His brother had his kids years ago and his mother's health is deteriorating. He can't look beyond the fact that it's unfair. Should I talk to him about this before he ruins his relationship with his family?  "
"My (25f) bf of 7 months (30m) is saying that I screwed his friend out of $500, I disagree. Need opinions.


I met my boyfriend in early January. For the first three months of our relationship, I had my own apartment, which we were at 100&amp;#37; of the time. I have been trying to save money since then as I am currently unemployed due to depression (I occasionally cam - like online stripping- to pay my credit card off each month).  Because of this, we’ve been bouncing back and forth from the tiny room he rents, my parents vacation home, and a little garden house in my parents backyard.  

He has been paying $400/month in rent to his two roommates, a couple, this entire time.

I was planning on spending the summer working at a summer camp, but at the last minute, I decided not to go. Mostly because I wanted to be with my boyfriend.

My mother said I could live with them in their house, or in their vacation home two hours away, for free.   My parents have always been really strict with me about having a job and paying rent, but they are being really understanding about the depression and not making me pay them rent this year (they are well off due to lots of hard work). 

I still would rather not live with them.

Which is why when my boyfriend suggested I just move in with him and the other couple, I decided to give it a try. Honestly, I was hoping he’d suggest this before he mentioned it, so I feel like it was something we both equally wanted.

His room was absolutely disgusting when I first moved in June 5.  I paid his roommates $500 (so they received a total of $900 from us that month) and spent the next three days cleaning, organizing, hauling out an old bedroom set that had completely fallen to pieces, etc. All of his clothes were dirty, I washed and hung and folded EVERYTHING of his so that I would have space for my things.

It was a tight squeeze, not just in our room, but in the apartment as well. The place was probably 1200 sq ft, one bathroom, no yard, with two 100 lb german shepherds who weren’t allowed to be there.   The townhouse is in off-base military housing (my guy and the other roommate are both active duty), so technically, roommates are not allowed either.

I enjoyed being able to be with my boyfriend so much  right at first, but quickly I started to feel like a bang maid. His sex drive has always been way higher than mine, but us being on his turf made it harder for me to say no when I didn’t want it. He also literally never lifted a finger, leaving me every morning to clean the huge mess he would make the night before. I spent about an hour cleaning and doing laundry every morning, whereas if it was just me, I would probably spend about 30 minutes doing these things. 

My boyfriend left to go underway for three days, and while he was gone, one of the dogs got into our room. The dog ripped out the screen, jumped onto the balcony, and jumped off the balcony only to then get hit by a car (he is fine, not even a sprain, still terrifying for everyone especially the owners). I don’t think this is my fault though. The other couple disagrees though. The girl totally blamed me and made me feel super awkward. 

There was never a lease, there was only this conversation, 

“So how long do you plan on staying here?”

“Idk, probably just the summer, thank you so much for letting me rent with bf.”

So I decided, on June 25 after being there for 20 days, that I didn’t want to spend the little money I have to continue living there, when I have many BETTER options that I don’t even have to pay for. 

When my boyfriend got home, he was furious. He was mad that I left without talking to him about it (understandable - though he wouldn’t have let me if I talked to him about it -  which is why I didn’t).   I just explained to him that I really didn’t have the money and it just wasn’t worth it for me. 

This is when he started saying that I was screwing his friend over. He said that the friend has been counting on my $500 (friend and wife probably make about 6k combined in socal, so they aren’t poor) to make the rent for July.

I said this wasn’t my problem, there was never a lease. The way I saw it, they got an unexpected $500 for June.  

My boyfriend says he can’t leave his friend hanging, and is going to give him the $500 anyways even though I won’t be staying there hardly at all (maybe once a week… i feel awkward after the dog thing happened).   This isn’t a loan, he’s ‘paying my rent,’ as he puts it.

I feel like he thinks I’m a shitty person and also thinks i ‘owe’ him now for ‘paying my rent.’  

Who is the crazy one here?

TL;DR   I moved in with bf and another couple for 3 weeks ago, no lease, but had planned to stay the summer. It's not working out, I've already left with my things, bf trying to say I owe rent to the roommates for July because they had been expecting it."
"UPDATE: My wife (27F) thinks I'm (27M) emotionally involved with a female coworker


Original post: www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uk1gu/my_wife_27f_thinks_im_27m_emotionally_involved/

tl;dr - talked to my wife and we agree I need to distance myself from Jan. Also, we agree Jan is purposefully or naively getting too close to me. And I'm not a slob husband, I help with the house and kids whenever I'm home :) 

UPDATE:
Thank you for all the helpful replies! I'm amazed at how good everyone is at reading between the lines. Like, way to call me out on everything I didn't put in the post and basically detail all my insecurities and faults that I didn't even recognize I had.

I talked to my wife and showed her the original post and the replies (after agreeing with her that yes, I was still upset when I posted this, so yes, it was biased). We talked about most of the replies and comments replies. What I didn't know until that conversation was that Jan talked about me all the time on their trip together, which is what really clued my wife in to the fact that something was wrong with Jan. We agreed that she responded to the situation the way her mother usually did when she wanted something done: getting angry enough to scare the other person into listening. Which is why my original post is so defensive.

And yes, I was in the wrong for not noticing the attention Jan was seeking, and for giving to much attention to her.

And yes, most of you are right, she's overworked and constantly tired because of the kids, so she was quite upset when Jan came over for a game night (with our mutual friend Taylor, 26M) after the kids were asleep.

But, some of you accused me of being a lazy do-nothing husband who still acts like he's single...which I would disagree with. From the moment I wake up until I leave for work, and then from the moment I get home until they're asleep, I help take care of the kids and clean the house.

And yes, Jan isn't currently dating anyone and when questioned about dating will say she's tired of it and that guys never ask her out anymore. Something is up with her, we agree.

UPDATE 2:

We think Jan inherited something from her mother (look at them moms again, passing down genes and behaviors). I didn't know until I talked to my wife (Jan told her previously) that Jan's mom has dissociative identity disorder. So there may be some other identify or behavior emerging when Jan is around me. We get the feeling that Jan has been comparing all of her dates to me, thinking that because they're not at the stage I'm at (traits/skills gained during marriage) that they're not good enough. My wife also pointed out that Jan had her hair done (which was, as Jan said, a coincidence because she had the appointment a month in advance), makeup done (unusual for Jan), and a nice shirt on the night she came over for game night.

Sooooo yes, I will be distancing myself from Jan probably permanently. And our office is moving soon, so I will make sure her desk is far from mine in the new building.

Yes, I was upset when I wrote the original post. Turns out I misheard my wife (we were driving while talking about this) and she said ""Men dont need to talk as much as women. I don't know how they deal with these things, but women need someone to talk to."" She was trying to get help from her friend who is apparently pretty level-headed but is dealing with an emotionally detached husband."
"One of my best friends (27M) suddenly dropped out of an international trip I (32M) payed for because his immature girlfriend (20F) gave him an ultimatum over it. What should I do here?


For years now, one of my best friends and I had been planning an international trip to travel around, eat awesome stuff, and more or less just have a ton of fun visiting some places we'd always dreamed of.  About six months ago, he, myself, my wife, and another one of our best friends actually started making plans and ensured the vacation time to make it happen.  

We booked the flights and some of the hotels around February, with the trip finally planned for much of the month of October.  My wife and I are in a good spot in life and our friends are a little younger and have struggled with the current economy, so we decided we'd gift the flight tickets to our friends.

Ever since then, we've all been planning all the cool stuff we're going to do and see.  At least until this past weekend when he suddenly and almost inexplicably dropped out.

Long story short, much of this is at the behest of his twenty year old girlfriend who has a long way to go in terms of maturity.  Through a number of obvious factors, it's abundantly clear that she has him on a very tightly controlled leash.  She more or less tells him where he has to be, when he has to be there, and who he can or can't associate with.   It had been made clear to me that she had made an ultimatum to him: Either she was going to go on the trip as well, or he wasn't going to go either.  Problem was, this wasn't really possible.  Seats weren't available on our flight anymore, and the rooms I'd gotten already had a very strict four person limit.

After a lot of back and forth from him for about a month, and after he continually insisted that he'd be going, he dropped the news on me two days ago that he wasn't anymore.  I kind of pressed him on it since this would potentially cause me to waste a lot of money and certainly cause a big hassle on my end that he'd no longer have to be a part of.  He eventually let it out that he couldn't go because his relationship would be over if he did.

It hasn't been exclusive to this particular instance with the trip.  He's also been avoiding or ditching other friends as well.  Many of our other close mutual friends have been exhausted with him blowing them off, avoiding them, or just generally being a dick lately at well.  I know that he's more or less cut himself off from everyone who isn't specifically a friend of his girlfriend, and he's slowly dissolving everything with everyone that he'd known prior to her.  It's kind of a weird relief to know that whatever is going on isn't just a problem with us.  

I'm trying to remind myself that whatever is going on probably isn't really from him, it's his girlfriend trying to control him behind the scenes.  Whenever their relationship ultimately crashes and burns, I want to be able to forgive him for all of this mess and just move on and forget it because of that.  He's inevitably going to be completely cut off from all of his friends after their toxic relationship is over, and I'd at least for my part not hold her behavior against him.

So not only is his and his girlfriend's behavior so toxic to everyone around him, but it is actually causing problems for everyone around him.  I am now left with a mess of fixing travel plans because of a problem they've caused.  What can be done about all of this?

------

**TL;DR**: After having planned it for years and having had it booked for months, a friend backed out of an expensive international trip (that I paid for) at the insistence of his crazy and immature twenty year old girlfriend.   He's cutting himself off from everyone at her behest, and now I've got to clean up a ton of mess that they've caused.  What's my move here?"
"I (24/M) accidentally shoved a coworker (26/F) to the pavement after she snuck up on me really late outside of the office and now she’s completely ignoring me.


First, I want to explain that I don’t go around shoving people for fun. It was late, the parking lot was empty except for my car and a few others scattered around, and I was already on edge due to an incident that we had all heard about a couple of nights prior. A guy in finance was held at knife point in that same parking lot. I had something similar happen to me when I was in university. Basically, there was a lot going through my head that night. 

She snuck up on me really quietly to hand my phone back to me, which I had apparently forgotten back at the office, on my desk. We work really close together. I’d call her a friend. That’s why she decided to return my phone to me, I guess. It was really windy. I didn’t hear her approach. She tapped me on my shoulder. I thought it was knife guy, so I promptly swung an arm around and shoved her off. 

By the time I turned to look, she was on the pavement and my phone had slipped out of her hand. 

Right away I apologized, tried to help her up, thanked her for returning my phone to me, which I didn’t know that I’d left at my desk until then. She sort of brushed me off, got up on her own, told me it was fine, ignored my apologies and walked off. 

Also she’s quite small. About 5’4” and really thin. I’m on the taller side. The shove clearly hurt her in a way that I didn’t intend for it to. In fact I didn’t intend to hurt her at all. I didn’t know it was her. I just panicked. 

This happened a week ago. I’ve been giving her space since. We usually talk a lot, eat together, etc. Clearly I fucked up and we both feel weird about it. I genuinely didn’t mean to hurt her or to scare her or do anything like that. I’m truly sorry for what I did. It doesn’t seem to me like she’s told anyone. Not any of our coworkers or HR. In that way I’m hoping she knows and believes that it was truly an accident. I said as much right then in the moment, when I apologized. 

In part I want to talk to her again, tell her I’m sorry for what I did, but I don’t want to push communication if she’s not ready. That said maybe she’s waiting for me to say something. I’m not sure what to do. She hasn’t said a word to me, or looked in my direction at all for a week now. I feel really bad. I don’t know what to do in this situation. 

What do you guys think? 

**tl;dr** It was late, the parking lot was empty. There was an attack that same week. I panicked when I felt a tap on my shoulder, swung my arm around and by the time I turned around, she was on the pavement. I said sorry more times than I can remember, tried to help her up, etc. She got up on her own, said it was okay, avoided eye contact, walked off and hasn’t talked to or looked at me in the week since. I don’t know what to do. We’re friends. Or I guess we used to be. I’m not sure. What do I do besides apologize again?"
"My [37F] husband [42M] refuses to parent as a unified front.


My husband and I have been having a rough marriage for about 1.5 years and have been in counseling for most of that. One of the recurring issues is that he undermines my parenting.

He will be more lenient on the kids than we previously agreed, not defend me when the kids are rude to me (but I will for him) and will outright tell the kids “5 more minutes is ok” when I just said “x is over”. We have had counselors explain to him that this is not good parenting, but he still just does not seem to get it and will undermine me with the kids to get back at me on something else he may be upset about.

Our current problem that I’m looking for feedback on: He doesn’t like my Dad but I wanted to visit him with the kids for a long weekend. And frankly we aren’t getting along that well now and I could use the space from him. It is a 4-hour drive each way. He eventually reluctantly agreed to let me take the kids for the weekend and he said he’d actually enjoy the time alone anyways. So, all should be good – the kids will have fun with me, he can have a weekend on his own. Obviously, he is welcome to schedule another trip sometime just with the kids if he wants to also.

The problem is he keeps telling our kids “its up to them” if they want to go or not. But I don’t think it is up to the kids – it is up to the parents. And we agreed they are going. So now rather than having my two little kids excited about this fun mini-trip, they are crying and complaining that they don’t want to go and they want to stay with Daddy.

My kids do like to stay home and play with Daddy, but I know they will also have fun on this trip. I have a ton of really fun kids activities planned that I know they will love.

Our kids are little (5yo and 9yo), so it’s pretty easy to get them excited and looking forward to anything we suggest, but especially easy when it’s a trip like this and some of their favorite activities are scheduled (e.g. horseback riding).

This exact scenario has played out many times in the past and it drives me crazy. And Daddy just sits there silently and says that he won’t force his kids to do something they don’t want to do. So I’m the mean Mom and drag the kids into the car. Of course, 3 minutes later they are fine and we always have a lot of fun on our outings (big or small).

I wish, for our kid’s happiness and stability, that my husband would stick to our agreement in front of the kids and help create positivity and excitement for them, rather than drama and tears when there really is no option for the kids.

So, am I overreacting? Is this an example of being a non-unified front? It is ok for BOTH parents to say “You are going on trip x. Have fun, it will be great!”, right? I am 100&amp;#37; certain that if we both did that everyone would be happy and there would be no more fighting or tears from our kids.

Tl;dr: I feel like my husband undermines my parenting by giving our kids the option of going on a trip or not, even though we previously agreed the kids would go on this trip and there really is no option for them not to go."
"I (31F) suspect my husband (34M) of 5 years, wants to hookup with a mutual friend. I've trusted him so much around her because he says he sees her as a little sister. I ready some messages her sent to her, it seems different. Am I crazy?


So this friend, Amy (29F) is well, gorgeous. Like movie star beauty and she's also a very nice person. Her grew up with Amy, they've known each other since he was 10 and she was 5 or so.

Amy was his sister's best friend, so while they were never close when he was a teen. She was around his house a lot.

Well tragedy struck when his sister died in a car crash while she was driving to meet Amy. That was when his sister and Amy was 19 and my husband was 25.

They've been close ever since, mainly as they live like 10 mins apart in the city. They hang out a lot, coffee, drinks, dancing, clubbing. In fact, the night I met him, he was with Amy and I thought she was his date.

Anyway, she wasn't, we started dating shortly after. He told me about Amy and his sister and how he feels connected to his dead sister through Amy. I got that, and while I was insanely jealous of Amy at first. She was soooo nice, like literally the definition of a sweet, but albeit broken girl (she suffers with depression and anxiety).

Amy and I have gotten very close too over the years. I consider her one of top 5 friends and we do hangout alone every so often.

Last weekend (I've been bottling this for almost a week). She and I went out to a mutual friends bday.   
Amy got way too drunk, I even suspect someone may have drugged her drink. Anyway...she begged me to msg my husband and tell him she's ok. She said he worries about her a lot.

I found that super weird, and ignored her requests for sometime (thought it was just drunken talk). But she kept insisting.

Then she begged me to read their chat history to see how much he cares. 

Well that piqued my curiosity so I did it.

I honestly, don't know why, but she was sad, crying and telling me to call my husband and tell him how important he is to her. Before, you think she was being mean or trying to confess an affair (which is what I thought at first), she wasn't. She was genuinely sad, crying, feeling sick and telling me the only person who makes feel ok is my husband. 

So anyway, I checked her phone and what I found was weird........so I honestly do sort of know my husband and her are close and that he does worry and care. I know he sometimes has long conversations with her where he's telling her that he loves her, and that she'll be ok etc. I would often be in the same room so obviously I'd think, their love was platonic. 

Remember again, as I got to know Amy, I genuinely believed she saw my husband as a brother. They're not sexual at all. They do dance, get touchy etc. But it's always in a friendly way, can't describe it but I know. Going off on a tangent here too, but I know he's not sexually attracted to her. He doesn't check her out, stare at her cleavage or legs. 

So anyway, back to checking her phone....... 

I was not prepared for what I saw....... they appear to have extremely loving, caring, supportive, intimate conversations. Far deeper than anything he and I have ever talked about. He's so open about his feelings. He tells her things he never tells me. He talks to her about his work problems, where he eats, sends her random pics of where he is (stuff he never shows me). He talks about our sex life (mostly good stuff). He never appeared to bad talk me thankfully. Often times, he'd say, how much he loves me when chatting with her (and she's say how I'm perfect too).  But there just way too many kiss, heart, hug emoji's and just generally 'sweet talk' between them.

It left me feeling very odd.....like I didn't know my husband at all. 

So the affair fears are eased, possibly this is emotional cheating. Hiding stuff from me but sharing stuff with her just rubs me the wrong way. However, he never says anything bad about me. He actually says so much nice stuff in fact. The truth is, after reading it a bit (i spent like 20 mins reading their chats while Amy was knocked out sleeping on my lap), I'm not mad at either of them. They both seem to love me a lot. Amy and him, did not flirt once. They do send selfies, but it's not sexy selfies per say. Just things like 'Check me out at X' or 'is this outfit good for tonight?'.

I've told just one friend, today at lunch.

Basically she said, what if Amy were a guy or actually his little sister, would you be upset? And the truth is, no I wouldn't. But i also do think, he and she wouldn't be sending kiss emoticons if she was his male friend of sister too...

I have not confronted him, and also Amy seems to have forgotten everything that night.

But I'm confused, should I confront him? I think I should as I've been passive aggressive for him this week and he probably will figure out somethings up. 

Also, is this a cause for concern? Obviously, their dynamic isn't a normal male-female platonic relationship too, so looking at it with that lens will make it look far worse than it is (I assume).

 **TL;DR**

Husband has a best friend (female, Amy) who was the best friend of his dead sister. They're insanely close and seem to have a platonic relationship. Amy loves me and I do really like her. However, she is absolutely gorgeous but also has a lot mental health issues. Amy and I hang out occasionally and last week we went to a party. She got way too drunk and started missing my husband, telling me how perfect and loving he is. She then made me read their whatsapp conversations to see how perfect he is (her words). I saw that he and her are actually far closer and more intimate than I imagined. But their conversations do seem innocent, no sexual flirting, no bad talking me (quite the opposite). 

I do feel slightly betrayed, but also happy they both love me so much too. 

Thanks, 

Confused AF"
"When she apologizes, my [28M] wife [28F] just says “I’m sorry, whether you forgive me is up to you.” I need more. Is that controlling?


I was raised to give a full apology. I say “I’m sorry for X, and I recognize how much pain that caused you. I’m going to do a, b, and c to make sure X doesn’t happen again.” No excuses, full responsibility and commitment to be better.

When my wife does something hurtful and I ask for an apology, I get “I’m sorry.” I’ve tried asking her to expand, and she responds with “just tell me what you want me to say.” Then she’ll parrot back what I say, which feels very empty. I’ve also asked what she’s going to do differently and she said she hopes that it won’t happen again.

I feel like I’m going crazy. Is this normal? She says that it’s controlling to want more than one apology (one would be fine if it were a real apology). But I’m left with the impression that she doesn’t feel bad, just wants the issue resolved so we can move on.

***tl;dr*** My wife doesn’t really take responsibility when she apologizes and says that I’m controlling when I ask for more. Am I controlling?"
"[personal issues] Mother in law wants grandchildren because she has cancer but I (f22) don’t feel ready


Hi, I need really good advice. Sorry for any mistakes. 


My husband (m25) and I (f22) got married this February, been together 1,5 year. Since then my mother in law was really adamant that I get pregnant as fast as possible to the point of talking to me about it once every 2 days. But for multiple reasons I am not ready. For example my husband and I have some marital issues that we need to sort out before we think of bringing a little one to the family, we are going to move in a new apartment in about ~3 months and there is a lot to do. And I don’t want to get out too much personal info but right now at work is a very busy period which is stressful and it can be physical as I have to do a lot a heavy lifting. All in all this is not the best situation. 


It was all fine and we were going to wait but today we learned that mother in law have cancer and it is not very bright. They estimate 5 years with little percentage. And now I understand why she is so insistant. I really really want to grant her a grandchild but the time is really not right... I really don’t feel like having a kid just yet. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to sound egoistical... but it really puts me in a bad position. I don’t know what to do. Please reddit help me. 

Tldr: mother in law wants grandchildren because of her cancer but I’m not ready

"I[24M] feel like my present for my gf's[22F] birthday is inadequate and somewhat childish compared to what her friends and siblings got her and now I fear she might not like it.


My gf's birthday is this Saturday. We've been together for 3.5 years now and in these years, this would be only the second time where we could celebrate her birthday properly. Ellie (my gf) loves to joke that the perfect present for her birthday would be for us to spend the day together. 

Anyway, this year we have planned to have a nice dinner with her close friends and her two siblings at our place and then we would go to a club. I know that my gf wouldn't request it herself but we all have got her presents for her birthday. 

Mine is something that I thought was cute and that she'd love it. Ellie loves The Muppets. Growing up she would use to watch it all the time. Even now whenever she has a few hours to kill, she'd watch an episode or two even though she had already watched said episode over a hundred times. 

Back home she had a bunch of puppets from the show and she used to tell me that when she was little, those were her best friends. She still loves puppets and has some at our place and  now for her birthday I thought that it would be an excellent idea to buy her a custom made look-a-like puppet of herself.

I found a great site online that would offer such a service and after all was done a few days ago the puppet arrived. It's really well made, I gotta handed it to the people that did it. Every small detail is there and I am really impressed. I gift wrapped it and now it sits safely back home with my parents. 

I really thought that my idea was great. I know from experience that my gf loves these kinds of gifts, nothing overly fancy or flashy (although some might argue that this is fancy enough) but more meaningful than anything. However after conversating with her friends and learning what they have got for her, I feel as if mine is not up to par. 

I mean her two best friends from her childhood got her this really nice golden necklace that my gf wanted since she was in high school but never could afford. Her brothers got her this extremely nice engraved wrist watch. It's something that their late father used to own and this is a replica of his watch. Her friends from uni got her a weekend long vacation at this famous resort here in our country. 

And in the midst of all that, here I am with ... a puppet. I feel as if my gift is ineadequate and somewhat childish, while her friends got her gifts that mean something to her like the watch and the necklace or something really usefull like a vacation that she desperately needs since she has been really stressed from studying and working almost all the time. 

I am at a point where I consider scraping my orginal idea and buying her something else. But I don't know if my finances would allow for something like this. I am just really worried that I will be letting my girlfriend down. I missed her two previous birthdays (although I made up to her both times) since I was working those days and now that I finally can celebrate it with her, the best thing I came up with was a puppet. Do I have something to worry about guys or do you think my gf would like the present? Would you be upset if your SO gave you such a present for your birthday? Should I get her something else? I am just really worried that I'd mess up here and I absolutely don't want to do this.


tl;dr My gf's birthday is this Saturday. She is a big fan of The Muppets and by default absolutely loves puppets. So for her birhday I got her this really well custom made look-a-like puppet of herself. After finding out what kind of gifts her friends and siblings got her, I feel like my gift is ineadequte and somewhat childish. I am really worried that I am gonna mess up here and I wonder if she will like my gift. "
"My [25F] Mom [47F] is battling terminal illness. My partner [29M] of 5 years thinks she's not dying fast enough


My mom has stage 4 lung cancer. It has spread to many organs. When she was first diagnosed they weren't sure if she would live 6 month but 3 years in and shes still fighting. In fact up until 3 month ago we thought it was well controlled. 


They discovered metastasis in a new organ few months ago and it was growing rapidly indicating the meds she was on wasn't working for that section. She just completed her 3rd round of radio and we are waiting on  the outcome. 


My bf Huns has never met my mom yet he hates her and insults her at every chance he gets 


Im to be blamed for this unfortunately. When we met I was going through some things and I confided in Huns about my childhood. 


Now I dont want to go into too much detail but my family is from another culture where it's okay to beat your kids for not listening to you. I was abused as a child to the point I almost ran away. I hated my childhood and i didn't feel like I had a childhood. 


I dont hate my mom though. She has made some terrible mistakes which she has owned up to long time ago and she has changed. She was struggling with mental health problems too which shes gotten help for. she has also made incredible sacrifices for her children. 

I know she loves me but more importantly i love her and I have 2 young brothers (13 And 15). I dont want them to grow up without a mother. 


My bf has been anything but supportive through out all of this. Not only has he not been supportive but he's been adding a lot of stress on to my plate too. 


Back when she was diagnosed he would comment on how she had it coming and how it was karma 


When the treatment was working well he would make comments about why she wasnt ""dead yet"". How lung cancer patients die quicker. 


We had many fights over this and I thought we came to an agreement that regardless of what he thinks of my mother- she was still my mother and I wanted her in my life and I didn't want him to make negative comments about her. In turn I wouldn't bring up my mother to him either In good light because that seemed to have pissed him off. 



Just to clarify- hans has never been abused himself so he didn't understand why I could forgive. 


He didn't understand that this was my past and pain and that it was ultimately my decision to forgive and have her in my life before she passes. 



Onto 2 days ago. I was stressing out as I was late in my period by a week. Huns didn't seem to care at all and commented on how I was being dramatic. 


I felt really alone and we got talking. I expressed that I didn't want to have a baby before marriage as my family is pretty traditional.


Well he goes on a tangent about how my ""abusive "" mother couldn't be traditional and how she was a hypocrite. My mother had nothing to do with our topic at hand.


She had just finished her last radiotherapy session recently and he has not asked once how she was going. Not asked once how I was coping even though he knew I've been taking several days off to go with my mother to the hospital .

The first chance he gets he calls her names when it had NOTHING to do with anything we were talking about ?! 


I can't take this. I can't handle him on top of everything else that's happening. I feel so alone in all of this and I know when she passes its going to be much worse because not only will he not support my grief but he will be cruel and will insult her. I can't have him talk like that about  her.


I want to end things over this. I dont care if I'm pregnant I dont want a child or a family or anything with someone who can't support me emotionally. Who thinks my emotions are dramatic 


But I dont know if im being too harsh or if the stress is clouding my judgement.  


Tl;Dr: SO isn't supportive through bigstress and grief.  Not sure what to think

"My [23F] boyfriend [24M] is convinced my parents are abusive because they expect too much of me. I love my parents and don't feel the same way. Bf insists I get help.


So yeah my bf \[24 male\] of 1.5 years has always had beef with my parents for no reason. I guess there are some cultural differences that make our upbringings different. My parents are first generation immigrants from Nigeria and my boyfriend is a white American. I'm very close to my parents, esp my mom, and this seems to rub my bf the wrong way. He is largely out of contact with both his parents and only talks to his dad on holidays.  He says his parents are mentally disturbed and it's better to distance ourselves from them. 

Anyways my parents were very strict and very academically demanding when I was growing up. However this was the norm with our immigrant community and while I felt stress at the time I feel like it's made me to become a stronger adult. I really appreciate their method of parenting and I hope to impart some of the same on my kids one day. However when I tell stories about my childhood to my bf, he is convinced I had an abusive childhood. He points to the fact that my parents restricted a lot of activities in my youth (like tv, internet, going out with friends, dating) if I hadn't finished schoolwork/kept up grades as textbook abuse. I really don't agree. I think without my parents' brand of parenting I would've been seriously out of control. I was really impulsive in my teenage years and didn't have good priorities at all, mostly due to a bad crowd I fell in with. 

So now in adulthood I'm very close to my parents. My mom and I text all the time and I call them at least once a week to update them on my life. My bf thinks this makes me codependent and he thinks I've been brainwashed by my parents to not be able to leave their influence. He's always trying to convince me to reduce my level of contact with them or even cut them out completely like he did. He says it's the best choice he's ever made and he's sure I'd feel the same. 

I'm getting pretty annoyed at his insistence I'm somehow messed in the head for loving my parents. I tell him families are different and while some people may find my parents hard to deal with I love them and I WANT them in my life. He keeps insisting that I go to his therapist who helped with his parental issues. He thinks his therapist could ""talk some sense into me"" and basically help me recognize my parents' abuse. 

Honestly what should I do about this? Should I even bothering educating my bf about my family at this point? He honestly believes I was abused and has even told our friends about my ""damaged childhood."" It really pisses me off because I feel like he does not understand my immigrant background at all or my family's struggles. 

Tl:DR: Boyfriend is convinced I've been abused by my immigrant parents because they were strict and academically demanding. I disagree and am actually very close to my parents in adulthood. He thinks I need to see his therapist so I can see this supposed abuse. Is this even worth fighting about?"
"Boyfriend [25] asked me [F/24] if he could visit female friend in another state. Am I crazy for being upset?


Boyfriend and I have been together for about 4.5 years (though not continuously). Last summer, he visited a friend who lives in another distant state. Later that summer, they hooked up and he wound up lying to me about it (and let me travel by plane to come see him before telling me). They’ve got some kind of romantic history prior to this event as well. We weren’t exclusive at that time but it was a whole thing, but I’ve been starting to heal from the damage. I wanted to forgive and trust him again.

A few days ago he asked if it would be ok if he visited her again this summer (solo visit, he didn’t ask me to come along but I can’t anyway). I was floored that he’d even ask and basically responded by sobbing, unable to speak for a while. After 20 minutes  of me not saying anything and crying he told me he wasn’t going to go because I matter too much to him. 

One of the conditions of our current relationship is that he needs to be able to maintain his friendship with this girl he’s trying to visit. Before we decided to get back together, I told him that I’d hate to restrict his ability to have friendships. Now, I hate that I can’t just let go and be cool with him visiting her - I feel like a hypocrite. I want to want him to go. I also hate that he even thought it would be ok to ask if he could go after everything that happened with this girl last summer. Am I insane and/or too insecure in this relationship for it to be viable? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend asked if he could visit a girl in another state who he has a history with. Am I crazy for being upset?"
"I've lost a lot of respect for my Dad


I'm  16 years old and my parents are hard working people, they buy me the  things I need and give me gifts for my birthday/Christmas. I appreciate  that they do these things, but I'm starting to dislike them as people  and its getting harder and harder to truly respect them.

Ever  see those guys who would go insane if they feel ""disrespected""? That's  my dad, it doesn't matter who you are he'll just go off on you no matter  what. This one time, my brother and I was playing the playstation 3 and  my dad told me to get off because he wanted to play. So as we left the  room I said to my brother ""I thought this was our ps3"". My dad heard me  and came into my room pissed. He picked me up off the floor and got in  my face and started yelling at the top of his lungs telling me how he  pays for everything I have so that makes it his. So he threw my nintendo  ds across the room (He didn't pay for it by the way, my Uncle bought it  for me). Everytime I somehow disrespected him he would make me do push  ups, still made me do them even my arms were giving out. Sometimes if I  stopped because I couldn't do them anymore he would get his belt and  whip my butt or back. I was 9 years old at the time so I didn't see  anything wrong with this, I thought every kid went through this when  they ""disrespected their parents"". I  was always afraid of my dad, I  didn't really speak to him much because of that. Him and I have no  relationship at all. I started to realize this was wrong when I spoke to  a friend of mine about this. We both disliked our fathers so we kind of  shared our experiences. He looked at me with a shocked look on his face  when I shared and he said ""Dude, that's not okay"".

When  my brother and I were younger and when we were sitting in the car while  my parents were driving, we would just have fun having a good time  laughing. But sometimes my dad would be on the phone and when we laughed  with each other he would turn around grab our legs and squeeze the hell  out of them, this resulted with us crying because of it. At the age of  15 I decided to put all that was in the past behind me and try start  talking to my dad more. My dad has this thing with assuming that people  have attitudes and it flips him out and he starts to have one. So he  tells me to go help my brother with his football equipment and out of  nowhere he says ""Don't do it with an attitude either"". All I responded  with was ""I don't have an attitude"". He somehow thought that I was  ""challenging"" him and when I tried to explain that I wasn't challenging  him at all he yelled at me to ""shut up"" and he started slamming doors  and yelling. He then shouted at the top of his lungs ""Don't ever come to  me if you need anything in life, you won't get nothing!"". He then  apologized after my mom talked to him about it, I accepted his apology  but that stuck with me for a while and it still does. I just lost all of  my respect for him when that happened. He talks to my mom that way as  well, and I really don't like that. I know its not my place to be  talking about how he treats my mom but I feel like he thinks he's  somehow above her and that he's in charge. I feel like that I'm in ""his""  house not my ""parents'"" house.

I finally  had the courage to tell my mom how I felt about this. When I was 13 I  brought up the time my dad once pulled me out of my bed (I slepped on  the top bunk) and he really hurt my arm. He did this because of one of  our ""disrespectful"" moments. And when that happened they told me to not  tell anyone why my arm was hurting, they even thought about not taking  me to school because of it. This all happened when I was about 10 years  old. So when I brought this up, my mom talked to my dad about while I  was in another room in bed. I heard him say ""I'm tired of my kids being  so sensitive"".

I'm 16 now and while most  of this stuff has stopped (my parents mostly work all day now) it still  sticks with me. It bothers me honestly, especially that they see nothing  wrong with this. I just don't like being around my parents anymore. I  try to get out of the house whenever I get the chance. There's even more  info as to why I don't like them in another post made.

But honestly this stuff still bothers me, and I don't know what to do about it.

tl,dr: My dad had anger issues and ended up saying and making me do things out of anger. "
"Ex-friend (20/30sF) discovered that my husband (30sM) had a drug addiction in his late teens and early 20s. She called CPS to ""rescue"" our babies (3M, 9 month old baby girl).


Hello, relationships.


My head is spinning a little right now still, sorry. Let me preface by saying this: he had a slight problem with pills growing up because he was a trans + gay youth, parents junkies, poor, and was an easy target for bullies. He has been clean for 9 years. Barely takes aspirin. When he had given birth to our babies, he had to he strong armed to take the epidural and other drugs. He is clean. Sober. Safe. Our children are safe. His parents are getting clean. (See prior posts for more history.)

End preface.

Enter Julia. Julia just moved here about 3 weeks ago, maybe less time. She is white. This is maybe weird to state, but she is... uhhh. White suburbia, maybe has 1 friend that is of coloured, doesn't seem at all street smart... Just... Very sheltered in a way that was awkward and off putting when I first met her. Little stupid. Literally the first meeting I had with her she asked if my daughter was adopted (we are a multi racial family, my daughter is pale like her father... Our son stole all of the dark genes, we swear. He is dark haired, almost darker than me, dark eyes...). She was very confused when my son came over and asked if she was step daughter... after being told that she is mine, but her father (I clarified that they were trans and is biologically their mother because she didn't know what trans/transgender is). And then asked if I was sure because my daughter ""was a white baby!"". Despite the awkward first meeting, we got along well. Mostly. She has 2 little ones my son's age and they play together a lot. One night when we had invited her over for dinner, we had (slightly) spicy noodles and she was dismayed the entire night about not being able to breastfeed her youngest one tonight because ""her milk would be spicy!"" And slapped her bous hand when he tried to eat the noodles because ""he's very white!!! It's going to burn his tum!!!"" 

For context, your average ramen bowl was no spicier than these noodles.

Recently, Julia tried to bring up about a friend of hers that overdosed on prescription pills. We tried to be sympathetic, but she stopped us immediately and said that the friend deserved to die for it. We were all drinking. Not heavily, but Bostonian level drinking. (Also to clarify, my husband was not drinking... He is pregnant so.)

My husband mentioned that he had a drug problem when he was young and told her what made him develop the habit. By the end, she was crying. Like... sobbing. Uncontrollably about how there was no way that he could be healthy and sober now, something was wrong with the kids because of his addiction, he was a drug dealer (!?!?!?!?!?!?)... and left. Blocked on Facebook. 


Not too long later, CPS comes a walking around and says that someone called to report that my husband was a drug addict and I was covering for him.

Julia says she called because she feared the children being **further** abused. She has since blocked us on Facebook, but told others at a local park to not play with us because we had gotten caught with drugs. Not true. We didn't even have weed in the apartment. But already, we've had playmates fall out with us and when my boy goes up to play with another baby, the child gets called away from him.

Realistically, what can we do than try to tell people she's lying? We're well known in our little circle and feel harshly judged.

Tldr: Julia thinks a past addiction will stay with you forever. Tried to get our kid's taken away."
