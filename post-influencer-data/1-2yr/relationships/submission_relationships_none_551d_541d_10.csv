"My “enemy” (21/F) cared for me (21/F) after being drugged and protected me from a creep

"My [18F] friend [18M] held my hand today when we were walking home. I liked it a lot, and I told him that, but he’s been ignoring me for the whole day. Did I scare him off?


Idk what happened to this account because I can’t post anything on it. I’ll try updating you guys on a different account (/u/jong22)

Also, I’m seeing him again soon, thanks for all the advice!

- - -

I've known my friend since high school. We go to the same university, and we live close by so we walk home together every day.

Today, out of nowhere, he held my hand. He’s a really shy person so this was completely unexpected. He looked nervous, so I said that his warm hands felt nice on a cold day. He didn't expect me to reciprocate, and we just walked the rest of the way home in awkward silence.


I realized how nice it felt to hold his hand and how much I wanted to date him, so I sent this message to him shortly after arriving home:

“I really liked it when you held my hand today, and I want to talk about it.”

It's been a few hours and he hasn't replied back. I'm not the type of person that expects an instant reply, but he left me on read, and he usually gets back to me immediately.

We were also supposed to play league of legends today, but he wouldn't get on discord or reply to any of my mentions.

So what's happening here? Did I scare him away? Am I being really annoying by messaging him? Help!

"My [25F] husband [27m] often “jokes” that he doesn’t intend on living past 55, and lives his life in a way that might make that reality. It’s starting to really make me sad.


Hey everyone. I’m not sure how much room I even have to be upset here, as this is something about my husband I knew since before I married him. I guess its just really been starting to bother me.

I met my husband ten years ago, back in high school. At the time he was just a crush, a coulle years ahead of me. After he graduated he left town for a while, before coming back four years ago, when he and I re-met and started dating.

I was so happy when we got together. My hubby is charming, and sweet, and very kind to me and others. He’s truly the perfect person for me.

He did have a sort of quirk, that he has had basically since he and I began dating. He will often “joke” (I use that term loosely, as he presents it as a joke but I think he is at least half-serious) that he does not want to get old, and has no intention of living past “about 55”.

I barely even paid attention when he said it, at first. I figured he was just being young and blowing off steam.

Six months ago he and I ran down to the local courthouse and got married. I can honestly say that saying my vows to him in a thrift-store dress is the happiest moment of my life.

But marriage I think is changing my view of his attitudes towards his life. While before it was just something he said and I would kind of chuckle at, the more I pay attention to his life, the more I think he is really serious about it, and that makes me incredibly sad.

He has alot of habits that arent great for his long-term survival. He used to smoke cigarettes. I got him to mostly stop that (he did it because I asked, not out of any consideration for his own health), though he still smokes a black and mild most nights just after getting off of work.

He eats with basically zero regard to how it might affect him. *lots* of red-meat. Alot of steak, barbecue, burgers, etc. i will sometimes try to encourage him to eat a little healthier, but those attempts always crash and burn. He’ll stick to healthy eating for maybe a day or two, then he gets tired of it and returns to his old eating habits.

He downs *tons* of energy drinks and coffee. I mean like, three tk four cups of coffee before work, and probably two or three red bulls while at work. He drinks so much coffee he will have two cups with dinner and still be able to go sleep like a log. I tried to point out that eating healthier would give him more *actual* energy, so he wouldnt need so much caffeine, but it had no real affect.

He also rides a motorcycle, with the bare amount of safety gear allowed by law. He loves riding his bike and I don’t want to be a wet blanket, but I feel like he is going to have an accident eventually, his fault or otherwise.

We had a discussion about it a few nights ago, and I think I uncovered something like, idk, a phobia of getting old, maybe?

I basically told him I really wanted him to try to be healthier so he’ll last. He basically said he would rather have half a lifetime that he enjoys instead of a long, full lifetime with “salads and boredom.”

He also alluded to his grandparents. I never met them, they died before we got together. Basically their twilight years don’t seem to have been pleasant. His grandmother got dimensia and could barely remember who she was for the last few years of her life. His grandfather was sharp as a tack until he died, but his body deteriorated quickly and he could barely even move for the last five years of his life.

My husband talked about that and basically said he wants “no part” of getting old.

While I can appreciate why he might feel that way, I’m just sad about it. I love my husband. He is my life partner come whatever. But I want to be with him for a *long time*. I want to celebrate a 60 year anniversary with him and try to do that interlocked-arm toast and mess it up and have the video go to America’s Funniest Home Videos, damn it.

My husband is a good man. I don’t have any intentions of leaving him or something. I just want him to get over his fear of aging now, before he sets himself up for the exact kind of old age he is afraid of, or actually succeeds in having a heart attack in his 50’s.

But he seems truly, legitimately, afraid of getting old, and is perfectly happy just....not.

TL;DR: I think my husband has a phobia of getting old, and lives his life in a way to basically make sure he won’t. I’m really sad about it."

"Our (31f, 31m, married 5 years) dogs bark all the time. We have recieved dozens of complaints from neighbors, animal control and police. My husband refuses to do anything about it and I'm about to deploy again. What are my options?


I guess some background is in order, we have a good marriage and has always planned on having kids when we turned 32 (lined up with some professional events) but the current issue has put such a strain on us, I don't know if I can stay married. 

My husband grew up in the inner city and always wanted dogs, I grew up on a farm-lite and was surrounded by animals so I suggested since we live in a very typical packed in master planned community, we should get something small and easy to maintain. For some reason he ignored me and bought two pure bred basset hounds. So we talked about how these dogs need an incredible amount of stimulation and he'd have to walk them multiple times a day and he agreed. 

Well slowly but surely he lost interest in the dogs so I started walking them in the morning before work but then he would just let them outside all day. Hounds of all varieties are INCREDIBLY Loud and we recieved our first friendly complaint from a neighbor who runs a therapeutic massage studio out of her home saying that even when she turned her music all the way up she could still hear the dogs (as an aside, we just received a threating letter from her lawyer stating her intent to sue over documented lost revune).  I promised her I would keep the dogs inside when we were out and I would work with them to bark train them when I was home.

Well almost immediately after that I had to travel out of the country for 26 (edit:weeks, not months) (military) and went over in great detail what I was doing with the dogs to keep them bark trained and inside. Deployment went well but I was shocked when I got back home that shoved in a shoebox there were dozens of complaints from neighbors, animal control, the police, even a court requested demand for city sponsored mediation with another neighbor. My husband had paid probably $600 total in noise ordinance violations and I think there are another 2 pending.  

I asked him what happened and he screamed at me ""Dogs are fucking dogs Haley, they bark."" I tried to calmly explain to him that dogs don't ""just bark."" i asked if he'd kept up my bark training and he said no because the dogs ""hated it"" (they didn't, they enjoyed the stimulation). Talking with him was like a brick wall so I went to one of the neighbors I know and asked her how bad it really was, she said that about a week after I left the dogs started barking and literally did not stop until I got home. She said one of the two dogs and often both barked 24 hours a day.  I said how sorry I was and asked if she'd spoken to my husband, she said she hadn't because she had the ability to block it out but that other neighbors were really bothered by it. My husband admits to just leaving the dogs outside all the time because they are happier that way,

So it's been about a month and I've done my best to get the dogs back in some semblance of behavior but the second they start barking either the police show up, either cite us or give us a warning or we recieve another letter from animal control. I decided that I needed to really get on top of this so I bought bark training collars. They were very effective (and expensive) but I came home this weekend and my husband had thrown them away because he felt they were ""torture."" Well sure enough Sunday afternoon I was out, he let the dogs outside to bark and bay for almost 8 hours. I got back to a note taped to our garage door that said ""if these dogs bark like this one more time, I will do something drastic.""

In the background of all this, I got notice that the girl who replaced me in my last deployment is sick and the easiest option is for me to fly back immediately for up to four months until they can get someone trained up, so I will be gone to leave my husband to handle the dog issue...which he seems like he doesn't want to do at all. I'm terrified of what will happen if I leave again. We've been cited, threatened to be sued and maybe worse.

I feel like I've tried reasonable solutions, I feel like I've tried harsh solutions but my husband has rejected all of them. I feel terrible for all the noise and headaches we've caused our neighborhood and want to make it right but how can I do this with an uncooperative partner and probably leaving again?


Tl;dr: our dogs are problem barkers and my husband refuses to do anything about it. I feel like I've tried to make it better but he just doesn't help and even undermines my efforts. What can I do?


edit at 5:18pm, finally heard back from a local-ish Basset Hound network, they are going to come over and ""interview"" the dogs in the morning in order to set them up with the appropriate foster. I am doing this when my husband is at work. Then I'm not telling him anything, if he even notices. I met with the JAG who sent me to a off base private attorney who is going to get separation paperwork started on Thursday afternoon. It sucks and if you would have asked me 8 months ago when we got the dogs, I would have thought I'd be trying to get pregnant now (even with the video gaming) instead I'm starting over after my marriage failed in from of my eyes. It's ok, I feel terrible for the damage we inflicted on our neighbors. I'll ask the attorney on Thursday if it's appropriate for me to apologize to the neighbors and let them know the dogs are gone. 

Thanks for the inputs everyone, I've been devastated throughout this process because I knew we were genuinely hurting people. I hope we are on our way to some sort of resolution with the people we affected. "

I work full time and my boyfriend goes to university, when I come home he's always excited to see me, and he gives me a hug or kiss, etc. That didn't happen when I came home today. He was on his computer and didn't say anything to me so I said, ""Hey honey I'm home."" 

My boyfriend ignored me and pretended I wasn't there. I said his name and he replied back in an annoyed tone. I asked him if something happened today and he told me to go away.

I tried to get him to talk about his day until he said, ""Can you go away? I don't want to talk to you."" I was really upset at the way he said it, and we got into an argument about how he was ignoring me. It left both of us feeling sad, but my boyfriend cried at the end of it and told me to leave him alone for the rest of the day.

I respected his wish, and he followed through with it. My boyfriend didn't eat dinner with me today, and decided to sleep on the couch.

It's 1:45 am and I basically haven't interacted with my boyfriend for the past 24 hours. I miss him so much, but I don't want to upset him again. I don't know why he's acting this way. This behaviour is extremely abnormal for him. He's never been this upset over anything before, or refused to communicate with me.

I think something happened to him at school that he's afraid to talk to me about, but it must be very sensitive if he refuses to discuss it with his partner of 3 years. I don't know how to bring it up without upsetting him. Maybe I could write him a letter? Or a text message? I guess in any way that makes him feel more comfortable.

**tl;dr:** I came home from work and said hello to my boyfriend. He didn't acknowledge me or reply back. I asked him if something happened and my boyfriend said that he didn't want to talk to me. We got into an argument, and he cried, then left me alone for the rest of the day."
"Bosses [30s, M/F] want to lower my [20F] pay?


For context, I’m a 20 year-old girl going to college and I gave up some really good job offers for this babysitting because my grandma (closest person I have to a parent) wanted me to focus on my studies and not stress about a full-time job on the side.

I wasn’t against this, initially the pay was great ($10/hour), which gives me roughly anywhere between $30 and $50 a week, and up to around $160 a month depending on how much I sit them. It isn’t much, but it helps cover food expenses and compensates for the little my dad gives me. I’m lucky enough that my grandma offered to cover my rent, but my budget is still tight.

I’ve been at this job since September, I pick up two 2 year-old twin girls at daycare, dress them, push their stroller a few miles (about a 20min walk) back home, play with them, cook their dinner and then take public transportation back home. So far, it’s all good.

The thing is, I do a lot of overtime. I get that they’re busy people (both parents are doctors), and I’ve covered a few times when I was available. I’m okay with that since it gets me some extra bucks. Thing is, they also get me to do evening/night jobs when they go out. This has happened three times this month. They live close to a very sketchy neighborhood that I have to go through to get home, and walking past there at night is just a big no-no, so I usually take an uber. The trip is roughly around $10, which is an hour’s pay at this job. They’ve never reimbursed me the trips despite me telling them.

Now, yesterday I went and did my job as always. I asked for last month’s pay, since they hadn’t given it to me yet. I was paid until yesterday’s sitting. But before giving me the money, the dad asks if I’m okay with my pay being lowered, supposedly because I do a lot of hours already (from $10 to $8/hour). 
I was taken aback because we hadn’t discussed this before and he seemed to want an immediate answer. I told him I’d think about it.

I counted what I made on average per month, and lowering to $8/hour would also lower my monthly salary by around $40. It probably isn’t much, but it is almost a week’s pay with what I made until now, and pays a week’s worth of food at an inexpensive store.

I like the kids, but they’re also very rambunctious, which I guess is normal for their age. But it takes me over 30 minutes at daycare just to get them ready because they’re never sitting still. Overall, I guess I’m doing a lot of work for just $8, and I’m thinking of refusing and maybe quitting this for a more serious and better-paying job.

I really need advice, what do you think about the situation? Is this normal? How do I politely tell them no, without seeming greedy about the money?

TL;DR: Parents of twin girls I babysit want to lower my pay. I do a lot of work and overtime because I need it, but I’m feeling discouraged now that they want to lower my salary. It feels like too much work for very little pay."
"[Update] I [20F] finally left ex [30M] for good but it took me way too long to see what he’s capable of


[Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/81mr6p/weird_situation_with_me_20f_and_boyfriend_for_now/?st=JENV1N33&amp;sh=6c0606f1)

Original post wasn’t popular at all, but I want to thank everyone that commented and I took all the advice, from telling my friends and family and writing down the reasons I am better without him.

When I made up my mind to break up for good, I was so relieved it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders that I didn’t even know was there. 

However, it took me to the end see what a monster the drugs (that he’s doing by his own choice) turn him into. I was going to his place to return his keys, and since the drugs make him paranoid, I had to make sure to hand the keys in person to avoid him accusing me of never returning them. He seemed normal and in a decent mood, he invited me in saying he just finished cooking. Stupid me, I was hungry, and agreed thinking we could end on a positive note. 

Bad idea.

He got agitated and was set off very fast at the fact that I was truly leaving him this time. He wouldn’t let me leave and got physical with me, telling me I ruined his life and was responsible for his actions (remember he’s got some drug induced psychosis or something). I finally ran out and got home safely after a couple hours trying to defend myself without setting him off more. 

I’ve blocked his texts and all social media. I initially had some nightmares that either he killed himself or of him murdering me but as of the last couple days I just no longer feel guilty about leaving and have accepted that he’s responsible fo himself - he’s had many chances to accept free help. 

Only problem is, I’m still able to receive his (many) voicemails so that sucks. 
I’m a little nervous that he’ll show up at my house but I’m staying alert. Other than that, life is good! I’m just angry at myself for taking this long to leave him. But at least I’ve learned from it. 

TLDR:
Finally broke up with druggie ex for good I told people around me to enforce it - not that I needed to anymore, I am never going back, I’m so relieved and happy again."

Long story short this professor crossed many professional boundaries with me when I was a student of his last semester. I've since graduated and tried to cut all contact and ties with him, including abruptly ending a project I was working on with him, because of his behavior toward me. I'm a young recent female grad and he has used his position of power beyond what is legally and ethically correct.

A couple weeks ago I finally gained the courage to send him an email telling him it's best we no longer work together. I expected this to be the end of anything with him. It was a HUGE burden off my shoulders...until this morning! He sent me a text asking if I work at this shop in town that I mentioned I had applied to last semester.

"My little brother (M18) wants to live with me (F20) next year at college and IDK how to break it to him.


So my brother and I have been really close ever since we were very young. Back when I lived at home he would basically just always follow me around like a puppy dog. He was constantly looking for me to hang out and to play with. Even into high school he still always wanted to be around me, despite what I was doing. He was crushed when I went off to college, and for the first few months he called me at least once a day, even more than both of my parents combined. 

Now he’s applied to the same college as me and was accepted. The first thing he asked is if we are going to room together. I told him that I wasn’t sure and that I would have to talk to my friends about it. 

I’ve hardly ever seen him get so excited about something before, he keeps telling me how awesome it would be if we got an apartment together. I asked him not to bug me about it and he’s been really good about that, but the way he talks leads me to believe he truly believes I’m going to room with him next year.

I don’t want to room with him. I love him to death and I’m excited as hell that he’s coming to my school, but I just do not see that working out too well. I already have a group of friends and we’re pretty sure we’re all going to get an apartment together. I also feel like it would be super awkward hooking up with guys in my room if my brother was there at the apartment.

I just don’t know how to handle this. I can clearly tell he 100% expects me to room with him, and I really don’t want to crush him. He’s extremely sensitive and I’m afraid he’ll cry and think that I don’t like him, and I can never stand to see him cry. 

I guess I would just like to know a good way to put this to him, with him knowing I still love him like crazy and he’s still one of my best friends. I’ll definitely spend time with him once he starts going here, I just don’t think I can do the apartment with him. I wish there was an easy way to describe all this to him. 

TL;DR: Little brother wants to room with me at college in the fall, don’t know how and don’t have the heart to tell him I won’t 

EDIT: Thank you all for the wonderful responses, I received a lot more advice than I expected. I’ve gotten a pretty good idea of what to say from you guys and I’m planning on talking to him tomorrow since I’m home for the weekend. I know it will really upset him but I know for a fact he won’t try to convince me otherwise or complain or anything like that. 

And as many of you have pointed out, he will probably try to spend a lot of time with me regardless of living with me. I’ve thought about it and I’m not going to say anything unless I need to, I don’t want him thinking that I’m dreading having to hang out with him because that’s not true at all. But if I need to and I probably will, I’ll tell him I’ll have lunch with him a few times a week and if he wants to come over to my place he needs my permission first.

Again, thank you all very much for the advice."

"I[27F] was diagnosed with cancer and don't have much time. My husband[29M] of one year and one month is very sad and unable to contain himself.


It's been one year and one month since our marriage. He has always been very polite, honest and caring.

It was an arranged marriage. At first, I wasn't sure about him and kept him at distance, he was very nice and calm that whole time. My feelings developed towards him six months in after the wedding day.

Me not having any sort of relationship before, it was very hard for me to be intimate. One day i told him about my feelings and not being intimate with anyone, to which he replied and I quote ""It's Okay, I can understand. Take all the time you need."" I got worried, keeping him at distance all that time was my worst choice. I thought it was my mistake that destroyed my and most importantly his life, as he didn't confessed his feelings. 

I was diagnosed with cancer. After receiving treatment and a surgery. No luck, I don't have much time left.
He's very sad and taking a top care of me. I do know that he loves me very much.
Last month I had this conversation with his best friend, she told me ~ I'm lucky to have him as my husband(which I really am), he's one women man. Love him, cherish every moment with him.

I'm regretting that I kept him at distance and made his beautiful life hell. I don't know how to talk to him, but i want him to move on after me. I know it will be very hard for him, but He's a very good man and deserve a second chance.

TL;DR :- got married(arranged) to a wonderful man, initially kept him at distance. Seeing his care and commitment developed feelings towards him. Diagnosed with cancer, i don't have much time left, he's very sad and unable to contain himself. I don't know how to say, but I want him to move on after me.

"My (26M) Boyfriend (25M) is sick of having my little brother (10M) interfere with our relationship.


I want to start off by saying that he's definitely got something of a point and that he really does love and care for my little brother like his own, he's just frustrated and so am I. 

Firstly my little brother has been living with us for about 3 years.  I'm his guardian after our dad basically dumped him off on me and left to ""find himself"".  I've always loved my little brother and even when I still lived at home took care of him more than our dad did (our mom died in childbirth and I don't think our dad ever really forgave him).  I have a pretty well paying job and so I can financially handle him living with us and we get along really well.  My boyfriend (been together nearly 5 years, the whole college romance deal) has always treated him like his own brother and loves taking care of him and playing with him when I'm at work.  For about the first 1.5 years it was going very well, though stressful at points, my brother still gave us space enough to enjoy our relationship while still parenting him to the best of my abilities.  

Lately, however, my brother's been more and more attached at the hip to me, he doesn't like to leave my side and will throw a fit if I have to leave, even to go to work while he's leaving for school.  I've been trying to get him in to see a counselor but with student loans, paying for all his and my needs, rent, etc, my paycheck is already stretched thin.  My boyfriend tries to help where he can but his job just simply doesn't pay as well as mine. It's become to the point where he will constantly try to climb into my bed every night (which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't also my boyfriend's bed).  At first my boyfriend thought it was cute and didn't mind but lately, he's been giving me more and more of the ""seriously"" looks and demanding I put my foot down and be stricter with my brother about staying in his own room at night.  My brother obviously has abandonment issues due to our dad and I don't want to exacerbate them by telling him to back off.  At the same time, due to my brother constantly coming into our room and/or insisting he be near me whenever he's home, the amount of sex we've had lately has dropped to near zero, which is frustrating for both me and my boyfriend, to say the least.

My boyfriend never actually tells me what I should do with my brother or how I should raise him but he's expressed his frustration (both the sexual and financial sides) to me and obviously, something needs to change, I just don't know what or how.  I've explained to my boyfriend that this is just temporary but we've been having more and more fights about what to do and I'm scared this is going to lead to a breakup.  My boyfriend (obviously) has the patience of a saint and he's easily the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with but my first concern is helping my brother and I don't know how I can do right by both of them at the same time.  What do I do?  Any tips, please?

---
**Tl;dr**:  I'm the official caregiver of my 10-year-old brother for the past 3 years.  My boyfriend of 5 years has been wonderfully patient during the transition but lately, my brother has become more attached to me and won't let us have our free time.  Our sex life has suffered as well as our financial situation.  I'm scared if things progress they have been it'll end in a breakup which is the absolute last thing I want.  Does anyone have any tips on how to handle this without either my boyfriend or brother suffering?"

"My (f19) fiance (f25) of a year is complaining about having to help with newborn. Am I wrong to be upset?


This is going to be long, but please bear with me.


Me and my fiance (I call him my husband because we consider ourselves married even if we haven't gotten officially married yet.) Are having arguments every day. 

Here is the deal.

He thinks I'm being lazy or something. I admit, sometimes he takes on the majority of feedings and diaper changes. I'm not going to lie. But my whole world just got turned upside down and it's taking me more time to adjust than I'd thought. 

To start, I had a vaginal delivery. I went into labor with a hemoglobin of 9.3, which is not good at all. To make things worse, I had the most traumatic birth experience I could have imagined. The story is in my post history, titled ""an update"". the episiotomy that saved my baby that the doctor almost refused to do, the severe blood loss making me lose consciousness and need a blood transfusion, seeing my baby struggling and blue on top of my epidural not working. It was bad.

I had to be cut twice and tore in one spot, they didn't tell me how many stitches I got, so that makes me think it was a lot. The blood was pouring so badly it seemed like they could barely see to stitch me back up.

Well, it's been about 9 days and it still hurts. I was only prescribed ibuprofen but couldn't get that due to losing my Medicaid card. I have been dealing with this with absolutely 0 pain management. I have pulled a stitch loose as well.

I'm still bleeding pretty heavily and am concerned because last night I passed a blood clot that was almost exactly the size of a gold ball, the size they said to look out for.

My fiance is mad because he feels he's ""doing more than be should"" in his own words. 

It hurts for me to sit down and walk and go to the bathroom. I'm obviously suffering from pretty bad post partum depression, I've spent more days crying than not.

I have insomnia and a newborn doesn't help with That. He doesn't understand because he falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow. 

Yesterday, he slept until 1pm. I got up before 10 am and stayed up with the baby. Then later we layed down at about 6pm and he fell asleep while I layed there until 9:20 and had to take a benadryl to get any sleep. The baby started crying less than 20 minutes after I finally fell asleep, but of course I was the one who had to change and feed him, not the guy who's gotten 6+ more hours of sleep than I have already, not counting the time it took before I could fall asleep the night before.

So when 10pm came around he got up and went to the store. He came back and watched the baby while I finally got some sleep. Only 2 hours, I got up at 12.

Guys he complained about having to watch the baby for the 2 or maybe 2 and a half hours while I was napping. I'm not joking. Then I was the only one who got up to change him and feed him the 4 times last night


As I was feeding and changing the baby while he slept, he was telling me I didn't do shit.

I read the paperwork the hospital gave me about taking it easy and accepting help, but I can't because he will bitch at me because he had to do the dishes and cook. I did the dishes several times yesterday and cleaned the entire bedroom and part of the living room, but I don't do anything apparently. 

Now he's complaining that his stomach hurts, watch me have to do everything today only to get bitched at like all I do means nothing. I'm sorry his stomach hurts, but my vagina and my asshole feels like it's getting stabbed from the inside and I don't expect that to let up any time soon, especially with me overworking myself.

I'm more depressed than I've ever been in my life and he still insists on berating me and talking to me like a child, despite my pleas for him to stop.
I am only 19, he's a little older. He's already had a kid, which he abandoned by the way. I've never done this. 

The other day I was having difficulty changing my son's diaper and he basically called me stupid and told me it wasn't that hard. Sure, it isn't hard when you've already changed diapers of course. I don't have that experience. He then went on to tell me he doesn't trust me with the baby so he won't be working. Wtf? 

He threatened to leave me twice yesterday over this stuff, but he doesn't know I've been contemplating leaving him. I want him to leave first. I want him to go ahead, after all that's what he did to the mother of his last child.

I'm so tired of the back and forth and I think he knows it. He will talk down on me and leave me crying and then trick me into forgiving him with temporary love and affection. He will say he's sorry and he loves me only to make me stay until he decides to hurt me again.

tl;dr 

Fiance feels like he's doing to much work because I'm recovering from a traumatic birth and can't do much due to pain and depression. He berates me and threatens to leave me and just makes my postpartum depression even worse. He gets way more sleep than I do, but I'm the lazy one when I need a break from the house chores I'm not even supposed to be doing until I recover enough to be able to sit down without wanting to cry. I've already made one of my stitches loose overworking myself. "

Hi. 

I had my first child with my partner on the 10th of March, and during labour my mother noticed that my partner had been receiving some text messages that he would hurriedly try to get off his screen, or reply to without people seeing. 

My partner isn't usually a secretive person and I have never seen that kind of behaviour from him but my mother is adamant that he is hiding something. 

I asked him about it once we had been discharged from the hospital and were settled in back home(as my mother told me when we were at the hospital), and he avoided the question but was quick to accuse my mother of always hating him. 

Other than this I have no reason to believe he is up to something, but the fact that he has completely disregarded my questions and gone on a rampant about my mother has directed my concern into whether or not he is hiding something. 

He is completely and utterly in love with our son, but this chip on my shoulder is creating more of a mess than I'd like. I'm not sure what to do from here. Please help!~

TL;DR Bf received texts while I was in labour that my mother said were sus (he was hiding them/trying to remove himself from attention when he was replying), and he avoided my question but had a little rage about my mother when I asked about it. "

Hi,

He’s trash. A manipulative liar that’s somehow sucked me in to the most unhealthy relationship I’ve ever come across, even after 3 years of reading this sub daily. I’m in therapy to build up the confidence to end it.

I caught him in what I believe is a lie today, and he told me to email his ex and ask her. I did.

The email has ended up in his inbox, without me copying or blind copying him in. It is an email from me, to her, that has appeared in his inbox. He’s not been forwarded it, it’s as if he is the recipient.

He sent me a screenshot and I can send anyone a screenshot as a PM to see. I followed it up with a test email, with him BCC’d in, to prove the difference. I sent the email from my phone, using the gmail app.

I think he’s installed some software on my emails or my phone (I have an iPhone), or a chrome extension, or SOMETHING that would automatically send emails I send from that account to her to him too, without my knowledge. Is that possible?

He’s incredibly tech savvy (hacker level), I’m not.

Please help me - this might be what I can use to finally cut ties.

"Our[50'sM] son's (17M) mother has been out of line, how do we explain this to him?


Hello Reddit, thanks for reading this post. 


We are not looking for legal advice (we have that covered), we are looking for ways to handle things on an emotional level.



My name is Tom and my husband's name is Victor. We live in Western-Europe and have been dating for 25 years. Married for 10.


14 years ago, I signed up to become a foster parent together with my then-boyfriend Victor. The first (and only) child we had was Jacob. He was 2,5 when we first met him. Jacob's mom was not able to take care of him and from his dad, we did not hear a lot. 
It seemed to me that Jacob's dad had left his mother for another woman and that it had hurt his mom a lot. Which made her decide to give him up for foster care, not only that but her new boyfriend was violent and had debts.


So we took care of Jacob. He would stay with us during the week. On wednesdayafternoon his mom would come and on Saturday he could go to her place for the day on the condition that her boyfriend was not around. For the first 6 months this worked great but then, she started to not show up. 


On memory I vividly recall is him waiting for her on his birthday and her not showing up. A year later we got the call she wanted Jacob back, after all the formalities and administrative procedures, and with pain in our heart we took his stuff, put it in a bag and let him go with her.


No joke, an hour later she was back on our driveway. Jacob had started crying and she could not take it, she gave him to us and just left. 5 years later we started the procedure to adopt him, and he is now legally our son.


We have been in contact with Jacob's maternal grandmother, a very nice and kind lady. She has been giving us more info about his parents. Jacob's mom had been crazy in love with her boss,  who was married. They started an affair and she tried to get pregnant to make him stay with her. When he discovered her pregnancy, he told her he was willing to be there for the child and divorce his wife, but by no means did he want to date her.


The father did divorce his wife, he did tell her he made a mistake by cheating on her but that he wanted to get to know his son. Appearantly, the man had had a daughter (with his first wife or something) but she died when she was 10, resulting in him being very emotional when he heard he was being a dad again.


Jacob's mom left the country, gave birth in that country and never let  Jacob's dad know anything about him. The only reason she came back was because she had met her then-boyfriend who was abusive, resulting in Jacob being in foster care.


As a mother she has never been there for him. No cards, no presents, no visits, despite us telling her (after the adoption) that our door will always be open. 


Jacob just turned 17 and his dad would like to be in contact with him. Jacob knows this and he has told he that he would like us to talk with his dad first to see what  kind of man he is. We have met him several times and he has been more than polite and kind with us. He has not been pushing Jacob or us to be in contact with him and has said that he only wants things to do with Jacob's interest at heart.


On to the issue: Jacob's mom has discovered that her ex has been in contact with us. She has been going crazy. Her social media is full of hate towards us. How we 'stole her baby', how she is indeed a good mother and how 2 men would never be good parents. She has been mean towards her mother (who she has not seen in 10 years) and has  been showing up at Jacob's dad's place to harrass him and ask him our new adress, luckily he did not give in.


She has been at Jacob's school, has tried to reach us and him through social media. We have been to the police, have had talks with the school, everything is safe. But, we need to adress this to Jacob.


How do we explain what happend to our son? How do we stay respectfull towards his mom?


Tl;dr: Son's bio-mom has been acting out of line, how do we explain this to him?"
"My (29/M) fiance (28/F) broke up with me this morning. Wedding invitations went out two weeks ago.


I’ve never posted here and hoped I would never have to. I’ve been with my fiance for 2.5 years, engaged for almost a year. We were supposed to get married in April. She’s always suffered from anxiety and depression. She’s had it managed fairly well for most of our time together. She recently had some sort of mental break and has been going to an out patient program for the past two weeks. This morning, she told me she “loved me” but isn’t “in love with me anymore”. She can’t give me any other reasoning. She tells me that I’m the perfect person and that it has nothing to do with me.

How am I supposed to ever trust someone again if, in an instant, someone can say they’re no longer in love with me? How do I know what to fix or change about myself so this doesn’t happen again? I feel like I’m too old to find someone who is single and actually wants to be committed. I gave up most of my possessions when I moved in with my fiance because she had recently purchased a home so I feel like I have nothing now. I literally only have a few possessions to take with me. We bought a dog together 1.5 years ago. I want to keep him but how am I supposed to take care of him or give him somewhere to live? I don’t think I can afford to live on my own. I have substance abuse issues but have been clean for 5.5 years. I don’t think I want to use but I feel so hopeless. I know that I’m rambling but I’m lost and am not sure what to do.

TLDR: My (29/M) fiance (28/F) ended our relationship this morning. I don’t have much to my name and don’t know where to go from here or how to get over it emotionally."
"I hate my husband's [25/M] best friend [25/M]


My husband [25/M] and I [22/F] have been together for about six years, married for three. We started dating in highschool and so I've known most his friends since then. My problem is that one of his best friends [25/M] from highschool is very rude. He kind of has one of those ""screw everyone"" personalities, but when we invite him over to our house he's only rude to me. He'll tease my husband or other guests but it's not the same as the things he says to me. 

He constantly ""jokingly"" asks my husband when we're going to get divorced or who he'll date next. He tries very hard to exclude me from conversation or activities or insults me the entire time. He belittles everything I say and makes me feel uncomfortable. I've made it clear to everyone that I don't enjoy his sense of humor and that his insults bother me. I've even asked him to just leave me alone, but that just fuels his fire. 

I understand that he's one of my husband's closest friends and he brings my husband happiness, so I continue to invite him to things. A few months ago my husband told me that his friend admitted to hating me, no jokes, he just hates me as a person. Since then I've sort of been trying to boycott this friend but not all out banning him from our life. 

Is it wrong of me to not want this friend in our home? Also it's hard for me to not be a little hurt that my husband cares so much for someone who hates his wife. Is that normal? I don't want to be unreasonable but he ruins my entire mood when he's around.

My husband understands and acknowledges that his friend is rude to me but he always says ""I didn't hear him say that. I'm sorry. I'll say something next time."" or ""He didn't mean that, he meant this"". He's never gotten angry at his friend for anything but does get defensive of his friend when I am angry at his friend. Any advice?


**TL;DR; : My husband's best friend is a huge jerk to me and has openly admitted that he hates me. Am I being unreasonable by not wanting him around?**

"Me[25F] with my FWB [27M], asked to start a relationship being sure he'd agree, apparently i totally misread the signs. Hurt and unsure how to proceed from here


I have only been in a formal relationship once, from 17 to 20. Since then, I just never clicked with anyone and focused on myself. I had several different FWBs - actual male friends, we'd meet to watch a game or smoke and gossip and then casually have sex. And I had booty calls I guess you'd call them, where we just met for sex. Honestly I am not a very sexual person, so getting laid through this system once a month or two was enough for me. 

Five months ago I met this guy, thinking he'd be another FWB or hook up. It was different from the beginning - he awoke something sexual in me as suddenly I craved him all the time and couldn't stop thinking about sex with him. 

We only met one every week or two because of our other responsibilities but we would text every day, talking about everything under the sun, flirting and being generally sweet. We went on actual dates, held hands, spent evenings cuddled up, and supported each other through whatever shit was happening. We went on a spontaneous long weekend road trip together. 

We shared some pretty private stuff and held each other through many nights reassuring that everything will be okay. When I was struggling with a class he spent an entire day going through the assignments with me. I hand made him a bunch of presents that he proudly displays around his apartment. We'd casually talk about what we'd expect from a partner in a committed relationship and happily point out how similar our expectations sounded. ""I've never met a girl like you. I can't believe I won the lottery and met you."" Etc etc. 

All my friends laughed and pointed out he was my boyfriend in everything but the name. I kinda had the same occasional thought but I mostly loved the ride. 

Recently I've been having a pretty tough time, losing a family member and struggling with my career. He supported me through all of that and I was so thankful. However, I realised I was upset we didn't do anything for Valentine's Day - even though we weren't officially dating so it made no sense to be upset. This made me realise I wanted to have more with him. 

I'll be honest, I spent an entire day reading forums for situations similar to mine and everyone always agreed this was NOT a typical FWB situation. Most of the time OPs would follow up saying they started dating their FWB. 

I was pretty excited - so at the end of our meeting last night I proposed we acknowledge our feelings and attempt to pursue a relationship. I didn't even come on too strong, just said we should try it out. We are both open relationship types so it's not like i was shackling him down either. 

Well, it turns out I totally misread all the signs. He said I am great, but he doesn't think of me in the relationship way. Said he isn't even sure he's ready for a relationship with anyone but if he did, he doesn't think it would be with me. Said he had had some fleeting thoughts of dating me in the beginning but they have long disappeared and he enjoys our existing set up but can't give me more. 

I feel so fucking stupid. I feel like a knife was driven into my heart, on top of all the other stuff happening now. I feel like I ruined a great thing - just no idea what to do with myself now, and most importantly how to proceed with him, how to treat our relationship and heal now. 

TL;DR: myself and FWB acted like a couple, and a great couple, in all but name. I asked him to try an actual relationship and he rejected me. I feel stupid and heartbroken and not sure what to do with him now. "

"Friend/flatmate (26F) is sarcastic to the point where she’s just rude, says I’m (24F) just too sensitive and have no self-esteem. Friendship is strained.


To start with, there’s a slight chance she’ll see this, but maybe then she’ll try to see things from my perspective. I’ll take my chances. 

Anne and I have been living together for two years now (in a shared apartment with five other people) and have known each other for four years. We’re all students. She’s one of my best friends (we’ve grown so close that I basically consider her family) and I know I’m one of hers. And she’s a great friend; I’ve seldom met someone so supportive and enthusiastic about their friend’s passions, someone so trustworthy and funny.

That said, she takes pride in being fluent in sarcasm. When someone says they’re fluent in sarcasm, what they really mean is they are an asshole, and when someone tells you who they are, believe them. Every single time someone mentions sarcasm, she butts in saying something along the lines of “that’s my middle name”. Yes, really. Actually, once she even called herself a little asshole. 

Recently this has really started to affect our friendship. Anne has a hard time reading other people’s emotions and appropriate responses. She always says she’s a logical person, not an emotional one. For example, whenever I’m really upset about something, she leaves the room and comes back with a broomstick to say “there, there” like in that one meme.
At first I found that hilarious, but after two years it just got old and I told her that some real support would be nice. No change. She also said to not ever come to her with a truly serious issue like illness or death of a loved one because she’d just be making jokes. I get it, that’s probably also how I’d cope- but not right in the affected person’s face.
Anne sometimes jokes about how she’s afraid that she’s on the spectrum because she can relate to many symptoms of autism, so that may be an explanation.
A few weeks ago I visited the doctor who couldn’t give me a clear answer to my issues. It was very disheartening, to say the least. I wanted to blow off some steam and Anne encouraged me to talk to her. It was a very intimate conversation where I expressed my worries, and at its end she just said “welp, I just checked on the internet. Really sounds like (diagnosis I feared)”, closed her laptop and disappeared to her room. Like, thank you, I guess?

I have a feeling that Anne can never be in the wrong. Whenever she asks something, she also has to google the answer and sometimes gets weird about it. Example: she asked me what brand of orange juice I buy because mine never seems to go bad after two days, like hers does. I said it’s probably because she opens her juice and doesn’t store it in the fridge, to which her answer was that this is absolutely not the reason, I don’t know what I’m talking about and she’s NEVER stored opened juice in the fridge and she’s going to just ask her mom and google it. And then she said that I waste my money on the expensive juice!
Another time, our flatmate Jen asked how many inhabitants Poland has. Anne said “about as much as Germany (80 million)” and I answered “nope, about half of that, no more than 40 million” (and I should know, I’m half Polish) and Anne looked at me like I was stupid, said “that can’t be, not very likely” and googled it. Guess who was right. 

Every second thing she says sounds sarcastic or annoyed. Example: She, Jen and I are translating a restaurant menu and Jen wanted to translate some beverage as “Cognac”, so I said that she shouldn’t do that because you can only call it Cognac when it actually comes from the eponymous French region. Anne kept rolling her eyes and eventually interrupted me, telling me that nobody cared. Another time Jen asked something about a word in Polish. I translated and explained it, but Anne stopped me and said that wasn’t what Jen asked and I could now drop it because no one cared. I apologized for misunderstanding Jen and laughed it off because hey, it was a harmless mistake, but Anne said that I always misunderstand things and start talking about shit no one cares about. 
So, the next day I gently asked her if she had an issue with me and whether everything’s okay. Ann explained that lately she’d just been on edge and had the feeling that I have the tendency to always want to be right, like with the Cognac, and that annoyed her. At the same time she assured me that it was really just her being hypersensitive and I shouldn’t worry. Okay. 
Two days later we’re back to translating and the next thing I know she goes off for five minutes about how you can’t translate a local beverage as “Coca Cola” because that’s a trademark. 

As I said, most of the things she says are sarcastic or rude, to the point where I can’t just laugh it off anymore. I also feel like she has a hard time dealing with criticism. Every time I ask her something, she either goes “mmmhm” (imagine a sassy latina in a sitcom who pouts her lips and raises her brows) or answers in a tone of voice that suggests I’m stupid for asking. So I told myself that I’d express being bothered by that. No chickening out. The next time she’d do that. 
Anne, Jen and I were watching netflix together and I asked my friends to explain something that had happened on the show. Anne immediately adopted that derisive tone and after she’d stopped talking I thanked her for the explanation but asked her if she’d please consider trying to sound a little nicer because she often came across as aggressive.
I guess I shouldn’t have asked in front of Jen. Anne immediately said that she doesn’t sound aggressive and she’s not the problem here. I said “okay, that’s just how I feel it comes across and maybe it’s something you’d like to consider” and was trying to be really sweet and smiley. Anne rolled her eyes, said “mmmmhm” and turned her attention back to her phone. 

She spent last week at her parents’ house and came back yesterday morning at half past six. I came out of my room to check who the f makes that kind of noise at such an ungodly hour during semester break and was surprised to see her. I greeted her and told her I was glad to see her, and her answer was “mmmhm. Why do you have that stupid hat on?”
I explained that I had a fever and was trying to sweat it out, and she said “mmmhm” and went to her room. 

Later in the morning I met her on the floor and said that she can have half of my bread because I bought way too much and she said “yeah, uh, well, I really don’t need your bread, if you saw the loaf my mom gave me, you wouldn’t be asking” so I said “okay, chill, I didn’t know”.
Anne then basically lost it. “Don’t tell me to chill! Stop telling me I’m aggressive. It’s literally all in your head. I’m not aggressive, but the lower your self-esteem gets, the more ridiculous you get, and right now it’s at its lowest so you act out.”
Yeah, I’ll be the first to admit that my self esteem is shit, but I’m trying not to be a fucking doormat anymore. I don’t think this is all in my head. So I tried to defend myself by saying that it had nothing to do with my self-esteem, but she interrupted me with “I am not aggressive and I do not like being told how I am, do you understand? It’s in your head because your self-esteem is extremely low. Don’t ever talk about this again.”

She left after that, and yup, my self-esteem is in fact so shit that I shed a few tears in my room. I really like Anne, I care about her, we have talked about really deep stuff in the past and she knows about the clusterfuck my family is and I know about hers. She knows about my issues, and I think attacking my self-esteem was a low blow. We have relied on each other for a lot of messed up stuff and she’s so supportive of my writing and I always encourage her with her passions, but lately I’ve had enough of her lack of empathy and even almost regret sharing some of my problems with her. 

The examples I listed are merely the tip of the iceberg and while the issues might sound ridiculous, they just accumulate, but jeez, this kinda sounds like kindergarten shit. I feels like it’s come to a head yesterday morning. I confided in a friend who told me to do the slow fade because my friendship with Anne sounds toxic, but I’d like to solve it and talk it out because she’s important to me. I just don’t know how to approach her without her exploding. I’m afraid of conflict.
I also asked a mutual friend who said that Anne does come across as rude if you don’t know her. 
Moving out right now is not an option, I’ll be done with my degree in the summer and transferring to another university anyway. But I can’t keep living with her like this or I’ll lose my mind. Today she’s been acting like nothing ever happened, but I’m resentful and afraid to speak up. 

And what if I’m really just too sensitive and it’s all in my head? I realize that this post is biased because it’s from my perspective. 
And even if she really hasn’t an issue with me, I don’t like being talked to like I’m an idiot. I have a right to ask her to be considerate. I’m just kinda at the end of my rope here.

My question is: Should I do the slow fade or try to make the friendship work? If so, how?



Tl;dr: Friend/flatmate is fluent in sarcasm to the point where it’s jarring. Gets defensive when confronted, refuses to see an issue and blames my concerns on my low self-esteem. Should I let the friendship fade or try to work it out? If so, how?"
"[Update] I’m (25F) worried I’ve done something to make my BF (26M) not want to marry me


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/80dvxq/im_25f_worried_that_ive_done_something_to_make_my/)

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented on my original post and gave excellent advice. As per usual, the best answer was to have a conversation which is exactly what I did. I had been scared to bring it up in case he felt like I was pressuring him, but he could tell something was bothering me.

Long story short, he explained that his views on marriage have changed since we got together...basically he thinks it’s a lot of money and work for not much to change since we’re common law. BUT since he’s known for a while that it’s become important to me, he absolutely intends to marry me. As many users surmised, his main concern right now is money (the cost of a wedding to be specific). We’ve agreed to a budget although not a specific timeline, more a when we can afford it sort of thing (he does contract work so his income in any given year can vary greatly). Right now he’s told me his priority is paying off some debts, and then he plans to buy a ring. He also told me he felt the ring I had picked wasn’t nice enough and he’s concerned he’s going to look cheap (which I think it silly but whatever) and he’s asked me to look at rings in the $1000 range instead and send him a few pictures of things I like. So, all is well :)

Tl;dr: BF still intends to marry me, wants to pay off some debts and save money for a wedding before proposing, also wants me to choose a more expensive ring"

"My jeweler (F/40s) unwittingly engraved my mother's name on an engagement ring I (M/32) had made


This could almost be a Seinfeld episode.

A couple of weeks ago I (M/32) was shopping around for a place to design an engagement ring to propose to my girlfriend (F/30), and I found a local jeweler with very positive reviews. It just so happens that this company has the same name as my mother, let's call her Nancy. So this company is ""Nancy Jewelers"".

I get in touch with them and deal directly with the owner (Lady in her 40s), who's very professional and understands my requirements, finds me a great deal on an eye-clean diamond through her contacts, and sends me preliminary sketches of the setting for my approval. All good, and I'm pleased and excited to see the final product.

Yesterday I get an e-mail saying the ring is ready for collection with a couple of photos from the side and top. It looks exactly as I envisioned, except the jeweler has engraved ""NANCY"" on the inside of the finished product. So now I am expected to present my girlfriend with an engagement ring, which for all she'll know inexplicably has my mother's name engraved in it.

I mean, it's not really inexplicable, but I still don't think it would be appropriate to give her the ring as is. I know the owner of the company is quite proud of their work and will probably look at me sideways if I ask her to nix the branding. I can appreciate that this situation is amusing, and I'm quite an awkward person so I figured I would share this story and also ask for advice on how best to handle it gracefully.

Thank you.

**tldr: I had an engagement ring made at a company who shares its name with my mother, and they wontedly engraved their company name on the inside of the band. Not sure how to broach the situation without offending someone.**"
"What is wrong with my [24F] younger brother [21M]


My younger brother is a strange character, and he has become increasingly worse and more unbearable as we age. I’m beginning to think he suffers from some sort of mental illness, and I want him to get checked. 

Since a young age he consistently bullied and teased my siblings and I. As we got older this slowly stopped. He later apologized to me. When he reached high school he began to gain a lot of weight and had few friends and no girlfriends. He started to develop a resentment towards women and would complain that western women have been ruined (I know), and he developed some extreme political views. He would spend all his time in his room completely isolated, and became heavily interested in computers. 

He scored well in high school, and went to study engineering at university. This is when things became even worse. He became interested in fitness and lost a lot of weight. Around this time he also became interested in manipulating people, especially women, and he would boast about psychological tricks to influence people before my family asked him to stop. He started dating and would talk about his ‘exploits’ and how he loved ‘pumping and dumping’ girls. He even said to me “most of them deserve to have their hearts broken anyway”. 

He became irrationally confident to the point where it was intoxicating. He would constantly talk about how amazing he is, how attractive he is, how he’s the greatest man of his generation. The worst thing is that this attitude made him somewhat of an idol amongst his dudebro friends, and my family talk at lengths about how proud they are of him losing weight, grades, starting his career, and having ‘ambition’. He claims he has been promoted several times as his job and claims the office loves ‘confident asshole’ attitude. 

He is extremely manipulative, and whenever I talk to him I can feel him manipulating me and plotting while talking. When we have family gatherings he always hits on our cousins wives and girlfriends, and seems to have a constant slew of girls he somehow meets. I feel like screaming at them to run for the hills, but I’m afraid of what he would do in retaliation. 

One time my dad lost his temper at him, and my brother said “I’ll stop being a cunt when it stops working for me”. Sometimes he hints at genuine remorse for his actions, but he seems to fluctuate a lot. 

What is wrong with him, and how can we help him?

tl;dr - my brother is extremely manipulative and heartless. I want to help him anyway before he gets even worse. "
"I [24M] had some friends over lastnight. My friend [24F] asked if she could bring her new boyfriend who is sketchy - I said no and I'm afraid I burned a bridge.


Lastnight I had about 10 of my friends over to my place. We're all quite close and the majority of us have been friends since pre-puberty. My good friend, Bella, tends to date some pretty sketchy guys. I met her current boyfriend for the first time about a month ago at another friend's house. The entire night all he seemed to talk about was his love for fighting people, and how he likes to steal. He'd go into detail about how he'd swipe bikes if they were on the porch, etc. He didn't make a good impression on a single one of our friends and I think we're all pretty easy to get along with. 




Anyways lastnight rolls around and Bella asks if she can bring her new boyfriend - I tell her that because of what I heard him talking about I don't feel comfortable having him in my home. She called me and was very upset - not angry, but on the verge of crying. She asked me to explain myself, so I tried to phrase it gently and said ""When I met him all he did was talk about stealing and fighting. Maybe he was nervous and I'd love if the four of us (him + her, me + my Fiance') could grab a beer sometime so I could try and get to know him better... but I just don't feel comfortable opening up my home to him right now. I'm sorry to put this on you, I really hope you can still make it."" She was quite upset and said she'd see what she could do.




She eventually shows up and things are definitely off between us. I gave her a hug, told her I was glad she came, and reinforced I'd love for the four of us to get together. She said ""I understand and respect why you did what you did, but it put me in such a bad position."" Apparently he's pissed off at her now (for going out without him? and they've only been together a couple months.) 




**TL;DR:** Old friend asked to bring her new boyfriend - he's sketchy so I said no. Did I do the wrong thing?"

"Me[19/F] with my father [50s/M] came out to me while I was trying to come out to him?


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I come from a very religious/conservative family.  Like church every night of the week religious.  And my parents have some very traditional views, especially regarding homosexuality.  The worst fight my mom and I ever got in was when she over heard me singing ""I kissed a girl"" by Katy Perry.  Aside from this, I want to make it clear, my parents are literally the best parents in the world.  They are there for me, and have sacrificed so much for me.


I have struggled with my sexuality for a long time, and have finally started to feel comfortable that I'm queer/bi.  It's taken me a long time to get to a place where I can accept who I am.  I moved away for college this year, and have been really open for the first time in my life.  I used to get extreme paranoia that I would get caught with a girl, and that my parents would send me to a camp or kick me out of home.  Like seriously crippling paranoia, daily panic attacks, and I felt the need to constantly lie about everything in my life.  But now at college it feels like this huge weight is off my shoulders!

I'd decided not to come out to my parents, because A. I'm still dependent on them B. I don't want to lose them.  We are very close, especially me and my father (he's like my best friend), and I hate the thought of them turning their back on me if I date a women.

A few weeks ago I was with my father, and we got into a really deep discussion.  Somehow we came to the topic of parenting, and I told him I wished I would have been able to be more open with him.  I told him I never felt like I was able to share things with him that I thought didn't line up with his religion.  He launched into telling me this wasn't true, and he loved me and accepted me no matter what. This turned me into a crying baby.  I asked him if he'd except me if I was a lawyer, a democrat, an atheist.  He said yes every time.  Then I very nonchalantly asked if he'd accept me if I was gay.  He said no.  (I was fucking crushed.  I have never dropped quicker in my life.  I was this close to coming out)

Anyways, (trying to pick the pieces of myself off the floor while seeming casual) I asked him why he was against homosexuality.  I should clarify my father isn't the guy at rallies saying gays will burn in hell.  Instead he acts more like it's the victorian era, and that's just something not to be talked about.  At first he said the standard bullshit, verses and what not.  I have heard these verses my whole life, and know the counter points everyone.  He'd give me a reason he thought being gay was wrong, and I'd tell him why that was bullshit.  

Eventually we got into a deep discussion of the culture he was raised in (teen during the AIDS crisis).  He was a bit of a dork (I inherited this trait!)  and bullied, often in a homophobic way.  This was obviously a really traumatic for him.  We were both pretty emotional at this point.  He started saying that he found men attractive.  OKAY THAT WAS A BIT OF A TWIST.  I asked him if he was born in todays culture if he would have felt more comfortable with that part of himself.  He said yes.

I'm really glad he felt able to share this with me, he has never told another person.  While I was blindsided at the moment, it wasn't totally out the blue.  I have always had my suspicions.  I don't know if he is gay or bisexual, but I'm hoping bisexual since he is married to my mom.

I've been trying to ignore this conversation for the last few weeks.  Typing this out tonight has made me cry like a baby.  I always thought if I could take down my dad's biblical argument against homosexuality, he would come around and support me.  But if this is coming from his own self hatred, I don't see how he could ever accept me.  Also, I want my dad to be happy, and I'm worried he's not.

Obviously, I'm not going to tell anyone what my father told me.  But how do I proceed from here?  I feel that weight and paranoia coming back over me since this conversation with.  I also want to make sure my dad knows I love him, and this doesn't change a thing.  And if anyone happens to know how to get your parents to love and accept you that would be great.

TL:DR Almost came out to my religious father, but realized he wouldn't accept me.  Then he came out to me. "

"My family has turned against my sister[30F] and I [23F] after opening up about our abuse.


So this is going to be extremely long. 

I was abused as kid by a family member on my mothers side. I was also forced to see this person until I was eighteen. So this whole thing started off because I was staying with my grandparents. My grandpa knew about the abuse but did not know how bad it was. He constantly started talking about my abuser, because he’s successful. I finally got up the courage to tell my grandpa what this person did and why it hurt so much to hear him talk about this person. After telling my sister I did that she called him and told him about her own abuse, it was not the same person but it was also my moms side of the family. After my sister telling my grandpa I heard him yelling upstairs so I went to see what was going on. In the process of me and my grandpa talking my grandma called my mom and put it on speaker phone. My mom started asking me ‘what the hell are you doing’ and saying that ‘they don’t know what they are talking about’ during this conversation it came out that my grandma had caught my abuser doing it before but I was still allowed over there. My mom and grandmother knew but would still bring me to his house for sleepovers. 

That night I decided to go to my sisters house. I tried to call my mom on the way but she wouldn’t answer. I was upset and wanted to talk to my mom I thought we were close. I went on social media and she had blocked me on everything. As I got to my sisters house we started talking (my sister and I were not close growing up) it came out that she was told that I was lying. Growing up my mom always questioned what she called ‘my story’ saying family comes first and that I need to let the past stay in the past. I tried to contact my mom multiple times and she wouldn’t answer. Finally my sister and I came to the decision that we needed a break from her. 

In this whole process of my sister and I talking a lot of things came up. I remembered my mom choking me growing up and yanking my hair. When I brought this up with my mom recently she said I have false memories. Or that I’ve always been good at making up stories. But during these conversations with my sister, my sister brought it up because she remembered my mom doing that to me and to her. My sister remembered having to lock me in a bathroom so my mom did not hurt me and I thought I was making these things up. 

Anyways at the time I lived with my grandparents as they are getting older so I was staying to help them. I went to my parents house to get my pets who at first they were watching, but I had tried to take them with me and my mom said I wasn’t responsible enough to take care of them. So I said that’s it my babies are staying with me as I was picking them up. When I walked into the house my parents house was bare. My mom had taken down everything that was my sisters or mine. When I went into my room to get some of my things she said ‘nothing here is actually yours they are all presents you can’t afford anything’ so instead I said ‘okay fine but the animals are, I’m leaving’ when I started to leave she started throwing paintings at me and pictures and the figurines that were in ‘my room’. After that when I tried to go back to my grandparents I was told I wasn’t welcome. So instead I went to a hotel. 

At this hotel I got multiple messages from family members saying that all of this was my fault. That my grandparents were going to die because of me and that I’m a horrible person for being mean to my mom. All I did was tell my grandfather about my abuse. I was told by these family members I need to get over it. That it was in the past. I’m ashamed but I got a lot of messed up messages and I couldn’t take it so I tried to commit suicide. Somehow my grandparents showed up and I remember crying to the paramedics saying they would try to erase everything. I ended being 51-50. I had to go to a psychiatric facility for a few days and honestly it was the best thing for me at that time. I got put on the perfect meds for me and made the decision the moment I got out I packed up my car with my kiddos and I moved to another state. 

However my dad has always been my person and my sister and I told him everything and he’s saying ‘I won’t make a decision between my kids and my wife’ and saying he’s known her for so long. He’s begun pulling away from me and my whole family doesn’t want anything to do with me. The issue is that now I’m gone and I’m happy and ready to go on with my life but there’s still a voice in my head saying maybe I am a liar. And that all of this will be my fault. 

Also apart of this my sister contacted her biological father and found out he did pay child support and that he might not actually be her father. That he sent presents for her birthday which my sister and I remember her getting the presents but they were from my mom.  So this man who we’ve turned against our whole life is suddenly a super nice person whose doing everything in his power to make my sister feel safe. This is so confusing for both of us and we just don’t know what’s going on. It feels like our whole life has been flipped upside down. And now my family is posting about my abuser and the good he’s doing. How they are proud of him. I feel broken and I honestly am coming here for advice on what to do because I don’t know where to go from here. 

TLDR:  After confiding in my grandfather about my abuse my mom got extremely mad at me for saying anything. Also found out she knew about the abuse as it was happening and didn’t do anything and that my sisters bio dad isn’t an asshole. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice! "

"My [39f] seventeen year old daughter's boyfriend is really 26, I thought he was 21/22


My daughter met David at work around early June. They didn't start dating until July. He was fresh out of the military and moved back to our state because he had family there and wanted to find a college to attend out this way. My daughter works at an upscale restaurant as a server and she started bussing tables there when she was 15. She's now 17. David's mother worked at the restaurant and got him a job there as a bartender while he looked for schools to attend. 
Him and my daughter talked constantly at work and I noticed she was more into working than she usually was, she was excited to go there. She made the first move and asked him out. My daughter is very shy and this isn't something that she'd normally do, and then she asked permission if she could go on said date and told me his age. At first I was apprehensive because they worked together and also she told me he was turning 22. At the time, she was a week away from turning 17. 
I couldn't say no because I met her father in college was I was 17 and he was 22 and it's been an amazing relationship. Also, not that I was thinking that theyd have sex right away, but where we live 16 is the age of consent.
So yes, I allowed it and they've been together ever since. I've met David a handful of times and he's a very nice and polite man who treats my daughter with respect. At about five months into their relationship she asked to camping with him and I allowed that too because she's on the pill and my daughter's body is her own and she can make her own decisions. Now I feel really stupid. 
They managed to keep their romantic relationship a secret at work until about a month ago when a coworker saw them holding hands in the park. I used to work at the restaurant that my daughter and David work at, and I used to work with davids mother as well. She reached out to me via Facebook and said something along the lines of 'are you okay with our kids' relationship? David is 26 and I know Stella(my daughter) is only seventeen."" 
I was shocked, I didn't know David was 26. I didn't tell his mother that I didn't know his true age, I actually haven't even responded to her. I've confronted my daughter and she's told me that she loves him and he loves her and that she knows the age gap is wrong but feels that it's situational because they get along very well and there is no evidence of a power dynamic. If it was a few weeks into their relationship I would've told her no, but it's been 8 months and 8 months qualifies as a serious relationship, and their relationship is very serious. I just don't know what to do, Reddit..

"I (f16) was asked out by my crush (m16) but it turns out his friend was on his phone and asked me out as a joke! To make things worse, I said yes!


TL;DR: asked out as a joke 

Story time: I’ve liked one of my best guy friends for a while now. We told each other everything, and one day I started to like him as more than a friend. So, it was maybe 6:00 pm, and he Snapchats me saying he’s bored, and so we started playing random questions. (which is literally just asking each other random questions) I genuinely thought it was my crush sending all of these because it was his face in the Snapchat! But then, he starting chatting in the dm section of Snap, and asked me who I had a crush on. I said that I’ll tell him if he told me. This is where the story gets tragic y’all. 

He told me! He said that he used to like me. So, me being the naive person I am, said “yeah same lol” and then the convo died down a bit and he had to go to basketball practice. I was talking to one of my friends about it and she, jokingly, (though I’m still pretty pissed at her) Snapchats my crush “OMG U FINALLY TOLD NINA (me) THAT U LIKED HER” and lemme tell you guys, he was confused af. Especially considering he’d asked out my friend about 2 hrs earlier. That’s right, he was dating someone. 

So, it felt like my heart had been smashed with a sledgehammer and tossed in a fire. But then came the embarrassment. Actually, saying I am mortified is a better way to put this lmao. I’m moving this summer for my moms work and it’s currently mid March so I just have to get through the school year and even then I have no clue how! 

Back to the story lol. It turned out my crushes friend was on his Snapchat account and sent all of those messages. So basically I told his friend that I liked him. When I found this out, I made the friend who sent him the Snapchats (I’ll call her... Abby) clear everything up with my crush and basically say that she was on my phone saying everything. My crush and I both agreed we should put this behind us, but idk how to live down this mortal embarrassment.

Finally, I fucked up big time. I only told four people about this situation, and let’s call them: Allie, Alex, Abby, and Lindsay. So, same night all of this went down, I found out Allie thought I was a fake friend, AFTER I confided in her what happened, and now I’m scared she’s going to tell my friend that my crush asked out!!! Now Alex idrc that I told because she’s off playing golf in Florida for the next two weeks lmao. Abby, the friend who contacted my crush, hasn’t been the most trustworthy person lately but she was my best friend so I felt obligated to tell her, except I have a feeling she told a LOT of people. And then Lindsay, I know she wouldn’t tell a soul so I’m fine there. 

To sum it up: I’m absolutely mortified, and scared that this will get back to 1) the entire grade and 2) especially my friend that my crush asked out because I don’t want to get in between them. I just don’t know how to live this down

"Boyfriend's (32M) younger sister (16F) involved in weird cult-like clique, he asked me (27F) to help but I have no idea how to deal with this situation


So this is kind of a unique situation. My boyfriend has a very young sister. Their mother passed when she was 2, and their father is a nice guy but a total workaholic and is rarely home. My boyfriend lived about an hour away and tries to be a good brother but obviously he can't be everything for her.

Recently he's found out that that she is part of a 6-member clique at her all-girls high school, and none of it seems healthy. We found her real instagram and they all have like ""aesthetic"" type accounts, which is not weird by itself, but they all consider each other sisters, have some kind of seniority system, and also harshly punish each other if they do something ""wrong."" He told me that they will physically fight each other outside the grounds of school for ""offenses,"" they monitor each other's weights and appearance (they have like weigh-in days or something, have to wear certain things, look presentable and neat, etc).

My boyfriend feeling totally overwhelmed by all this asked me to talk to her female-to-female. I'd been through my fair share of clique-y behavior in high school so I said I'd gladly try to help or mentor her if possible. I'd met her before and she was a nice girl. 

When I talked to her, she was really open about her friendship with these girls and it was just so... strange. It honestly feels like some kind of cult. It's beyond my scope of cat-fighting and gossiping. They aren't really like negative in the grand scheme of things. They push each other to do well in school, treat each other with respect, be healthy, and look presentable and neat. That's good right? But if they don't follow some of these ""rules"" they'll physically attack each other by slapping , hitting, ganging up on one girl. And she just seems like totally jaded to that, like it's just normal behavior and she doesn't think any of it is wrong at all. 

I'm kind of at a loss what to say or do. My boyfriend is really worried but I think he's thinking maybe I'll be a good influence on her. I don't think this is a situation where being a good or bad influence really matters. She doesn't think anything is wrong, but the whole situation is really bizarre.

What exactly should be done here?

Tldr: my boyfriend's younger sister is part of a weird cult/clique with 5 other girls where they hold each other to really high standards, considered themselves sisters, and also physically hit each other for infractions. I don't know what the hell to do or how to help. How can I help?"
"My (F20) roommate (F20) is using her depression as an excuse to get out of literally all housework and it’s getting old.


My roommates and I have lived together for 6 months, so we’re halfway through our lease. I get along fine with G (F20) as well as L (F20), but for the last two months, any time G and I have asked L to do ANY housework, she claims that she’s can’t because she’s so busy and depressed. At first I sympathized because I’ve had a difficult time since going on antidepressants and my course load has been heavy this semester, so I let it slide for the first few weeks. 

But at this point I’m ready to scream every time I see some mess L has made without cleaning it up. Not only does she not pitch in with any other chores around the house such as garbage removal or cleaning the kitchen, but she blatantly leaves messes all around the house and then gets angry any time G or I say that the mess is gross or a problem. It’s as if she expects us to clean up after her. 

Since she and I live on the top floor, we share a bathroom and that also means that I have to clean the bathroom or else it gets disgusting since she has no concept of hygiene. The reason I can’t really continue to believe that her depression is a “valid excuse” is because I literally hear her in her room talking on the phone, laughing, and watching tv constantly. She’s always posting pictures of stuff she paints while she’s “bored” and she constantly goes out to dinner with her friends. If she has all the energy to do that, why the hell should G and I have to pick up her messes since she’s “so depressed” and “too tired” to do it herself? 

I’m at the end of my line, I don’t know how to bring it up without sounding insensitive but I seriously have awful issues with clinical depression and even when it’s bad I still take care of my messes and keep the house orderly. I can’t stand that she’s using her mental illness as an excuse to be lazy, and I want to end it now. 

So does anyone have any advice? How do I talk to her about this? How do I not sound like an awful person? How do I get her to do her share of the housework? 

**TLDR** roommate doesn’t do any housework, uses depression and exhaustion as excuse, but then does other fun stuff with her copious free time. "

But I still cant help feeling despressed that I will never be ""normal"" or non-socially akward, no matter how hard I try. I dont tell many people about what I have due to people treating me differently and becoming a charity project to them, where they will be my ""friend"" to make themselves feel better. 

   As for Swim lessons I have gotten many good reviews from parents,  I have taught them for over 5 years, I am firm but also fun, I make kids laugh while also helping them learn. I have taught many kids at all levels. I have lesson plans, games, and set goals for every student, and give the parents a report at the end, even though I am not getting paid for these swim lessons. I have gotten requests and compliments from both parents and students.
 
 Recently however I got removed from a swim lesson because the mother said I was akward and didn't make enough eye contact, I seem fake/ robotic and that my body language seemed contrived. I worked well with the kid and they seemed visibly sad when they got a new lesson instructor the next day. I have to see this mother and work around with her every day, and I have to take a class from her. Everytime I see her I become depressed because it is a reminder that I have autism, and no-matter how hard I work I will never be normal and people will always judge and discriminate against me, I know that she is judging me for being socially ackward, and for having autism. I am starting to get anxiety about teaching swim lessons now because I am afraid of parents saying the same thing to me again. How should I handle having to take a class with her, this is a small college and she is the only professer who teaches this course? 
TL;DR: Parent who I have to take a class with removes to from a position due to my autism/ traits. "
"Me [32 F] with my Husband [35 M] I am frustrated with our poor financial decision.


I want to preface this with saying: my husband isn’t an idiot, he’s an optimist. And I love him for it. My husband has repeatedly had bouts of cancer, and each times he’s beat it. I married him knowing that, and have made my peace with any inevitability of his health. 

Recently, we had our first son. He’s a good baby, and we both agreed that when the baby was born, I would take time for a few years to be a stay at home mom. 

Now, my husband and I lived in a dinky and small home. I loved it. It was just right for me. Quaint, easy to clean, warm and *cheap*. I will be the first to admit that I am not excited about big material things. I watched my mother piss away a lot of money, and it made me frugal. Right before we found out I was pregnant, we both had great jobs. I worked as a manager at a small firm and he works as a teacher, Summers off works great for his health. 

Now, *right* before I found out I was pregnant, I was diagnosed with lupus. Shit luck. I went from strong and healthy to pretty feeble, and couldn’t walk without falling. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to stop working, and eventually lost my job. My husband was NOTHING except supportive. He cooked, he cleaned, he took care of me. He reassured me. We were just about to close on a new house, and I begged him not to. I said I didn’t think it was a sound decision, and that I felt like the sudden onset of my symptoms and the severity would leave me out of work for some time. 

He disagreed, his own reoccurring health issues have left him maybe a little naive. His mother called me, screaming about how ridiculous it was to hold onto my starter home. I was sick, tired and relented. (Please note he had no part in her actions.) We sold our home and moved into a beautiful, wonderful new house. It really is a great house. 

But I was right, we were trying for a baby when I was diagnosed and stopped trying immediately, but we found out I was already pregnant. The pregnancy and the lupus knocked me out. I wasn’t functional anymore. I even picked up home odd jobs so I at least brought in SOME money. I didn’t want to let myself fall into the role of a sick person, or a victim of circumstance. I did what I could. We lost a car because we couldn’t pay for it. Reddit, it was a crap 2000 era car. We don’t have fancy things. 

When the baby was born, and I was able to be medicated my symptoms are MUCH more manageable, but still there. And now, my husband approached me saying that we can no longer afford our home on his income alone, on account of our son. I expected as much. 

Reddit, we have no outside expenses. I make all our food from scratch, I shop cheap. I have bought no new clothes. We were so blessed with help I haven’t even needed to buy wipes or diapers yet! We do not go out, we spend time indoors. Our internet and phones are cheap. I am serious when I say we simply can’t cut costs. It’s just the cost of living and the property taxes that are killing us. 

I’m mad. I’m livid. And I’m heartbroken. I wanted time with my baby. I wanted to see my son reach his milestones, and I want to change every diaper. I have an option to return to an old, much less paying job. But itll be enough. 

I don’t know how to field through my anger. I told him no, I said that I didn’t want to change spaces when we didn’t know what could happen. He’s been apologetic, and has learned his lesson. We communicate a lot better, especially about finances. 

But I feel like the damage is irreparable. My main goal in life was to nurture my son, and even though this is such a small stage this has been my dream. I love my husband, and he’s a great partner and a great father, but I can’t shake the feeling of resentment. 

He isn’t happy, either. He’s suffering. He wanted his son to grow up in a home with a parent there, as he did. We know it’s not the end of the world to place him in child care. But I’ve worked in child care. I’ve seen some horrible people take care of kids. I don’t want to have to worry constantly. 

At this point I’d rather sell my house and stay with my boy. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know how to stop my anger and resentment from taking over when I discuss this with my husband. 

The other issue is obvious, while staying at home we planned for me to continue my education so that I could end up as the bread winner, and take care of my son and husband, should his health decline. But now not only can I not go back to school, I can’t afford my life. Frankly, I’m tired. I’m 3 weeks post partum and all I want to do is rest. I can’t even imagine entering the work force now, so soon. Not only am I worried, my lupus still isn’t super. 

Tl:dr Husband made a crap decision that affects our family and now I’m mad as hell. I just need some perspective. What do I do? 

Edit: When my husband came home, we had a really fruitful conversation. One where I completely owned up to my own shortcomings, and my part in our financial struggles. I appreciate all the people who called me out on that- I got stuck playing a victim in my head. My husband acknowledged that he should have had my back with not only his mom, but with making a better plan for ourselves. 

While we both liked the idea of me being home, and tending to our son and the house, we realize it isn’t a fruitful option, at all. Not in the long run, now and just keeping our head above water won’t change our situation. So, we are going to meet with a realtor, and discuss the best option for what to do with our home. 

In terms of working, I will return to work full time, so that if the future allows, if and when we are in a more secure position, when my son is more cognizant of my presence- we will have the ability to do so. 

I feel really silly, I was so blinded to my own culpability in this situation. When I let go of my husband being the bad guy I just felt embarrassed. He’s been trying his hardest to keep me home as long as he possibly could, and I made him out to be a jerk. 

For those who have their personal experiences, tough love, and well wishing: I appreciate all of it. I’m a first time mom, and still very worried, but I know my son will be well socialized and happy, wether he stays with me, grandma, or somewhere else. 

One of the things my husband said that stuck with me is that we have selfish desire as a parent versus what is good for us as a family, and for my son in the long run. My want to stay at home comes from a lot of fear and neglect in my own background. It’s my personal desire. But it doesn’t mean he will be less happy, less loved, or have less of a connection with me. Which ultimately, is my fear. 

Tl:dr, I put on my big girl panties.
