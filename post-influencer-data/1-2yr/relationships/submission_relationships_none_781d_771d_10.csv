"[UPDATE] I [25ftm] am about to come out to my parents [46m&amp;49f] as transgender and I'm kinda freaking out.

Hey Reddit, 

My OP didn't get much of a response, but I appreciate those who offered support/advice and wanted to give an update in case anyone was wondering. 


Originally, my weekend got a little more busy than I had planned, so I decided to move my coming out day until Tuesday. 

So, on Sunday, I called my mom to set up dinner (if I hadn't, I knew I would back out and not tell them) and my mom was feeling impatient I guess, because she was just like ""let's talk about it now"" and put me on speaker phone with my dad right next to her. 


So, I told them. And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked ""is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!"" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. 

We are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was ""Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname""

So I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. 

I also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. 

I hope you guys all have a great week!


Tl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!


**Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a ""sick fuck"" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**


**And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments. Thank you.**

**Edit 2: my first gold ever, thanks guys. You've been overwhelmingly supportive. Thank you all. You're wonderful humans.**"

"[UPDATE] I [19F] am being excluded from our gaming group. I decide to find a new group. Boyfriend [20M] is the one upset.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6p3gsf/i_19f_am_being_excluded_from_our_gaming_group_i/

Thank you everyone for all the advice! And thank you to those that also offered to play with me. I wasn't expecting my post to get so many replies. Unfortunately, I had some unrelated family business, so I couldn't respond to you all. However, I have read everything and have taken all your words into consideration. Some people have also asked me questions about how we can play so often, how long I've been with my boyfriend, etc., so I'll just give a brief background (skip to the next line if you don’t want to read it). 

First off, most of us are college students [18/20], either working part time or staying at home with our parents. As of right now, most of us are on summer break. We only have two older members in the group, which are R [25/M] and another guy [23/M]. The rest of us are or fall under 20. R is actually married and his wife makes good bank, so he has a ton of free time. 

Second, about my boyfriend. Surprisingly we met through the gaming group, as he was the one who advertised it, which was how I found and joined the group. That was about 2 years ago, and about a couple of months after we met, we just clicked and started dating. My boyfriend has known R for about 3 years, so they're close friends. However, R did not join the group until 6 months ago, as my boyfriend invited him because he thought it'd be fun to have him there too. I did not know much of R, other than that he was my boyfriend's friend, until he joined the group.

  ---   
So, after I posted my original post, I signed up for 2 different groups. The first one was an all-women’s group [16-20F]. They responded to me pretty quickly. They were very nice and polite, but explained that they only play once/twice a week. Unfortunately, that didn't cut it for me. The second group responded to me the next day, and I learned that they were more active but that they're also an all-men’s group [17-19M]. However, they were open to having me there. At first, I felt pretty sketched, but the oldest and most popular guy [19/M] there took me aside and explained to me that he does not tolerate any type of harassment and that he will definitely kick out any of the other guys if they were bothering me. Hearing that made me feel more comfortable and I played some games with them. I had so much fun! All the guys were really nice and friendly. No sexual remarks, no more screaming of profanity against women, etc.. It was nice being in a group of people who were happy to play with me.

After I finished my games and left, my boyfriend called and asked if we could talk. When he came over, before I could even ask or speak myself, he told me he was really sorry and that he screwed up big time, and he understands how wrong he was. He said he didn't want me to go to a new group because he feared that I would leave him too for some new guy. Then he told me that he didn't realize how hurt I was from being excluded from the group because I had never complained or voiced against it, which was true. I never complained about the exclusions, or even R’s behavior before, because I knew it would just cause more conflict. I also didn't want my boyfriend to stop playing with his friends because of me. I explained this to him, and he said he was sorry for not defending and comforting me like he should have been in the first place. 

To my surprise, he then showed me his text messages between him and R that happened a few months ago. Apparently, way before my exclusion, R had a few conversations with my boyfriend, telling him how much of a pain it was to play with me there. He wanted my boyfriend to kick me out. However, my boyfriend refused and told R that was not happening. Then, around the time when I decided to stop hanging out around R, that's when R sent a group text to everyone in the group explaining how he doesn't want to play with the group again, and he hopes everyone understands. Everyone, and to my shock, even my best friend, all agreed with him. Only my boyfriend protested, but R was really stubborn and he had the whole group to support him, so my boyfriend gave up. After showing me those texts, he told me next that he kicked R from their group earlier today. R was not allowed to play with them anymore, but my boyfriend said he'd still be willing my play with R one on one, but only like once a month. Surprisingly, R agreed, and that was that. My boyfriend said he understood if I didn't want to be with him anymore, but said that he truly does love me.

Honestly, even after all that has happened, I'm not mad at my boyfriend. This is both of ours first relationship, and we’re still learning. He's always been kind to me and I’ve never had a problem with him before this situation occurred.  I feel happy that he realized his mistakes and did apologize without me asking. This is the first time he's ever come across a situation where he has no choice but to choose a side, so I don't blame him for trying to do anything to keep the group together. He told me he would also like me to come back to our old group, but he said it's completely fine if I stay with my new group. He knows it was wrong of him to ask me not to join a new group. I told him I don't think I'll ever come back to the old group and that I will definitely be sticking with my new group from now on. However, I will always make time for him and put him first. He accepted it without any protest, and we went back to our usual fun activities. 

I feel bad that my boyfriend may have lost a close friend since I never asked him to do any of that for me. Regardless, I am happy, and lately my boyfriend and I have been spending more time together now that R isn't around as much. I have also continued playing with my new group and it's been awesome. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading this long update! Sorry for the ramble and mistakes, my mind is all over the place right now and I wanted to explain as much as I could. Thank you guys once again!

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend apologized for everything and kicked R out of his gaming group. I will continue to play with my new group and boyfriend is ok with it now. Things are better."

"[UPDATE] My [24/f] boyfriend [29/m] of a few months has made inappropriate comments about money and other miscellaneous choices I make. Are these major red flags this early on?


Original Post: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6p2xtq/my_24f_boyfriend_29m_of_a_few_months_has_made/

Thanks to everyone who gave me great advice. I basically ended up breaking things off with him after he, once again, was acting very rude towards me. I briefly let him know it is because I thought he was disrespectful and didn't feel like he even liked me.

He acknowledged that some of his treatment towards me was ""unfair"" but said he ""wouldn't have spent time with me and talked to me if he didn't actually like me."" There was also some other BS in there about how he doesn't feel good about it and tried to tell me that it isn't a good place to be in. Nothing he said really made sense, as usual. Lol.

All in all, I am pretty happy about my decision and although it didn't last too long, I should have called it quits one week in. Lessons learned!


**tl;dr:** Broke it off with him after he was rude and he tried to get me to empathize with him. Bye."

"Me [24 F] with my soon-to-be BIL [29 M]. He is trying to create drama because he thinks I'm 'stealing' his brother/my fiance [26M]


Throwaway because we all reddit and know each other's names. 

I've been with Fred for 4 years and we are planning to get married next year. I met him after I had just moved to the UK and we instantly clicked. I hadn't planned on dating anyone but I guess sometimes life just happens. Back then, he was still living at home so I quickly met his father, stepmum, sister and brother Peter. They were all nice to me and very obvious happy that Fred had found someone. He has social anxiety disorder, so approaching me was a huge deal for him. 

After two years together, Fred moved in with me. That was the first time his brother and father displayed some dislike for me. They feared I was taking advantage of him and stealing him away. In my opinion, they also disliked that I encouraged Fred to go back to university and finish the degree he dreamed of instead of working a dead-end job in the family business (where he felt incredibly unhappy and controlled). 

After some time his family got used to it and everyone seemed very happy that Fred was doing something with his life. We got engaged and while everyone seemed happy, Peter took him aside fearing that I was trapping him or forcing him to get married. This really hurt me and installed a lot of fears. I questioned our entire relationship and whether I was controlling and pushy. 

Recently, we announced that we'll be moving across the country for our careers. I've got a paid PhD position and Fred landed a job in his dream industry (not many opportunities where we are right now). I think that was the final straw for his brother. So far he has had several stern talks with Fred that he shouldn't let me walk all over him, that my dreams didn't have to be his etc. Again, I am incredibly hurt and anxious. When I met Fred, nobody in his family cared about what he wanted. I remember when I asked him what his dreams were and he said that nobody had ever asked him that. I do believe that I want the best for us as a team. We discussed getting married, we discussed moving... we make decisions together. So I don't think I'm the controlling she-devil that Peter sees in me. I know he is protective of Fred but this is really putting a strain on our relationship. 

Last night, Peter texted him complaining that he didn't want me there at a family dinner because I was too aggressive and never understand his jokes. We were both shocked and after some questioning, Peter couldn't name a single specific incident. I cried a lot because I feel targeted. Yes, I do sometimes speak up against Peter, when I disagree with something he says (eg when he makes jokes about my country). But I never once raised my voice or insulted him. We believe that he can't handle that a woman is standing up for herself (his own gf is very submissive and only speaks when he asks her to... it's quite shocking to see). 

Anyways, Fred went to the family dinner and I stayed home. He promised he'd talk to Peter and stand up for me. What should I do now? How should I react if he didn't talk to him or if he allowed Peter to talk baldy about me again (which I think will be the case)? How can I acknowledge that I feel for him because of the anxiety but that he needs to put his foot down? His family is not supportive of any 'conflict' and believes that the younger siblings must respect (=completely submit to) the older siblings.

"Me [29F] with a woman [36F] whose job I was given after covering her maternity leave, she keeps harassing me to get together.


2 years ago I was hired to cover Jenna's materity leave, when she returned I was given the job permanently and the company moved her to a completely different department entirely out of her wheelhouse hoping she would quit because she is a rude person.



This woman is manipulative, rude, self-absorbed and has no self awareness. Jenna made life a living hell for me before she went on maternity leave during my training which was crazy because she is the one who hired me and also the one who chose to have a child (it was absolutely planned). My boss and the president of our company did not want to work with her which is why I got the job. In her new role when she returned she was terrible to her co-workers, didn't do any of her work, was running a side business while on the clock, and was trying to get a package / let go from the company. Eventually she had enough and quit herself.



The career we both have is a very small niche role that is very social. There are many people in our social circle that do not know me who I meet that are automatically rude because I ""took her job"". 




I try not to burn bridges, and have not been rude to her at all. When she was still working here I went for coffee and was very nice, but smart with how I handled all conversations never giving her real information (she is a snake!). I do sympathize with her losing her job after having a baby, I will have kids in the future and would be very sad if that happened to me. However, I do think I have earned this role as I am far nicer and also more skilled. 



Closer to the end beore she quit I was politely declining meeting Jenna. She is relentless and never gives up. She is gone from the company now yet she keeps emailing me and calling me wanting to meet up. I have received 4 emails and 6 calls in the past 2 weeks which I ignored because I was on vacation. 



Jenna's side business *cough pyramid scheme* relies on new clients, she has already hit me up to buy her items but I have clearly and directly said no. 



I don't get why she wants to meet up! I do not want her in my life she is toxic.



How do I say no to meeting up with this person, or should I just ignore her? I want to keep a good reputation within our industry.

"I [19F] want to tell my mom [48F] that I don't want to wear the hijab any more.


Hi Reddit! I made a new account for this because my old one had too many personal details.

As some background information, my mother and I are really close. She's normally very reasonable and calm, but when it comes to religion she's kind of stubborn. My entire family is Muslim, and my parents were born and raised in a Muslim country. When I was three, we all moved to America and we've been living here ever since. 

My dad and his side of the family aren't as religious as my mom, and while none of the women on that side wear the hijab, my dad is a bit of a wild card. I have no idea how he feels on the topic, and I don't think he would be much help because we aren't very close.
To my mom, religion is the most important thing in our (read: her) life. She works for an Islamic school, all her close friends are similarly religious, and when she has free time she likes to listen to lectures from Muslim scholars. I 100% understand why she feels that way- my mom has been through some pretty heartbreaking things and god is the only thing she can count on. 

As you can probably tell, I don't really feel the same way. Don't get me wrong- I love certain aspects of Islam, and I have always felt at home within our community and religion. My mother and I do tend to argue on the stiffer points (like gay rights, tattoos, etc- all of which aren't allowed in Islam) but those arguments have always been casual debates when the topic comes up. The one thing we have never argued about is the hijab, and that's mainly due to how afraid I am to bring the topic up.

To my mom, hijab is the best way to show your devotion to god, and the topic isn't really up for debate. I started wearing it when I was REALLY young- around 10- and it was more out of a misguided attempt to please her than it was for any religious reasons. That would probably be a really good reason to explain why I don't want to wear it anymore, but it's been about ten years since and she would point out that even if my initial reasons were wrong, that doesn't mean they can't be changed. My real reasons for not wanting to wear it anymore is because I'm tired of being constantly pigeonholed into something I'm not when I wear the hijab. Everyone assumes I'm some innocent nun and that's really not the case. I've taken it off for parties and gotten drunk and high like every other teen my age and I just want to stop living this ridiculous double life. 

My real issue here is that I have no idea how to bring it up to my mom. What do I start with? What reasons can I give her? I know I mentioned a few above, but those really aren't things I feel comfortable telling my mom. When it comes to fights, we've only had one big fight (over my college major) and it was over in two days. My mom's default setting with fights is just to freeze me out until I feel horribly guilty, and then to apologize while assuming I'll do what she wants. I know it sounds horrible, but we're both the most important people to each other and in that case, I wanted to keep our relationship intact instead of doing what I wanted (which turned out fine in the end, since my career aspirations have changed). This time, I want to be able to hold my ground.

So this is what I need your help with, Reddit: how do I bring the topic up? What reasons can I give her? How do I deal with the aftermath? If anyone here has been in a similar situation, I would really appreciate your help.

TL;DR: My mom is very religious, and I'm not. I want to tell her I'm not going to wear the hijab any more, but I have no idea how to bring the topic up, or how to explain why."

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6oa8cj/i_27f_am_falling_for_an_asexual_friend_29m_who/

Thank you to those who responded to my initial post. After going through the replies it was clear to me that I was overlooking Jack's feelings and the fact that it must have taken him courage to tell me about his asexuality. I realized I was being selfish since he'd told me exactly what might happen if I overlooked it, and that happened exactly (as many of you pointed out). 

I still would have felt guilty if I didn't tell Jack about my feelings. So, over the weekend, I sent him a text asking to get coffee and chat. He seemed to know what was up - he asked me, ""is it about feelings?"" and I replied ""yes."" We met up that evening and I explained that I had started developing feelings for him, and that I thought we should spend some time apart, since we would be incompatible for a relationship. He shared that he had seen this coming, and that it seemed to happen a lot in his life - women would start off as friends but would get increasingly attracted to him. He told me that one time, he was groped (really, assaulted, but he didn't use that word) by an overzealous female friend and since then he had learned to catch on to those signals before it got too late. He had hoped that I would also just be a friend, but he said he understood that you can't control how feelings develop and that while it was sad, he'd also like to spend some time apart. 

We agreed that I would tell our mutual friend group minimal information but enough to keep them quiet about our separation. I went ahead and told them last night when we met for dinner. I explained that we are still friends but that I need to spend some time away to keep my feelings in check. They all seemed to understand and those who had been friends with Jack for a while exchanged knowing glances. Apparently this is a common issue (the fact that he looks like a fashion model doesn't help). 

One of our older friends, Susan (35-40? f) pulled me aside after dinner and said that Jack had called her afterwards and confided in her what had happened. She told me that he seemed to be very sad on the phone, but that he explicitly stated that it wasn't my fault - it was just the nature of who he is and who I am. She said that despite his maturity, good looks, and successful career, all of which would make him a catch, his love life is in shambles because he doesn't have interest in sex. I have to say that the conversation really opened my eyes - I hadn't ever considered that sex was so important to me, and most other women, until I realized that a man like him could face so much hardship due to his disinterest in it. Susan shared one other piece of advice with me: don't assume anything about anyone, unless they tell you directly; and, when they tell you something, respect it. That's definitely a lesson I will take to heart here.

All in all, I feel sad, but I can imagine that Jack feels broken. I only have to get over a crush - he has to accept that, once again, he's lost a friend to Cupid's arrow. Poor guy seemed destroyed after this incident, because we were really good friends. We got along perfectly. I can see why he said he gets little female platonic company. I'd like to be friends with him again some time, after I'm confident that the feelings won't get in the way of our friendship. But it will probably never be the same. 

Thank you, reddit, for helping me realize I was selfish in this situation. The outcome is far from perfect but it was necessary, and fortunately our friend group is understanding and hasn't cut off from either of us.

**TLDR: Talked to Jack, we decided to spend time apart. He's understandably sad. I learned about asexuality, maturity, and selfishness. Good life lessons - and no fairy tale ending.**"

Throwaway as my husband knows my reddit account. I do not speak English as my first language, so apologies for that.

 ---

I want to start with that usual statement that my husband is a very good person, otherwise I would not have married him or have a child [7F] with him. He's kind, very generous and spontaneous and the love of my life.

He just isn't the father I had hoped him to be. Now, I might be overreacting, but I come from a household where my both my parents worked but my mother still was the main caregiver for me. She did everything, from cleaning, to cooking, to the taxes and bills and caring for our pets, while my dad came home and did very little. He probably asked me ten questions about myself in my whole life, he was not a very loving person, especially not towards my mom.

I am seeing this behavior in my husband and it is incredibly upsetting. I am supposed to care for the house and child even though we share similar working hours. When I bring this up, he says his work his harder and I have it easy because I am a receptionist. The constant arguing is so tiring and I just want to sleep for a week. My sexual drive is dead and that seems to be the only thing my husband complains about.

I have sat him down so many times to ask him to take care of our daughter and he will for a time, but then he acts like some kind of hero for caring for our daughter or spending some time with her. He does this especially when our friends and family are over and they praise him like some godly father who spends roughly 30 minutes a day with her. It is so upsetting because I do not get this, even though we could be doing the same thing.

I am so done. I have no idea how to get him to turn around and my daughter is growing moody as well in between the sudden amount of love she receives from her father and then next to none. Meanwhile, my husband grows upset that she and I are much closer.

Maybe my husband isn't as great as I thought or described in the beginning, but sometimes he is and I become hopeful again before he falls back into this weird absent father role. He comes from a household where his father was the same, which may be why he becomes so fussy and angry when I try to make him to be a parent.

I am tired of being called a nag, I just want us to be a household of equality before my daughter picks up that his behavior is in any way okay.

Reddit, I have no one to speak to about this and I would love to get some help with the situation. Is there any way to fix this or are we doomed to fail?

My son has a heart condition he was diagnosed with. It is very stressful for my wife, daughters and I. The one bad thing is he's going to need a lot of medication for the rest of his life. The good news is that it's treatable with medication and surgery. It's not going to cut his life short with treatment.   

Last night my family and I went to my mothers house for her birthday. My son was trying to get another cup cake when he already had 1 of them for desert. Our daughters and son were allowed 1. He didn't listen to my wife and went back a second time after she already said no. She put him in a make shift time out chair for 10 minutes. She did nothing else to him. She tried to explain nicely to him why he couldn't have one. He ignored her and so she dealt with it. She took him by his hand and walked him to a chair. 

My brother then got on our case on how it's cruel to treat him like a normal kid. He said that we should give him special treatment because of his heart, and go easy on him. I told him to really mind his own business. He then said he would never be mean to his kid if she has a heart problem. He won't keep his nose out of our business.

"I [19F] am being excluded from our gaming group. I decide to find a new group. Boyfriend [20M] is the one upset.


I am in a gaming group that has about 10 members (18-25F/M), including my boyfriend and I. A month ago, I had a fallout with a member in the group, who I'll call R (25M). Basically, I don't like R. All he ever does is degrade and talk about are women who are ""back-stabbing bitches who you can never trust"" and how much he loves to smoke weed and do drugs. Hearing those things constantly became a drag, so I decided that I did not want to around him anymore.

Ever since I cut off contact, I've been excluded from games whenever R plays because he does not want me there. Even my boyfriend told me not to join because it'll piss off R. Obviously, I don't want to play with R either so this is fine with me. The thing is, when R is playing, I'm excluded from the group as I can't play with anyone else, because they're all playing with R. This happens 3/4 days every week, and they play for 5-6 hours a day. 

I'm really shy, so I don't talk much in the group games besides doing the usual callouts. I know everyone would much rather play with R than me since he's more outgoing and fun to them, so I don't interfere. Even so, I still feel like shit for being left out constantly. My boyfriend didn't even defend me the first time I was excluded. He just told me to not join ever again and left it at that. Only one other person in the group has defending me, and that is my best friend (19M) since middle-school. When I first told him about the situation, he got really angry and asked me if I wanted him to stop playing with R too. I know my boyfriend and best friend love playing with R though, so I didn't ask them to stop.

Last night, R and the group were all playing again. I decided to look for some other groups online to play with, because being alone sucks. While on a break from his game, my boyfriend asked what I was doing. I told him casually that I was looking for a new gaming group to play with. His reaction was not what I was expecting. He got upset and kept questioning me why I wanted to leave our old gaming group. I told him since I'm being excluded from our old group so often, I may as well find a new group to play with because I obviously don't fit in anymore. Even after my answers, he would keep asking me why I couldn't just stay and participate in the group often. How am I suppose to participate in a group when I'm being excluded from it weekly? 

At that point, I told my boyfriend to stop talking to me about this subject and to leave it. He then said to me that I was overreacting to being excluded from the group and then went on a rant about why I couldn't just be happy for once since he still plays with me daily. My boyfriend and I do play daily, but we play alone with just us two since no one else in the group can play at the times we're online. Being excluded from playing with everyone else is what makes me feel like shit, not being excluded from playing with my boyfriend. I told him that if I find a new group, I would always play with him first, no matter what. However, I just want to find a new group to play with when he and everyone else are playing with R since I can't join in the first place, and playing alone sucks. He said fine in an annoyed tone, and we left it at that.

We haven't spoken about it since, but I can tell he's upset over it. Am I really overreacting to the situation? Do I just ignore my boyfriend for now? Do I say something? This is the first time I've ever seen him so upset over something I did. I'm not sure what to do.

"I [27F] feel like I can make no real friends as an adult. Is this just what adulthood is like?


I grew up in a small town, with about 100,000 people. All of my best friends (who live scattered across the country) grew up with me in this town and our relationships are rock solid. I guess having those friendships (though not in close proximity) makes my current situation harder, because I know what it COULD be like. 

I moved to a large city four years ago for work. I had a roommate, my best friend, (who now lives across the country) and a boyfriend, so my time was monopolized. When my boyfriend and I broke up, I tried making friends at work, but it seemed like I was the only one calling or making plans, so I stopped trying. My roommate ran with a different crowd (they liked to party and I didn't), so her connections weren't people I was interested in hanging out with. 

Over the last several years, I've managed to make ""friends,"" but they never last long. Our friendships feel shallow and boring compared to the connection I have with my friends from back home. I do have one friend that I spend a lot of time with, but I'm worried that our relationship is shallow because all we ever talk about are our interactions with men, and nothing else. She also has some of the same characteristics that I don't like about myself, and I find myself annoyed with her more often than not. I care about her and want to maintain our friendship, so I try very hard to accept her for who she is and work on deepening our relationship. She is a very good person and I do feel lucky to have her around, despite my annoyance.  

I realize that as a twenty-seven year old woman, most of the people I know will either be in serious relationships or married. Lots of the people I know in my city grew up here, and their social circle has been together for decades. I'm not in a serious relationship and do not feel like I will be in one in the foreseeable future. 

I considered for a while that I was the problem, since I kept trying to make friends and it never worked. I can be very selfish, often dramatic, abrupt, and pretentious. I have a hard time giving control to other people. Over the last few years, I've worked hard to become a kinder person, who is less reactive and more open to suggestions of others. Still no luck. Is it normal to have a hard time making real friends as an adult? Are my expectations too high and this is just what adulthood is like? 

TL;DR: I moved to a new city and four years later, still don't have connections like I do with my friends from back home. I don't have a boyfriend and spend a ton of time alone with my dog. Is this just what adulthood is like? I want to be content and happy with my life, but I miss my friends and I'm lonely. 

**Edit: Thank you guys for all of your responses. I read every single one, even if I didn't respond to it. I'm glad to know I'm not alone, but there is also a lot of great advice in this thread that I plan on putting to use immediately. Also, I have been informed that 100,000 people is NOT a small town. I just knew a lot of people so I guess it felt smaller to me. Would a better term be small city? Lastly, I am confused by some of your comments regarding my character. I mentioned my character flaws to point out that I am actively working to fix them. No one is perfect, but at least I'm self-aware.** "

"My [27M] little sister [16F] has many pets which she cares for AMAZINGLY! I want to offer her financial assistance- but worry that the offer could be rude




My sister got her first pet, a hamster, at age 8. She cared for it amazingly for two years until it died. She was heartbroken. She got another animal last year when she started working. 

My mom remembered what a good job she did with the hamster, and told her she could have any animal she wanted as long as she cared for it and paid for it. She saved for a month and got an African gray. She then got a hedgehog, then a snake.

She quickly became well known in ou neighborhood as an animal lover and an amazing caretaker. She works 40 hour a week in A exotic animal rescue during the summer, and does online school during the year and continues to work. She has really bad anxiety and has chosen online school.

She has over 15 different species of animal at this point. All are spoiled and regularly taken to the vet. She works her butt off and never complains or buys anything for herself. It all goes to the animals.

She keeps on acquiring rescues due to people in our area adopting animal, not being able to care for them, and then offering them to her. She has turned down a few that she doesn't think she could care for (for example a horse). I'm really proud of how responsible she is.

I've reached a point in life where I make a great income and am married with no plans to have kids. My wife and I would like to offer my sister $500 a month to help care for her animals. We are considering offering more- but wanted someone else's opinion on what we should offer.

The extra money would allow her to take in
More special needs animals and help care for her special needs chinchilla which frequently has to see the vet. It could also help her buy things for herself. It's for whatever she wants, basically.

The thing is she's never had any assistance with the animals. She basically lives alone because my mom is always on work trips, and has never had help financially. She's never taken more then a day trip and has told me she can't and doesn't want to because of her animals. I'm happy to babysit her animals and have told her that. But she says she doesn't want to make them anyone else's job.

She's so insistent that she doesn't mind them being solely her responsibility that it makes me hesistant to offer help. 

My mom says she would be fine with me offering help.

Would it be a nice offer? Is $500 too much or too little? Are there other better things I could offer her?

TLDR: my sister has a ton of animals and works 40
Hours a week to care for them. She's a great pet owner and her life is basically devoted to them. I want to offer her financial assistance but she's so clear that she is fine with them being her sol responsibility that i worry she may perceive it as me not thinking she's responsible enough or doesn't have enough $. What do you think? Is there something better I could offer her?

"Guy [24M] decided on his own that he can stay at my house for a week [20F].


I’ve been using Tinder lately and met up with guy about a month ago. We hooked up a few times and since then he’s been constantly asking me to hang out, calling me “babe”, calling me on the phone, etc. etc. This is another problem in itself. I usually ignore him or laugh it off- I don't want to date him but he's a nice guy. I see him once or twice a week or so. 



He’s told me a couple of times in passing that he’s moving back to his state mid August. Yesterday, he told me he has to move out of his house at the beginning of August. I was curious so I asked him where he’s going to stay and he said “With you or I’ll be sleeping on the streets.” I asked him if he was serious and he said “Seriously, I haven’t made any other plans.” 



Like, what? That's in a few days. He’s a nice guy, but he didn’t even ask me and now is making me feel really guilty. I like living alone. I know it’s only one week and that I don’t have roommates to deal with, but I don’t want to have to share my space. Is it out of line that I’m feeling kind of creeped out, annoyed, and angry? What should I say? Help!

Hi Reddit. I've been going through a lot of emotional stuff this past month &amp; really needed someone to talk to about what is going on.. my friends all live far away now and my parents will kick me out if they find out what's been going on in my life.


To begin, my ex and I dated for a little over 2 years and broke up about a month and a half ago. We were generally a happy couple. We went to school together, smoked weed, played video games, lived with each other for quite some time.. I was pretty happy with how things were between us until the last few months when he started getting into drugs. That's when shit started getting really difficult.


He quit his job for almost two months leaving me the pressure to pay all our bills when I wasn't making enough at my new job. He was ordering ""research chemicals"" and was consistently getting high with a little glass pipe. Wouldn't eat or sleep for literally days. When he got angry on these drugs he would take a lot of things out on me. He did things like punch himself/walls/doors, scream in my face and said a lot of really shitty things to me. In one occasion he even swallowed all my anxiety medication when I tried to break up with him.


Anyway, our relationship was getting to a point where it was NOT healthy. The last fight we got in that ended everything was at the end of may. I stormed off into our old bathroom crying when we were fighting and he ran after me. Threw my straightener to the ground and broke it. Got in my face screaming to the point where there was spit on me &amp; I reacted by slapping him in his face, and that's when he took me to the ground and strangled me. I was truly scared for my life. I didn't feel safe. He left me in the bathroom while I was gasping and continued to break my things. The next day I was foolish and tried to see if we could work things out after I spent the night at my moms. He told me I was a stupid cunt, and to take my dog and leave... so I did. I was hysterical. I even went to his mom on several occasions for help and all she ever really had to say was that she's sorry he's fucked up, like his dad. Who is a druggie and in prison rn.


Anyway, things ended very badly. When I moved out I filed a police report sending them pictures of the bruises he left on my throat because I felt threatened, and knew that if he kept doing those drugs when we broke up that maybe he'd come after me. 


After about a month or so he contacted me once he found out I went on a date with another guy. I didn't reply to anything at first, and even blocked him. He then messaged me on Reddit and I was weak and answered. We caught up for a while and eventually I met up with him. He has been off drugs, and was looking a lot healthier. I had such a great time seeing him and hearing how much he missed and loved me that I basically forgot what he did to me. Took me on dates that I had been bugging him about when we were still together, and I really enjoyed his company.


Well yesterday night I was on my way over to his place and that's when I got a call from his mom saying he was arrested. I tried going to the police station where he was held but they wouldn't let me talk to anyone. I didn't even press charges, the police did because they were concerned. He got charged for assault and attempted murder.


His mom took me to the court house today 
To see if we could get him out and it was so damn awkward. She really doesn't give a shit about me, and is using me to get her son out of jail. Which didn't work btw. I felt stupid after I got home thinking to myself why am I trying to help him? Is he really going to change?  I just have so many mixed emotions and feelings for him still that I let it get to my head. 


I'm not really sure what I should do. He has tried calling me three different times today from the jail and I accidentally missed two of them. The third one I was just too scared to answer. I keep hoping he'll call back again and i keep my phone on me at all times waiting. Idk why I can't seem to let him go. What he did was so wrong but even if I wanted to drop the charges I wouldn't be able to because it wasn't me who did it.


His family keeps contacting me, basically telling me to lie about what he did to the court so he can be let out. But it wasn't a lie, and I don't want to go to court. Idk if I can get in trouble for communicating with him these past two weeks too. I'm really scared and I know I probably sound stupid for wanting to be with him even tho it's pretty damn near impossible. 


Do you think he'll really change? Should I go to court and lie? I care about him so much but I just don't want to make myself lie like that, and the fact that his family doesn't seem to give a fuck about what I think or even believe that he laid hands on me really bothers me. They're making me feel like I was the one in the wrong here. Sometimes I feel like I am. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to lie, even though is still care about him?

"Me (20F) with my Mom and Step-Dad (59F/60M), they won't invite me to family outings anymore


Hey Reddit, I'm new to posting and I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any horrendous errors I make. 

Here's some background: I am an only child and a sophomore in college. My parents have been divorced since I was 6 and I don't really talk to my dad anymore because he's emotionally abusive and manipulative. I've always been very close to my mom. My stepdad (we'll call him ""Bill"") has been around since I was 8 or so, and he's been very accepting and caring towards me in general. I am very grateful for the help and support that my mom and Bill have given me throughout the years, and I recognize that they have done a lot for me and I go out of my way to always thank them and try to show my appreciation. 

Onto the issue: my mom and Bill are currently in the process of finishing up a cabin that they own by a lake. When I was still in high school, they would invite me to come with them during the summer to spend time with them. Now, like 3 years later, my parents still go to the cabin fairly often but they do not invite me anymore. I haven't seen in it about a year and a half, and the last time I was there was just in passing.

My parents have always gone on trips without me (usually to Arizona or Las Vegas) and I've always understood that they need their time to be by themselves and enjoy being adults without worrying about me. But recently they've been going a lot more, like last summer they went on a two week vacation to Hawaii with my extended family and didn't invite me. This year they went to San Francisco and San Diego for a week with extended family and didn't invite me. 

I completely understand that my parents are under no obligation to take me places and I really do not mean to sound like a brat, but it just makes me upset to not even be invited. Especially on trips where my extended family goes too, or to the cabin which is big enough to have me stay too and used to be a family-spot. I've even offered to drive myself to the cabin and meet them or pay my own way on trips, but they've never wanted me to. It makes me feel like I am no longer included in the family. 

I talked to my mom about it last night and she said that ""because I'm an adult now, they have no reason to invite me to things. I am in college and working my own job, and that all must mean I'm independent from them."" My mom also said that ""she doesn't understand why I'm not upset that my dad doesn't ever want to do anything with me (and I WAS upset about that growing up. It took years of therapy to feel okay, and she knows that), and that if my dad doesn't have to invite me to things then she doesn't understand why she and Bill have to either.""

So my question is, where do I go from here? Do I try to talk to her about it again today and clarify how I'm feeling? Do I just move on and start distancing myself? Is this a problem that other people have faced? How did you handle it? Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. 

TLDR; parents have stopped inviting me on family trips, say it's because I'm an adult and if my abusive father doesn't have to invite me to things then they don't think they need to either. What do I do now?"

"My coworker's [25M] girlfriend [25F] threatened me [21F]


I’ve been working at my dream company in the city for about a year and two months now. We have a very small office, less than 15 full-time employees and with the exception of about 4 “higher-ups”, everyone is pretty young. There are one or two people in their 30s, but everyone else is in their early to mid-20s. The company specializes in something extremely specific, and we all like to nerd out about what we do. Couple that with the fact that most of them moved from far away for this opportunity, and don't really know people in the city outside of work, my coworkers and I became fast friends when we were interns for this company last summer. Another thing to note, without giving too much away, this company is in an extremely male-dominated industry. I’m the only girl in the office, and it’s been that way since I began as an intern. It was weird at first, but the guys were so welcoming and treat me with the same level of respect as everyone else. Since we have been working together for over a year, a group of six of us have become super close and hang out together a lot outside of work. They’re some of the best friends I’ve ever had and spending time with them is always a blast. 

One of the guys, Jack [25M], and I were very close last summer when we were interns. We sat next to each other every day at work and would get lunch sometimes. One day, he started texting me out of the blue, and this continued into the fall, when I had gone back to school. It definitely got flirty at times, and he would initiate conversations about random things for no reason at all, which made me think he was possibly interested in me. I wasn’t really looking for anything at the time, but after thinking about it, I decided if he asked me out, I definitely would’ve said yes. He was cute, had a great personality and we had a ton in common. Obviously it’s never a great idea to date coworkers, but we were interns at this point, both of us fully expecting to part ways when our internships ended, so it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. We never went on a date or anything, it was just harmless banter. 

As time went on, I kind of realized that even though he’s a great guy, there were a lot of fundamental incompatibilities between us and we would probably never work out as a couple. In addition, we both got hired full-time, so not wanting to risk this golden opportunity I was given, I stopped flirting with him. And just as well, because I started crushing on someone else (not in the company, for the record) and he started dating a girl from his hometown over the winter and pretty much stopped texting me altogether, unless it was work-related. We still continue to be great friends.

So fast forward to yesterday. One of my coworkers in our group, Sam, threw a party/BBQ at his place after work and invited our usual crew. Jack’s girlfriend, Lisa, was visiting him this weekend, so he took her along. It was mainly us sitting around, drinking and talking, while Sam grilled. Lisa and I were the only two girls there, and since she didn’t know anybody other than Jack, I struck up a conversation with her while a bunch of us were outside on the porch. She seemed really nice at first, and we were getting along. We start talking about work, and at this point, all the guys went inside to play video games, so it was just her and I outside talking. She asked about what I did, then asked how many other girls work there. I told her zero, and that I was the only one. Her face visibly dropped and she said “Really?” in a very judgmental tone. At the time, I was taken aback by the fact her demeanor just turned on a dime, so I just went on to say that it was weird at first, but they treat me like one of the guys, and we’re all friends, so it doesn’t really matter. She asked me if I had a boyfriend, which was pretty random, but I answered honestly and said no. She was silent for a second before she looked me dead in the eye and said “You better stay away from mine then.” I kind of just laughed uncomfortably, thinking she was just kidding, until she stood up and said, “No, really. If I find out you’ve been hanging out with him, I’ll ruin your goddamn life.” I was stunned. The things she was saying sounded like she was spouting lines from a badly-written movie. I didn’t really know what to say to that, so, probably not making much sense, I just said something to the effect of “I don’t know who you think you are, but you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t hang out with.” I know I shouldn’t have even engaged, but she just made me so mad, and it all came out of nowhere! She stormed back into the house. I followed her in, and just hung out with the other guys, on opposite sides of the room from her for the rest of the night. Lisa kept making eye contact with me while touching Jack, but I just tried to ignore her. Jack didn’t seem to notice a thing, and didn’t act any differently toward me for the remainder of the party.

So now I don’t know what to do. For the record, I’m not scared of this girl on a personal level. She’s clearly ridiculous and crazy possessive. She also lives in Jack’s hometown, which is about 4 hours away from us, and this is the first time in the 7 or 8 months they’ve been together that she’s come to visit him, so it’s not like she’d be around to check up on me. Jack and I never hang out one-on-one, it’s always in a group. If I stopped hanging out with them and decided to live in fear of her, I’d be letting her win, and like I said to her, she doesn’t get to keep me away from my friends. However, I am scared about what she could do to me professionally. Jack and I are on the same team at work. We sit next to each other, we work on projects together and are in constant communication throughout the day. I’m afraid she could tell Jack a rumor about me to make him uncomfortable around me at work. Or, she could make up something really bad, Jack could believe her, get the company involved and have my job be in jeopardy. I worked so hard for this job, and it’s a golden opportunity for people in our industry – I wouldn’t get the experience or opportunities anywhere else. I get the vibe that she’s done this to other girls before, since she was so quick to launch right into a threat, and I don’t want her to actually ruin my life if she has the capability.

So what should I do? Should I bring up to Jack that his girlfriend made me uncomfortable? What worries me is it’s my word against hers at this point, since no one else was outside with us, and he has no real incentive to believe me over his girlfriend, who he seems to really like. Sam and I have gotten very close over the last few months, and Sam is also very close with Jack – should I confide in Sam what happened, and maybe he can low-key bring it up to Jack? Or should I just drop it completely and try to move on with my life? Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL,DR: My coworker's girlfriend threatened to ""ruin my life"" if I continue to hang out with him."
"My [24] parents [50; 57] don't want me to move out because ""I'm not done cooking,"" but I want out.


Hello, /r/relationships. I apologize in advanced for the length.

Sorry if this is a long ramble, I don't know how to put this in a narrative.

So i have generalized anxiety disorder which disrupted a lot of my life, and naturally, my parents are extremely protective of me. I would get panic attacks, go through extremely bad relationships, and worry over nonsensical things. They've told me all my life to not worry about getting a job and to just let them pay for things. 

I would feel pretty guilty about this, especially since my parents were always giving money to my bio dad to take care of my severely autistic bother, and to my older sister who has a kid and has terrible money issues of her own from her own screw ups (she crashes cars, got fired from work all the time, and more.) So every chance I got, I would try to get a job. But my parents would always talk me out of it saying I'm not worried and that they would take care of it. I was in high school, so I didn't have much free time anyway. 

This was fine as a teenager but now I'm 23. I'm constantly driving between campuses and my internship, while also living an active social life and participating in the speech/debate team which gives me a grant that covers half the tuition. I make straight A's despite any trouble I run into, and just today found out that since I turn 24 in September, I qualify for a pell grant that will cover my tuition. Not to mentioned I am only 6 classes away from graduating with my BA! My anxiety is also ten times better, and I feel extremely accomplished. Even my speech coaches have told me they're so proud of how far I've come.

But every summer during my college years I would try to find a job and my parents would make me quit. I only succeeded in keeping one job at a retail store, and they decided to push me to babysitting my brother so much I had to quit for ""the family."" After I quit my babysitting duties suspiciously subsided. I am only allowed 200 dollars a month for food expenses and gas, and since I go to school everyday back and forth in-between my internship, this isn't enough to sustain myself. I tried to bargain for more, they say I need to budget. I offer to get a job, they say absolutely not.

Thing is, this is my last year. My tuition is being paid for myself and I only take three classes a semester now. This would be perfect to get a job to save up some money and to move out and transition to true independence. I also have an amazing, loving boyfriend who wants to take the next step and have me move in with him. I'm delighted but my parents 100% do not approve, despite him being so polite and making so much effort to get to know them (he bought my little brother two expensive transformers toys and didn't receive any thank you from them at all, much less bothered to even talk to him).

I feel so discouraged. I tried hinting that I want to leave but they keep saying weird stuff like ""you're not done cooking yet,"" and how I need to focus on my studies. Well I've been focusing on my studies and obviously they are fine. When I told my (step) dad about potentially having good news about my Grant money, he immediately berated me: ""No, you're not moving out."" Even though I wasn't even going to TALK about it.

They put a lot of pressure on me to do impromptu milk runs in the middle of the night, to take care of my brother while they go out. They say I can come and go as I please, but demand me to text me where I am through out the day and make extremely snide remarks on how I practically live at my boyfriends even though they establish that it was supposed to be absolutely fine.

I'm getting sick of living here. I get berated for hanging my bath towel in the ""incorrect"" towel rack, have to stop at home to do the dishes between school and my internship even though I'm barely home enough to do the dishes anyway, and I get fussed at for not being home but when I AM at home they don't even acknowledge my existence unless they need something. I'm so tired of them seeing all my anxieties as me not being ready, and not seeing the strides I could make on my own.

But I'm still conflicted. I don't want to lose them, I just want to move out and live my life freely and develop responsibility. I feel weird that they aren't even letting me do that. I don't feel like I'm even home here anymore. 

tl;dr: despite me being responsible, straight a, productive student with grant money to pay for tuition, parents still won't let me out and I feel trapped. 


Edit: Wow! I never imagined my post would get this big! I am extremely grateful for the advice and constructive criticism. I do think my parents have slight narcissism issues, but ultimately in their weird way they seem to think they are doing the best by me while also taking extreme advantage of the situation. I'm applying to multiple part time jobs, and have been for a while - but the advice everyone has given out has just reaffirmed that I MUST do this. Once I get a job and have a decent amount of income, I am going to let my mother know that I will move, and that she can't say anything to change my mind. I know she'll be pissed, and that my step dad will be enraged, but I suppose that's the cost of seeking happiness.

I might schedule a therapist appointment in the mean time with someone who is quite familiar with how my mother can be, and seek her advise as well. 

Thank you everyone again I truly appreciate the outside perspective!"

"My [24F] boyfriend [24M] of a year is so forgiving of people and accuses me of holding grudges.


My boyfriend Aaron is very forgiving of others, which in some ways is a good quality, but I think he takes it too far. I'm all for working things out and not cutting people off for petty things, but if someone is constantly causing me a problem, I don't see why I should be kind and helpful to them anymore. I don't get involved when I think my boyfriend is being too forgiving because it doesn't affect me and if Aaron wants to waste his time on someone who doesn't deserve it, that's his problem. But he argues with me when I don't do this and often accuses me of holding a grudge. Like when I quit a group I had been volunteering with, because I thought a lot of the people in charge were rude and disrespectful, and he said I should have stayed and tried to work it out with them. I'm not going to waste my time changing the culture of an organization when I'm not even required to be there. I found another group that does the same kind of work, so I feel like I solved the problem.

We got in a huge argument yesterday, because he was in the room when I got a phone call from a landlord about my ex-roommate, Angie, who had put my info down in her rental history. I can only assume she didn't think the landlord would actually check on this. Angie was a terrible person to live with. As an example, me politely asking her to clean up her dishes which had been sitting in the sink for three days turned into a huge fight where she got defensive and said that it wasn't her fault, and that I had left a dish out two months ago so I was a hypocrite, and she didn't say anything at the time because she was so nice. She yelled that it was so unfair, because I got home much earlier than she did, and that if I wasn't so lazy I could have just done them, and that I was an asshole for asking for more money in exchange for doing the chores because she had credit card debt to pay and wahhh wahhh wahhh. This was pretty typical of Angie, and I became very stressed out, never knowing what would set off a fight.

If the person who called me had been someone renting out a whole apartment, I would have just said Angie paid her rent on time and didn't trash the place, but the woman was renting out a room in her house, so she would be actually living with my ex-roommate. So I told the whole truth, and when the woman asked if I would live with Angie again, I said absolutely not.

Aaron got very mad at me for doing this, and said it's okay not to want to live with Angie anymore, but that I shouldn't be sabotaging her chances of having a home somewhere else that had nothing to do with me. My argument is the woman asked me questions, and I answered. I didn't go on a smear campaign or make of stories about Angie to get her in trouble. If Angie ever expected me to help her with anything, she shouldn't have burned her bridge with me.

I'm tired of Aaron always getting on my case about why I didn't help this person, or why I won't visit this person, and how I hold grudges all the time, when most people would agree that my complaints about these people are reasonable. If he wants to be super forgiving that's on him, but how can I get him to back off when it's my problem?

"I [22M] being stalked by my downstairs neighbors


So here's the story:

My neighbors would keep banging on my floor (his ceiling) whenever I walked around my apartment. Despite putting carpets, walking lightly, even to the point where I would avoid walking, the slightest noise would bother them.

I've previously made complaints, and this one final time my landlord made it clear to them that if I would complain again it they'd move out.

They look like a couple around 50 and the husband is always home.

So I've noticed that he would always stand outside, when my window is open and just wait there, as if he were trying to listen to my conversations.

I've noticed that when I would leave the apartment, he would as well. When I would come home from the gym, he would follow me back. When I would legit go bring out trash/recycling, he would attempt to go out for a walk. 

I know I sound paranoid, but this shit is straight out creepy. I have no idea what his intentions are, nor what he wants.

I wanted to know what I could do at this point. I can defend myself, but I'd rather go non-physical if anything happens.

Thanks!

TL;DR: My downstairs neighbor is following me, listening in my conversations when windows are open and I want to find a solution for him to stop stalking me.

"Me [30F] with my wife[30F], I think she is addicted to the internet and is about to lose her job over it


Yesterday was a final straw for my wife's internet usage and when I tried to make it a discussion, she became hysterical and wouldn't speak to me.

She told me that she's received her final warning for 'excessive internet usage' at work. I said to her ""final warning? how many have there been?"" Two or three times in the past year. She usually spends her time on facebook, tumblr, amazon, forums, twitter, etc. Things I can definitely understand an employer not wanting to pay her for. ""They don't give me enough work to do, and I told them that"". Great.

She is late to her job every morning, no matter what her start time is. When she had a start time of 8am, she'd show up at 8:20. Her boss ended up changing her start time to just be at 8:15 am for her (very nice of him) but then she was just coming in at 8:30 or 8:45. Last month they changed her start time to 9am. I leave the house for work at 7 usually, so I assumed she was easily making it in by 9. Last week I was ill and worked remotely and saw that no-- she wasn't even leaving the house until her shift was about to begin. No matter what her start time is at her job, she's late.

Why is she late, you ask? Well, it's only a 20m drive so distance and traffic isn't the reason. Every morning, as soon as she blinks herself awake, she reaches to the nightstand for her cellphone. Facebook is usually the first thing she goes to. I'll say to her 'hey put the phone down and get ready' and she'll say ""this is my routine, this is my routine, i have to do it"". The problem is she'll lay in bed on her phone/Facebook for an hour or more every morning. By the time she puts the phone away, she's supposed to start her shift in 20 minutes and she hasn't even gotten out of bed or showered yet.

The addiction is now affecting our relationship. Can't even talk to her hardly anymore. She comes home from work, out comes the phone. I'll ask her a question 2, 3, 4, 5, times, and she never responds. It's like she's on another planet. If we try to watch a show? She's on her phone the whole time too, playing games or reading posts. I've begun to feel like an echo in my own home, almost like I live alone. I can't even remember the last time she wasn't staring at her screen and it's been getting so much worse. 

Other than the phone usage, our relationship is good. We love each other dearly, care about each other immensely, and typically almost never argue. Now all of our arguments stem from me asking her to put the phone/internet down.

I've suggested she sees a therapist (many times) for her depression. She always agrees but never follows through. Last night I suggested ""Why don't we deem 8pm-9pm for Social Media Time"" and leave our phones away the rest of the evening. She was immediately incensed and snapped, ""That's NOT going to help my depression."" Her instant defensiveness is an obvious red flag that this is an addiction issue. 

Any time I try to talk to her about this, she breaks down into hysterics or gets extremely mean towards me. I've tried multiple approaches, ranging from ""I'm concerned for you"" to ""I'm worried about me"" to ""How can we realistically plan to raise a child if you can't even get to work on time like the rest of the world?"" 

I don't want to resent her but I'm starting to. Also to make note, she does fall on the autistic spectrum, which she employs often when I confront her (""I'm an aspie, i need my routine and can't possibly change it"" or ""I'm an aspie, I'm always late and that's never changing""). I'm trying to be understanding of mental limitations but these seem like problems that some simple time management could resolve. 

What do I do? I feel like a stranger in my own home with my own wife, I'm terrified she will lose her job and she doesn't seem to care about keeping it, and I can't support us both on my income. Am I being insensitive like she claims? I don't want to be a bad wife, but I'm genuinely afraid this addiction is going to ruin her life and mine with it.

"I'm pregnant and so is the other woman


Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I don't even know where to begin-my life has become something you only see on the Lifetime channel. 

Background: I (33F) have been with my husband (35M) for 6 years. I have a daughter (8F) that he's been stepdad to that entire time. Thought everything was great. Never fought, didn't disagree on finances or life goals or parenting. We were the couple that made others cringe with our love. This all came as a complete shock to me and it happened right after he was laid off from his job. 

A few months ago, my husband admitted depression and left me for another woman who he had been having an emotional affair with for a month (24F) who happened to also be a coworker and someone I knew on a personal level before he did. Moved in with her immediately after starting therapy even though I was pregnant with his child. Went to a few sessions and stopped. I dealt with that as best I could, with him still supporting us financially and me not completely losing my shit as I understand mental health issues quite well and felt a lot of empathy for what he was going through. 

Things have been...okay. We don't talk much but he pays the bills and sees our daughter occasionally. That is until this latest bomb. He's gotten the other woman pregnant. Cue me completely losing my cool in hormonal devastation. I don't even know how to react or think or move forward at this point. I cannot work due to this very high risk pregnancy as well as health issues of my own. I haven't worked in almost a year which before all this happened, was a mutual decision and a necessity for my health. 

I don't even know where to go from here. Two babies will be born very close together and the logistics of that have my mind running in an endless circle. How am I supposed to explain this to the daughter he barely sees since this other woman entered the picture? How am I supposed to deal with this emotionally? And how is he possibly going to deal with the realities of this situation when the babies come? How will he possibly be able to spend time with our children when he has another one in another city with another woman? 

I feel utterly replaced. I feel my child and unborn child have been replaced. I feel...invisible now. He says he wants to still be involved but neither of us know how to make that work. I can't even look at him right now. The kicker is, almost no one knows we even separated months ago. Divorce isn't an option yet since my child and I would lose our health insurance and not qualifying for any sort of government aid (already spoke to a lawyer and social worker before the second pregnancy came out in the open). 

Thank you in advance for reading this hot mess. I don't even know what sort of advice I'm looking for. I mostly just had to get this off my chest. 

EDIT: my post is locked but I wanted to let each of you know (especially those that I was unable to reply to because of the lock), that I read each and every response and I am so grateful for the advice, support, and Internet hugs. I'm still in shock and it's going to be so hard moving forward, but I have taken all of these responses to heart. Thank you all so very much. 

TL;DR : husband left me for another woman and we're both pregnant and I don't know how to deal"

"Friend [22F] keeps on requesting to hang out with my boyfriend [22M] I'm [21F] feeling paranoid and territorial and I need help handling it appropriately.


Alright, so we'll call my friend Mandy. Never had trouble with Mandy before, but I've only been single while we've been friends. When we were single we'd club and hang out a lot together. Mandy is a casually dating right now but she's been having trouble finding men that want a calm monogamous relationship.

So, we all smoke. James (bf) And I smoke maybe twice a week. We typically do it together, and for some reason we usually have sex afterwards. I think this matters in the context of the story because Mandy knows this. (I recommended she try It with a guy she was with) It might not matter, but I'm paranoid, so I do think I'm kinda grasping at straws a bit.

So from square one Mandy thought James was a good guy. Liked his personality, commented that she found him attractive, basically that I ""got a good one."" I figured this was fine, this is just the whole ""my friends comment on my new guy"" thing. She's expressed jealousy a few times but nothing super weird or detailed, just that she wishes she'll meet a guy like him. I didn't think this way a big deal since I've said things like ""he's such a catch! I hope I meet someone like him"" in the past too.

Lately, if we hang out with Mandy, she comes out dressed similar to when we go to a bar as opposed to when she and I hang out alone. Like curled hair and a sexy outfit. Using her good makeup. But she's still in her jeans t shirt makeup free combo when her and I go out anywhere.

She's also been requesting to hang out with him one on one. For instance, I asked him to pick and and drop off a pizza for me and her on his way home. He said sure, and that he'd bring me a bottle of wine and some weed since I like the boozy-high pizza eating experience. So I told Mandy this and she got way over excited. Like, too excited. Jumping around. All of a sudden she wanted us to do each other's makeup for fun. And she took her hair out of the bun it was in.

So James drops off pizza and wine but apologizes because he forgot the weed. No big deal. Mandy made it a big deal. ""How could youuuu, I'm so disappointeddddd."" Now the voice thing is only how I've heard her speak to men. But in all fairness, from her dad to the mailman, all men get that tone &amp; voice from her. James kinda laughed it off and told her to feel blessed with the free wine and pizza.

So James leaves, and Mandy is still laughing about the situation and basically said ""he's so funny, give me his number!"" I was kinda monotone and I straight up asked for what? She said she wanted it so she could smoke with him later since he forgot the weed, in case I was busy when she was free. I laughed and said no (was this inappropriate/controlling of me? should I have spoken to James first?)  after I said no, she asked me why. I told her James is only free to smoke when I'm free. 😅 Which is, yknow, a lie. 

So the situation died out from there. No longer wanted to do each other's makeup and the hair went back up into a bun.

She's continued requesting to hang out as a trio and I'm kinda here playing gatekeeper now. So I feel like I could be paranoid because it's possible she doesn't want him! Maybe she literally just wants to smoke and I'm the crazy ass girlfriend. (i.e. for free since James would be generous since she's my friend.) Maybe shes just lonely and enjoys the vibe/dynamic we have! But I'm so paranoid and territorial now. I notice dumb shit like whether her hair is up or down and how much makeup she's put on now. It's unsettling haha.

So yeah. I need to have conversations with both James and Mandy since I feel like the goalie protecting James from Mandy. I love Mandy, we've had a bunch of great times. Shes been great until now. But she also can't have my man. BUT, I also don't want to be the crazy gf that's cutting off friends that she feels threatened by. 

Help me out please. I need a calm cool way to mske boundaries known while not causing any scenes.

Tl;dr: I think my friend wants my man. But I could be wrong. I don't want to throw away my friendship with her unless I really have to."

I used facebook to find a group, and I guess the last time I used that group not many ppl were online, but now every body has phones and fb is a big family connector.

Thanks, r/relationships. I read posts here for the advice (and the drama, for real) and because of the collective smartness of this community my interpersonal interactions are ready for this. I've already fixed my social media (Put your friends into diff groups, ppl) and have been able to request personal space boundaries without even thinking twice about it.

"UPDATE: I (M31) have been dating my best friend’s sister (F28) for 3.5 months, but I get confused on whether she is very reserved or just disinterested.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rizfz/i_m31_have_been_dating_my_best_friends_sister_f28/

Hello. As an avid reader, I have always appreciated updates so I figured I would provide one on my previous post (nothing that interesting however, sorry for the length).

My OP was at the 3.5 month mark. At 5 months, nothing had improved and had in fact deteriorated. 

I was scheduled to go on an out-of-state trip in the near future, and two weeks before said trip, Beth came over to my house. Admittedly, she was not feeling well and I appreciated the effort she had made to come over. However, she was quite distant, and she insisted that I “didn’t have to walk [her] to her car every time”. I told her it was no trouble, and she responded by saying “I’m a very independent woman, you can’t take that away from me.”
I was very taken aback. I told her I was not trying to do anything of the sort and it was just a common courtesy. We kissed goodnight and parted ways. Afterwords, our texts were brief, and I decided to stop initiating and wait until she reached out.

She went silent for a week. :(

At this point, the message was clear; she Just Wasn’t That Into Me, but didn’t want to be the one to break it off. I figured if that was the case it was kind of incumbent upon her to speak up, but I figured I’d go ahead and rip the band-aid off. So I went ahead and called and asked to swing by her place. I did so, and I basically broke down how I was feeling:

•	I really like her and think she’s awesome

•	That being said, I get the feeling I’m way more into her than she is into me

•	Regardless, my needs for passion, attention, and affection are not being met

•	The last thing I would want to do is ask her to be someone she’s not

•	Maybe we’re better off as friends

I presented this pretty matter of factly, and I assumed she would jump at the chance to break things off in a very amicable manner. Much to my surprise, she really protested. She said that she did like me and knew she had a problem with opening up, but that she was hoping to continue our relationship and that we could both have a chance to grow. I asked her about the comment she made the last time we saw each other, and she said she was joking. I told her I didn’t get it. I also said that regardless, if she is going to go a week without talking to me, then I (and I think 99% of guys) would see that as a sign of disinterest.

We talked about a lot of stuff (I was there for like three hours), but as for our relationship, we decided to keep seeing each other. I was going to take her at her word that she likes me and not jump to conclusions, and she was going to do a better job of being more demonstrative about her feelings.

Things were a bit better at first, but then it seemed like she was back to just being disinterested. Then, about a month after our big talk (so we had been dating for about 6 months at this point) we had another awkward goodbye followed by her not texting me for a week, something I had specifically told her I would interpret as disinterest. At this point, I decided I was a bit over having to initiate every single interaction, and that I didn’t really want to date someone who wasn’t excited to spend time with me. 

I spared us another drawn-out conversation like last time that clearly didn’t do anything, and broke it off by text. Maybe not the best way to do it, but at least I was willing to consider her feelings and talk to her at all. I told her that it was clear she was checked out, and not intending on even addressing the situation. I did acknowledge that my tone would come off as frustrated (because I was) but that I didn’t want there to be any hard feelings. She replied and said she wasn’t checked out and was intending to address things (when???), but she respected my opinion. She apologized for being preoccupied and making me feel upset and frustrated, and agreed we should remain on friendly terms.

So… that’s that. I’m far from being upset at this point, just a bit confused, ha ha. If she was over it, why not just break it off? And why fade out on someone you know you’re going to see again? It’s not like I’m just some random from Tinder or something. 

If she really wasn’t checked out, why would she act so distant, especially after our big talk? 

Whatever. It’s still a bit of a headscratcher but after the shit show that was my divorce, at least I can say I’ve been through a breakup that didn’t involve law enforcement! And like I said, I realize this isn't some big dramatic update, but I always appreciate them as a reader and I appreciate everyone who commented.

TL;DR: She kept being distant, and after a Come To Jesus Talk about it, she kept it up so I broke it off. Still a bit confused if she was really disinterested or we had different communication styles, but either way we’re not a good match.
