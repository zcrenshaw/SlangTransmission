"My wife and I [both 40'sF] want to ""propose"" adoption to our foster son [26M]


[removed]"
"My (25M) wife (27F) died from a heroin overdose. Her dad asked me not to tell anyone how she died, and for a year I kept the promise until I drunkingly admitted she was an addict to her sister. Turns out, her sister is an addict to, and was the person who got my wife into heroin.


My wife hid her heroin addiction from me extremely successfully, but to be fair, she only died 2 months after starting it. She would do it while I was away at work, and she would be sober by the time I was home. I didn't have a clue until I came home to her dead. There was fentanyl in the heroin she did. 

The only person I told was her dad, and he right away said to never tell anyone that, ever, because his family is heavily against addiction. I was told to tell them she had a bad reaction to her allergies (she had like, dozens upon dozens of allergies) and choked to death when her airways closed. They all knew her as a girl with a lot of allergies, it was easily believable. 

So I kept in contact with that family, and one day I went out to dinner with her sister and her sisters boyfriend. Boyfriend fell asleep and me and her sister had a nightcap, and I was pretty drunk at the time and we were talking about my wife and I just finally admitted the truth to her, she was a heroin addict. She just sighed and looked down and looked horribly sad suddenly. She said she knew she was a heroin addict, because she was the one who got her into heroin. She told me my wife was addicted to pills for a bit, then stole a small bump of H from her sister and then was addicted, and kept asking her sister for more and more and eventually her sister gave in and they were addicts together for a while. 

I was just astounded, not only did she know that my wife was doing heroin, but she was the one who got her into it. She is also still an addict, she showed me her marks on her arms. She said her father has no clue. 

I am not even sure what to do. I am very close with this family, I have been since I was 6 years old and grew up with them. In a way they are the family I never had. Its not like these people are 'just' my wifes family, I didn't even know my wife that well in the early years of growing up alongside them on our block. 

So I am really confused as to what to do. Should I tell the dad? Should I keep this secret to the grave? I dont know. I really, really don't. I am very close with the dad, I babysit his kid 4 days a week (he has another kid who is 11 years old with a younger wife, his old wife died).

"My [27 F] husband [25 M] and I have been married for less than six months and I can't have sex with him because of something awful that he did to me


My husband and I got married at the end of June of 2017 and we were together for seven years before we got married. We had a fight at the end of August. During this fight I was sobbing so hard in the bathroom that I was gagging and choking, like I was going to throw up. I went into our bedroom and my husband and I continued to fight and I continued to cry. Eventually, my husband mimicked how I was gagging from crying so hard. I have never felt so disgusted with another person or so embarrassed. Several days after the fight, I tried to explain to him how him mimicking me requires him to sincerely apologize and he refused. We have not had sex or even touched each other since this incident and I am having a very difficult time moving past what has happened and need advice as to what to do to move on.

"My [30F] wife doesn't believe that I [35M] want children.


So, my wife and I have been married for five years (together for 8 years).  Way back when, we decided that we wouldn't try for kids until after she had graduated from university.  That was all fine, she graduated three years ago, and she's in the workforce now.

Thing is though, she recently turned 30, and suddenly conception is the biggest thing in her life.  We've been trying to conceive for around a year, but no joy yet.  We've both been fertility tested, and the tests showed that we are capable of having children.

Thing is though, she has it in her head that I don't want children.  She thinks that I'm sabotaging her attempts to have a baby, that I don't want to be a parent, that I don't care about how she feels, now  she's getting older and time is ticking.

Thing is, I really, really would like to be a father, and she won't believe it.  It's become a big thing where she gets really pissed off with stupid things because she thinks that I don't want to have children with her.

What do I do here?

"Update: am I [F26] overreacting?


Update from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73m8a6/am_if26_overreacting/

First post didn’t get too much attention but helped me open my eyes. I realized things weren’t going to work out and we broke up last night. My ex [M28] has more problems than I am equipped to handle. Nothing crazy happened just disappointed at the decisions that led me to this point. Wish I had opened my eyes and got out sooner. I wasn’t happy and him being a jerk made everything a lot easier. Right now I just feel relieved. Kind of waiting for any emotions to hit me. Maybe I’ll feel something more than relieved once he moves out (hopefully tomorrow). 

Anyway that’s it. I feel relieved and excited to move on with my life and get back to who I was before this relationship. 

Tl;dr ex was treating me like trash so I ended it. Thanks for opening my eyes relationships. 

Edit: just wanted to do a quick edit and say thank you again to everyone’s advice and kind words. It’s really helpful in knowing I made the right decision. I was hanging out with my family and there wasn’t any service. I’ll be responding to everyone very soon. Appreciate all the support, kind strangers!

Also since a lot of people are asking I am keeping my pupper. I was the one who adopted him and honestly my ex won’t fight me for him because he doesn’t even like him. His loss!"
"My girlfriend [30F] is mad at me because of our Christmas plans [29M]


The holidays are coming up soon and since we spent last Christmas with my girlfriend's family, we are spending this Christmas with my family. My parents live in a pretty boring farming town, so we decided that we would travel somewhere for Christmas. It would be my parents, my sister, my sister's boyfriend, me, and my girlfriend travelling together, and my dad would be paying for all of us (flights, hotel or cruise tickets, everything). We were deciding between two options, a Caribbean cruise or winter activities in Northern Canada - snowshoeing, hot springs, snowmobiling, aurora borealis. I love the snow and get quite seasick, so my vote was for Canada (plus white Christmas wooh!). My girlfriend voted for the Caribbean. In the end, we all voted and there were more votes for Canada 4-2. 


So I told my girlfriend this and she responds with ""I do NOT want to go to Canada. You should have voted for the one that I wanted to go to. What the fuck are we going to do in Canada? It's cold, this resort doesn't look like it has been upgraded since the 80's, we're going to be stuck with your parents all week. At least if we were on a cruise ship, we could get away from them. Ugh.""
 I was kind of put off by this... I've been wanting to see the Northern Lights since I was 12 and I was actually really excited to spend my holidays hanging out in a cabin by the fire, reading a book and chilling out with my parents and sister, whom I haven't seen in almost 2 years. 


I almost want to tell my girlfriend ""Nobody is forcing you to come, if you're just going to be miserable and complaining the whole time, then just stay here with your family!"". But I know this will just result in her getting beyond angry at me. I understand that she is disappointed she doesn't get to go on a cruise and go to the beach... but I feel like she is telling me to ignore what I want and just agree with what she wants all the time. And her comment about having to spend time with my family really annoyed me. Her parents live about 20 minutes away from us so we see them every other Sunday for lunch and every single holiday (Easter, Columbus Day,Thanksgiving, siblings and parents birthdays). Does she not realize how much time I have spent with her parents these past 3 years compared to my own? 


I don't know what to do here. I feel like my girlfriend is being really selfish, but am I the one who is being selfish? Should I have voted to go to the Caribbean, knowing beforehand that that is what my gf wanted? I actually didn't really say anything after my girlfriend's comment. I was just so annoyed at everything she said that I felt it better not to respond at the moment. 

**Edit**: Hi everyone, thank you so much for all your comments. I did not think that I would get so many responses @_@ I am at work right now so I can't reply to everything, but I am definitely reading every single one of your comments. A lot of you are saying that there is only 1 thing to do, and should've been done yesterday. But I think I'm going to have to do a lot of thinking and I'll post an update when things get figured out. This is a throwaway account, so I'll write down the username and password somewhere haha. Again, thanks everyone. And for all of you who are asking where we're going, we're going to a resort just outside of Yellowknife!

My SIL Laura and I were hanging out today while I was visiting my brother. They had a kid recently and I wanted to go and see my nephew. My brother had some business to attend to and left for about an hour so it was just me and Laura.

I have always had an interest in martial arts and specifically in this one called Krav Maga which Laura has been training for over 5 years so she knows her shit. We were talking about it, I told her that I am really interested in starting to practice it, she showed me some really cool moves and what not but in the midst of all that, she accidentally managed to hit me. 

She didn't mean to and I don't blame her at all, stuff like this can happen. I told her that she doesn't have to worry and that I will be fine. Problem is that once my mother found out why I had a black eye, she flipped. She started going on this ridiculous tirade that my SIL hit me on purpose. She didn't and I tried to explain but my mom was having none of it. She now wants to call my brother and tell him that Laura gave me a black eye and so he can ""get his wife under control"" or something like that.

How can I stop my mom from making an ass out of herself? She and Laura aren't seeing eye-to-eye on things recently, especially after my nephew was born and I feel like my mom is just looking for an excuse to chastise Laura and make her the enemy. 


tl;dr while practising with my SIL, she accidentally hit me in the face. It was an accident and I don't blame my SIL at all. My mom thinks it was deliberate and she now wants to blame my SIL for this. How can I stop her from making an ass out of herself?

Well, my mom found out that I’m not a virgin through reading my texts through some kind of app. We talked, and now I’m basically worthless as a person to her. She is scared the secret is going to get out and ruin her reputation. A lot of people lose their virginity in high school; my parents are so religious that they don’t understand that. 

She hasn’t told my father yet, and when he finds out, he will ruin my life. I just don’t know what to do. I’m so scared. This is my senior year and I’m about to lose my car, my phone, my ability to go anywhere but church. I’m also so guilty and I feel like such a disappointment.

"I [27F] kept my birth name upon marriage. Brother-in-law [28 M] upset, writes me letter telling me to change my name.


(Throw-away account) Also, warning!! Long post, tl;dr at the bottom as usual.

**Background:** 
I (27F) married into a very traditional family. I, however am a gender egalitarian. To me it doesn't matter who takes who's name, but I personally feel very VERY attached to my last name (for reasons). So when I married my DH (25M) we decided to keep both our names. Children born to us would be hyphened. DH's family is NOT pleased. 


**Situation:**
 (A year and a half of marriage later) DH's family, being super traditional and a little patriarchal (they're mormon) were very hurt by me not taking DH's last name. They decided to ignore my decision and continued to refer to me by DH's last name instead of my birth-name. Among multiple incidents, my BIL (28M) put my married name on a family group e-mail. I decided to confront him individually about it. Perhaps he forgot, perhaps he didn't know how to address me, so let's talk about it! I asked BIL to change my name back to my birth-name on his e-mail, reminding him of my decision. (I was very nice about it, in fact all I literally said was, ""Uh, hey BIL, could you use my birth-name instead of DH's last name? You know I kept my birth-name, right? Thanks man, you're the best!"")

A month later a received a letter from him, telling me that I should change my last. I'm going to include excerpts from the letter below, but my main question is, how do I respond? Am I being unrealistic by being a little upset?



**Letter Excerpts:**
""The reason I write this letter is because I care about you and I care about (DH's family). I write what I write in the spirit of kindness and prayer. In fact, I wouldn't be writing this if I hadn't prayed about it beforehand and felt compelled to write this. It's about your last name... Refusing to put (DH's last name) on yourself, for whatever reason, causes great heartache and pain to many of them. It also causes a lot of unnecessary awkwardness in conversation. When people see that you haven't taken that name, the assumption in society is that you two are living together and are not married.""

""In the end, I really could care less about this whole thing. I'm not a (DH's last name), I'm a (different last name -he's married into the family). I kept my name, I don't really care what you decide to do. After reading this you can be mad at me, forgiving of me, or accepting of what I have to say and honestly it won't affect me one iota what you decide. I believe that the whole subject is a petty and immature one. It isn't something that would cause such a big deal to anyone. However I care more about the feelings and relations held by my family, of which (DH's family) take part in. 

The reason you should choose to take (DH's last name) is because it is kind to do so. It makes it so much easier to relate to you and removes all the unnecessary awkwardness I have previously described. I know that this decision is for you to decide and no one else. But resisting to take your husband's name in society and circles you interact with is a selfish one.""

And finally... ""Hopefully you have felt a spirit of peace from this and not contention. I only strive to do what is right, and I try and show it in this letter. I seek to better myself every day and to lift everyone around me up so I can become more like my Savior Jesus Christ. He is my whole example for everything and is the reason I make any decision in my life. So if this letter brought a bad spirit to you I apologize for it was not intended this way. I wrote it out of a spirit of love for you and (DH's family).""


Ok, thoughts? Suggestions?

"My [24f] boyfriend's [25m] (2 years) older brother [27m] asked me for help ""adulting"" specifically in regards to his budget, time management, and meal-prepping. He was very angry, frustrated, and clearly not taking it seriously so I quit. Now he and his parents are angry and harrassing us.


Long story short my parents raised me to be a functional, independent adult instead of just continuously caring for me as a helpless child. My boyfriend ""West"" wasn't as lucky and has spent the past two years straightening his finances out so he could move out from his parent's house, learning self-discipline and responsibility when it comes to meals, exercise, chores, etc. He enrolled in college last spring. I'm very proud of him and it's incredibly motivating to have a partner interested in supporting and encouraging me through my own journey in those areas.   



About three months ago ""South"", West's brother, asked me to help him out the way my parents and I had initially helped West get a handle on what he needed to do when he'd become serious about being more responsible for himself. West has tried to help South out a few times but their personalities tend to clash quickly and West is frequently busy.  


I explained that I could show him my processes but it'd really be up to him to make the actual decisions and changes and then follow through. He talked a very big game about understanding this and how serious he was about wanting to follow in his brother's footsteps and start school.  
 

However, once we actually started sitting down and going over things I realized anytime I'd try to gently suggest where a sacrifice could be made (mostly in his budget, dietary habits, or gaming/free-time schedule) I'd be met with repeated excuses, angry outbursts, or what really seemed like attempts to manipulate me into pitying him. We argued quite a bit over the angry outbursts, I'm trying to help him and I don't care if he thinks he's directing the anger at me or not it puts me on edge. He doesn't see anything wrong with smashing/breaking things and shouting at me, he even thinks I'm too sensitive because I told him if he called me a name again I'd walk immediately. He only laid off all of his excuses re:anger because he didn't want to talk to a therapist, which I insisted was necessary to continue if he truly cannot control himself. 
 
  


When I invited him over to learn to cook dinner with me and West once a week he'd consistently show up late and be generally disagreeable or outright refuse to involve himself in the process. He asked me for help enrolling in a local community college and proceeded to lie to me several times while also trying to foist his paperwork and scheduling of appointments onto me. I was very insistent that he needs to learn to do this himself and I can only help him, I'm not his secretary. But after he had his mother call me and try to guilt me into writing an essay for him I refused to have anything to do with him and the school at all.   


We had a falling out after a particularly infuriating visit and I told South that if he all he really wants to for me to feel sorry for him and agree there's no way he can make real changes in his life then I wasn't interested in wasting my time anymore.  


He's badmouthed me to several of his relatives and a few of our mutual friends since. What I'm hearing is a grossly misrepresented version of events that mostly focus on describing me as controlling, nosy, bossy, unsympathetic, spoiled, and that I have no idea what the real world is like, etc., etc. I've mostly ignored this, it doesn't seem too many people take it too seriously, but it has caused tension between my boyfriend and I and South's parents.  

Two days ago West's father called me and asked if I'd help South out again and I flatly, politely declined. When West's father kept pressing, insisting his son was serious this time, I told him that the fact that he had his father calling on his behalf indicated to me that no, he was not serious about taking responsibility for himself.  


Now South and his parents are calling, texting, e-mailing, and stopping by our place to berate West over choosing such a selfish woman over his family. The badmouthing to relatives has also spread to South's parents and very unexpectedly I had a coworker and an old family friend come to me with concerns over the situation this weekend! This whole situation is infuriating and ridiculous. West thinks we should just avoid them until it blows over but also admits, in the same breath, that his parents are infamous for holding grudges and have been in trouble with the law over enacting revenge on the object of their grudges.

"Fiance[24M] went to great lengths to hide spilled ash at my parent's house. In the process, he ruined a mattress and got an Uber without telling anyone


been together 4 years

My fiance and I were staying at my parents' house. They don't really approve of us sleeping together in their house so we stayed in separate bedrooms. We went to bed and I guess my fiance decided it would be a great idea to smoke in my parent's house (it's not legal here)

This itself isn't a huge deal as it's something I used to do. Probably not something I'd do when staying at his parent's house but whatever.

From what I gather, this is what happened: Fiance vaped a lot of weed and watched netflix. I could hear him giggling through the wall at this point and he wasn't checking his phone. Fiance was collecting abv for later use. He didn't have anything to put it in so he decided to hollow out my mom's display soap bar, put the abv in there, and cover it with foil he found in the closet. 

Obviously, this was a dumb idea. The abv spilled all over the bed after he laughed particularly hard. This is a rough estimate of what he did from what he's managed to tell me. He poured a bottle of water on the ash, and when that made it worse he began to scrub the spot with the bar of hollowed soap. He forgot there was more abv in there, making it worse yet again.

In the end, there was a concoction of dish soap, vinegar, window cleaner and drain cleaner that soaked up into the mattress. The tiny spot of ash now led to a giant, soapy sopping wet area that covered 1/4 of a king bed.

Fiance decided, high out of his mind, that his only course of action was to get an uber and leave. He didn't tell me he was leaving and we discovered this massive mess in the morning. He didn't answer his phone until an hour ago and he sent me a text apologizing and saying that he panicked and would refund the mattress. He hasn't sent me anything else

I don't know what to do. He isn't replying to any of my texts or calls now. My parents are furious and telling me that I'm making a huge mistake to marry someone who would abandon me like that

edit: phone keeps changing abv to ash. Sorry for the confusion. No, I don't know why he didn't just dust/wipe it away like normal. Finally heard from my fiance last night. He's coming over now to talk about it. I'll update after that

"My (30F) formerly estranged younger sister (27F) and her husband (40M) are expecting their first child, are desolately poor. My husband (28M) doesn't think we should help them.


Ok, before everyone goes thinking my husband is a callous fuckface, here's the back story. 

My younger sister, Andrea, in the past, has been quite critical of me and my job. I've been working as a really successful VIP hostess in upscale gentlemen's clubs for about 10 years. She has expressed some very virulent opinions about this, including shaming me for it and calling me some very distasteful names. This prompted us to become estranged for about four years, until about 4 months ago when I received an email about her expecting. My husband, Sasha, was VERY upset about the way she treated me, and what she called me. He has no interest in seeing her or interacting with her, but understands why I want to repair the relationship and forge a relationship with my sister's child 

A few nights ago I got a text from Andrea saying she felt emotional and lonely. We don't have any family (all estranged or dead). Not even a single cousin, it's just the two of us. After a bit of texting, Andrea tells me she is behind on her rent by almost $1,000 and is worried about eviction. They don't even have a car to live in. Her husband, Philip, hasn't had a job as long as I've known him (maybe 5 years?). His family supported him being a ""professional student"" as I guess you could call it, yet he never finished any degree. His family went broke 2 years ago so Andrea has been supporting them (service industry) ever since. She tells me his age plus lack of work experience are causing him to not be able to find a job.

Reddit, I could pay this back rent without issue. I make good money and Sasha works for a large social media company. We have a lot in savings, which we are going to put toward an investment property.

Sasha flatly refuses to send a dollar. He says they are adults, they planned this baby (they actually did, they were trying) and have to accept the consequences of their poor decisions. While I agree, I don't think the baby needs to suffer because if its parents bad planning. 

I've started putting a few of my tips away every night to stockpile to send them. Sasha doesn't know. I've never lied to him before. It feels like shit. 

Any opinions here? I feel like it's either abandon my sister's child, or lie to my husband.

Tl;dr: My younger sister is pregnant and destitute, her husband is nice but kind of a bum. I am financially secure, my husband refuses to help due to her former treatment of us. Help?"
"Me [33F] and my husband [34M], together for 10 years – He is uncomfortable with how often I touch him


Hi Reddit. I have been married to my husband, J, for 4 years, and we were together for 6 years before that.

When we started dating, I was very upfront about my libido. I didn’t want to pressure him, and told him flat out that he should reject sex if he wasn’t up for it at any time; no hurt feelings on my part. He jokingly laughed and said he could meet my libido, but after a couple of months &amp; the honeymoon phase was over, he admitted that he couldn’t. We’ve since started this little check-in; it’s not on the dot once a month, but every couple of weeks we just check in to see where we’re at with everything. We try to communicate everything as it’s happening, but sometimes that just doesn’t work out. So we made this a casual check-up to talk about stuff. Usually it’s about small things like “the last two weeks I’ve had to remind you to do the dishes” or “you promised x but it hasn’t happened yet; could we make a timeline?” It takes the edge off of a “serious sit down” (although we have had those too) and builds a time &amp; place where we can discuss minor stuff that we might forget in the moment (e.g. I want to talk to you about the dishes but had to run off to work and forgot, until you did it again, and now it’s built up in my head). Part of the check-in is my initiating sex (he also initiates sex, just less often). My libido is pretty constant, and pretty high. J’s libido fluctuates a bit more, and is more likely to change based on things like stress. So every time we do a quick check, if I’m initiating too often or just enough or if he’d be comfortable if I did it a little more often. For example, about 2 years ago J had a really stressful job. Sex was just another stress thing for him, and he wasn’t up for it anyway because of his mood, so we had sex maybe once a week, as communicated. When he finally quit and took a break from working, we had sex almost every day, as communicated, and then we went back to a happy (although fluctuating) medium.

This usually works well, but yesterday something went a little weird, I guess.

I’m very frisky lately. I’m so in love with my husband, I’m just ready to go whenever. When I wake up next to him, I’m ready. When he comes to bed and his showering wakes me, I’m ready. Through-out the day I see him, and I’m ready. He’s an amazing man, he’s smart and he’s handsome and funny and honest and – I could write a novel’s worth on the things I love about him. I constantly want to be close to him, I constantly want to be intimate, I constantly want to bump bits because bumping bits feels even better when it’s with the person you love. I know he doesn’t want me instigating sex that often, but he never had a problem with me being touchy-feely. If we both got work in the morning, I don’t want to have sex either even when I want to, if that makes sense. I’d still like to cuddle and make out and touch him. 

This is something “separate” from initiating sex. I can be really touchy/sexual without it being sex. That’s never been a problem, although I will admit I’ve been doing it more often than I used to. It wasn’t something that pressured him, by his own admission. It was just my “love language.”

But yesterday he had a sit down with me and told me I did stuff like that way too often. I was always touching him and always frisky and he was a little angry about it, even. 

I explained that it was a genuine reaction on seeing him, and that while I generally tried not to touch him sexually (so rub his arm, not his thigh or pecs or ass). That it’s because I love him, not to pressure sex. And then I ended the explanation with an apology, that I didn’t mean to pressure him or make him feel uncomfortable, and that I’d pay more attention to my actions when I do it and to do it less often. I mean, it sucks to have to manage that genuine emotion but if he’s uncomfortable I’m not gonna continue, you know?

But he got a little angrier and said it wasn’t about pressuring him, I made him feel objectified. Like all I wanted was his body.

This feels like a punch to my gut. I’m not constantly touching him because he’s some sort of celebrity a-list hottie. I love my husband, and think he’s attractive, and want to be intimate with him, but if you guys saw a picture he’s not stereotypically attractive. He’s not 6” tall, he’s not muscular, he doesn’t have that jaw line actors have. He’s got a dad bod and he’s a little short, he wears glasses and is balding and isn’t “typically” attractive. I love him, I love the way he looks, but it’s not that he’s had a long history of girls dating him just for his looks and that I’m adding to that with my behavior. I’m not touching him to feel his six-pack that he doesn’t have, I’m touching him because I want physical touch with this amazing man. I’m not (solely) attracted to his body or ass or whatever, a huge part of my attraction to him is who he *is*. Barring ridiculous obesity, I would fuck this man no matter what. He could be 70 and wrinkly and bald and wearing ugly clothes and I’d still go to town on him. I can’t imagine him doing anything to his appearance/body (barring ridiculous obesity, I guess) that would make me less attracted to him.

And he knows my history with that word specifically (some stuff in university, he’s aware of it) so it kind of hurts that he’d use it. It’s not that he’s not allowed to feel that way because of my history, but he knows what that word means to *me*, and if he feels that way that’s a huge problem to me. It needs to be fixed. 

I can touch him less and be less frisky around, that’s a compromise I’ll have to make. But if he feels that way I’m not sure what I can do to make him stop feeling that way. And it sucks that I have to reign in doing this when it was never a problem before; he always welcomed it and even noted when I did it less, but now it’s become a problem. It’s going to take time for me to adjust doing this, and I’ll have to get used to expressing my love in other ways, but. He was genuinely kind of angry during the entire exchange, and that’s new.

I want to do something. Take extra steps besides just stopping to make him feel better. I want to sit down again and talk, but for the first time since I’ve met him I’m not sure how to start, or what to say. It’s going to take genuine effort for me to ramp back my touchy feely-ness, and I know I’m not gonna get it right immediately on the short term. I want to maybe go out on a nice dinner or buy a gift or something. I want a gesture that communicates that I never meant to make him feel this way. Any suggestions?

**tl;dr:** My husband says I make him feel “objectified” because I’m too touchy. I want to sit down and talk about it again, and do something nice as a gesture in apology. Any suggestions or input would be appreciated!

"Me [30F] with my husband [31M] is convinced my father [60sM] is meddling with my ducks


My parents live a few hours away so it makes sense that when they visit they stay in the guest room, right? My husband and I have noticed (and find it very odd) that whenever my father is staying there is a duck issue (I foster injured ducklings/orphaned ducklings until they are well enough to be released/rehomed. Only wild ducks are released into the wild, I am not one of those people who just dump a duck off at a pond etc) but anyway, my mother has stayed alone and there have been no problems so that rules her out of the picture.

Whats been happening: About a year ago a duckling mysteriously managed to escape (keep in mind this had NEVER happened before) and he was the only one who knew about it. I wasn't suspicious, I caught the duckling again, checked its enclosure, I couldn't see a way it could have gotten out so I popped it back in. It didn't get out again.

Six months ago another duckling escaped while he was staying (keep in mind there had been no escapees since his last visit). It was the same situation, he was the one who found it running loose and when I put it back in there was no obvious way it could have gotten out. It didn't get out again.

He is always making negative comments about them, saying they are too 'loud' etc. We also clash a lot (our personalities are very different).

Anyway, the latest incident. The other night it was quite stormy, I had four decent sized ducklings outside for the night so I put them in their crate so they'd be safe. They were all perfectly fine the day before, no signs anything may be wrong. I let them out in the morning and one of them has died. I am seriously confused, it also looked like it had happened within the past hour or so. It had no blood on it either but another one had somehow had a piece taken out of its beak, it was bleeding. I was very upset and took the live ones inside to see what else I could find and to tend to its beak (which will be fine, thankfully). He was not surprised when he heard the news one had died, didn't say anything, only let out a loud sigh when I took the remaining three inside. 

Keep in mind when he is not here there are NO problems at all with the ducks! Absolutely no issues. My husband has noticed this and he is convinced that my father is behind the issues, thinks he heard them chirping when the sun came up and shook the crate so wildly he killed one and how one got an injured beak (there was a small pottery cat bowl in there and he thinks that is how it was injured). I thought maybe they had gotten spooked by something (it was stormy) and it had gotten trampled, it was the second smallest though but perhaps a bigger one somehow stood on its neck causing it to suffocate? I have had them (and 50+ other ducks over the years) spend a night in there before and had no issues.

I asked my mother about it, doesn't she think it is odd etc and she said I was 'bringing up the past' when I mentioned how the ducklings escaped only when my father is here, never any other time. She was angry that my husband thinks he has something to do with the death of the duckling, said she didn't want a fight but became crazily defensive of him. and she became very upset, on the verge of tears. It was not a confrontational conversation, just a ""Do you think he may have had something to do with it? We think he may have shaken the crate.""

TL;DR: Husband thinks my father is endangering my ducks and caused one to be killed.

Edit: Will also add that when I was living at home he would run outside and chase them off the property, one time a small duckling became trapped in the property and before I could even do anything he had cornered it and threw it over the fence, the poor thing had tiny wings and would have landed quite hard.

Edit #2: Have come to the conclusion that yes, it is him who has been doing all this. It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that someone, especially my own father is capable of doing such things. It makes me feel sick. He will not be staying over again, or spend any time in my home where he may have a moment to himself. Thanks to everyone for providing your opinion from an outsiders perspective. 

Edit #3: Thank you so much to everyone who commented on this. I am very grateful. I went out and purchased one of those spinning windmill things for the duckling and put it just above where I buried it. It's still really upsetting."

"Friend sent me a bill?!


A have this friend of mine, who I have known for 18 years.  Early in our friendship, the first 10 years, we hung out a lot, went to each other's house (we lived a few blocks from each other) for celebrations, when his son was born, I was the second person he called from the hospital (after his in-laws). We were tight, if either of needed a hand, we were both there to help.

Fast forward, he moved away, due to work, family matters and distance, we sort of lost touch. About 5 years ago after not hearing from him in 3-4 years he stopped by my house, he was in the neighborhood.  We stayed in light contact since (every few months, through FB, etc) he had started a business in HVAC, and worked hard to get where he was at. 

I had a problem with my furnace recently, I identified the part that was bad, and texted him if he knew of a good place for me to get one was (it was a inexpensive part, less than $50 retail, but not readily available to the public.

He texted me back, to get it from him.  I called on the phone to ask a question about my diagnosis, he agreed, and said I'll send one of my guys over to handle it.  I was kind of surprised, said you would do that? He said no problem.  The guy came over the next morning while I was gone and he replaced the part in 15 minutes, and I gave the guy some sporting gear I had offered to him a couple months ago that i never got around to getting to him.  

I got home later that day and all is working fine, I text him to ask how much I owe him for the part.  No response.  A couple days later I get an invoice for $250 for a service call, labor and the part.  I was kind of surprised, I sent a reply asking if this was for real? I thought possibly that his guy just thought I was just another customer and filed his paperwork and his billing system sent out the invoice.  No redponse.

A few days after that I give him a call on his personal cell, it goes to voicemail in 2 rings and I leave him a message, just said I received this invoice, had some questions, and asked him to call me.

No response.  Two days later I receive a late payment notice.

Now I assume he's upset with me for some reason, I don't know.  I was perfectly capable of making the repair myself, and there was never any mention of the cost of a service call or hourly rates.  I thought he was just being a good friend.  If he planned to bill me full price, I feel he should have told me, and I would have just sourced the part myself, and called it a day.

Now I'm felling like I was tricked, and that he did this for some reason I don't know.

Am I right for feeling a little misled?  What's the right thing to do here?


tl;dr Friend sent me an invoice for work, I feel misled because there was no mention of charging me for a simple repair, he made it sound like he would just take care of it"

"I (29F) quit drinking last week and need ideas to make it up to my husband (34M)


So like the title says, I stopped drinking last week. There was no rock bottom, just 11+ years of daily drinking and walking a fine line between being a functioning alcoholic and at times being a full-blown alcoholic. I come from a long line of alcoholics and addicts... I knew I couldn't pretend anymore if I wanted my marriage to work (I posted about my heroin addicted brother coming to my wedding last year and you guys were really helpful- it's in my history). For context: we got married 1.5 years ago after knowing each other for 1.5 years prior. Coming up on our 3 year dating anniversary. 

So. 11 years of drinking every day, 8 days sober. I've lost 6 lbs and I feel fucking amazing. My sex drive is through the roof, I feel ecstatic to wake up every morning. I'm finally in therapy to deal with issues from my childhood and my parents/brother/family addictions. The book I'm reading says ""99% commitment is a bitch. 100% is easy..."" truer words have never been spoken. I've been at 99% for years, refusing to totally commit to abstinence from alcohol, knowing I should quit, trying to cut back and failing, constantly struggling. Cycle of shame, regret, and guilt. I'm amazed at how easy this past week has been... I know in my gut there's no going back.

My incredibly supportive husband quit drinking to support me over a year ago, and has been leading by example ever since. My question is... how on earth do I possibly make this up to him? He used to be a big drinker (active duty military) and stopped of his own accord. He helped me see that I need to break the cycle of addiction for ME, not just because I'm going to get pregnant (we're planning on tying to start a family next Spring/Summer). We both work full-time, but he has taken on the lions share of household duties, such as cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry....everything, really. I want show him how much I love him, how grateful I am to him, and how much I appreciate him. How can I possibly make up the last 3 years of drinking to him?

TL;DR Last week I stopped drinking after 11 years of daily drinking. My husband has been my rock, picking up my slack while I figured shit out. How on earth do I make up 3 years of drinking to him? "
"Boyfriend's [20m] mom [40s f] refuses to accommodate my [19 f] dietary restrictions?


EDIT: thank you everyone for your comments! Seems like the general consensus is to have George talk to his mother about us not coming unless she cooks something I can eat. I plan to talk to George about it when he gets home from work tonight. I will also either bring a small meal for myself to eat next week or bring a gluten free dish to pass for everyone to share (depending on how much time I have that day). Thank you again, everyone! 
________________________
I have been dating my boyfriend, George, for a little over a year. George and I have known each other for years as he is my brother's best friend and my brother is actually the one who set us up as a couple. 

George and I recently moved in to our own place. We get along great! I genuinely love George with my whole heart and after I graduate college we plan on getting married and starting a long life together.

George is his mom's, Stacy's, baby. Stacy had ...negative opinions on us moving out. She was very unhappy. We are completely able to support ourselves as I work multiple jobs while I'm in school and George works full time as a mechanic. We always pay our bills on time, we never ask our parents for financial help, we even have enough left over to save. 

Once a week George and I have dinner at my mom's house and then a few days later we have dinner at Stacy's house.

Now the problem: I was recently diagnosed with gluten sensitivity. I can eat a little bit of gluten and only feel slightly ill but too much will give me such a bad migraine I'm completely out. All I can do is just go home and hide and go to bed. Stacy knows this. Stacy is a nurse. Stacy has seen me become so ill I have to leave somewhere so she knows I'm not ""faking it"". Last night she made a baked pasta dish and garlic bread. She refuses to accommodate me! George pointed out that nothing was gluten free and she said ""I google gluten free recipes and they all looked gross""!! In my opinion gluten free is the easiest dietary restriction to cook for! George has offered to send her some recipes that we use at home and she seemed very disinterested. My feelings are hurt because I would do everything I could to accommodate her if she needed it. 

So I guess my question is: how should I handle Stacy's blatant refusal of accommodating my gluten sensitivity? Should I just not eat at family dinner? I want to just cook dinner myself but I don't want to hurt her feelings

"I [24M] cannot stand my girlfriend's [22F] narcissistic mother [59F]. She's been a thorn in our relationship and I was given an ultimatum today.


I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now. She's an amazing person and I love being with her and spending time with her, but there's one issue that's always affected our relationship. Her mother.

I hated her from the moment I met her. She's extremely manipulative, a pathological liar, she always finds ways to berate my girlfriend and I, and just uses people for her own personal gain. I tried to be respectful at first since it's my girlfriend's mother, but my patience with her ran out quickly. Ever since I met her, she has been nothing, but a parasite.

It all came to a head at my cousin's funeral last week. I specifically told my girlfriend not to bring her mother to the funeral, but she completely disregarded my request and brought her anyway. She was a complete nuisance and it got so bad, that my uncle actually physically removed her from the building when she had supposedly laughed at him that his son was dead.

My girlfriend and I have been non-stop fighting about this ever since. She refused to believe she did that and thinks that I should be more respectful of her and that I need to learn to look the other way regarding her actions since she was still hurting from her divorce (that happened over a decade ago). I found this completely ridiculous and told her everything I thought about her mother.

She eventually gave me an ultimatum that if I don't apologize to her mother by tomorrow and learn to be more respectful that she'll break up with me as she can't be with someone who is so heartless.

What should I do? I love my girlfriend so much and I want to stay with her, but I also cannot stand her mother and I don't feel like I nor anyone else deserves to be bullied by her.

Our good friends family has fallen apart in recent months. It has not been an easy time for her. We found a lot of things about her brother that most people would want to beat him to death if they found out. CPS and our friend has organized for her to raise her nephew who is 3 or 4 years old. I haven't met him, but I am told he is a very timid child. He doesn't like men, strangers or loud noises. He's ok with women, but if they come to close he'll freak. He's gotten OK with his aunt. 

My wife is a child psychologist. My wife can't work with him because she said it would be better for him to work with a person that's not her. It's also against her conduct because she's too close to the situation. Our friend was fine with it. She didn't cause the fuss. The fuss came from our family. 

Our family thinks it's horrible of my wife not to give the kid free therapy sessions. They're going on and on about it. We blocked their numbers but my parents showed up at my work to confront me on the issue. I almost had to get security to get them out of the building.

"I asked my friend (38f) to babysit my kid (3f) for one night, and now I think things are weird


I've been separated from my husband for about 9 months. He's in the military so I have my daughter full-time for months at a time when he deploys or goes on underways. This is absolutely fine with me as I love my kiddo to bits and I think the consistency of a single household is good for her at this particular stage in her development. But when dad's back in town, we do a 60/40 split. That's neither here nor there.

He's been deployed most of the summer, came back for a month, and has been gone again since August. I definitely believe in self-care and try to make sure I can take care of myself mentally and physically so I can be a better, more patient, more involved parent. When we share custody this is easy, as I have a few days here and there ""off duty"" by default, but when he's out to sea, it's harder. While funds are tight, I've found money for a babysitter here and there to go out to dinner or see a movie in order to get a little ""me time."" Hiking is one of my ultimate de-stressors, and I've been itching to go camp as the weather is changing, but I knew that I couldn't pay for an overnight babysitter. I don't have any family in the area either, but I do have a good crew of friends.

My friend Tammy has an 8 month old son and is very close with her cousin, who has a 4 year old daughter. Tammy has reached out in the past and said that if I needed anything while my ex was gone, she would be happy to help with my daughter. She generally loves kids, and the last time we hung out my daughter played great with the 4 year old, the dog, the two cats, and was helpful with bringing things for the baby. She and her husband live in a big house with a huge yard and a play set outside. Given her willingness to help with my daughter, I thought it wouldn't be a huge imposition to ask if she would mind watching her for one night. We arranged the plan 3 weeks in advance of my trip.

I dropped her off Saturday morning at 9am. Things were great. Tammy and I had a nice chat, and then I hit the road. I was driving 3 hours so I could hit some mountains. I went on a hike, then set up camp and relaxed by the fire for the evening. My friend texted me pictures of my daughter playing with her cousin's kid. The next morning around 10am I get a text that says ""when are you coming back"". She's not a very flowery communicator so this didn't strike me as too abrupt or anything. I said ""I was planning another little hike after breakfast and I'm 3 hours out so probably around 6 if that's ok?"" and she didn't respond. Again, this is not out of the ordinary for her texting habits, I took the silence as a green light. And so I went about my day as planned.

I hit two accidents on the way home and between those slow downs and stopping for gas, etc, I was about an hour late. I gave her updates all along the drive about my ETA. When I got there, my daughter was downstairs and Tammy was upstairs sitting on her bed with her son, looking flat-out exhausted. She barely made eye contact with me, barely said anything except ""I am not ready for a 3 year old"" but said it in a humorless way. I tried asking how it went and she just kind of made a sound and continued looking away from me so I thanked her profusely for watching my kiddo and I collected her stuff and left. I figured it was more tiring than she expected to watch a 3 year old and her son, and didn't think too much of it.

I got home and popped on Facebook for a few minutes. I saw that she had posted a status about two hours before I got there about how she was ""losing her sanity."" Which I take as some indication of what my kid put her through or something. She rarely posts on facebook at all, and I was surprised to see it. I did take it personally, when I guess there's a chance it's not really about my daughter, but I'm pretty sure she played a role in how my friend felt last night. I'm a little rubbed the wrong way by the Facebook post but she obviously has a right to express herself however she feels.

I'm sure you're wondering if my kid is a hellion... I promise she isn't. She is a strong-willed kid, she wants to help with everything. She communicates very clearly and exerts her independence when she can. She goes to daycare full time and the teachers there talk about how well she listens, she sits for story time, she plays well with friends. She really is a good kid, but, well, she's 3. It's a hard age for anyone. But now I'm left not knowing how to feel about this - Tammy was acting very strange last night, and I worry that I've inadvertently done something to cause resentment? Even though she offered to help, said yes when I asked if she was interested, and didn't respond when I asked if my return time was ok. The worst thing I did was come back an hour late.

Do you think I crossed some line that I'm not aware of? How can I adequately express my gratitude? I'm sending her a thank you card today, and I was thinking of sending some small gift but I don't know what. Should I try to talk to her about how the day went, or whether my child did something egregiously wrong? I don't know if I should just let it go... send my thank you note and give her space... or what.

tl;dr - left my daughter with a friend for an overnight, friend acted closed off and kind of mad when I picked my daughter up the next day. She also posted a weird kind of passive aggressive facebook status. What should I do to help smooth things over?

**EDIT** to address one recurring question, yes, when we set up the arrangement I was clear that I would leave Saturday morning and be back Sunday evening. I knew that with the drive I was planning, I wouldn't be back earlier. 7pm is still the evening, albeit an hour later than I had told her that morning.

**EDIT 2** thanks guys. I have some new perspective on the situation, which is what I was aiming for with this post. I can see how her text was probably a ""help me"" plea that I didn't recognize. I'll make sure she knows how appreciative I am and apologize profusely for not returning sooner."

"I found out today that my (35F) ex (37M) is engaged. We haven't talked in years and I am happily married, but I am bummed by this news. Why?


Backstory:  My ex and I dated for 4 years (age 24 - 28) and then were on and off for another 1.5 years before I finally ended it for good and went no contact.  In hindsight it wasn't a healthy relationship, but while I was in it I was convinced we were meant to be.  One of the major factors in our breakup was that he didn't want to get married.  I tried to be ok with just being committed but not married indefinitely, but couldn't do it.  I was also suspicious of a new girl that had started at his work and finally reached my breaking point after I caught him lying about texting her.  He broke no contact after 3 months when he called me in the middle of the night crying about how he fucked up his life. Turns out, he knocked up this work girl. I told him point blank that I couldn't be the one to support him through this and we resumed no contact.  
  
Six months later I met and started dating my now husband.  He is actually perfect for me, we never fight, are on the same page about everything, have amazing sex and make each other laugh constantly.  I am extremely happy and secure in my marriage and don't think about or miss my ex.  
  
Which is why I am confused about what I am feeling right now.  Today, a former co-worker of me and ex (that is how we initially met) had a baby and there was fb post about it.  I clicked on said co-workers page and there was my ex in the little friends grid.  His profile is a picture of him and a woman. (Not the same woman he had the baby with). I clicked on it - since we aren't friends, I can't see much info, one of the few things that is posted publicly is that he got engaged this past June.  I don't really even know what I am feeling, but it's not happy for him that is for sure.  
  
The only things I can think of are that I'm still somehow bitter that he wouldn't marry me or that I feel like he was such a shit partner that he doesn't deserve to be happy even years later. If you would have asked me yesterday if I was over him I would have said yes 10000% and really, I am, I mean I definitely don't want to even talk to him, let alone be with him. I don't even know why I clicked that stupid thumbnail. Ugh.  Should I just stop trying to understand this rush of negative emotions and let it pass me by and hope things will be normal tomorrow? (normal as in, no thoughts of ex).  Has anyone else experienced something like this?  I feel stupid.  
    
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Ex and I have been broken up, no contact for years. Stupidly looked at his social media and saw that he got engaged over the summer.  I'm in a happy relationship and don't want anything to do with ex, but seeing this news upset me.  Trying to understand my feelings and wondering if others have experienced something like this.  
  
**EDIT** - It's very reassuring that all the responses are saying this is normal. Thanks for taking the time to read and ease my mind :)"
"Me [25 F] with my BF [26 M] 6 years, always a jerk after we've had sex.


Throwaway because blah blah, y'all get it. 

I've been with my BF for 6 years, lived together for 4. We're usually pretty happy, but have our fair share of issues. One is a mismatch in sex drive - mine is much higher (preferably 3/4 times per week) whereas his is lower (preferably 1-2 times per month). I make it work, but obviously it's not ideal. 

Usually we have sex, and if he gets off before I do, he goes and cleans up quickly then comes back and helps get me off. After I've gotten off, I'm a stereotypical girl where I would like a kiss and a cuddle. He, however, is usually on his feet and getting dressed before I've had a chance to catch my breath. 

The big thing I can't deal with is that he becomes a bit of a jerk as soon as the sex is all over. Leading up to day when he inevitably is interested enough for us to have sex, he'll kiss me more deeply/passionately. As soon as we've both finished, it's all tight lipped grandma kisses from him for the next few weeks. Any attempt to be physical, even in a playful joking way, is rebuffed with a ""are you serious right now?"" pitying kind of look. 

Even if I wait a full week before I try and engage him in even just some deep kissing on the couch, he usually gives me a few ""pity kisses"" before extracting himself. It's made very obvious that after he's gotten off he has zero interest in me physically. Once, after sex, I told him that it was really great, and having such great sex made me want to have more right away, and he gave me this look that said, ""I pity you/poor you"" and left. 

Beyond just the kissing/touching issue, the day after we have sex is usually a pretty bad day, with him snapping at me over little things (the dishes not having been done, the garbage being too full, not feeding the cat exactly at his feeding time). 

I don't know if there's a way to fix this besides just being with someone else, because I've talked to him about all of this and it usually results in a few more pity kisses for a few days before returning to the norm. I guess I'm just hoping that I'm not alone and someone has been through this and has some advice. 

tl;dr - My boyfriend of 6 years loses all interest in my physically after we have sex, and this lasts until about the next time he wants to have sex (usually a week to two weeks). Additionally, he  is not very nice after we've had sex, which makes the fact that he doesn't want to by physical with me hurt more. "

"I (F20) think I may have gotten married too young.


I got married to my boyfriend of 4 years in July. We lived together for two years, moved across country, and even bought 2 cars together before we were engaged. The problem is, I just realized that he doesn't do anything for me. My husband makes about 1/5th of what I do, I pay for all bills and rent, I plan date nights, I initiate sex and practically carry him thru life. I went thru some serious mental health issues about a year ago and was very vocal about needing help, but he did not make a serious effort to try to help me, which was very hurtful. 

He works very hard and is trying to make a career happen for himself, I love him so much, but I am very tired and not sure what to do or how to confront him on this.

"My (35F) DH (35M) tells his brother (33M) about our sex life in front of me, even after we've both told him to stop


Edit: Thank you all for the comments. I'm reading and taking them all in, and appreciate them. I've definitely got a lot to think about. 

My DH and I have been together for 10 years, married for 9.

DH and I own our own business and BIL helps out on the weekend. If we have sex and I enjoy it, he teases me about it the next morning and will tell BIL how much I enjoyed it, while I'm standing there, despite BIL and I telling him to stop numerous times, and being visibly uncomfortable. 

As a result, I've toned down my enjoyment of sex. In fact, I have toned it down so much that I have no enjoyment left in it. Also, if I'm not ""in to it"" enough, DH will complain about the ""starfish"" for days afterwards. So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. About six weeks ago, I decided I was done faking it and done putting in the effort. We've had bad sex (we both agree) twice since then. 

Yesterday, after passionless sex, I broke down and told DH that I hated it when he teased me about enjoying it and I felt like he was purposely humiliating me for liking sex. He apologized and assured me that wasn't the case. 

This afternoon I packed the kids off to a evening with MIL and just wanted to relax for a few minutes before heading into the office for a couple of hours. DH tried to get me in the mood, and I declined. He then pulled down his pants to masturbate (which I have no problem with. Go for it). I declined to ""lend him a hand,"" and he got angry. He asked why I hated sex, and when I tried to reiterate our conversation from yesterday, he got angry and said the real reason I didn't like sex is because I hated sex and didn't find him attractive, then he stormed out. 

Am I overreacting? Is it a compliment that he brags about our sex life to his brother? 

**TL;DR** I told DH that him telling his brother about our sex life is humiliating. He says it's a guy thing, and we don't have sex because I'm not attracted to him.

"My wife (35) is often concerned about my (m35) appearance- is this normal?


I'm just wondering to what extent this is the norm. My wife of about 4 years now is always very concerned about how I dress etc. 

I'm never scruffy but I do have a fairly relaxed attitude to my outward appearance. But my wife is always picking holes - the creases on my trousers aren't properly ironed, my shoes aren't polished enough, my shirt isn't absolutely crease free...

While I do understand that it's important not to look unkempt I don't believe that is the case and no one except my wife has ever commented on my appearance in a negative way. 

I like that I don't get super stressed about the outward appearance but she's making me feel like I have to conform to her standard and this is making things stressful for me. She has got pretty angry in the past when I've gone out wearing shoes that she didn't consider up to scratch.

I've brought this up with her and she just gets annoyed. She thinks it's just her being a normal wife and I'm just being silly that it bothers me. 

Am I just a scruff who should take their wife's advice or is she being a bit over the top?

EDIT: further context from another reply

""think it comes from a place of anxiety, like if I'm not perfect  things are somehow going to fall apart. She's not had a lot of stability in her life and she seems to fear that things could collapse. She is also very focused on how others see her, she wants people to think well of her to a huge degree where she gets upset if she perceives that someone doesn't like her. 
I guess she is projecting that on to me but struggles with that as she doesn't have full control there but still sees me as an extension of how she is perceived. ""

"My [18F] mom wants me to give her all my friends phone numbers


I'm sure this is pretty common for girls with strict parents. I just started college and my mom has always been pretty overbearing, like using Find My Friends to track my location and not letting me find a job so I don't leave campus that often. I don't believe I have it as bad as many people but it's definitely taken its toll on our relationship and I find myself wanting to distance myself from her. Anyways, she just asked me to give all my friends phone numbers and personally, I think that's fucking weird. Call me crazy but I don't want someone's mom to be frantically texting me shit asking me where their daughter is. I understand she's concerned of my safety since I'm a young woman, but I don't feel comfortable with it. 

tl;dr
My mom wants all my friends phone numbers. How do I tell her I'm a grown up now and I'm not comfortable with that without making myself sound ungrateful and rude?"
"Me (15f&amp;adopted) said the worst possible thing to my parents (41f and 40m) and I don't think I can fix me and my dad's relationship. Help?


I was adopted by my mom and dad before I turned one. They're the only people I consider parents and i really love them and am very greatful for all they've given me. Me and my dad are especially close. Or we were. I really messed up.



During the summer, I went to a party and got so drunk that my friends had to get my older brother (20m&amp;biological) to come get me and take me home. I didn't actually remember anything and I couldn't even talk apparently. The next morning, when I woke up my mom and dad came up to my room to punish me. My mom was annoyed, but my dad was furious. I know people being addicted to alcohol has caused alot of pain in his life (his dad was a drunk, and alot of his relatives. His boxing coach who he was really close to had drinking issues. A few years ago one of his friends choked to death on his puke because he was drunk. I get why he dislikes it). I think seeing me so drunk scared him, because I don't remember him ever being this angry with me. He was going off.



I was so sad and angry and embarrassed that I snapped. I said the worst thing an adopted kid could ever say. I told them they weren't my real parents anyway. It was spiteful and hurtful and I'm so ashamed of myself for saying it.


I knew right away that I messed up. I still remember the look on my dad's face and the way he froze and that makes me want to cry. They just left me in my room and I didn't know what to say.



That night, I spoke to them and told them I was so sorry and I didn't mean it and I really loved them (which I do. I really really do). They said they knew that and knew that I hadn't meant it and they were only so worried because they loved me.



Me and my mom feel back to normal. But we weren't extremely close before (not that I don't love her by the way. I do. But we just don't really mesh as people. I still love her alot though and she's a great mom). But me and my dad, who were really really close, don't feel the same. I feel like I've ruined what we had. It was something precious and great and I shattered it because I'm a horrible person.



I love my dad. And he loved me and I ruined that. I really want us to be the same again. What can I say or do to get him to forgive me?



tldr : I told my parents (who adopted me) that they weren't my real parents in an argument and even though he says he's accepted my apology me and my dad (who were really close) aren't the same."
