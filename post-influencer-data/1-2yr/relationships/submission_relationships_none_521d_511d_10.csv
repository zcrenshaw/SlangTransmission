"[Update] I [21F] made an advance towards my friend [18M] and he freaked out. Was my approach too aggressive, and did I lose my chance with him?


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8a7vbk/i_21f_made_an_advance_towards_my_friend_18m_and/

I'm a bit tired from everything that happened today, so please cut me some slack if some parts of my post are unclear :) 

I got a reply back from my friend shortly after making my post. He said he wanted to talk to me in person about the kiss.

My friend said that he's had a crush on me since high school, but thought I'd never reciprocate his feelings because I'm older than him. He explained how surprised he was when I went in for a kiss, but felt like I was going too fast. He told me that he liked it when we kissed, but he had a lot of feelings going on at the same time that he needed to process. I apologized for being too aggressive, and said I should've told him my feelings first.

I told him it was okay if he didn't want to date me, or have a relationship, but he was interested in one. My friend explained to me that he wanted us to go slow, because we've been friends for so long and he's afraid of ruining our friendship. I suggested we could use the trip to the beach that our parents planned out for the weekend as a date, and he thought it was a good idea.

The trip to the beach was today. We arrived there in the morning and left at night. 

The date felt extremely nostalgic, because we relieved our childhood. During our time at the beach we did a lot of the activities that we used to do when we were kids. We built sandcastles, ate ice cream, played on the park, caught fish, etc. I felt like a kid again, and experiencing it with my friend now that we're adults was a lot of fun. I could tell he was enjoying it as much as I was, from all the smiling, laughing, AND flirting he was doing with me.

We had dinner at the restaurant our parents used to take us to. I thought I couldn't learn anything more about him, but I did, and it was great being able to talk to him in a romantic setting. 

Afterwards we just walked along the beach and browsed all the stores. It was my favourite part of the date because it reminded me of the time our parents let us explore the beach by ourselves. I remember how independent and free both of us felt. He also held my hand throughout the whole thing which I thought was so freaking cute.

The final thing we did was watch the sunset together. It was extremely romantic, the sky looked beautiful, and it made the mood perfect, so I kissed him (but this time I asked). 

We texted each other for the whole car ride back home, and I’m still talking to him right now.

I fucked up by being too aggressive with him despite knowing how shy he is, but I'm happy that I was able to apologize, and we were able to go on a date. I don't understand why many of you were commenting on our age difference. I've known him for more than half of his life, and we have a shared childhood. I don't think there's anything wrong with me pursuing him.

Thanks for all the advice though &lt;3

**tl;dr:** I went on a nostalgic trip to the beach/date with my friend, we held hands, kissed again, and had a lot of fun.

"I [23F] had a threesome with BF [23M] and friend [22M] &amp; really enjoyed it. Now BF feels insecure. [Update after 2 years]


[This is my post from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4d7woe/i_23f_had_a_threesome_with_bf_23m_and_friend_22m/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=relationships). I figured after 2 years, it's time for an update.

TLDR of old post: Boyfrienf and I, having discussed threesomes theoretically, rushed into a situation and had a threesome with one of his friends, someone who I had a crush on (and he always knew about it). I really enjoyed it and he liked it too. But in the following day and weeks, he felt insecure.

Now that I'm looking back at it, the problem wasn't that we had a threesome, but that we did it too early. We weren't ready for it mentally. Especially for him, there were issues that he needed to work out before we were able to do this in a way that would leave both of us fully satisfied and without regret. For me personally, I wasn't really aware how this could affect him. An MMF threesome does take a toll on the woman physically, but it's even more of a toll emotionally and psychologically on him. 

I won't deny that the next few months were difficult. He asked me several times to compare his performance with Jack's and give him detailed answers. He always felt like Jack performed in a way that he has never been able to, mostly because Jack was physically stronger and has a larger package down there. I wish we had talked more about how he'd feel if it turns out that the other guy has a larger package, we never really discussed it. And we were only 23 back then.

We saw a very sex-positive therapist together who really helped us through this. Improving communication, our awareness of situations, learning to deal with emotionally taxing situation, lifelong insecurities, among other things.

We didn't do any other threesomes for a year after the one with Jack. Luckily for us, Jack remained very committed to our initial agreement to never speak of this with anyone or let it affect our friendship. While we stayed away from him for a while, he was still part of our friendship network and we never had a moment of awkwardness. We're still friendly with him, but we've kept our distance. 

We finally did a FFM threesome last year, this time we were much more prepared. We were there 100% mentally. The person we picked was a distant friend, but not a close one like Jack was. She's very pretty, and has a bubblier butt than I do. Something my boyfriend likes!

I got to see what he felt like the first time around, and to be honest, had I been my 23-year-old self without the preparations of the last year, I might have responded just like he did. But we had grown up a lot and we had a great experience. Even the next day I told him that it was great seeing him enjoy that butt.

The entire point of these experiences is to try things we can't do on our own. This isn't something to get insecure about, it's the whole point! 

We also have a MMF partner now, again someone we know but isn't close. And things are great. We now do a threesome roughly every other week, alternating between MMF and FFM. We've had amazing experiences! And everything is great. Thanks for your help.

Also, we're now engaged.

**TLDR:** We weren't anywhere near ready to have threesomes back then. We didn't do it right and he was rightfully hurt. It took a long time and therapy but we worked through our issues, learned a lot and when we were ready we began having threesomes the right way. We're now engaged, still doing threesomes and enjoying them very much. Life is great. "
"I [31M] received a text from a coworker [30F], saying she had a sex dream about me. I'm married and uncomfortable with this.


I've been work friends with this woman for a while. We casually chat when we see each other and get along pretty well. This morning, she texted me, asking if she could tell me something personal. I said ""sure"" and she proceeded to tell me she had a sex dream about me last night and it was very good. Then she asked me to delete the text. I tried to downplay it by saying a lot of people have these dreams and I'd try not to make it weird. Then, she responded by saying, ""you were very good, if that helps.""

I am extremely uncomfortable now. I'm married and would never even consider the thought of cheating on my wife. We have a happy marriage. My coworker is also married, with children and she always talks about her husband, so I've always assumed they have a good marriage too. I don't know if she's just talking about it to make herself less uncomfortable or if she's trying to initiate something, but I don't know how to handle it. What should I say to her to make it clear that it made me uncomfortable but also doesn't make it difficult for us to work together in the future?

This is the first time I've had to deal with something like this in my five years of marriage. Should I tell my wife about the conversation or just forget about it? My wife is a pretty anxious person and I don't think she will handle it well, even if I reassure her that nothing is going on. She has self-confidence issues, so I know it will eat at her if she knows. On the other hand, I want to honor my wife and be respectful of the loyalty and honesty we've established with each other. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar to this? What did you do? I feel awful just having known this information and it's driving me nuts.

tl;dr: Coworker told me she had a sex dream about me and seems happy about it. I'm happily married and so is she(or so I thought)."
"My sister [31/F] was sick and thought she was going to die, so she told me [27/F] family secrets; she lived and I don’t know what to do


Posting to a throwaway for reasons. My sister and I are very close, we tell each other everything. She was adopted as a baby since our mom struggled with fertility, and I was the “miracle baby.” Our parents love us both, but they totally give her older sibling privilege, even now they we’re both adults. They tell her everything, she knows about stuff weeks before I do, but I’ve never been very bothered by it. Also, our mom can be a bit distant. Ever since I was in high school, she’s struggled with holding a job, and always had a tendency to withdraw for a few days. I was told by our dad that it was because of her issues with depression. I’ve never taken it personally. Yeah, it can be difficult somedays, but she’s a good mom. She goes on frequent vacations and lives in another state,  so we don’t see each other all that much.

Anyways, my sister was really sick and ended up in the hospital. About a week and a half ago, things got bad and she was put in intensive care. Both of us were really freaked out, and she thought she was going to die. Like, my sister was making calls and telling people she loved them. It was scary. When my sister was admitted to the ICU, she told me she didn’t want to die without telling me some things. So, she told me that I wasn’t my parents’ child. Our dad had an affair with our mom’s sister, and when our aunt got pregnant, our dad convinced our mom to stay with him by promising she could raise the baby- me. She said yes, obviously. And as though telling me all that wasn’t enough, my sister told me that our mom has been addicted to drugs and alcohol for roughly the past decade. I didn’t know what to say, and she just kept going, saying our mom goes on “vacations” that are really trips to rehab. I just felt frozen, like I couldn’t say or ask anything. I didn’t.

My sister is okay now. Our parents are with her. I don’t have any idea what to do. I can’t look at my mom without thinking of all the lies I’ve been told. I can’t look at my dad without feeling betrayed. A few days ago, I asked my sister about it and asked how she knew and she said they’d just told her. She asked me not to bring it up with our parents, since they’d be angry with her for telling, but how can I *not*? What do I do? Who can I trust?

TL;DR: My sister was afraid of dying and told me that I was adopted and our mom is an addict. I’m lost. "
"(UPDATE!) I'm (30/F) single, pregnant via sperm donor, and my mom (51/F) completely disapproves


[Link to original!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kzall/im_30f_single_pregnant_via_sperm_donor_and_my_mom/?st=JFSH9M18&amp;sh=ef2352a9)

So, things have been a little wild. My mom had been spreading some awful lies and rumors about me and my pregnancy back in our hometown, and it was causing a lot of issues between us. I just didn’t want to speak with her, and I was dealing with my own recent diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It’s been really hard, I’ve been feeling isolated by my friends and having troubles with my mom was making it even worse. I knew I didn’t want her there when my son was born, but I wanted her there a bit. So, I asked her to come out whenever she wanted in these final weeks, and she chose last week. It was rough. She was talking about my clothes, the nursery, my house, even my food. Everything got criticized and I felt like I was breaking, but I kept convincing myself things were okay. I told myself it was alright because I just needed *someone.*

I went into labor over the weekend, and I was freaking out. I was still early-term, but I wanted to labor naturally for as long as possible. The longer he was in there, in my opinion, the better. And my mom was just giving me shit the entire time. She drove me to the hospital and was polite, then we got there and she was telling me how I was doing it wrong, I wasn’t being careful enough, etc. Labor lasted 30 hours, and I was so miserable. My mom was just being so nasty the whole time, and I kept wanting to cry. Eventually, I just got sick of it and told her she could either be quiet or get out, and she chose the latter. My son, Foster Delaney, was born around 4am on Saturday, and he is just gorgeous. I was totally worried I wouldn’t feel that bond and I’d just never connect, but the second I saw him, I knew he was mine and I loved him. He’s just the sweetest little boy. He’s on the heavy side for being born as early as he was, and is shockingly healthy, which I’m very happy about. He’s just so precious.

My mom came back on Sunday, and I was kind of at the end of my rope. Foster hasn’t been latching easily, and I’m just riddled with anxiety. And he’s been freaking out at night to be fed, and since he won’t latch too quickly, the screaming lasts hours. So, I told my mom that my patience had already been tested, and she was on a short leash. My mom apologized to me, and admitted she’d been terrible. She’d had an idea of how things were going to go for me, and when I’d gone for something else, she self-destructed. She had seen me at my worst for so long that she was panicked when I had intentionally put myself in a bad spot. She told me that she’d been lying to people at home to save face, but I told her it had hurt and our relationship was definitely on thin ice. She said being denied the chance to see her grandson being born was a wake up call, and I hope it really is. And I’ll admit, it’s been helpful to have her around. She keeps my anxiety at bay and brings me food, and does some cleaning up at home. I’m waiting to go back with her, but until then, I’m really happy to be with my boy.

So, I guess that’s it. Foster is here, my mom is here, and I’m okay. My friends haven’t really been visiting but I have my mom and her care, and that’s enough for me. Everyone in my family is really excited to meet him, and I’m excited too!! So, yeah! Thanks guys!

TL;DR: I had my son, and my mom is finally shaping up!"
"[update] I (23f) posted about my parents tearing down my childhood treehouse on Thursday. I flew home to try to save some of the wood, but so much more happened.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8bujh5/my_23f_parents_50s_are_tearing_down_my_tree_house/

**a huge thank you to everyone, especially /u/RodeoBob for such thoughtful replies. I didn't specifically follow everyone's advice but rather sort of pieced things together from everyone, so seriously thank you to everyone.**

**tl;dr of original: my parents told me they were tearing down my childhood treehouse to install a gazebo and hottub. The treehouse had been given to me by my grandpa and it was my sanctuary from my parents constant verbal and physical fighting. I was heartbroken that they were tearing it down and also heartbroken for realizing that all these years later, they were still so callous to what they had put me through.**

So end story is I called my mom to please take several pictures of the treehouse for me, from several angles and inside. She was so rude and dismissive and said something along the lines of ""oh, Jenny we don't have time for that and you can't expect us to climb up into that piece of junk?"" I was heartbroken all over again because she was callous. 

I decided that the only way I was going to have any keepsakes was to fly home and either take pictures myself or save as much of the wood as I could. I bought a really expensive last minute ticket home. After I'd already paid the ticket, I remembered that my maybe my neighbor would be willing to take some pictures for me. They are an elderly couple but they had almost been like surrogate grandparents (when they were home, they travelled a lot) but Mr ""Smith"" prided himself on being in great shape so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask him for pictures just in case I didn't make it home in time. 

To say it was an odd conversation is an understatement, I'll just type it out to the best of my memory:

Me: ""Hi Mrs Smith, it's Jenny from next door are you guys in town by chance?""

Mrs Smith: ""Jenny! It's so good to hear from you. No we are at our place in XXXXX. Is there something I can do for you? Is everything ok?""

Me: ""well not really, my parents are tearing down the oak tree with my...""

Mrs Smith: ""what? they are doing what?""

Me: ""they are tearing down that oak tree with my treehouse.""

Mrs Smith ""no, they can't do that. That's our oak tree."" 

Me: ""well I think either Friday or Saturday, they are having people over to cut it all down.""

Mrs Smith: ""Jenny, I need to make some calls. I'm sorry I need to let you go. I'll try to call you back.""

So I flew home early Friday morning. My parents had hired some laborers from home depot but weren't home. They were well underway tearing my treehouse down. I approached them and asked if I could pay them to set aside the boards and metal parts and not throw them in the dumpster they had brought, they agreed. And I was able to save almost all the wood in a very neat pile. I even tried to number everything so if I ever do get to rebuild it someday, I know what goes together. It wasn't ideal but I feel fortunate that I did get to save most everything. 

I'd say at maybe 6pm my parents finally showed up and they were as mad as I've ever seen them. They weren't even happy to see me. What it turns out, the neighbors had their lawyer issue an injunction against tearing the tree down. I can't even begin to say how angry my parents were. And they didn't even really speak to me to tell me what was going on so I called Mr and Mrs Smith back. It took until Saturday but finally they called and they told me that basically there had been a surveying mistake when my parents had built their house in the 80s and the tree had actually been on the Smith's property the whole time. They told me they always had an uneasy peace with my parents over the error and had never minded having a treehouse in the tree but chopping it down was crossing a major line. They said the tree gave them great shade in the summer mornings and they could not imagine tearing it down for any reason. They asked me what my parents reasons were and I told him about the gazebo and he literally started laughing that my parents had the nerve to knowingly build a gazebo on their property. He said he'd always planned on legally deeding the property over to my parents since it's only about a 11 foot error (along the entire property) but since he thinks my parents purposefully waited until he and Mrs Smith were out of town to rip down the tree, he wasn't in any mood to do them favors. 

Saturday was so awkward and I spent the night at a friends from HS. This morning my dad said he wanted my ""Crap"" off his property so I called the Smiths back and they said they didn't mind if I stored my wood in their barn as long as I needed. 

My parents went to Church and I plan on leaving without saying goodbye. I had some memorabilia boxes in the attic, I am taking them to a friends house and she's going to ship them too me so there's nothing left in the house for my parents to take their anger out on. 

I don't know how this will affect our relationship but the reality is we haven't had much of one for a long time. I don't have any attachment to my childhood home any more so at least in the near term there's nothing for me to really go home to. 

thank you everyone for the advice and giving me some clarity during a really stressful time. I didn't follow most advice but I did take a little bit from all 300+ responses to work out a decent solution. Thank you again.

**tl;dr: update from a post about my parents tearing down my childhood treehouse to build a gazebo and hot tub. Turns out the tree was actually on the neighbors property and they issued and injunction from having the tree chopped down. The treehouse was already mostly disassembled by the time I got home but I gave the workers a $100 extra to stack the wood neatly and not throw it away. So my parents don't get to chop the tree down and the pieces of my treehouse will stay safely in the neighbors barn until I figure out what I can do with the wood.**

"UPDATE: I [33F] Witnessed a Neighbor [50sF] Damage the Property of Neighbors [30sMF] I’ve Never Met


Thanks to the kind redditors who gave me advice in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zzcro/i33f_witnessed_a_neighbor_50sf_i_dont_get_along/), I decided to leave an anonymous note in the neighbors mailbox detailing what I saw of the accident. I know most of the comments suggested handling it in a more direct manner, but I’ve had a lot of issues with the woman who hit the house next door and wanted to do the right thing without involving myself.

Well, since the original accident, I’ve seen my next door neighbors come out and survey the damage. I briefly met them and they seem very nice. They mentioned that they’d never had an issue with the woman who hit the house and didn’t want to start a neighbor war since they determined the damage was entirely cosmetic. 

That was around two months ago. Earlier this week, the woman who lives downstairs hit their house *again*. This time it was much harder, at 4 in the morning, and she was caught red handed. I popped my head out of the window to see the next door neighbors running out of their house with a flashlight. They shone it down the driveway to reveal the downstairs neighbor pulling her car away from the house and taking a significant amount of wood and siding with it. The husband yelled “Hey, you just hit our house!” The downstairs neighbor stumbled out of her car, yelled “No I didn’t” and promptly vomited in the yard. She was drunk- really, really drunk.

The next door neighbors offered to wait until she was sober to file the police report, but she apparently gets belligerent when drunk. She screamed, accused them of “bullying her” said she knew the local police chief and would report them for harassment, and ultimately stormed into her apartment and slammed the door. The couple next door were dumbfounded. Two police cars showed up a few minutes later to hash it out.

So, basically I tried to do the right thing. It turns out the couple next door have the patience of saints and didn’t want to cause any trouble, but trouble can’t be avoided when it lives that close. Karma seems to be catching up the the hit and run lady downstairs. 

**tl;dr:** I told the neighbors about the accident I witnessed. They wanted to let it slide, but the lady hit their house again while intoxicated and caused a lot more damage. The police are involved now."
"My [26 F] boyfriend [28 M] of three years won't stop ""liking"" his ex's sexy photos


My boyfriend is naturally very flirtatious by nature. I do my best to keep my jealousy at bay with him. He has almost exclusively female friends and frequently goes on ""friend"" dates with them which I'm very respectful of. 

However, for the last year or so he consistently ""likes"" his ex's sexy instagram pictures and it just frustrates me to no end. They had a very hyper sexual relationship (they went to sex parties together) and she still swings. She'll post a picture in garters and a panty and bra and he'll like it, etc. I think he's liked every photo on her page. It's because the pictures are sexy that it bothers me so much. It makes me feel like hes telling her, ""Hey I still want to f*** you"" 

When I brought this up to him that it makes me feel insecure and upsets me he got really angry and basically told me, ""I'm fucking you not her"" and kind of made me feel like a huge asshole about it. 

Am I being unreasonable? How do I make my boyfriend realize this is disrespectful to me? If it were pictures of her cat, food, travel, I wouldn't care. 

TLDR: My 26 F bf 28 M won't stop liking pictures of his ex in lingerie on Instagram and made me feel like an asshole for complaining about it"
"I [17M] am worried about my best friend's [20F] mental health, because of how strongly she reacted, after I said that I wasn't sure about having a relationship with her.


I met Sarah 7 years ago. She was friends with my older sister, and they would hang out at our house. We became best friends in her last year of high school. She went off to university, and our friendship transitioned into an online one. Her university is about 50 minutes away, so we can only meet each other once a month, but I talk to her every day online, and I have her added on all my social media.

She was acting strange yesterday. I asked her if something was wrong. She said there was something on her mind that she'd been wanting to tell me for a long time. Sarah admitted that she was in love with me and said she'd been thinking about me in this way for the past year. She told me how jealous she was getting seeing me talk to other girls online. I asked her to further explain her feelings towards me. She said I made her feel special and even with our age difference, and distance we could make a serious relationship work. She told me that university life made her feel lonely, and the best part of her day was talking to me.

I told Sarah I loved her too, but that I thought I was too young for her. I said she should be dating someone closer to her age, but she said it was okay because I'm mature enough to date her.

When she asked for a relationship I told her I wasn't sure, and she started crying. She asked me why we couldn't be together if we love each other, and left the call before I could give her my reasons. Later that day, at night, she sent me a bunch of drunk texts and videos of her crying, saying how much she loves me, how great of a girlfriend she'd be, and how the only reason she wakes up in the morning is because of me.

Our friendship is extremely strained at the moment too. This morning she texted me a bunch of hearts and sent a paragraph on how much she loves/cares about me, but she took it back later in the afternoon. Sarah was freaking out, and begging me not to cut her out of her life because I'm the only person she has to talk to. She seemed extremely paranoid that I was going to end the friendship until I promised her I wasn't.

I am so fucking stressed, and the whole situation has been eating at me. I want a relationship with her, but it's not a good idea, because no matter how much we love each other I don't think it'll work because of our age difference, the distance between us, and the mental health issues that I think she has. 

I don't think Sarah can handle a relationship. I'm concerned about the comment she made that she only wakes up because of me, and the fact that her reaction was to drink alcohol. I need advice on what to do. I can't ghost her, she's my best friend, and I want to help but I have no clue what to do or where to start. I'm scared of losing my best friend.

I'm not close with my sister, but I might be able to get her to talk to Sarah because they're still friends. Or I could have my parents to talk to her parents because they're friends with each other, but I feel like her life is spiraling out of control, she's pushing everyone away from her, and I'm the only person that can stop it. 

Please help me. 

**tl;dr: My best friend that I've known for 7 years confessed her love towards me. I told her I felt the same, but I wasn't sure if it was a good idea because of our age difference, and the distance between us. She reacted strongly by crying, and later that day sent me a bunch of texts/drunk videos of her saying how much she loves me, how great of a girlfriend she'd be, and the only reason she wakes up in the morning is because of me. I am extremely concerned about her mental health, and I don't know what to do.**"
"Fiance (26m) is paranoid that I'm (22f) going to revenge cheat on him


It was last year that I found out my fiance cheated on me. He told me that he did, but only because the girl he was with threatened to expose him. I gave him another chance because this is a first time thing and I don't think he'd do it again. He said that's he been craving attention from me, which I will admit I've been lacking on giving him. But ever since then, he's been so paranoid that I'm going to do the same to him. Which I wouldn't. I'm not trashy or spiteful. He asked me to marry him shortly after I found out. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want him to feel like he had to marry me to prove his loyalty or because he felt bad. But he insists that's it's what he wants.

He just randomly asks me stuff like, ""we're okay right?""  Or when I leave, I noticed that he would start panicking and ask where I'm going and with who. When I finally asked him why he was being frantic all of a sudden, he told me that he was worried about me cheating on him. He really started crying and I felt bad because I gave him no reason to feel like I would cheat on him. This dude is really worried about nothing. Then he told me to make sure I come and talk to him if I feel like swaying.

I've told him over and over that I wouldn't cheat on him out of spite. I wouldn't cheat on him at all. I'd just leave, but he isn't listening. We're getting married soon and I don't want this to be something stuck in the back of his mind. This has also gotten to be really annoying. He is constantly looking over my shoulder to see who I'm speaking to and he wants to go EVERYWHERE with me. Even to my hair appointments, which he hated going to before.

Tl;Dr: My fiance cheated on me last year and he's paranoid that I'll do the same to him, even though I've assured him I wouldn't"
"My (23f) family is at family reunion at Disney. All my brothers and sisters (10-19m/f) are adopted. My uncle (40sM) said he wanted a pic with only the ""real Millers."" I told him I would not participate without my siblings now he and his wife are pissed at me and demanding an apology.


FYI: Miller isn't our last name, just chose a generic one (no offense to anyone named Miller ;))

For some background I am one of four children, but the only biological one. My parents adopted my brother (19) then my two sisters (14 and 10). We are all different races and nationalities which can cause some initial confusion when it comes to describing our family, but for the most part people get it quickly and I wouldn't want it any other way. 

There has been a family reunion planned for Disney World this week for well over a year that included anyone who was either a child or grandchild of my Dad's grandparents so I couldn't even begin to count but if I had to guess I'd say there's 40 of us on this trip to include aunts, uncles, cousins and grandkids.  At the very last minute my parents had a business emergency so they asked me and my brother if we would be ok going and being responsible for our two younger siblings. Disney isn't really my thing but I was definitely excited to hang out with my brother and sisters and I haven't seen my cousins in forever. 

Things were a little weird from the get go and my brother and I very quickly figured out we'd have more fun if we did our own thing so we've done things like actually ditched Disney, gone to Universal Studios and the Beach in Clearwater. This really pissed off my uncle ""Ron"" because he's the one who put the whole thing together. It made him even more mad when some other family members started following our lead (like I said, I'm not a Disney fan but 7 days at Disney World seemed like too much even for diehards). So I really felt like Ron was carrying some sort of grudge against me and my brother. We were still meeting for family breakfasts and dinners and I thought we were doing a great job being social.

Since everyone is driving or flying out tonight or tomorrow, Ron wanted to get a pic of the family at this mornings breakfast. We all lined up next to some greenery and Ron said ""I'd actually like one with the ""real"" Miller family first."" I assumed that meant things like just my grandparents  kids and grandkids. So me and my siblings took a spot in the group but all the spouses came too. Ron pointed at my siblings and said ""no I'm sorry I meant blood relatives."" Which caused even more confusion because some of the spouses moved to leave and he had to backtrack and say ""no spouses are fine.""

I was like WTF? I said as calmly as I could ""Ron, my brother and sisters are ""real"" Millers."" He accused me of purposefully obfuscating and not understanding. I said no, I wasn't I would just know that my parents would want my siblings included in family reunion photo. He then got extremely pissed and said I could take whatever goddamned picture I wanted, but this was his picture and the ""official"" reunion pic. I said that made it even more important that my brother and sisters were in it. He again accused me of making a bigger deal out of this than it needed to be. I said if that was the case then we all would just go do our own thing. He thing said basically ""you're a blood relative, I need you in the picture."" I said I flat out refused and thank god me and my brother were on the same wavelength because he was already packing up our younger sisters to go to our room so our exit was mostly complete by the time I'd had enough of Ron. 

I just got a text from Ron's wife saying ""Ron is sorry for the language he used, but we both feel you owe him a huge apology. He worked very hard to set up this reunion and in addition to the picture incident this morning, we feel that you've been sabotaging it from the beginning. I don't think your parents would be proud of your actions.""

I literally almost died laughing because it was so presumptuous and rude. My inclination is to march down to their condo and rip them to shreds and if my extended family falls apart because of it, then fine, I don't care if I ever see Ron and his ilk again. 

My other inclination is to just let it go, Ron has to suffer with his small mind anyways and I don't have to see him often (last time was probably when I was 17) and he really means nothing to me, so a nasty altercation will just poison my soul. 

Of those two choices, ignore or have a verbal altercation what should I chose? Is there a third option?

**TL;DR: during a family reunion my uncle wanted a family photo that didn't include my adopted siblings. I said no and said I wouldn't be in the ""official"" picture if he didn't include them. A verbal altercation ensued and now he's demanding an apology. Should I go tell him off over his wife's rude text or should I take the high road and let it go?**

"I was (unknowingly) the other woman and once I found out, I told his wife.


I [24F] met this guy on Tinder. We had a lot of immediate chemistry so we continued to hang out/hook up. I was really just trying to have some fun. 

Some red flags appeared almost immediately. He kept his place reaaaally clean and my intuition told me that he seemed to carry around some guilt. He was just a little weirdly distant. I sent him a friend request after about a week of us hooking up, and he blocked me when he got it. I didn’t understand why he did this at the time, but I was hurt to say the least. He then completely ghosted me. 

Two weeks later, I get a text from him asking if I can come over so he can explain things. When I get there, he tells me that he’s technically married, but they’re separated and live in different states. He said that they only got married in the first place because he knocked her up and she needed (his military) health insurance.

I took it with a grain of salt. I didn’t get mad because at this point I already figured this guy was a POS. I hooked up with him a couple times more since it wasn’t really anything serious, but then after those couple of times, he got all weird again. He told me out of the blue how he “didn’t want to hurt me,” how I’m a “really nice girl, almost too nice,” and how he didn’t want me to expect anything that I shouldn’t from our casual relationship. I thought it was weird and it definitely didn’t make any contextual sense to me. I hadn’t made it seem like I had any feelings for him or anything. I kind of brushed it off and just went on with my life, definitely knowing at that point that this guy is a POS and not worth my time. 

Well, for some reason, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. It all felt really weird. So I got on my second Facebook—made specifically for situations like this—and looked him up. I didn’t see anything about his wife. I searched his last name on his friends list and found her. Turns out, they were quite obviously still married and only doing long distance because she is in school in another state. 

So, I just decided to message her. I was kind of just going with my gut at this point. I told her “Hey, you don’t know me, and I don’t know what your relationship with _____ is like, but I wanted to let you know that he is 100% sleeping with other women (plural).”—he had told me about another ex he was with a few months before me—“If you want to know anything else just let me know.” She replied, and we ended up messaging each other for hours while he was at work. I sent her all the screenshots I had of our texts, pictures, calls, his tinder profile, etc. She definitely thought they were in a happy monogamous marriage. She was devastated. We were really friendly the whole time. After she talked to him—as she happened to be visiting him  at the time—she told me that he admitted to it. I told her I was there for her if she needed anything and to stay strong. 

Today, I get the nastiest text from him, saying how I don’t know anything about their relationship, all these other nasty things, and then told me to fuck off at the end. Not gonna lie, I was pretty hurt. 

I feel like I did the right thing, just because I was in her shoes in an almost identical situation last year. I know that I’d want to know, and in fact I found out about everything because of one of the other women in my particular situation. 

Anyone else been in a similar situation? I don’t need to say anything else to her, do I? Did I do the right thing? 

Edit: grammar 

TL;DR: I was unknowingly the other woman and told his wife as soon as I found out about her. He said some really hurtful things and I’m just hoping I did the right thing. "
"Me [35F] and my husband [38M] with my sister-in-law [33F]; we didn't pick her to be the guardian of our twins [6months] and it's dropped a bomb in our relationship


My husband and I have been married for five years, and recently had twins. Now that life is settling down (ha!) we met with our lawyer to update our wills and do all that proper legal things that people should do once having kids. Part of that was setting up legal guardianship for the twins. We asked my best friend and her husband. They agreed and it’s all sorted out. 


Which brings us to our current problem: my husband’s sister. We had dinner over the weekend with my husband’s family. We mentioned that we updated our wills. My SIL asked if that included guardianship for the twins and I said yes. My husband chimed in and said “We asked Sue and Chris [my best friend and her husband] and they agreed.” Well apparently that was the worst thing we could have said, because SIL started crying. She sat at the table, tears streaming down her cheeks, repeatedly questioning why we didn’t ask her and how we could consider sending our kids to a non-family member; isn’t she good enough to raise our kids? How hurtful that was and how someone who wasn’t family couldn’t love the children like family would. 


Honestly, asking my husband’s sister was never an option for us. While I care deeply about my SIL and she’s a nice person, she wouldn’t have raised our kids in a way that we would be comfortable with. She’s highly religious, like church or church related activity 3 or 4 days a week. In contrast my husband and I are both atheists. SIL hasn’t done any sort of post-secondary education; and barely graduated high school (Un-diagnosed learning disability); because of that school and education just aren’t important to her. Nor is following current events – SIL herself has admitted that current events stress her out and she’d rather ignore them.  My husband and I both have master’s degrees in our fields and believe in the importance of education – some sort of post-secondary or vocational school is expected. Finally this one may seem shallow, but SIL is morbidly obese. She’s 33 and struggles health wise: knee issues, diabetes, breathing problems, untreated sleep apnea, migraines, other aches and pains. Physically she’s just not capable of potentially raising kids, IMO. 

Put it all together and she’s just not someone we’d want raising our kids, no matter how much we love her. She does have many good qualities: she exemplifies kindness; she’s hard working; she’s got a wicked sense of humor. We want her in our children’s lives just not in a potential parental role.


In contrast we joke with my best friend and her husband how the 4 of us are essentially the same couple. Our lifestyles and parenting philosophies and religious beliefs couldn’t be more similar. My husband and I both believe that they would do as good a job, if not better, in raising our kids as we would. My friend and her husband would ensure that our kids maintain a relationship with our families, which is important to us. It was a simple and logical choice. 


I should also note that we didn’t pick my brother and his wife for guardians either. I love them, but they want to travel and they live a very nomadic life. They’re a great uncle and aunt, but would be shit parents.


I discovered yesterday that my SIL had deleted me from her social media – childish, but the ultimate eff you in her world. She’s also refusing to speak with use because “We’ve shown we don’t care about family and don’t trust her with our kids”. Is there any way we can mend this fence? It has nothing to do with not caring about family and everything to do with what’s in the best interest of our children. Is there anything we can do to make this better?

TL;DR Didn't ask my SIL to be the guardian of our twins  for a number of reasons. She's hurt and refusing to speak to us. Is there anything we can do to mend this fence?"
"Me [28/M] and my Wife [26/F] of 8 Years, Update Post


[OP Here](https://redd.it/81pvaf).

Gist of my original post was that my wife (26/F) and I (28/M) had split up (after 8 years) due to my failing mental health and the stresses it had caused the relationship. Well here's an update to what all went on over a month later.

Alright, so I was really freaked out and heartbroken when I made the post, as I had never lived alone before or lived without someone controlling most aspects of my life. 

It turns out, I have very simple tastes. I can cook and do so well. I'm now properly medicated for Bipolar instead of Depression and am on my second month of them. I'm living in my own place, with my cat, and I'm keeping it clean.

My coworkers, my family and even myself have all noticed an excellent change in my outlook and behavior. Coworkers tell me I'm happier, more relaxed and more fun to work with. My family is mostly excited because this is the most they've seen of me since I started my relationship 8 years ago, but they also mention I don't seem so nervous anymore.

Personally, I don't think I've ever felt more terrified. I expect so much more from myself and my surroundings. I scarcely know what to do with so much extra energy and freedom. Paying for a place to live turned out to be way easier than I had been led to believe too. My family aren't mean spirited people like I had been led to believe, and it turns out I'm worth more as a person than just what I can cook or what my body can bring my partner. 

I still am not entirely sure what to do with myself, but I've started off by getting in touch with a few mental health groups in my area, trying out karaoke (was super excited to learn I can sing well according to the folks who heard me), and generally doing my best to stay in touch with my family and old friends. My coworkers are very kind too, and they even helped me move! I do have to decline their invitations to hook up with friends they know or downloading dating apps; I just don't feel ready for something like that. I'm taking this all on with a more growth-oriented mindset and am trying to get out of my comfort zones, confronting my negative assumptions about myself and the lies I had been told to control me. 

This is only my second time posting here, and I know folks may not really care, but it feels good to have some kind of positive update to things that just a month ago felt like the end of my world. As for how she's handling things, she's pretty much stopped talking to me, except to complain how much everything costs or about a mobile game she's playing. 

**TL:DR**

**I think things are gonna be okay, but I still don't know how to further this whole ""I'm a real person who's worth more than my body"" thing. It's a lot of freedom and it's scary as shit. Doing what I can and am definitely in a better spot than last post here, but I'm open to suggestions on further improvement**"
"[16f], Dad [54m] told my boyfriend [16m] not to give me rides home from work anymore. Dad won’t give me an alternative way home and I don’t know what he expects me to do.


Dad has been on a kick lately for getting me to be more self-reliant. And I get the idea, but some of his recent actions have left me really confused and pretty annoyed.

It started with him telling me I need to start making my own money for going out with friends and stuff. And that is fine, I get it. So I went out and got a job at a store after school a few nights a week.

The job itsself is fine, I actually really like who I work with and my boss. The only trouble I’ve had is that I get off kinda late, and it isn’t really the best neighborhood for a girl to walk through alone at night.

I told dad I was scared to walk home through that area, he told me it was my job and I need to figure it out.

I was venting about this to my boy a couple weeks ago (dating 4 months) and he said he could just start giving me rides home. I told him he didn’t have to, but he said it was fine because he is always up until like midnight anyway, so he didn’t mind.

And it worked out really well for the last two weeks. I get a ride home every night so i don’t have to walk home, get to spend a little bit of time with the boy, so it seemed like a good solution.

But when my boyfriend dropped me off last night, dad was waiting outside. He came down to the car and asked my boyfriend if he was giving me rides every night. My boyfriend said he was and he didn’t mind.

Dad told him that I never asked if that was okay. Its true, I didn’t, but I wasn’t trying to hide it or anything and it didn’t seem like it would be a problem.

Dad told my boy that he is not allowed to give me rides home anymore. Dad wouldnt talk about why until we went inside, and then he told me that it is because I am supposed to be “learning self-reliance” and thag doesn’t mean depending on my boyfriend to drive me home from work.

I told him the reason I asked for rides was because I am scared to walk home at night. Dad told me an adult has to figure things like that out on their own.

So I asked him if he would start picking me up since my boy isn’t allowed to anymore, dad said no. So i asked if he could help me buy some old crappy car of my own, dad said no to that, too. So, unless I missed something, the only way I’m “allowed” to go home is walking alone past a bunch of crackheads at night. I am not okay with that.

My boyfriend texted me later in the night that he would just start dropping me off around the corner from my house so I can pretend I walked home, so the immediate solution is figured out. But it seems stupid to me that we need to hide this.

I mean, I’m a 100 pound girl. Wtf is “self-reliance” going to mean if some druggie decides they want my cash While I’m walking home?

This isn’t normal, right?? I can get by my dad easy enough on the rides, but I really don’t want to have to do that. What can I say to him to make him see my side of this? And how can I convince him that getting a safe ride home from my boyfriend doesn’t mean I expect to be “coddled”?

TL;DR: Boyfriend gives me rides home after work so I don’t have to walk through a crappy neighborhood. Dad is not okay with that and told him not to do it anymore. Why? And how can i resolve this?"
"I (28f) make daily visits to post office or work, clerk (60s) is the rudest human being I've ever met. She has ~6mos to retire, if I complain she could be fired. Do I just endure her or do I need to press the issue?


I hope this is an ok sub for this, I thought about r/PF but figure since this is more of a person issue, I'd post here. 

I own and operate a small company where mail order is 100% of my business. I've tried other shipping methods but by far the easiest for me is to take my packages to my local post office nearly every day to drop them off. 

Ever since I've been going to this post office (walking distance from my house) the clerk there has been a thorn in my side. She is the rudest person I've ever met. 

First of all she is an absolute stickler for even the smallest of rules. That's fine, I could deal with this but on days where she kicks me out of line because I stepped away for half as second to get a pen and everyone in the line agrees that it's no problem...are very frustrating to say the least. 

But she also personally attacks me. She calls me dumb, blonde, stupid, ignorant, silly, etc...  multiple times a week. I am always overly polite to her so I feel she has no reason to treat me like this. I also know what I'm doing because I ship so much but even then I make human mistakes and I feel some basic human courtesy is in order. 

Today I had a mailing label MAYBE 2mm hanging over the edge of package. She looked right at me and said (as near I can remember) ""look blondie, you're in here every day. you know I can't accept this as it will cause all my packages to stick together). I said I wanted to talk to her supervisor. She looked at me and said ""you sure you can handle that? I mean you can't handle a label and you're what 15 years old?"" I insisted on it. Her supervisor came out and took me into office. 

I explained to him what had being going on for the last 6 months. He looked like a broken man. He said that she had been transferred around to every post office in our area and she made everyone miserable at every one. He was desperately hoping that she would just chill out and ride out her time as she's getting ready to retire in six months. At first I said that didn't affect me and something had to be done. Then he explained that if I opened up a formal complaint on her she would almost certainly be fired as she's had a ""file full"" of customer complaints and even the post office was ready to get rid of her. He said she basically had nothing in life and as much as he doesn't like her either he hopes that at least her retirement will let her live out her life. 

He also said that if I opened up a formal complaint, it would make his life miserable until the complaint is closed and he was really hoping to just get her out of there. 

He did offer that I could ask for him directly every time I come in, he also said he'd speak to her about her language and insults but he again basically pleaded with me to not open a formal complaint. 

I can fill in any details but based on what I just wrote, should I open the formal complaint process against her or should I just endure and let her ride out her time (while taking solace in the fact I'll never be as miserable as she is)?

**tl;dr:** lady at the post office I go to every day is the rudest person I've ever met. I wanted to file a formal complaint against her but her supervisor basically pleaded with me to not because she's less than 6 months away from retirement and she'd likely be fired. What should I do?

"My ex-girlfriend [27 F] and I [27 M] broke up 3.5 weeks ago after a ~4 years relationship. This past weekend she got very drunk and hysterically cried out of guilt about the breakup (that she initiated) to all my friends. Should I just forgive her?


First off, completely separating myself from her has been difficult. We met during professional school, and over 4 years forged a very close knit group of friends. On top of all that we are in the same profession in the same region. As a result, we have very overlapping lives at the moment.

This past weekend there was a local conference for our profession that we had both planned to attend together, but I withdrew after we broke up. I still heard through mutual friends at that conference everything that happened including what she was doing.

Multiple friends called me expressing concerns for my ex-girlfriend because she supposedly spent the whole weekend depressed/tearful. Everyone at the conference kept asking her what happened between us, and how regrettable it was because I was such a nice guy who seemed to be making her happy.

It boiled over on the last night when she got very drunk, and started to hysterically cry at the bar. She was telling everyone that she felt so terrible, and that they were right and I was a super nice guy. That she was a shitty person for leaving me for such a shallow reason (which she refused to tell anyone). That I did everything right as a boyfriend, and she cannot explain why she was so unhappy. That the breakup was 100% her fault, and she would understand if all our friends ended up hating her in the end.

The “shallow reason” she was referring to was my weight gain. I have steadily gained about ~35 lbs since we started dating due to the stress of school, and starting a very challenging residency afterwards. She had dropped small hints throughout the year to try and get me to “improve my health.” Finally she just flat out said that she just wasn’t physically attracted to me anymore. She felt bad because she has always had body image issues about herself, and constantly needed me to re-assure her that I still found her attractive no matter what happened.

I have started to recover myself. We really only text sporadically about the logistics of me getting my things from her apartment. I honestly do not have any ill will towards her anymore, and fully support that we both deserve to be happy even if it is not with each other. However, I do feel bad that she is harboring so much guilt over the situation. I am not sure what to do since she has been putting on a front with me that everything is fine, and she has moved on.

tl;dr - Friends seem to be concerned about ex-girlfriend’s mental state. I feel responsible still even though I shouldn’t... Should I talk to her and forgive her to help us both move on faster?"
"My[36m] wife[37f] threatens divorce in almost every argument, has a REALLY short temper, and no problem having no-holds-barred arguments in front of our kids [8m and mentally/physically disabled 6m]


TL;DR: wife has anger issues, constantly threatens divorce, and holds nothing back in arguments in front of our kids (one typical, one severely mentally and physically disabled). Couples therapy isn’t working, maybe making things worse. Divorce seems like an inevitable but devastating option but better than completely f**king up our neuro-typical son. 
 
This is really long but I couldn’t find anything unworthy enough to be cut out. Please bear with me. 

The above situation has been a relative constant in our 9-year marriage with periods of calm in between the eruptions. 
This weekend was about the 3rd or 4th tipping point where I've been ready to take her up on her offer to get divorced.
But first a little background on our disabled son, boy2. 12 months after having boy1 we found out we were pregnant again. Then we found out boy2 wasn’t developing typically and was unlikely to survive to term or would be too disabled to care for and we should consider abortion. My wife and I didn't want to abort and decided to let nature take its course. Boy2 was born and later diagnosed with an extremely rare genetic condition called PHGDH, a serene deficiency. He'll never walk or talk, he's legally blind and deaf, and is, and will be 100% interdependent for the rest of his life. Because of boy2’s care needs and school schedule my wife doesn’t work and earns no income other than babysitting for a friend (which is about to end).
 
We’re currently in marriage counseling but I don’t think my point of view is being heard. The therapist seems to think that all my wife’s grievances and frustrations with me are valid and a result of my ADHD, for which I was diagnosed at age 26 {Med disclosure: I take stimulants for ADHD as well as anti-depressants and anxiety meds for those conditions. Wife was prescribed an anti-anxiety med but I suspect she hasn’t been taking them since the RX bottle says it was filled in January. She insists she’s been taking them and just poured new meds into old bottle.] 

Since I’ve known my wife she’s had a temper. In the beginning of our relationship it manifested in the form of silence. I would notice times where she’d get quiet and just sort of “whatever”. As our relationship grew, the things that seemed to make her quiet at the beginning of our relationship would instead make her obviously angry. This got worse after boy1 was born. We’d get into these arguments over things and when I’d finally relent out of sheer unwillingness to put my all into an argument, she’d then argue with me against her previous argument claiming she “felt bad” for making me change my mind. This literally made me feel crazy. 

Boy1 is now 8 and we still have explosive arguments around him. It usually starts out small but quickly escalates into screaming where she’s calling me names, saying she hates me, telling me she wants me to leave and that she wants a divorce. Boy1 gets visibly upset by these arguments and screams at us to stop fighting, goes into his room to scream, and involves himself to try and calm us down. I don’t even know what to do, I want to take myself away from the situation but she accuses me of “leaving my responsibilities”. There have been two instances where trying to remove myself has caused the problem to escalate: A few years ago, we got into an explosive argument so I went to my basement workshop to spend some time away from her and cool off, she followed me down there and continued to yell at me until I lost control and punched a thick piece of plywood, breaking my hand. She had a sort-of “that’s what you get” attitude about it.  The second time we got into another explosive argument (this time neither kid was around), I was trying to go for a drive to cool off and she physically restrained me by wrapping her arms around me and blocking the door, preventing me from leaving the house. I’m 6’1”, 250lbs so could’ve gotten free but she’d’ve gotten hurt and I’d’ve probably been arrested. I was really disturbed by this instance so I emailed our counselor saying I was concerned I might be a victim of domestic abuse. At our next session the counselor all but wrote it off, almost mocking me for saying her actions constituted abuse. I said if it were the other way around I doubt she’d be so nonchalant about it which seemed to make her (counselor) mad and said such an accusation cost her license. I understand her job is to keep marriages together but writing off a claim of domestic abuse seems pretty unprofessional.
 
I’ve talked to my own personal therapist about these things and he validates my feelings which gives me courage to confront her about how I feel she’s treating me poorly but wife just comes back with “well did you tell him this and that or just your side of the story?” Which makes me think I wasn’t being fair in how I described the situation to my personal therapist. 
At our couples sessions My wife seems to control the narrative and becomes vulnerable and cries when I talk about how she’s treating me is wrong and unfair. At home, however, she shows no vulnerability at all and goes right into her no-holds-barred anger tirades. I feel so powerless. I genuinely feel she thinks her actions are justified based on how she feels and that she’s not intentionally manipulating me but I can’t seem to allow myself to come to terms with her severe reactions to my relatively minor actions. 

Yesterday I reached a tipping point after she said she wanted a divorce. This whole thing happened in front of boys 1 and 2. I had spent part of the day alone with boy2 while wife was with boy1 at a birthday party for one of his friends. Wife had one of boy2’s meds in her car, which he was scheduled to take while she was out. I let her know that I mixed up a new batch and gave him the appropriate dose. Later that night I drew up his final daily dose and threw away the rest so as not to get confused by the 2 partial bottles of medication. This resulted in him receiving the appropriate amount of medication for the day with a small amount wasted (med is a non-RX supplement and not subject to re-fill restrictions). When wife saw me throw away the excess med she completely lost it and began screaming and jumping up and down in an almost comical way saying I completely messed up his meds. I tried explaining what happened and she wouldn’t listen. When I finally got through to her she redirected her extreme reaction toward the fact that I had thrown out the excess medication, which at most should’ve elicited a “bummer, but oh well” response. But instead, she said she wanted a divorce. While all this was happening, boy2 was getting really upset. Screaming at us to stop fighting and trying to tell us jokes to calm us down, which broke my heart. I told her that her temper is creating a toxic environment for our son and it’s going to cause him serious damage. She retorted with “you’re the toxic one”. I slept on the couch.
 
This morning she was still acting cold. I asked her if she really wanted a divorce and she said she didn’t. I told her if she threatens divorce again I’m going to a lawyer and getting it done. (I’ve made this promise probably about 4 times in the past so it probably doesn’t carry weight anymore). I’m at my wits end, now. It devastates me to think of a life without seeing my boys every day and having them grow up in a broken home but at this point I’m willing to live with the pain if it means the boys aren’t subject to such a toxic environment. 
I know there’s no way to get out of this in one piece, financially, considering she doesn’t work, we own a home together, and with boy2’s disabled status. I don’t want my boys to have to sacrifice their lifestyles and full-time father but I’m legitimately concerned about how this poisonous environment is affecting the development of our (so far) neuro-typical kid. 
We both have near-by supportive families so I won’t be homeless if/when the shit hits the fan but I can’t imagine ever achieving happiness for myself if our family breaks apart. I don’t earn enough money sustain my family as well as myself in any sort of independent capacity. 

Am I in an abusive relationship? Is separation/divorce overdue? 
Is there any way to work with my wife without enabling her extreme temper?

Thanks for listening.

"My girlfriend (28/F) of three years is very upset about my (28/M) allergy to cats.


I (28/M) have always been extremely allergic to cats, and I was always upfront about this with my girlfriend (28/F) of three years as she has had a cat since before we met. We’ve had issues throughout the relationship as at first she accused me of faking my allergy, but over time, and seeing my reaction first hand multiple times she seemed to accept it.


When we moved in together roughly eight months ago, she left her cat at her parents house. She was extremely upset by this, and I tried to comfort her but my reaction is so severe it wasn’t a minor inconvenience. When around a cat I usually start to feel like I have the flu, including swollen eyes, runny nose, and have trouble breathing. If I touch cat dander I will break out in hives, on many occasions I’ve ended up with hives on my face when my girlfriend touches me after touching the cat. We’ve argued before when she’ll touch my face, and I realize what has happened and go to the bathroom to wash, only to have her say I’m overreacting.


A few weeks after moving in, I had an allergic reaction when we went to a friend’s house for a party and they had a cat. I wasn’t aware of this before arriving. I tried my best but ended up having a severe reaction and needed to leave, my girlfriend was very upset – insisted there was something wrong with me and told me “her and her cat are a package deal, I can’t have one without the other.”


At this point I decided to visit an allergist and starting receiving weekly allergy shots, I’m about 5 months in at this point. A short while afterwards my girlfriend decided she no longer wanted her cat to live with us, as he bonded so well with her parents. When I mentioned that I had been getting the shots for her, she insisted that I was doing it for myself. I continued the shots regardless.


Yesterday we went to visit her parents, and I made sure to take allergy medication before arriving. My reaction was subdued between the shots I’ve received and the medication. When I arrived, my girlfriend asked me to pet the cat, I did so and then immediately went to wash my hands. She asked if I had taken allergy medication, and seemed disappointed when I told I had.


I like cats, it’s just that I’m so allergic I need to be careful. At one point in the evening, my girlfriend expressed that she wished I would hold her cat. I told her that it wasn’t a good idea, I’m only 5 months into a three year series of allergy shots, the doctor said it would be 6 months to a year before serious improvement, and I was wearing my work clothes that I didn’t want to fill with hair and dander. She became extremely upset and told me I’d been having shots long enough and needed to “get over” my aversion to cats. This really upset me but I kept quiet in front of her parents and pet him just a little instead, again going to wash my hands afterwards.


When we arrived home, my girlfriend seemed very upset, and then told me she was hurt that I did not make more of an effort to be friendly with her cat, I wasn’t excited to see him, and didn’t truly test to see if the shots were working. She kept saying how impatient she is to have the cat live with us. When I said I felt a little funny and needed to shower and get the dander off of me, she responded ""No, you really don't, but whatever.""


Afterwards everything seemed to upset her, and she’s been extremely distant today.


I don’t know what to do – I’m already getting allergy shots, which are not cheap or comfortable, and it seems this is not enough for her. I feel like she isn’t considering my wellbeing at all, or even expressing appreciation that I’ve spent all this money, time, and effort going to the doctor for her. I’m not upset she is close to her cat, but how can I express that I’m doing everything possible and the process can’t be rushed?


TL;DR – Girlfriend (28/F) of three years is upset about my (28/M) severe cat allergy, I am five months into a three year series of allergy shots so her cat can live with us. My girlfriend says five months of shots is enough and I need to get over this. Doctor says 6-12 months before improvement. How can I explain that I’m doing everything possible and it cannot be rushed?"
"Me [32 F] with my husband [32 M] 8 years, I ruined one of his socks &amp; there's nothing I can do to make it up to him apparently :-(


My husband got home from work to find that one of his brand new special athletic socks was in the dryer - my fault. I accidentally put it in there. He got very upset and said it had ruined it, he cursed a bit and threw the socks down on the floor.

I, of course, felt really bad about this as it is totally my fault - I made a mistake and didn't see the sock in with the other clothes when I put them in the dryer earlier. He said that it had ruined one of them so he'd be unable to wear them for an event this weekend. So I apologized and immediately started looking up the brand and size etc online to buy him a new pair ASAP so he could still wear them this weekend.

But he said no, he doesn't want me getting him a new pair. He said if a new pair comes in the mail he'll throw them away. Which is crazy to me as he'd just been angrily ranting at me about what a waste it was, that someone had made these socks (they are factory made, not like they are hand made or anything but I think he was trying to make me understand the socks had value and he thinks I just didn't care enough to pay attention when sorting things for the dryer). But he said he would throw away new socks I order to replace them? 

I asked him why he wouldn't accept a replacement pair and he said that it's not about the money, it's about the waste - so when I asked why he'd throw out a new pair if they arrived if it's about waste, he didn't really say anything, just said because I can't just buy a new pair. I'm so confused!

I tired asking him what I can do to make it up to him, and he said the only way is to never do it again, and I said I promised to pay more attention to the dryer etc in future, but he said 'no you won't.' 

I picked up the socks where he had left them and they looked the same to me - one had been in the dryer and the other hadn't, and the elasticity and everything felt the same. I said this to him, hopefully all is not lost! and suggested he try them on to see if they're ok, as they might be fine and he just angrily said no.

It's just so weird to me and I'm so confused - he's so angry. He refused the coffee I offered to make him and I was meant to be making his favorite meal tonight anyway, but now he's saying he doesn't want it. It's like the whole night is ruined because of this sock, and it's like there's nothing I can do to apologise or make up for it.  We're different in this way - I hate conflict and to me, if someone makes a mistake without malice and sincerely apologises and offers to make it right by replacing or repairing the broken thing, then that's that, no point dwelling on it and life's too short to spend an entire evening raging because one of your socks may have lost a little of its elasticity from being accidentally put in the dryer. It's not even like this sock has shrunk or anything!! I can't even tell a difference!

It feels almost like he wanted the sock to be ruined, or like he doesn't want me to be able to do anything to make up for it, like he wants to be mad at me and feel justified about it? I have no idea what to do or say! I've left him on his own to feel angry with me but i'm honestly perplexed at the level of anger for this level of error on my part. This is like only the 2nd or 3rd time in 8 years I have accidentally put something in the dryer, plus on closer inspection it does not even seem to be damaged and he does't want me to fix it! What can I do, am I missing something here? Very confused right now.

tldr: put SO's sock in the dryer by accident. Doesnt appear to be ruined but he is convinced it is and is extremely angry, won't allow me to buy a replacement, won't accept my apology. I'm confused and need help understanding what this could possibly be about?"
"My [17F] dad [43F] is finally divorcing my mom [39F] and I couldn't be happier. People don't understand and everyone is calling me a terrible daughter. What to do?


There's a lot of background here so I'll try to keep it short. My parents have been in a horrible marriage since my birth basically. My mom has diagnosed BPD and is EXTREMELY unstable. She is arrogant, temperamental, selfish, and manipulative. My entire life she is the definition of unreliable and I felt like I had to grow up very quickly to deal with her. 

The thing is, she is absolutely charming to outsiders, to our distant relatives, etc. The only people who are familiar with the real her are my dad, me, and her own parents who live in another country. We have tons of family friends and relatives near us who absolutely adore her because she participates in a lot of local events and is seen as the ""funny, vivacious mom"" who attends all the charity drives, bake sales, and fun runs. 

At home, she is a whole other beast. Small things will overwhelm her, like washing dishes, having to cook a meal, laundry, paying bills, etc. So me and my dad usually do it. Small things also make her angry like if I forget to put away my music stand and instruments IN MY OWN ROOM and she freaks out and stays in bed for half a day angry. She also says awful things to us daily, calling us useless, unlovable, undeserving of affection, etc. Just really really extreme things you don't expect to hear from a parent. 

My dad is a good guy but after so many years he's been miserable and run over for so long. I know he's not perfect but he tries hard to defend me in front of my mom and he's asked me since I was young if I wanted to not live here anymore and go somewhere else with just him. Every time I told him it was fine and I liked living with mom because I didn't want to shake the boat. I feel the closest to my dad because he is the only parent in my life. My mom is more like the unstable older sister who one minute loves you and the other minute will yell at you for existing in her space.

Anyways, last year my dad sat me down and told me that he's divorcing my mom because he told me that he decided he wants to have a new chance at life, so he's finally decided to divorce my mom now that I am about to graduate and leave for college. My first reaction was shock but I have to admit I was really really happy too. It's not that I don't love my mom, but I just want to see my dad happy and I'm excited he's finally brave enough to do what he always wanted to do. I'm also looking forward to spending more time with just my dad without my mom freaking out and threatening to hurt herself because we didn't include her on something.

Well the news is now out and everyone is coming to me and telling me what a POS my dad is. After hearing it for so long I finally snapped and told someone that I was HAPPY my dad is leaving my mom. Since then the word has gotten out and I am being called an ungrateful child for doing this to my mother. Since my mom was super involved in our school's PTA, all of my teachers now call me names behind my back. They whisper when I'm around and I hear them saying ""oh that's her daughter, you know, that one..."" 

We live in a small town and now there's a huge rumor that my dad was cheating and I was helping him hide it from my mom. There are also rumors that I was the one who convinced my dad to leave. It's gotten outrageous and I am so so sick of it. What can I do now?

-----
tldr: My mom was unstable and verbally abusive growing up. My dad tried his best but now he's finally gotten the guts to leave her. I'm happy for him and happy for myself, too. We live in a small town that loves my mom though and now word is out about how I feel. People are blaming me for the divorce. What can I do?"
"How do you break up with someone when you know they’ll be blind sided by it?


My (M26) girlfriend F(26) share an apartment together however she is not on the lease because I met her after I had my apartment and she moved in with me. 

We’ve been together for about a year and a half. We’ve had our fair share of relationship problems just like any couple, nothing too major though. 

However, I know she is not the girl who I want to spend the rest of my life with, and I don’t have any good reasons to give her besides I know in my heart she’s not the girl for me. 

I’ve been going back and fourth in my mind on how to break things off. I feel as if I’ve been dragging this on for the past few months now, and I don’t  want to lead her on any longer. 

She has told me she can see herself marrying me and I simply can’t reciprocate that. I know when I do it she will be pretty blind sided by it. I don’t think I have given off any signs that I am unhappy. 

I know she has friends and family very close to us that she can definitely turn to until she gets a place of her own so it’s not like I’m kicking her to the curb with nowhere to turn to. 

I just feel awful for continuing being in this relationship all the while I’m pretty much checked out of it. 

I just cannot think of an ideal way to break it off with her, from what I say to her, to the setting I do it in and the timing of it. I just can’t decide because I do love her and she’s a great girl I’m having a really hard time knowing I’m going to break her heart which is why I have putting it off. But I can’t keep this going much longer. 

TL:DR- my girlfriend of a year and a half and I share an apartment and I don’t know how or when to break up with her.

"My [22M] girlfriend [30F] of 2 years stays up at night to match my late sleeping schedule, because she refuses to go to sleep unless I'm in bed with her.


I regularly stay up until 1-2 am. My girlfriend says it's unhealthy, but it's my life and I can make decisions for myself. The problem is that my late sleeping schedule is also her sleeping schedule. If I go to sleep at 2:00 am, then that's the time she also goes to sleep at, even if she has to work at 8:00 am the next morning.

My girlfriend will sit beside me, and watch me do stuff on the computer for hours until I decide to go to sleep. She doesn't say anything while she does this, except sometimes she'll beg me to go to sleep. I've asked her why she can't just go to sleep by herself. My girlfriend says that she feels scared, and doesn't feel safe without me. 

I've tried to compromise by cuddling/sleeping with her for 30 minutes, then getting back on my computer, but when I try to get out of our bed she makes me stay. 

I don't understand why my girlfriend wants me to be in bed with her, or else she can't sleep. It's not like she couldn't sleep without me before I moved in. I'm supposed to be getting alone time at night for myself, but the fact that my girlfriend silently watches me while I'm on my computer annoys me.

tl;dr: My girlfriend won't go to sleep unless I'm in bed with her. She goes to sleep at the same time I go to sleep, even if she has work early in the morning."
"I (27f) really need to divorce my husband (30m) while he is in prison because of some absolutely insane stunts he pulled.


Storybook romance. Girl meets boy, boy is amazing to girl, moves her from her tiny farm town to an amazing city, New Orleans , and they live happily ever after.

Except boy is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, and girl is far too young to have settled down so quickly and taken on a very domestic role.

Boy and girl leave amazing city, and move to Chicago after 5 years together. Things immediately start to fall apart. Girl is exposed to a big city full of diverse people, and hasn't had any sexual relationship with husband in essentially years.

Girl starts working in a bar downtown, starts to get a lot of attention. Has to work 3 jobs to pay for expensive apartment while boy is struggling to find and keep employment. Stress takes its toll.

Girl gets too close to coworker. Que emotional affair that turns into making out after work one night, and a ride home on a motorcycle. Never anything further physically. 

Boy finds out and he's beyond crushed. Starts calling girl a whore, slut, jezebel. Starts saying he never should have brought her to Chicago, and she couldn't handle it. That he should have left her in her small town to rot. 

Girl is beyond sorry, apologizes, offers to quit job, cuts off all contact with co-worker. They patch things up. Except for when boy gets drunk and starts calling her all the nasty names again.

In the midst of all of this, they decide to try an open relationship to see if they can reignite their sex life (I know.... I know). Boy meets wonderful woman, girl approves, they start seeing eachother. Girl is having issues meeting decent guy, dates a couple of douche bags. Boy is not amused, tells girl she can't see other people until she can figure out how to meet decent men. Que the whole damn thing falling apart. Boy goes on and on about how he's falling for woman, and then tells girl that he doesn't feel anything towards her anymore. Girl is crushed.

Boy gets drunk and tells girl to get out. Girl packs shit while he's at work and moves in with friend. Boy seems to accept it.

Girl continues to pay rent at Boys apartment because she loves him, and doesn't want an eviction for either of them. Meanwhile she's couch surfing and working 3 jobs to handle all the financial shit going on. Finally after 3 months, she tells boy she has to get an apartment, and asks if he can handle rent by himself. He claims he can.

They have rare contact, and it's never friendly. Girl takes one of their dogs to live with her.

Several weeks later, girl gets call from apartment. Boy stopped paying rent, trashed apartment, and got evicted. Girl calls boy and he claims apartment is in girls name, so she can go fuck herself. He's an idiot. Both receive eviction. Boy abandons their other dog, and flies back to New Orleans.

Sorry if the boy/girl stuff is annoying. It's just easier to keep it straight that way. 

Present situation: I get a call from the friend my ex is living with in new orleans. He's had a break with reality. Stolen a car, 3 license plates, 2 guns, and a bunch of hollow point ammo and credit cards from roomie. Roomie thinks he's coming for me because I kept one of our dogs.

I get a strange feeling about my family. I call my roommate and let her know what's going on, and to be careful. And then I call my parents that are still in Kansas, because I have a bad feeling he's headed that way. I don't sleep that night. In the morning I get a call, they've caught him. He's taken police on a high speed chase through Oklahoma and Kansas, and he's been caught 30 minutes away from the town my mom lives in (It should be noted he HATES my mother and blames her for everything). 

He's got a 20k bond in kansas, Oklahoma is pressing charges, and he's being extradited back to Louisiana on no bond.

Obviously the next step is to legally divorce him. But, my true struggle right now is.... what in the flying fuck do I do? He's tried to reach out through the jail via email, which I ignored and deleted because I fear for my mental and emotional state if I speak to him.

I carry so much blame, and so much heartache. I feel like I destroyed him. Somewhere in all of this, I also still love him.

I left him a year ago this month. I feel like I should be so much further in my healing process, and I'm not. My fear is I'll never be able to trust again. I'll never be able to care about anyone again. I'm completely shattered and so down I can barely function, but I'm doing it. 2 bartending jobs are the only thing keeping me afloat and social. 

Tl;dr: rough separation, ex husband goes crazy and comes after my family with guns on a 14 hour trip across the country. He's trying to reach out to me now, I think it's my fault he is in the mental state he is in, and I don't know what to do to heal."
"My [28F] husband [30M] left me on our honeymoon, I have seven nights still left and I'm numb, I don't know where to go from here.


I met Artie at college, it was love at first sight. He's gorgeous and funny and we hit it off from the first time we met. He was my third serious bf the others being in high school and I was his first. He is shy and introverted and I'm loud and extroverted but we worked. He balanced me out, I brought him out of his shell.

We got engaged two years ago while in Paris and the last two years spent planning our wedding was fabulous. 

Artie and I rarely argued, we came from homes where both sets of parents screamed and fought. We were good communicators or I thought we were.

The only bone of contention in our lives was his mother. She wasn't happy he was getting married she never liked me even though I tried my hardest to get her too. 

Anyway the wedding despite this went off without a hitch. His mom was actually very nice and actually hugged me. 

That was Saturday, Sunday his parents drive us to the airport and we set off for Hawaii. Sunday-tue night were fantastic. Great sex we went swimming with dolphins. A truly magical honeymoon, until Tuesday night. We are getting ready to go out and I notice he looks like he's going to cry. 

He bursts out into tears and I've never seen him this way ever between sobs he tells me he can't do this. He's made a mistake, he feel like he is suffocating. Calmly we talk things over and he tells me he has felt this way the last two months but he didn't want to hurt me. 

He says that he feels like he never got to experience dating that he isn't sure I'm the one because if I was his mom would like me. 

I'm besides myself at this point in tears and I had to get air so I left to take a walk. He tells me he's sorry then backtracks and says let's finish the honeymoon maybe we can get counseling. 

So I go for my walk and I'm sitting by the ocean crying my eyes out. After thirty minutes I come back to the room and his stuff is gone. He left his ring and the stack of cash from our wedding we took as spending money. I call his cell phone..no answer. 

I try calling his parents house and no answer. 

Finally I curl up and cry myself to sleep. 

The next morning I have a long text message from him. He wants a divorce, I can keep our puppy, he will move out of the house we bought. He then said he wishes me good luck but it's best if we do not communicate further. 

I go to the front desk and start bawling to the front desk lady. She is very helpful she gets me out of the honeymoon suite and gets me a regular room until I decide what I'm going to do.

I call my folks and my mom already knew, his mom is bragging on Facebook that her son ""dodged a bullet"" my sister my best friend in the world is headed here tomorrow and will be staying with me
I've decided to stay the rest of the trip. To get my head on straight to make some semblance of this. 

The man I loved with all my being ripped out my heart. 
I don't know where I go from here 

TL;DR:  my husband broke up with me on our honeymoon because his mom hated me among other things. I don't know what to do and I just need reddits advice. "
"UPDATE - I (F 23) think I am being sabotaged by a woman (F 30) who I work with? Am I being paranoid or does this sound like she's messing with me?


I said I would post an update, so here I am.  Original post here - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/87n2sr/i_f_23_think_i_am_being_sabotaged_by_a_woman_f_30/




I took all of your advice very seriously. I had planned on just casually bringing things up randomly to professor as you guys suggested. Anyways, I went to lab the next morning (Wednesday) at about 7:30 am (early for me I usually go in at 9:00). I planned on collecting RNA from my plants before they bloomed for the day. When I got up to the greenhouse, I found that my bushes had been hacked back and there were barely any buds. There wasn't enough tissue to collect my RNA, which is part of a project I want to have done by my next committee meeting. I freaked out, partially because it was 7:30 am, partially because I was extremely stressed at the time (had a big presentation the next day). Went down to the lab and cried in my office. Professor comes in around 8:40 or whatever.  I just decided that I needed to tell him or else I was gonna give up.  




So I asked professor if we could talk. I sat in his office, started crying, and told him that I think Jane hates me, and of course, he was like ""no you're just really different she doesn't hate you."" So I tell him all of my suspensions, I tell him that I'm so depressed over the entire situation I am considering dropping out and that I just cannot handle coming to lab anymore because of the entire thing. He cries, he tells me that it would be ridiculous to drop out over this, that he wished I had come to him sooner, if anything she is just jealous because I am the best grad student in the lab, and then tells me he wants me to switch to a Ph.D. (not to brag, but I wanted to add this as I  thought it was  funny to bring up this conversation while I am having a nervous break down). Then we go into the lab and he looks at the thermocycler and tells me that it does look like someone switched it off, but ""maybe someone did it by accident"".  He tells me that he'll talk with Ned and Jane in private so that neither of them thinks I am accusing either of them. 




I was so grateful that professor trusted me and felt like he needed to help. On Friday professor comes up to me and tells me that Jane wants to talk with me about everything. I got so nervous, I felt like I was going to vomit, so I went home early that day. 




On Sunday, my boyfriend and I had some friends (let's call them M, E, and K) over to study. All of these people are friends with Ned, Jane, and I. M and Ned live together, and I know ned tells her everything. I asked M if Ned had told her anything about what had happened. (So dumb of me to ask but I was drunk, and I am dumb) M tells me that she feels bad about the entire thing but that she wants to hear my side because she has only heard Janes side. So I tell her everything. M tells me that Jane has been going around telling everyone about how she's ""confused that I am accusing her of these things"", that she ""doesn't know what I am talking about"" and that she ""thinks I hate her"".  M tells me that Jane has talked to her about this twice since Friday. M is really nice and tells me I just need to talk it out with Jane and that she would supervise the talk if I wanted. Around this time E hears what were talking about and starts aggressively telling me that i am basically a liar and that there is no reason for jane to do any of those things to me. 





So, I freak out. In the morning I call the school's department of harassment. At like 830 in the morning I go in and talk with the dean. The dean told me the best thing - You cannot control what people think of you, just the conversations you have with them. I am taking that to heart, if any of the other grad students want to think I am crazy, so be it.  Then she makes me tell my story to another department.  They say they will start investigating her and they're gonna talk to professor about it. I avoid lab. I skip Monday, claiming to be sick. I come in Tuesday when Jane is in class. I get away with leaving early that day to avoid her. Wednesday I have accepted that I need to start going to lab. I go to lab, lucky me Jane is ""studying for a test"". Thursday she just avoids me while in lab. 




Basically that is all that has happened. I haven't heard back from the school. I am not sure what happened, if things are still happening, or what. Jane avoids talking to me unless its work related. Professor bought new pipette parts and recalibrated them all, so now we all have functional pipettes. I haven't had anyone bring it back up. Ned acts completely normal around me, my first day back he seemed a little weird, but after that, we're back to playing video games with each other.  Professor seems to be happy that we're all calm. He told me he is glad that I told him what was going on because I should feel comfortable in the lab. 




If anything major happens, I guess I can let you all know. I am not sure if anything more will happen. I assume she won't mess with my stuff now that Professor and the school have been informed about her actions.




TL;DR - Told Professor about the woman who was harassing me. He talked with her. She told everyone that I am a liar. I told the school on her. Now she avoids me. Everything is okay now, I guess?"
"My [17F] parents caught me with boyfriend, now our family life is going downhill


BACKGROUND : I am from a very strict Asian household that believe in keeping one's virginity until marriage. I am also an only child.


CONTEXT:
Last Monday (April 9) I went out with my guy friends until 12AM which is 2 hours past my curfew, and my parents saw me kiss my boyfriend when he dropped me off. I didn't pick up the phone when my dad called me, I regret that so much. My parents were waiting outside of the porch for me and they were devastated - their view of the perfect and innocent daughter was shattered. My dad told me that he felt betrayed and hurt. He said I don’t have any redeeming qualities or personality traits that would make him respect me as a person; he only loves me because I’m his daughter. 


I really regret disappointing my dad and I wish I can turn back time, because they will never trust me nor see me the same way again. My parents are very strict about having no boyfriend until after 4 years of college. I feel so sorry and I wish they could trust me again. My life was going very smoothly until I did that - I got accepted into my dream college (UC Davis), I just got my driver’s license, my parents spoiled me and got me a new phone, they were very proud and lenient on me for the first time, and my social and school life was great. I took advantage of my parents’ trust and lied to them whenever I went out with my friends and boyfriend late at night (this has been going on for 1 month). I broke up with my boyfriend recently because I will always choose my parents above all. I really wanted to have a smooth senior life but I messed everything up. 


My parents are now super protective of me and I feel very trapped. I wish I could stay at school longer because I hate going home. My mom waits 30 minutes on campus before my class ends to pick me up right away, this is to prevent me from talking to friends. My parents don’t even let me talk to my girl friends at all, and they took away my driving and going out privileges. They doubt everything I say now. 


Also, my mom says very hurtful things to me, and I feel worthless and hollow - all of my past accomplishments are now unacknowledged because of one mistake. I try not to talk back and avoid having any connection with my mom at all when I am home, but my one mistake is all she talks about. I understand that my parents are doing this out of love and just want the best for me. However, I constantly feel miserable and exhausted. I don’t have the emotional energy to be able to withstand this any longer. I just want my parents to trust me again and be proud of me. 






UPDATE :
My mom and dad are a team, but my dad is the good cop and my mom is the bad cop. I'm feeling a little better than a week ago because my mom doesn't yell at me or bring up the boyfriend situation anymore when I get home, but now she treats me like an unwanted stranger. I feel like we cut ties with each other, she doesn't talk to me unless she's ordering me to do chores (I never talk back and always do what she says.) She is so cold to me but it's better than her berating me. 


I understand what they're feeling right now - they're in shock because it's unexpected that their little girl turned out to be rebellious, and they have every right to be upset. I know I was stupid and I caused a lot of emotional pain for my parents, and I constantly wish for things to go back to normal. I always pray that when I wake up, this will all be just a dream and my life will be happy again. But I can't help but feel miserable and cry because I know this is my reality. If only I were more careful and I listened to my parents :(.


However, I don't think they WANT to understand my side of the situation. This is really affecting my mental health, and I don't think they care about happiness at all. I feel like they don't even know me. I'd be so much happier if I were able to just go out with whoever and whenever (just like before), without having to constantly stress about my parents watching me or that SPECIFIC 2PM curfew (right after school.) I want to show my parents that I understand them now, and that I can go home at the curfew they delegated for me. I feel emotionless at school and home because I constantly have to stress about ""when will have their trust back?"" 


I don't get why they're compromising both my happiness and theirs by making themselves stress more, I'm already 17 and this is expected to happen. I'm not doing anything ""wrong"", I'm taking 4 AP classes and I have all A's. I got accepted into 5 UC's, and I'm going to the one my dad decided for me instead of arguing back. They think I am going to get pregnant or cloud my mindset with thoughts of boys before going to college. I am not that irresponsible, and I know that my high school relationships (both romantic and nonromantic) are going to be temporary.

I'm really close to rebelling against my parents but I know they're going to disown me. I also know that even though time will heal the wounds, they will never completely heal and they'll be bruised. So my parents will never fully have faith in me again - knowing this makes me stress out even more. I have the option of moving out but I choose my parents. I choose to live with exaggerated restrictions and poor mental health, in exchange for a place to live, food, bills paid, electronics, car, and my college paid.




Can you give me any advice as to how I can earn my parents trust and respect back? Also, can you reassure me things are going to get better (both relationship and restrictions wise.) TY!!!

TL;DR  -  Mom used to shame and yell at me, but now cut ties with me. Parents treat me like I'm 12 years old again and took many privileges away. My mental health is declining by the day, they don't care. 


EDIT : Thank you so much for your thorough replies, I've reread them about 4 times each because they give me some hope and reassurance, plus they calm me down. :)
It's difficult to try to talk about this to my parents, I've tried several times, but both language barrier and their one-track mindset makes it hard to get through to them.

"Girl (18F) I (35M) was seeing told me she was 26. A few of my associates and friends found out before I did, and they spread on facebook that I am a predator and now the facebook posts have gone viral. I am terrified and am not sure what to do.


Disclaimer: A 35 year old knowingly dating an 18 year old is weird. Nowhere will I say that is not. Nor am I trying to imply women commonly lie about these things or anything like that. 

Met a girl at an art gallery, we kicked it off right away. The art gallery was 21 plus, so I assumed she was old, but when I asked her she said she had graduated college. She looked old, and more importantly the two people she was with were definitely older looking, so I just assumed she was maybe mid 20s. We went out for drinks at her apartment, didn't have sex, then the next time we met up we went out to eat and then had sex afterwards. We sort of went on and off dating a bit, I had zero suspicions that she was younger at all, she looked much older, and she told me at one point that she was 26 years old when I asked. I invited her out to drinks one night with my friends and we all went. 

So apparently, when they were all at the bar, a bartender asked for her ID. I wasn't there, but three of my friends were, the bartender told her she had a fake ID. So she asked me friends if they could buy her a drink, and they asked her how old she really was, and she said 18. My friends, who were scared she might have been even younger, asked for her real ID, and apparently it did say 18 on it. But at that point it was too late, and the bartender asked her to leave. She was really drunk, we had pregamed at her apartment, and I think she had other peoples liquor too. 

Anyways, I had left and brought her home at that point. The next day I start hearing from my friends that I should have told them she was 18 years old, and a few people were saying how unbelievably creepy this was. I have a group chat with 20 people in it, so obviously news spread very fast. A handful of people took this... really badly. Started calling me a predator. I just woke up to a flurry of messages between my friends, some defending me and some saying I totally knew and that I was fucked up for dating a 18 year old. I just asked what the fuck was going on, and suddenly, I was kicked out of the group chat. A few friends told me what happened, and what happened at the bar and such and that she was really 18. I told them that was ridiculous, and she was 26, and they said nope, no way, she got caught using a fake ID. The people who messaged me were defending me, saying that she looked very old, a few other people on the group chat, not so much. They thought I knew she was 18, and my 'act' of acting like I didn't know was a lie. 

The thing is, I work in a sort of public position. I am the guitarist in a popular band in brooklyn, we perform at venues all over. So when this blew up, it blew up pretty big. Or semi-big. A few girls wrote a status about how creepy it was that 'insert my name here', the guitarist of 'insert my band here' was sleeping with an 18 year old in his mid 30s. The status got big, like, 85 shares and counting, with 100+ comment chains arguing over this. A few girls shared statuses saying to 'watch out' because I am a predator and that I shouldn't be near young girls, and that I am some kind of example of why the music scene in nyc is so messed up etc. 

This has all transpired in 3 days. I sent a LONG text to the 18 year old saying this was really fucked up what she did, and that she is a horrible person, and that she should admit that she lied to me. A girl who used to text back right away hasn't responded in 3 days. No facebook, no instagram, no way of really contacting her that I know of. I decided to go to her apartment, her roommate answered, and said she had no idea where she was. 

I honestly feel like fucking breaking down right now. I can't even LOOK at my phone. I don't even want to think about how much this is blowing up. I have been xanaxed up for 3 days just to get rid of the ridiculous stress this has caused. This is like... the worst nightmare that can possibly happen to me. I honestly feel like leaving the city forever and moving back in with my parents, or becoming a hermit or something. This will never leave me. I am actually petrified of going back to my job, and they fire me for this, or my band just messages me one day and tells me I cant be on anymore. 

What the fuck am I supposed to do? 

Edit: I should point out that the people on the group chat are half friends, and half acquaintances. The group chat is sort of a group chat where we discuss the music scene in brooklyn and get each other shows at venues and stuff, there's quite a few people in there who are not my friends, but just people I sort of know through the scene. 

TL;DR - - Dated an 18 year old, she said she was 26. Friends found out, a few posted to FB calling me a predator. Now the facebook statuses are blowing up and going viral and everyone thinks I am a predator. "
"Me [28M] with my fiance [26F] of 7 years. She's on a ""solo"" trip and I can't find any evidence she paid for a hotel or plane ticket. Now her crossfit ""partner"" is also gone but no one knows where. Any possibility they aren't together?


edit: not sure how to flair, this I think i'm using relationships because infidelity is not confirmed. 

Throwaway because this has the capability to be very, very embarrassing. I will try to make this as non-meandering as possible but it goes back about 1.5 years. 

At that time my fiancé had been together about 5 years and we were both extremely overweight. We were both pretty big on the ""HAES"" bandwagon and full on believed that weight loss was not possible, calories didn't matter, etc... I would say we were happy together but navigating the outside world was hellish. My wife went to a new doctor who advised her that she needed to cut weight, at that time we used to carry around these little cards put out by a well known fat activist that we'd present to medical professionals stating the ""science"" behind HAES and how we deserved respect as fat people. This doctor crumpled it up, threw it away and said that my fiancé had a choice to either keep with the bullshit and be in constant pain until she dies, or get serious and lose weight. 

She started crossfit and a calorie reduced diet that very day. I did my absolute best to convince her of all the things we ""knew"" about weight loss but she worked really hard and lost almost 50lbs in the first six months. She pretty much convinced me that all the crap we believed in had been BS and she really wanted me to start eating right and working out with her. Even though she opened my eyes to the reality, I think I'm a pretty severe food addict and kept telling myself and her ""I'll start tomorrow I promise"" but tomorrow never really came. 

So a year into this, my fiancé had lost pretty close to 120lbs and for the first time since she was in middle school she weighed under 150 and she looked phenomenal, she also was doing better at work (she claims that she had much better mental clarity since she wasn't on sugar highs/lows all day, but I do think her improved looks helped her stand out). I'd actually gained 20lbs over the course of the year and sunk further into depression and food addiction. 

So maybe 1 year and 3 months into her weight loss, she started hanging out with this guy from her crossfit gym, I'll call Dr Bob. Dr Bob is medical doctor who is probably late 30s, in crazy good shape. Dr Bob started picking my fiancé up every morning at 6AM for their morning crossfit and she'd come back to our apartment every morning with Starbucks that Dr Bob had bought for her. She started hanging with Crossfit friends on the weekends and more often than not, Dr Bob would be the one to drop her off. 

I told her I was very uncomfortable with her spending so much time with Dr Bob. At first she was angry that I was controlling. I told her I wasn't asking her to do anything, but just relaying my feelings. We had a tense couple of days over this but in the end she came to me and said she was sorry, she promised nothing was going on between she and Dr Bob but she also said she had to admit that she would be terribly uncomfortable if I had a female friend that I was spending so much time with. 

At this point, I started going to food addiction treatment and although it's fits and starts, it's going well. However about 6 weeks ago my fiancé revealed to me that she was losing attraction for me. She said she needed some time and she was going to take a two week trip to a resort in Jamiaca to ""clear her head."" I said that was fine and I encouraged her to do so. 

I need to say here that both me and my fiancé have terrible credit, but I was able to get a card and put her on as an authorized user. To build up our credit we put litteraly every expense on this card and then pay it off every month. A not intentional side effect of this is I get to see what she spends her money on. I told her very clearly that she could put the trip on this card since she had savings to pay the balance. She agreed.  The first big red mark on this trip is that there has never been a single thing regarding this trip to show up on our statements or online activity. In my head i figured that maybe she'd taken cash out of her savings and paid for the ticket in person and maybe she'd just used my card for a hold on the hotel and she planned on paying cash when she got there. It made the most sense at the time. 

Well she left Saturday. I had been planning that when she was gone, I would start cross fit to go with my food addiction treatment. I went on Sunday to her gym. People knew who I was and were very friendly. I had expected to see Dr Bob there since I knew he always went on Sundays, I had to really get myself together because I wasn't sure how it would go. I planned on presenting myself as a ""friend of you friend"" and I would like to get to know you---no confrontation whatsoever. So after I flailed through the workout, I asked one person I sort of knew ""hey doesn't Dr Bob usually come on Sundays?"" She told me that yes, he was always there but that Dr Bob is on a ""secret"" vacation and it's the talk of the gym because no one really knew where he was going. My heart sunk and I sort of said ""is it Jamaica?"" she sort of chuckled ""no, he said very specifically he wasn't going to Jamaica, but did your fiancé get there? I know she was heading out?"" This didn't do much to help my fears. I don't think anyone at the gym knew what was going on or were keeping anything form me. But this is strike 2. 

So I obviously think she and Dr Bob are together. So i'll get to strike 3. Ever since starting cross fit my fiancé has been crazy documenting her weight loss on Instagram. And as she's lost weight she's posted more and more. She posts from the gym, she posts from her drive to work, she posts before after pictures, she posts stories multiple times a day. I expected of all the times to keep her Instagram updated, her trip to Jamaica would be ideal. It's been utterly silent and the last post was when she was curling her hair to get ready for the uber to take her to the airport. 

So I'm almost sure I know what's going on, Dr Bob paid for this trip and they are together. The utter lack of charges for the trip, Dr Bob being gone on a ""mystery"" vacation and the radio silence on Instagram are way too much to be coincidences. 

I've tried to call my fiancé and she answered and said she was having a great time so far and she was excited to hear from me and nothing in her voice indicated that she was hiding anything but again...there are just too many things stacked against this. 

I have no idea what to do. We are 2 days into a 14 day trip and I don't want to ruin her ""solo"" trip by accusing her of cheating on the chance that everything is on the up and up, but at the same time, my heart is breaking, I can't sleep, I'm just a wreck because I am 90% sure they are together. 

What can I do?

tl;dr: my fiancé is supposedly on a solo trip to Jamaica. There are three huge things that make me think she's with her friend from crossfit, 1. there's no evidence she paid for trip 2. her crossfit friend is on a ""mystery"" vacation and didn't tell anyone where. 3. her Instagram has gone from 5 posts a day to complete silence. What can I do?

"Found disturbing post on my (27F) boyfriend’s (27M) reddit profile


As the title says, I found my boyfriend’s reddit account yesterday. When I came across his profile I found a post he had made 3 hours before I found it, where he was asking for advice on how to initiate sex with an acquaintance of his. He mentioned how they had been trying to make plans for drinks but it didn’t pan out due to “scheduling” but that she had suggested lunch. He said in his post that that was too “friendsy” and he preferred drinks for a “potential lay”. Someone responded with some advice along the lines of - “lunch is fine but steer the conversation into territory of next time we see each other we’re gonna have sex” - to which he responded “I can hack that. Thanks.” 

We’ve been together for almost 4 years, living together for 2. I am so devastated. I confronted him about it and all he said was: nothing happened yet, nothing has even happened, blah blah blah. I broke up with him. Did I do the right thing?

**TL;DR** I found my bf’s reddit account and saw a post insinuating that he is planning to cheat on me. "
"I [F21] want to wait 6 months before I have sex with someone I date, my friend [M25] calls me crazy and says I will never find a boyfriend. Do I need to change my stance?


I’m inexperienced and have only been in one relationship that ended a year ago. Also the first time I’ve been in love and not just a silly crush or something. 

I waited 3 months before I had sex with my ex. Three months later he didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. I felt taken advantage of, like he was just waiting to have sex and then get out. So in order to not have this happen again I’ve decided not to have sex with people I date until it’s been at least 6 months and I feel comfortable knowing they like me as I am. 

I brought this up in conversation and my friend says I’m doomed and that no guy will put up with waiting 6 months. Is this true? I feel so out of place when it comes to todays dating etiquette, I don’t get why you are expected to have sex after 2 dates when you barely know the person?

I’m not religious (in fact I’m atheist) and I like sex. I just can’t accept a guy having sex with me and then be disinterested, I don’t know what’s wrong with me? Other girls can accept this but it pains me so much I hate it.

Is my friend correct? Will I suffer from finding a boyfriend because I’m abstaining sex for 6 months?

Tldr: I want to wait 6 months before sex with my data. Friend [M] says it won’t work and I will never find a guy that will accept waiting that long. "
"My [32F] good friend [34M] took care of me when I was deathly sick, and now I'm ashamed to be around him.


For the sake of this story I'm going to call my friend Mulder, because our relationship began as work partners where we also became very close friends. We have known each other for almost a decade, and our friendship has stayed strong through many failed relationships and other strifes. 

About a month ago I fell down with the worst stomach flu I have ever had. Projectile from both ends kind of bad. I could barely move and was basically confined to my bathroom.

I tried to downplay how sick I was to Mulder, but when he came around to drop off some soup he saw how sick I was and immediately came to my aid. He held my hair as I puked, washed the dried chunks out of my hair and carried me to bed. I was already so embarrassed he had to see me like this - until the force of my vomiting caused me to simultaneously soil my pants. Mulder didn't hesitate to clean me up, joking about things along the way, but I was too ashamed to pay attention. He even changed my sheets for me. 

Throughout the whole ordeal he stayed and slept on the couch. He was at my beck and call and didn't complain once. He was an incredible friend to me and I couldn't have asked for anyone else. But, now that I've recovered and feel better, I can't help but feel so damn embarrassed to be around him. I'm afraid I can't look at him without seeing him wiping my own ass for me. He doesn't act any different towards be, but I am so incredibly worried that he does.

Is there something I could do to get over it? Would any guy in this situation look at a girl differently after being face-to-face with many of her bodily fluids?

TL;DR: I was disgustingly sick and my best friend took the best care of me. I'm worried he is going to see me differently and can't get past embarrassment. "
"I (29f) had such a bad experience with my future inlaws (M/F 50s) that I am thinking of calling off the wedding with (M30) Advice please?


My fiance and I have been dating just over a year. He proposed to me on our 1 year anniversary. We decided we would be engaged for about a year and then start planning the actual wedding which would take place in 2020. We moved in together recently. 

I have only met his parents a few times on holidays and cook out type parties with many people. This past weekend he needed to drop off something at his parent's and asked me to come along for the ride and said we could go catch a movie. 

I was invited in and what was supposed to be a 15 minute errand turned into 4 of the most uncomfortable hours of my life. full of me trying to keep it together while smiling and being friendly. 

Highlights of the evening -

I mentioned something about still unpacking my fiances things in passing. His mother picked up on it and zeroed in. Turns out my fiance did not mention to his mother that we moved in together OR that he had proposed. I swear that woman gave me the dirtiest look when she looked at the ring. She then began to aggressively question me, while my fiance just sat there. She asked about personal things that I am not comfortable discussing with people I am not very very close to  - religious beliefs, finances, personal health etc. She then declared that we have been moving too fast and our relationship has been too up and down (It hasn't, but because I didn't go to their Christmas event she assumed it was because fiance and I were on and off. Truth is that I hadn't been extended an invite, neither formal or casual and made other plans. I guess it was a misunderstanding - they are a family that invites are implied.). Ok. I was diplomatic and answered the best I could. I was a bit mortified but did my best. 

Things got really bad when my fiances father came along. He was belligerently drunk. He wanted to give me a hug, but I wasn't getting up from my chair fast enough so he grabbed my arm and literally pulled me to my feet. It was forceful enough to make it hurt. Then he stood in my personal space (close enough his stomach was actually pressing into me) and went on a tirade about another family member which included a lot of sexist remarks. 

FFIL yelled at me and ordered me around quite a bit. Stuff like going to get him a drink .

FFIL could not remember my name. So he deferred to calling me sexist and infantalizing pet names (that i don't even let my fiance call me!)

FFIL was incredibly disrespectful of FMIL. Telling her to be quiet and what not. They were supposed to be going to a formal party that evening (we were there to drop off a suit jacket for FFIL). FMIL was ready and FFIL wanted to be late on purpose to make a point because he had gotten into a disagreement with the host. 

FFIL made many inappropriate and raunchy jokes to me and at my expense. Sex jokes and jokes about my race.

Then FFIL decided I needed to know all the dirty details of when he last took my fiance to a strip club. I learned things I NEVER wanted to know. He then continued on and said that he was going to take my fiance out to one again and buy him an hour in the VIP room. 

This was the worst of the night for me. Strip clubs are a HARD boundary in our relationship. My fiance and I agreed to that before we even became official. I feel a bit deceived because when we had that boundary discussion fiance had told me he had only been to a strip club once before and that he didn't like it at all, that he was ""forced"" to go by his friends, and it turned out this was untrue (Fiance claims he ""forgot"" about the time he went with his dad)

FFIL made these ""plans"" with fiance in front of myself, FMIL, and several neighbors who had stopped by. I felt so incredibly disrespected and embarrassed. My fiance didn't say anything. Didn't say he didn't want to go or that he thought this conversation was inappropriate. Nothing.

I did communicate with fiance several times during the evening that I was very uncomfortable, he tried to say his good byes but FFIL or FMIL would say something about why are you leaving so soon or come up with something he needed to do before we left (fix their computer, try on clothes, etc)

By the time we left I was emotionally exhausted and had a lot to process. I told fiance this. He kept trying to get me to talk about it and then got pissy with me because I wouldn't talk to him about it right away. He started driving more aggressively which really bothers me (this is something we have talked about before as well). 

When we did have a conversation about it later, it did not go well. Ended up being one of the worst fights of our relationship. He kept excusing everyone's behavior or saying that he didn't see or hear some of the stuff, said that he wasn't going to go to a strip club with his dad so it shouldn't matter that he didn't say he wasn't going to go, he couldn't give me a straight answer. 

I am still going through a bunch of emotions about this. Flash backs of my being scared little girl with an alcoholic father. I am SO PISSED at myself for prioritizing keeping the peace and trying to make a good impression. I should have spoken up and said that this was making me uncomfortable and just walked out the door. I am so mad I didn't stand up for myself.

I honestly just don't see my fiance the same way anymore. He's too passive to protect or stand up for me and our relationship. I can't get the image of him drooling over a stripper out of my head. My trust in him has been cracked. 

Also... I don't want a relationship with his parents, well atleast not his dad at this point. How would that even work post marriage? It wouldn't. 

Fiance asked me what I wanted him to say or do to make things better. I don't have an answer to that. 

I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR - Spent an evening with my FILs. FFIL yelled at me and grabbed me. He wanted to make plans to take my fiance to strip club for private dances. Fiance didn't say anything to the contrary.

EDIT: From the first few responses I have gotten I think it is important to add something here about my fiance. He is a very passive type of person and has dealt with anxiety and depression much of his life.

Also FFIL is technically his stepdad (I let it go as FFIL as that is pretty much the role he fills in our life)

Even if fiance couldn't speak up because of his anxiety, it still doesn't really change my feels on the matter though.

"How do I [21F] tell my boyfriend [23M] that this ""kawaii"" cute stuff is getting out of hand?


So my boyfriend is this big burly muscly dude who has an awesome sense of humor. Around everyone else, he is charming, hilarious, smart and so fun to be around. However, around me, a lot of the time he acts super dinky and it's cute except now it's going overboard. For example, I'm a pretty small girl and he thinks it's super cute but then he treats it like everything I do is cute. For example if I trip and fall, it's cute because ""I'm small"" or if I run and run out of breath, he goes like ""AWWWW YOU""RE TURNING PINK"". I like cute things, but its gotten to the point where we basically don't talk about anything but cute, childish dinky stuff and it's seriously starting to get to me for some reason?? For example, he won't stop showering me with soft plushies even though I told him I don't want any more because theyre really cute but I literally don't have any more room for new ones. If I ""neglect"" them and don't ""give them attention"", he'll say stuff like ""ohhh you hate them and now theyre gonna get small and kill themselves"" which gets REALLY REALLY tiring after a while. Every night when we skype, we don't talk about a lot of things that have substance for the most part because it's basically just us playing with the soft plushies even though I'm over it... I'll always have to give them kisses or hug them or whatever and it just feels ridiculous.

I feel like this affected our sex life as well. I can never get us to have ""hot and steamy"" sex, it always just turns REALLY goofy and silly and just straight up childish... I hate it. I can't even remember the last time I had an orgasm to be completely honest....

I like it most when we are hanging out with a group of people because then we talk like normal adults for the most part and have nice jokes, do fun things etc.

How do I bring it up? Last time I said ""I don't want to keep kissing them like theyre kids"" and my boyfriend was like ""oh you don't have to. I'll just never buy you any again. You know what why don't you just toss them out i don't mind"" in this grumpy mood and he will just keep saying shit that will make me feel bad.

"My [15 f] art teacher [40s F] told my mom [43 F] that I look autistic and like a robot. My mom is stressed and mad at me for it.


My art teacher at my school is really strict and rude to her students. 

My mom is a teacher at my school also, but she teaches a younger grade so i don't see her there much. She knows a lot of my teachers. 

I am usually sleepy in art class, its early in the morning. So I guess I might not look like I am paying attention all the time. I also don't have friends in the class, so I don't talk much. A lot of the class is always talking. 

Last week in class we were watching a video and I was looking at it but my teacher still got mad at me for watching with a ""blank dead stare"" and made fun of me for being ""creepy""

I said that I didn't understand, I was watching the video, and she got mad at me for talking back. 

That night my mom got mad at me because the art teacher told her that I looked autistic and ""like a robot"" and that I had to behave in class. My mom said i was  making her look bad, and she really needed this job because my dad lost his job. 

I think I need to talk to my art teacher and ask her to not involve my mom in her drama. I am worried how stressed my mom is about keeping her job at my school, and I think my art teacher is making it worse. 

How should I do this? I was thinking I could talk to my teacher before class and say that it is unkind to insult me and make my mom stressed when I didn't even do anything wrong. All I was doing was apparently looking at her wrong and looking at the video funny.

Tldr - my art teacher told my mom who is also a teacher that I look robotic and autistic and my mom is stressed and mad about it

"My [24F] in-laws [60MF] feel very offended about our recent wedding, and clearly dislike me. They are coming over to express their grievances tomorrow. How should I handle myself during this confrontation?


I married my husband, Lucas (28M), last Saturday. We have been happily together for three years. Lucas and I come from very different families. I am from a large and rowdy, Irish-Catholic family. Lucas is from a small and insular, devout-Christian family. Lucas’ mom in particular has always been very controlling. Growing up, she was very strict about the friends Lucas may see. He was rarely allowed to spend the night at others’ houses or go out after dark— even in late high school. His family have very few friends, as they prefer to keep to themselves. This was always very difficult for Lucas, who is a budding extrovert. It wasn’t until college that Lucas finally felt more like himself. 

When Lucas and I started dating, my family embraced him as one of their own. This is a very cliché saying, but they wanted to “gain a son, not lose a daughter.” I am really so happy that they have accepted Lucas as family. It has helped me feel closer to them after many years of tension. Lucas has especially taken a liking to my mother, who is a very direct and quirky person. Unlike his family, who hide their feelings at all costs, my family is very outspoken about their feelings/thoughts. Sometimes we get into some intense arguments, but at least we all know where we stand with each other. Lucas has told me many times that this is very refreshing for him. 

I am a very friendly, inquisitive, and passionate person. I am authentic in everything I do and say, even when it gets me in trouble sometimes. Just like my mother, I can be quite direct. I always *respectfully* let people know how I feel about them or about our relationship. You will never be in the dark about what I think of you. As a result, I make friends with older adults very easily. I have gotten along fantastically with all of my exes parents, and would even call some of them close friends/mentors. I love developing relationships with everyone I meet, and I love having heart-to-heart conversations about thought-provoking topics. 

Lucas’ family clearly does not like this about me. They are extremely resistant to talking about any topic other than a) how cute Lucas was as a child or b) how adorable Lucas’ Bichon frise is. Whenever I try to bring up a new topic, they give me blank stares— as if I just horribly offended them. But you know, their home, their rules of conversation... so I have played along for years. 

There have been several times where I had to draw clear boundaries with Lucas’ mom. In our first year of dating, Lucas and I got into a huge argument. His mom found out about it, and she left me a voicemail begging that I be “nicer” to her son and that I just need to apologize to him. I asserted that the way Lucas and I handle disagreements is our business and our business alone. That we are both adults and it is up to us to resolve arguments. She was extremely upset over my message and told Lucas that I made her cry.

A couple of times, she has tried to use me as a way to guilt Lucas into spending more time with her. She would come to me and tell me that her son is so rude to not write a more detailed note in his birthday card to her, and she wanted me to get him to write a new one. I told her that Lucas is a grown man and she will have to take that issue up with him to his face. Lucas and I are equals, and it isn’t my job to tell him what to do. She also did not like that.

Anyway, I can go on and on about how his family consistently makes me feel like crap. They seem upset and offended anytime we hang with my family (which is less often than we spend time with his family). Lucas’ mom seems really jealous of the time I spend with Lucas. Every time we embark on a new transition: moving in together, getting an apartment to ourselves across the city, getting engaged, etc... they are less than thrilled. Also, I just field a million passive aggressive comments about me being too “progressive” (simply because I spoke passionately about reproductive rights and mental health rights), and how “no offense” but I’m an idealist (and your point is?). For the sake of not alienating my partner from his family, I have kept my mouth shut all of these years (despite my usual MO).

But honestly, I am at my breaking point. Lucas’ family essentially had nothing to do with our wedding. Yes, they did contribute money towards our rehearsal dinner— but they wanted nothing to do with the planning. We tried to include them in all kinds of ways: decoration, toasts, music selection, gift bag design, anything... and we were met with silence. My parents worked their asses off to help make our wedding as special and authentic as possible. For weeks, we did yard work, we made a ton of clever DIY gift bags, we strung up lights, we discussed the schedule of events. It was not the wedding my parents would chose, but they got over themselves and gave us the time and support for what we wanted. 

The wedding finally came, and it was a great success! Many of our guests told us it was the best wedding that they have ever been to. A lot of compliments how it really reflected Lucas and I as a couple. I was so happy and relieved that we pulled it off. Lucas’ family didn’t once speak to me during the wedding. His family sat in a corner the entire time and didn’t speak to anyone from my family. I tried coming over to talk to them, but they didn’t really respond so I left them alone. They ended up leaving fairly early.  After the wedding, Lucas was raving about how all of my aunts/uncles/cousins/friends were coming up to him and telling him how happy that he was in our family now and how they are so happy he is my partner. That’s great! I, however, felt really hurt that his family couldn’t extend even a “welcome” to me. 

So, now it’s been a week since the wedding and all hell broke loose this morning. Lucas’ parents called him at work to say how offended they were by our conduct at the wedding. They said that they didn’t feel at all included in the plans (?!!!) and that my parents sat in “their” seats at the ceremony (there were no assigned sides or seats). They were upset that we didn’t make a bigger deal in thanking them for paying for the rehearsal dinner. And then they hounded Lucas about a bunch of super petty things. 

I handmade fortune cookies for the gift bags. The fortune cookies all contained very silly, very light-hearted fortunes. Lucas’ mother happened to get a fortune that read “Down with the patriarchy!” And she was upset and offended because “Lucas’s father is a patriarch and that is disrespectful to him.” What do I even say to something like that? 

Now they want to come over tomorrow to discuss our recent “offenses.” Lucas and I decided that we are going to make this a come-to-Jesus talk about their true feeling on me and our relationship. I feel very anxious because I want to scream at them and tell them to go f**k themselves. I feel like, no matter how nice I try to be, they always find a reason to be upset with me over. I don’t want to alienate my husband from his parents, but I’m also so insanely done with those people. How should I compose myself? I want to be true to myself, but I also don’t want to make things worse for my partner. 

TLDR; My in-laws clearly dislike me and find any reason to be offended by me. They are coming over tomorrow to confront us. How should I handle myself? Should I lay it on them? Should I just shut my trap and let my husband do the talking? Help, please!"
"I [20f] feel i have ruined my uncles [49m] life. How do i handle the guilt and become better and tell him how much i appreciate him


So to start off with I'll call my uncle Victor.

I've been sorta close to victor all my life. When i was a kid my dad would bring me over to his mother's  (my grandmother) house. Victor lived with her and we got on quite well whenever we'd talk.

My father was murdered when I was 12. My uncle and grandmother said I was always welcome and I started going to theirs every weekend. Victor and I became especially close. I'd call him roughly 5x a week and we'd sometimes talk for hours. For Christmas he bought me a ps3 and we'd play games together. I told him everything. I attempted suicide at 13, I held a man as he died at 13 and suffered other traumatic experiences as a child.
I literally told Victor everything that went on, including how horrible my mother was at times. He was the only one who believed me. I was a self harmer. I kept it mostly to myself but at 14 started opening up about it. My uncle worried and he'd try and help but he admitted he couldn't understand why i did it.

My uncle and i would discuss the idea of having kids. I definitely don't want children and my uncle feels the same. He doesn't mind kids but has said he doesn't want to raise any and he definitely would never have his own

Just after my 15th birthday my mum kicked me out. I called Victor sobbing and told him what had happened. He told me to come to his. Mum arranged a meeting with my school and my uncle came with me and we all sat in the room and my mother very clearly said she wanted nothing to do with me. She told my uncle that he could take me if he wanted but that otherwise she'd put me into care herself. My uncle agreed to take me in. 

By that point I was a complete wreck. I had keloid scarring all over my arms and legs and hurt myself regulary. I couldn't put a washing machine on. I never brushed my teeth. I couldn't go out much and i couldn't even go to the corner shop my anxiety was so severe. I had no friends. I was needy and always scared. I'd repeatedly say sorry with a stutter about everything. At the beginning if we ever argued I'd start crying, he'd always tell me he loved me and would give me a hug, he knew how when my mum and i would argue shed scream in my face, threaten me and say awful things like i regret giving birth to you. I never did it as a manipulation tactic, I'd have a panic attack and start crying from fear.

I became addicted to drugs and stole off my uncle, which i eventually admitted to. I occasionally slammed his door when i would get upset. I'd ask him to say i love you and beg him to hug me and he always refused so I'd cry. I regret that. My uncle hates being touched and literally shudders when i say i love you, he finds it extremely hard to express affection and I really wish I hadn't been so needy and selfish. I also always wanted to be around him and hang out and by the time I was 16 he'd started to grow distant. We'd argue a lot because i wanted more time together and he'd say he didn't want to hang out with a teenage girl.

Despite my behavior my uncle persevered. He taught me how to look after myself. How to clean myself properly and to wash my clothes. Taught me how to cook and clean and helped me with my homework. He'd take me shopping when i needed clothes. He helped me open a bank account and taught me how to use a bank card, taught me internet banking and how to use computers and shop online. He took me to the drs where i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and i got all my vaccinations late. He took me to an opticians where we discovered i needed glasses. My mother used to force me to always hide my scars and wouldn't let me leave the house without them covered. My uncle is the only person whose seen all of my scars. He's never called them ugly or said anything mean about them. 

He had endless patience. I was in therapy all throughout this time and had been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses. At the beginning i still would cut myself. He once mopped my floor and got me in the bathtub and cleaned the blood off me, he admitted he still gets nightmares of that night. He made me promise I'd come to him, day or night next time I felt that way.

I'd regularly sit in his room and talk about what happened in the past. I'd talk about my suicidal feelings and he always listened. But as i got older i started to be more secretive. I told him i stopped doing drugs, but i never did. As i developed a relationship with my mother again he supported me. When mum and i would argue and we'd stop talking he was always there for me when I'd cry about my mum.

I moved back in with my mum briefly late last year. He was the first person i called after i woke up after a suicide attempt, my mother had found me unconscious and left me there. He told me he loved me. He very rarely says i love you especially now that I'm older.

He told me he loved me when i attempted suicide again and was hospitalised a few months ago. my mum refused to take me back. The dr convinced me to call my uncle and he travelled 2 hours by bus to come and get me. He gave me a long hug and said i could come back with him. 

It's only recently i realised how much he's gone through. He's had depression for a long time and has admitted to me he had thoughts of suicide in the past and he implied he still gets them. He's got numerous health issues most of which are related to stress. He jokes that looking after me has been incredibly stressful. I know it has, but he never blames me for anything. I know that he values privacy a lot and he no longer gets the house to himself. My gran moved out when i was around 17 and so though she stays over a couple times a week it's mostly just Victor and I. We're always broke and though it's hard at times we make do. He never makes me feel bad about the lack of money and he doesn't ask for a lot of money each month.

I know he doesn't actually want me living here. He was really happy when i moved in with my mum which is why when she started being mean i didn't tell him initially. I know how hard it's been to take care of me and raise me and though I'm an adult now I'm still suicidal and I'm still a drug addict. I felt ashamed and figured I'd be better off dead. His health has deteriorated over the years and i believe that is mainly from stress. He really wants to move to Thailand (he clarified on his own) as he knows people over there and he regularly goes on holiday there but he can't because of me and gran. I have said thank you for taking me in, acknowledging i know he never wanted kids and it was hard on him. He agreed and added especially since i am mentally ill and i couldn't even put an oven on or clean myself. 

I honestly feel like all I've done is bring him misery. He's had to raise me and watch me act unstable. He's had to cope with my suicide attempt and my self harm and teach me all kinds of things most 15 year olds already know. He had to teach me how to interact with people and how to cope with my mental health. He's seen me sobbing and has had to call my psychiatrist a couple of times. He's also admitted he's scared I'll become a drug addict again and he literally monitors my painkillers, when i hurt my leg the other week i admitted I'd gotten prescription painkillers and he asked me to give them to him so he could control how much i took because he couldn't trust i wouldn't get upset and overdose.

I feel so guilty and heartbroken. If my uncle knew i was abusing drugs he'd be so disgusted. He almost threw me out when he learned I was an addict. It was only that I'd been clean for a few months by the time i told him that he didn't kick me out

I think I've ruined his life. All the stress I've put him through has certainly negatively affected his health. I don't know how i can ever tell him how much i appreciate what he's done for me.

These past few months I don't go to him as much with my issues. I give him a lot of space and no longer ask for any form of physical affection. I go out more to get our food shopping and I've said if he struggles to pay the bills I'll start giving him more money. Over the past year I've been a lot calmer and articulate. We very rarely argue and if we do i never lash out and I apologise and try and rationally explain my feelings. I want advice on how to help my uncle. How to be a better roommate. How to tell him sincerely that i know how hard it's been and i appreciate all he's done. How to handle the guilt i feel 

**tl;dr**: my uncle took me in at 15. I have had numerous mental health difficulties, drug issues and self destructive behaviours. I feel like i have ruined my uncles life who never wanted kids and had to raise a mentally ill girl. His health has deteriorated a lot from stress. Though i have managed to get better and not be as difficult I still feel really guilty. I wanted advice for how to handle the guilt and how to ease my uncles stress."
"My [31M] Wife [30F] of four years is angry and upset at me for finding staying at home parenting easier than her.


To make it easy I'll call my wife Jill and our son Ben, also in our country we get one year of parental leave and you get to apply to leave at your work once per child.

Jill and I had our son Ben 8 months ago, we made the decision that she would stay at home and I would continue work (either parent can take parental leave). She was having a hard time at the beginning so I was being as supportive as I could, doing all the housework (cooking and cleaning), looking after Ben when I got home from work and trying to help as much as possible, it was exhausting and after three months I asked Jill to help out, she said she would but every day I came home she hadn't done anything. This led to multiple arguments where she said I didn't know how exhausting it was to parent and how I got to go to work to ""get away from it all"", I definitely didn't view it that way and felt like I was working non stop while she was getting some time off when I got home.

Around the end of month 5 after a big blowout we talked about it and decided to switch places, she would go back to work and I would take the remaining 6 months at home, we organised this with our respective employers and swapped at the 6 month mark. The first few days were exhausting, Jill also called all the time to make sure I was looking after Ben right. After a week I got used to everything I needed to do with Ben and managed to start getting housework done, I started cooking and had dinner on the table when Jill came home, I was able to sit Ben near the kitchen and could tend to him if need be.

The first few times Jill came home to dinner she joked about me pawning Ben off on our friends to get work done, when I told her I wasn't really having a problem doing both she got quite nasty and said she doubted that was true. After that week she stopped helping out after work and didn't really help with Ben much either saying she was tired from work, trying to point out that that's exactly what I had done for months just led to more arguments.

A couple of days ago she came home and blew up at me, she claimed I tricked her so I would get to stay home, I tried to remind her that she wanted to swap as well and how exhausting she found it but she said that was bullshit. She then demanded we swap places again which we can't unless she quit her job which we can't afford. She's adamant and is now trying to talk to her employer to see if they'll let her take a second section of leave since she was originally going to be out for a year. However I don't want to go back, I'm really enjoying it at home but I'm worried about telling her this as it may just upset her more and cause more arguments, what should I do?

TLDR; Wife was having a hard time being a stay at home parent, we swapped and now she is claiming I tricked her and wants to swap back but I'm enjoying being at home. How should I handle this?

"How can I [19F] tell my mom [54] I don't want to babysit anymore?


This may be long, I've included a tl;dr at the end. 

So, I've been babysitting my little sister (5) four days a week, from 5 am to 8/9 pm for five years, and I have a child of my own (3). 

When I first started babysitting I was 15 and lived with my mom, and at the time my little sister was well behaved and I was homeschooled so I was home anyway. I had my son at 16 and my little sister got progressively worse attitude wise and my mom put her through hell having people move in and out and never disciplining her. 

She was a drug baby when she was born so she may have underlying issues my mom refuses to address, and she is to the point she is screaming at me, my husband, my son and my mom 24/7. She hits and kicks and lies over nothing and has even choked my son and otherwise physically hurt him in ways I can't continue to subject him to. 

My mom recently got custody of my nephew(1), also a drug baby too. She expects me to pick him up from day care everyday and keep him for four hours until she gets home. She pays me $100 every two weeks for all of this, and I have to buy food for her kids, too, and use my gas to go back and forth to her kids school and home. 

I got married last year and when we started trying to have a baby I was so stressed out I had a miscarriage, and when I got pregnant again she kicked me and I had a severe sub chronic hematoma that caused another miscarriage. 

We just moved out on our own and I didn't realize how great it is to finally be alone with my husband and child without someone else's kid 24/7. I know that sounds terrible and I feel selfish but I don't want to keep my moms kids anymore, I'm 19, trying to have my family and be happy and start college in august. 

I have never had a break from this until now, and I don't want to go back. I've spent every holiday, my husband and child's birthday and my birthday stuck at home babysitting her kids. I've had enough. 

How can I break it to my mom I don't want to be her built in babysitter anymore? 

Tl;dr: I've been babysitting my siblings for 5 years and I can't do it anymore. How can I tell my mom? 

Edited to say*** every time I've ever asked my mom to find someone else to keep her for a day she guilt trips me and treats me like shit. "
"I [23 F] used to have an eating disorder. My boyfriend [26 M] admitted he found me more attractive when I was skinnier.



I have had issues with disordered eating and exercise habits in the past. In college, I ran every day and kept to a strict diet. That doesn't sound so bad, but at my lowest weight, I was 78 pounds (I am 5 foot 3)

I was losing muscle mass because I was losing too much weight, and I was getting dizzy spells. I would bruise super easily,  from sports and everyday life. I felt like crap, and that made my tough college degree tougher. 

During my senior year of college, I looked at a picture of myself with my volleyball team, and realized I looked like a little kid surrounded by adult women. I realized my weight was unhealthy, and that I needed to change my habits.

I stopped working out, other than volleyball practice, and stopped dieting. Within a year, I had gotten up to 107 pounds. Looking at myself, I feel chubby, but realize I am objectively healthier. 

I still struggle with self image, I recently was complimenting my friend on how fit she was, and she insisted I was in better shape. Not just to be nice, she meant it, and I just couldn't see myself as fit and attractive as her. 

----

I started dating my boyfriend Mark about halfway through the process of putting weight back on.  I weighed about 90 pounds when we met about a year and a half ago.

I told him a little about my struggle with body image but I don't know if he understood it. He's never dealt with body image issues himself.

In the past 6 months, after having gotten up to a more healthy weight, I decided I wanted to start exercising regularly again. But I was wary about falling back into my old habits, so I decided I'd start going to the gym to bulk up and build muscle. 

I regularly have discussed my body and my goals with my doctor after realizing I had a problem, and am following his advice. So I do think I have gone about my ""bulking up"" in a healthy way.

It's been going really well, I've been making good progress. I don't watch my diet too much (Dirty bulking is the term lol). I just make sure I eat a lot, and eat enough protien. 

I'm super happy with my progress, I feel so much stronger than I did when I was skinny. I try not to focus on looks, instead focus on what I can physically do, but if I had to evaluate my appearance objectively... I weigh 118, have noticeably muscular arms and legs, and my diet has caused me to have a bit more belly fat. Though I can feel abs under there! 

I have started to see a dietician to make sure I am continuing this in a healthy way, since I really do want to continue lifting.

I do sometimes feel insecure about my belly fat, and my rounder face, but I have come to realize that I am way healthier than I was.  And I've got curves now!

----

Last week, when we were drinking, my boyfriend said something that really upset me. He said he was less attracted to me currently than he was when we met.

I was also drunk and got pretty annoyed, saying that he met me when I was recovering from an eating disorder and it was really fucked up that he preferred me weak and unhealthy to strong and feeling good about myself.

He said that it was good I wasn't starving myself anymore, but I had gone way too far in the other direction. He said he wasn't super attracted to too much muscle on a girl, plus I was ""dirty bulking"" as I put it. 

I lashed out at him and said he was disgusting for preferring a woman who looks like a child. (I honestly look back at photos from that time, and I had the body of a child. Knobbly knees, Flat breasts and butt because I was so thin)

I also accused him of being the type of person who led me to feeling shitty about my weight in the first place. 

We argued for a while more, but the gist of it was that he was attracted to slim women, and doesn't necessarily think being slim is unhealthy. 

I know from experience that it wasn't healthy to be that slim, and I was upset that he idealizes an image that I tried so hard to get, only to realize I was destroying my body trying. 

----

I don't know if I can get over this, but I also know this is a super sensitive topic for me, so I might be overreacting. 

It's also brought up self confidence issues, even though I like what I look like now (more or less) it hurts to be called less attractive.

----

Tldr - I used to have an eating disorder. I met my boyfriend fairly early into my recovery. He admitted drunk that he found me more attractive when we first met.

"My bf[25M] couldn’t contact me [25F] for 5hours and freaked out, reaching out to all my friends and almost calling the police.


Together for 4 years.

Last week I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to come have lunch win my friends this Saturday and he said he would be working at 4 so he didn’t feel like having lunch with people before work. Fair enough, I told him I would go alone.


Today I had planned lunch with some friends and left home at 11:30. My boyfriend works in a bar so he was still sleeping, I kissed him goodbye and told him I where I was going but without really waking him up, as I didn’t want to bother him.


I get there, leave my phone on my jacket as I have lunch wh my friends and don’t check on it. At 5:30 one of the friends I’m having lunch with gets a message and tells me “I think your bf is looking for you”. What? I go check my phone and I have a few missed calls, 40 texts from my bf and texts from 5 different friends asking me where I am if I’m ok because my bf is looking for me.


I got furious. As a context, I need to say that my bf is jealous. He got cheated on by his ex-gf and has had trust issues from there. When we started dating, going out with friends was a pain because he always got so jealous, sometimes I just didn’t go to avoid dealing with it. He has got a lot better and now all I got is a snarky remark, but still hearing “you sure you are not cheating on me?” Or many variations of that sentence is annoying, doesn’t matter if he tries to say it “jokingly”. I have a friend who sometimes gives me a lift after work and he even gets jealous of him! It’s tiring, but I have always hoped my bf would get over it seeing I’m completely trustworthy and I have never ever done anything to make him distrust me.


Now, I don’t think he contacted all my friends because he was jealous, but it did hit me as controlling. So so controlling. I was furious and when I called him I basically said I didn’t appreciate him making all this show because he couldn’t reach me for less than 5 hours. All my friends got worried and got involved in this drama. He told me he was worried and he didn’t even go to work in case he needed to call the police. Wtf? I got even more mad. He then started crying saying he was just really worried but for once I really didn’t care that he was crying, which I guess makes me a monster. I just saw a big overreaction. I told him to call down, go to work and we would talk later.


Later that afternoon I got a message saying that he got worried because he loves me and he did everything it of love and concern of me as always, but that if I react to that with such hostility maybe we should sit down and talk about this relationship.


Now I’m conflicted. I feel like I did my duty communicating where I was even if he forgot, and that he overreacted big time. On the other hand everybody tells me it’s “sweet” that he worries about me, but I’m not sure if it’s sweet or controlling...


What do you think? Was it my fault for going no contact for 5 hours and he was just being a caring bf? 


TLDR: I went to have lunch with friends and didn’t check my phone for 5 hours. My bf forgot where I was and freaked out, contacted all my friends from my Facebook and message me saying he would contact the police if he didn’t reach me in 30min. I think it was controlling, my friends that it was sweet and caring."
"I (32m) am deeply uninspired with my wife's (32f) laziness and unwillingness to change. I find myself attracted to a waitress at a diner I go to and my wife just fired our therapist. Is it time to throw in the towel?


I've been with my wife for close to 8 years now, married for 6. We had a great relationship for the first 4 years and I actually dream of those first years when it seemed like our love was like a drug with no downsides. 

My wife is a professional artist and I've supported her while she got her self started. She had some major setbacks when several pieces of her work were outright stolen off Etsy (one by a major ""celeb"" podcaster who could have easily paid her). Since then she's sort of sunk into a funk and has never really come out. She's stopped her artistic endeavors completely, has worked a few part time jobs but for the most part she sits at home all day long and goes out with her friends until almost 1 or 2 every single day of the week. 

At first I recommended she seek some therapy and she erupted in anger and blamed me for all her problems and said I was stifling her. I did talk her into some couples counseling but we went maybe three times and my wife could not handle any sort of criticism and she quit going. 

The next two years were also pretty bad but I sort of got lost in my work. my company moved locations and me and some coworkers started going to a diner across the street nearly every morning for breakfast. I was instantly captivated with our server. She's not in any way conventionally attractive and pretty overweight but I am enamored with her work ethic and just her general joy to be alive and happiness. She works two jobs, she takes care of her son and she's always, always happy to see me (or us). 

One day not too long ago in an argument with my wife, I very stupidly compared her to the waitress. My wife accused me of cheating and I didn't realize at the time she got into my phone, turned on the apple friends app and was taking screen shots from her phone every time I would be at the diner. Maybe a month ago she confronted me with my ""cheating"" and said she was taking them to a lawyer. I begged her to give counseling one more try and I promised I was not cheating and promised to stop going to the diner. I have kept my promise, but I have to admit I miss seeing my waitress friend because she made me feel happy. 

So my wife and I went to counseling yesterday for the first time with this therapist. Pretty quickly into it, my wife brought up the waitress and the therapist asked ""why do you think he might be attracted to someone like that?"" My wife stood up, said this was utter bullshit and she was being attacked and stormed out. Maybe a minute later my wife slammed the door open and said something like ""you're fucking fired, this is such bullshit."" I finished out the session by myself and agreed to keep coming back.

The therapist said she just didn't know enough about us yet to make a recommendation on our relationship. My wife wasn't home when I got home and she didn't come home last night. Her phone went strait to voicemail and her text messages didn't have the ""delivered"" caption. So I have no idea what she's up to or what she's thinking.

After reading this small snapshot of our lives, is it time to throw in the towel? I'm fed up but I keep coming back to those days when we were so happy and it makes it very hard for me to admit they wont ever happen again. 

**TL:DR; Is it time for me to throw in the towel on my marriage? My wife just ""fired"" our second therapist and we just aren't happy. She's accused me of cheating with a waitress who makes me happy just by being a cheerful good person and I don't know what else to do.** "
"My [18F] mom being difficult about my skin


I'm a 18 year old female and I have been dealing with acne for the past almost 7 years of my life. It started with small bumps on my forehead when I was 12 and then progressed to pimples on my cheeks and all over my face in general as I got older and school became more stressful. Recently I'm at the most stressful point of my life and my previous acne which was usually limited to just pimples became painful and deep cystic acne and because of that my self esteem really took a toll. 

I am fine with dealing acne on my own as I have been dealing with it for years. But since 12 the comments I have been getting from my parents have become worse and worse to a point where not a day passes where they don't make a remark about my face which to them comes off as just a comment but to me has been chipping away my already minuscule self esteem. What pisses me off is that they give 'advice' like ""you should wash your face twice with water everyday and your skin will get better"" when they have never experienced anything more than an occasional breakout all their life. Most of the time I get frustrated and return to my room to apply layers of moisturisers, sleeping with hydrating masks, slathering the oil and trying everything I can to keep the acne down. To make things worse, when my mom especially sees that I'm applying moisturisers she criticises me saying that what I'm doing is making my skin worse and that I should follow her advice and only wash my face with water twice a day etc. She also spews her bullshit assumptions about me not washing off my makeup before going to sleep (which I never ever do) or not washing my face twice a day (which I don't do because it's drying) as her counter arguments when the topic of my skin comes up, and I have no way of convincing her otherwise because she just refuses to believe whatever I say. 

Recently I went to the dermatologist (from my own money, not from her wallet) after much persuasion from my friend, and the dermatologist prescribed some antibiotics, clindamycin and topical tretinoin for two months. I'm thinking of going on isotretinoin the next time I go to the dermatologist again, but where I live I have to get my parent's signature for isotretinoin as I am under 21. I brought it up today during dinner and I got the usual ""just wash your face with water twice a day, trust me it will clear up, I'm your mother"" bullshit and initially I tried to reason with her, saying I'll get the doctor to explain to her why it's not going to work and why isotretinoin is good for me (she is mostly scared of the side effect regarding babies but I'm not even thinking of getting pregnant). She refused and said I should just listen to her advice, which riled me up because she is implying that her advice would help more than a dermatologist's. I got pissed and stormed off and it triggered me to write this after putting it off for a long time thinking it would just blow over one day. 

I'm stuck and very frustrated, I don't know what to do and I would like some advice.

tldr: my mother thinks acne can be washed away, doesn't want to follow me to a visit to the dermatologist and is making my life miserable"
"I feel that my husband manipulated me into a major life decision that I vehemently opposed... will I ever stop resenting him?


My husband (32M) and I (30F) live in one of the major metropolitan areas of the United States. Let’s call it Scum City. He grew up in a distant suburb of Scum City, went to college around here, and has generally spent his entire life within 50 square miles. I moved here on a whim (from another large city about 800 miles away) after college because so many of my friends had gone to school in Scum City and I was ready for a change of scenery. I met him within three months of moving here, we started dating two years later, engaged three years after that, and now we’ve been married for about one year. I do love him, but I wasn’t expecting my temporary move to Scum City to turn into a seven-year stretch, (or a lifetime.)

Truth be told... I hate it here, and I have for a while. After the novelty wore off, I realized that this place is so NOT my scene. Traffic is horrible, the people are shallow, the competition for everything (jobs, housing, dinner reservations) is fucking manic, and doing simple errands like getting groceries feels like going into battle. The weather and the pollution are an ISSUE for me. The cost of living is one of the highest in the nation — working twice as hard to get half as much - brilliant. I’m from a clean, green, polite, mellow, educated town - and I guess it spoiled me. I’ve been very open with my husband since we started dating that this city is not my cup of tea, and as we got more serious I was firm that I could never live here long term, let alone raise a family here — so... *you do you*, but that’s where I’m at. He agreed, and since all of his family now lives on the other coast we always talked about moving to one of their various cities as options, as well as my hometown. I have a really strong group of friends back home, as well the areas his family lives, and I would’ve been very happy living closer to any one of them. (All of the friends that lived in Scum City when I moved here have since moved away, and I now basically just hang out with the wives and girlfriends of all of my husband’s friends. They’re all really nice people, but I can’t fully relate to them. I’m a pretty independent gal and only being friends with my husbands friends kind of gives me the creeps. My friends from home, who I’ve known for 20+ years, I consider to be family, and I never intended to permanently abandon them.)

My husband and I moved out of Scum City a few years ago, to a suburb about an hour away, to be closer to his office (he’s the bread winner about six times over) and we bought a house there. It was a pretty great change of pace and definitely bought us some breathing room, as well as time to think about next steps. I left my stable, fun, well-paid job to relocate with him (my commute would’ve been about 90 minutes each way with the traffic) and I started my own business from home in our new town, which was excellent.

But after a while, being alone all day started to get to me, coupled with the fact that our “friends” were rarely willing/able to travel an hour to see us, and vice versa, and I started feeling more and more isolated and homesick. I became a little depressed, and a little anxious, but it was always manageable and pretty quickly cured with a trip to yoga or a vacation to visit friends and family.

Then we got engaged, which was great, and exciting, and I loved him so much, but the planning process kicked my anxiety into overdrive and I had trouble sleeping, trouble focusing on work, would break into random sobbing fits... I went to see a psychiatrist who told me I was depressed and gave me a few different prescriptions to lift my mood, help me sleep, etc. The medications got me through the wedding, and it was a beautiful time for us. But I thought I’d ought to stay on the meds for a little while longer for good measure.

My husband and I had made a pact earlier that year that he would finally leave his job by a certain date, and we would be free to move to a different city and a new stage in our lives. That date was approaching fast and we were both excited about this new adventure. The future looked bright! Goodbye Scum City!

About a month before his final day at work, we booked a flight to the city where a lot of his family lives and made appointments with a realtor to show us multiple properties. I was beyond excited, told my closest friends there that we were coming and would probably be moving there by the end of the year, and just generally preparing for this fun new chapter and finally getting away from this town that has been slowly eroding my soul.

So we arrive in the new city, spend the first day sightseeing and visiting with family, and gearing up for our real estate tour the next day. Everything is good. The next morning, we walk to breakfast and suddenly, my husband breaks down into full-on tears. A public ugly-cry. He tells me that his best friend has offered him a job at his start-up company... in Scum City... and that he’s accepting the offer. “It's an exciting new industry and if we build it right this could be a billion dollar business” etc etc, and he wants to do what's best for *us* long term. He’s says he’s crying because he knows how much I hate Scum City and he’s afraid that I’m going to leave him if he takes this job. I go straight into nurture-mode because he doesn’t cry often, and I reassure him that I’m not going anywhere and, while this is really bad news for me, we will make it work. Since he’s the breadwinner, I felt a little helpless, even though I knew that his resume was excellent and he could find a stellar, high-paying job in any city, preferably a city that doesn’t make his wife physically ill. He hadn’t even started job hunting yet, but he took this job in the exact place we were intentionally moving away from... without consulting me first because he knew that I would resist.

So he breaks this news to me, and I’m outwardly staying strong, but inside I’m spiraling. A switch has flipped inside me and my intuition is suddenly fucking nervous about this man. Was it all a lie? Does he ever plan to move away? Did I get myself into a real pickle here? We fly back home, get a renter into our house, and rent an apartment back in the center of Scum City. I dismantle my business in the suburbs and say goodbye to my clients. My depression surges.

My psychiatrist ups my meds. I lose all lust for life. I cry all the time, I can’t focus on anything, I feel absolutely trapped. I job hunt for months and find nothing. My husband helps me pay my bills but makes me feel guilty for doing so since he took a 50% pay cut for the new job, putting us in a much less secure financial position. Because logic. (Again, I had to dismantle my business to move with him and now I cannot find work because this city is so frickin’ competitive. Similar to when we moved two years earlier and I left my great job to follow him to the suburbs.) Basically, I felt like a piece of shit who can't make life happen properly, and I feel scared and sad and alone on top of it all.

Plot twist: I eventually realized that the meds were making me a zombie, and that they were actually making my anxiety and depression much worse than they really are, so I weaned off of them over the course of about two months. It took me about two more months to feel completely back to normal. Now I’m job hunting again, and I’m optimistic I’ll find something, but honestly, I don’t really want to find anything. I don’t want to work here. I don’t want to make new friends. I don’t want to live here. I just want to crawl under the covers and pray that this will all fix itself. I wish I could go back in time and change something... but I don't know what. No matter how you slice it, I still had a major life decision made behind my back. My trust is shattered.

I haven’t felt the same about my husband since he proclaimed that we were staying in Scum City. He knew I was depressed and anxious and that the city exacerbated all of that and I was at my wits end. Homesick to the point of tears at least once a week. We had plans, agreements, pacts. His way of consulting me was to blindside me and give me no room for push-back by saying he was afraid I was going to leave him since he “had” to stay. Even though this job was completely voluntary, and probably a poor option compared to other jobs he could’ve taken elsewhere. He most definitely does not have a timeline for me of when he will be ready to leave this job - so we are living here *INDEFINITELY*. Best case scenario would be the business venture completely failing, which is a terrible thing for me to think or say, and worst case scenario is that it becomes very successful and grows, trapping me here, potentially, for the rest of my life. If I stay.

I feel wronged. I feel manipulated and ignored. I feel like my needs were shrugged off so that he could work with his friend. I feel like my career is unimportant to him, and is less than an afterthought when it comes to major life decisions, yet I’m expected to bring home a nice income to help support our expensive city lifestyle. The industry I'm in is one of the most competitive industries here, and I didn't go to an Ivy League school and I don't have a ton of professional connections in Scum City. I was applying to 10 positions a day at one point and not getting a single reply. Every time he makes me feel guilty about not pulling my weight, I feel angry that he’s put me in this position - to the point that I feel spiteful. On the flip side, I also feel very guilty about feeling this way - that I should just suck it up and smile through the bullshit. That I should be happy no matter where I live as long as I’m with him. That I’m being dramatic. But... it’s my life too. I’ve said this all to him, many times, and he knows that I feel this way, but I’m not sure that he gets it. The business is going well. He believes he’s doing the right thing. But I cannot picture a future here, cannot picture starting a family here, cannot picture ever being truly happy here. And since we’re now living here with no end in sight, this means I really can’t picture my future with him, can’t picture starting our family, can’t picture us ever really being happy. I love him, but we don’t live in a bubble, and frankly I only get to see him for a few hours in the evening and on weekends anyways. The rest of the time, I’m out in Scum City, holding back my screams of frustration. This was not the agreement. I resent him so much for making me stay here that all of my walls are up. I resent that essentially my only way out is to leave him - *his words on that day*. That’s quite an ultimatum.

We’ve been glorified roommates for the past six months. Sex life has ground to a halt, romance completely out the window, and other than that I’m just not feeling good about the relationship in general. I feel like my trust has been betrayed in the most nuanced of ways that I can’t begin to describe it to anyone, and it's too personal anyway. I feel like I’ve been trapped in a situation where I’ve put my husband’s career before my own, and now I don’t have any money to protect myself. It’s terrifying. I don’t feel like I can really talk to anyone about this because it’s honestly so embarrassing to feel this way as a newlywed.

All I know is that I miss my loving relationship with my husband, and I’m scared that I won’t ever be able to get back to that place with the daily reminder of his selfish, solo decision. Even if he quit his job tomorrow and we moved to a great new city, will I ever feel as excited and trusting as I once was? Can anyone relate to this? Or have thoughts or insights to share? Am I the asshole here? I’m so confused. I’ve never been in this situation before, or know anyone that has, and I can’t figure out the way forward. I feel sick about it.

**TL;DR: I hate the city that I live in and I would have moved away a long time ago if I hadn't met my husband. He agreed for a long time that we would move somewhere new, and on the day we start making moving plans he informs me he has accepted a new job, forcing us to stay indefinitely. I feel trapped and resentful and am not sure how to fix it.**

Thank you for your help.

Signed,
Sleepless in Scum City"
"Guy I dated (27m) demanding I (28f) pay him back for dates after we broke up and he found out I am now dating someone else (30m)


I'm so fucking blindsided by this I really have no idea how to even react. This guy I briefly dated ""Alan"" for 2 months was super immature and selfish. So I broke it off with him. Within those 2 months he claimed to love me, told me he wanted to marry me, and also said stuff like he wants to impregnate me. It was the worst decision of my life to carry on with him the way I did. I should have broken it off with him way earlier but I kept giving him chances, despite all the glaring red flags.

After we broke up, I told my close friend ""Jake"" about this and we ended up getting closer and started developing feelings for each other. So I started seeing Jake.

Suddenly Alan texts me about wanting  to please get back together, please give him another chance. I told him No, please stop, in the nicest way possible. He said he would ""try"" to get over me. 

Jake and I spend a lot of time at my house and last week Alan texts me and totally explodes, saying he cant believe I've moved on so quickly, you're disgusting, horrible, etc. I was so horrified by him and his reaction and basically told him its none of his business and I owe him nothing. He apparently sat outside my house in his car from the time Jake came over (like 9pm) to when he left at around 7am. I told him this is stalking, and he claims its not ""legally stalking,"" whatever that means.

Now today he has texted me again saying I owe him $200 some dollars for all the meals he ever bought me. He wants me to calculate what I ever bought for him and let him know so we can even it out. 

I am so incredibly disgusted by him and really, really freaked out. What do I do Reddit? My friends have told me to just pay him and make him get over it the way he wants. I have no desire to give him what he wants but I want him to JUST STOP. Im so freaked out... What do I do?

Tldr : Guy i dated for 2 Months watched me at my house, with my new boyfriend, now demands I pay him back for meals we had together because I moved on too quickly for his liking apparently. What the hell do I do?? "
"My ex [M37] got his act together after we divorced and it infuriates me [F34]


**TL;DR -- Got divorced nearly 3 years ago. He [M37] turned his life around, I'm [F34] struggling.**


My husband and I were together for 10 years, married for 6 of them. No kids.


We eventually grew apart - that is to say, I grew up and he didn't. He wanted to live the life of a teenager well into his 30s. The last 2-3 years together were horrible. After his dad passed away, he gained all this weight and lost his job. I tried to help and support him but he would just wallow in self-pity. He stopped pitching in around the house. He spent all his free time smoking weed and dicking around on the computer. He had to sell his junk car to help pay our bills.


Eventually I'd had enough and we got a divorce in 2015. We've essentially been 'no contact' since it was finalized.


Last Friday I happened to bump into him downtown and he's a completely different person. He lost all the weight he put on and had actually toned up some. He was wearing a tailored suit (he had one ill-fitting suit for weddings and funerals when we were together) and a nice watch. He may have gotten hair plugs or something because his thinning hair wasn't as pronounced as before. He told me he bought a condo nearby within walking distance of his new job - a well-known tech firm in our town.


Our encounter was brief and he was nice to me. He even apologized for how our relationship had soured and wished me ""all the best"".


It's been 4 days since I saw him and honestly I just get angrier the more I think about it. I gave 10 of the best years of my life to this man and got nothing from it. We never had kids. He never had much money. When we divorced, I started from square one. 


Now he's ""Mr. Successful"" while I'm struggling. My job is very stressful and I'm making less than I was 5 years ago. I live alone and money is tight. I've been having some intestinal / digestive issues and doctors can't seem to diagnose what's wrong with me.


I guess I just want to know why he couldn't have been better to me, why I was never worth the effort."
"I [26M] make a lot more $ than others in my friend group, so I always end up footing the bill when we go out in groups.


Hey everyone. So I have a group of friends that I usually hang out with (four of them — two male/female couples that are around my age). I’ve known the guys since I was in high school. 

For various reasons, I’ve been better off than them financially for a while (I’m talking a significant pay gap, and they always joke that I’m the “rich” friend). Anyway, I’m usually the one to host if there’s going to be a party and I pay for all of the food and alcohol. It’s usually just assumed that if we’re going to be hanging out it will be at my place since I have more space. They don’t really chip in for anything (except sometimes they’ll do a BYOB kind of thing). 

When we go out to eat, we don’t split the check either. I generally just take it. I know they don’t have a lot of money (some are still students and some are struggling to live off of their “art” — and we live in WeHo, where nothing‘s cheap). 

Anyway, it’s been like this for years and I never really questioned it much. But I have a girlfriend now that I’ve been seeing for 6 months. And she’s made comments to me privately that she doesn’t understand why it’s always assumed that I’ll pay for everyone. (She’s 27 and has a decent job, and I think she’s always been a pretty independent person). My answer was that I know they wouldn’t be able to afford to go out as much if I made them contribute equally, so I just tend to pay. She kind of left it alone after that. 

But I’ve started thinking about it more myself, and I’m wondering if I have the right attitude. I hate to think that I might be paying for friendship. I do have fun with these people and all of that but I’m starting to wonder why they’ve never really expressed any discomfort with me paying whereas a girlfriend I’ve known less than a year notices and says something. 
 
I guess my questions are: should I bring this up with my friends and ask them to contribute more? Should I just leave well enough alone? Is this a normal dynamic if one friend makes more money?

TLDR: I make a lot more money than my friends. Wondering if it’s normal that I tend to foot the bill for all of us when we go out. Girlfriend seems to think it’s odd. But I’ve known my friends longer and gotten somewhat accustomed to this. I would hate to think I’m being used though, so I’d like outside opinions. "
"I [26F] Hooked Up With My Bosses Boss [33M] Last Night... How Should I Follow Up With Him?


My SVP is quitting the corporate world for a few months to travel. I always had kind of a crush on him so I was bummed to find out he was leaving. A few of us went out last night for a goodbye party and we ended up hooking up. We were both drunk but I initiated. I know (from his personality/some of his comments) that he is going to be waking up this morning post-hangover terrified that he took advantage me or pulled a Harvey Weinstein and I want to shoot over a text to calm any of those fears. 

I'm in a major company that would go nuts if I said anything but it was 100% consensual, I just needed some liquid courage to finally make a move and wasn't any more drunk than him. I feel like the ball is in my court with how things are in corporate America right now but I don't know what to text him. I want to make sure he knows that I don't feel used, that I had a good time, and also don't want to come across as wanting a relationship or something if he doesn't (since he's traveling). Do I make a joke out of it? Apologize myself? Any ideas?

TL:DR Hooked up with departing SVP at my company. I think he's afraid he took advantage of me since we were drunk and I want to shoot over a text to eliminate any of those fears/awkwardness! "
"I (20M) just found out my mother (47F) was a heroin addict and prostitute our entire childhood. Now that both me and my sister (17F) have left the house for college, I don't know what to do with her now that she is seemingly breaking down.


My mother is an immensely strong, tough, amazin women. She grew up in northern ireland during the troubles and experienced tremendous violence her entire childhood and then moved to NYC during the crack epidemic and survived as a DJ for clubs and parties. She has had just an unimaginable life and an amazing story to tell. I have always respected and loved her, my entire childhood, I looked up to her. She was my badass irish mom. She wore a leather jacket and a bandanna and had long hair. She was like a cool, not-that-crazy, sarcastic version of the mom from terminator 2. When I was 13 years old 2 men tried to mug us and she beat them both down using the end of her high heel gracefully, like she had no fear. When I was 15 I was getting bullied, and she taught me how to fight, and I ended up winning against the bully. She was witty, quick to respond, and always stable and stoic and calm. She could look down the barrel of a gun and laugh at it (not like I ever saw this happen, but I wouldnt be surprised). I thought she was the coolest thing in the world. And even besides the fact that she was cool, she was just a *great* mom to me. She gave me guidance when I needed it, gave me space when I wanted it, always had tips and tricks for everything, was funny and fun to be around. And yet, I found out things about her I wish I never found out. 

I always thought my mother was a security guard at a hospital, and that is why she worked all night. She also said my dad (out of the picture) gave us money. I never doubted this. She had a uniform. 

It turns out this wasn't true. I found out some horrible things from my sister 5 months ago. My sister has known for a while but it took her a while to tell me. My mom is a prostitute, and a heroin addict and dealer. When I visited home from college, my sister showed me the needles and the baggies. My sister said she read texts on her phone about meeting with johns. There were also texts about dealing heroin. Not like she was a REAL dealer but lots of stuff about selling what she had and stuff. I honestly don't know how I never noticed it before. Thinking back... there were so many signs. So many damn signs. I would sometimes see her coming home slurring her words and looking so damn tired, I chopped it up to her being just exhausted after working for 13 hours. 

I haven't confronted my mother about this. Its honestly torn me apart since I found out. Its not like I don't believe her stories, my aunts and uncles have confirmed all of them, but I feel like there is now an aspect to them that was fake now. She wasn't cool calm and collective, dealing with the worst of society while staying above them like some kind of badass in a wasteland of danger, she was absolutely apart of the worst of society, she WAS one of the junkies she talked about, she WAS one of the prostitutes she told me dotted the streets of new york back then. 

So since I found out, my sister has left for college. I have visited a few times and my mom is just absolutely not doing good. Last time she burst out crying, saying she misses us so badly, and that she wants us to come home but she knows we cant. She said we were her rocks, keeping her stable. I know she wasn't ready to tell me the truth, but she told... enough that I knew something was wrong. That she was implying something was wrong. The time after that, I visited maybe 3 weeks later, she just looked terribly sad and depressed. She looked like she had aged 5 years in those few months. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel horrible. I do plan on confronting her about the truth but I don't know how or what to say, I don't want to make her any more sad than she already is. 

What do I do? how do I deal with this? Just tell her to go to rehab? There has gotta be more to it than that.

"My [28F] coworker [50sF] is hinting/insinuating that i fall asleep during my night shift, how to tell her i don't appreciate her accusations?


I work night-shift for a cleaning company that is contracted out to a local council. Myself and two other staff members work for the cleaning company, and 3 staff members work alongside us but are employed directly by the council.


When i first started the job nearly 2years ago i took over for a girl my age that was both locking the premises up/turning the lights off and sleeping in the office, as well as sleeping in her car during her shifts and stealing money. Even though she was fired this caused a HUGE amount of distrust between the two companies, whenever something goes missing or gets stolen im the FIRST person to be questioned, my other two coworkers however are never really suspected. 


Last night my coworker (we work shifts, i only see her when im arriving and shes getting ready to go home)  started questioning if i ever fall asleep in the office, saying i look like i need a sleep and if having the heaters on at night will make me tired (i live in the southern hemisphere, were coming up to winter weather and i often close the office door to keep the heat in).


While she was saying this (i knew exactly what she was hinting at) her face was inches from mine and was making stern eye contact. Because i have a facial deformity (cleft lip) im not comfortable with people looking at me so closely, it makes me self conscious and i look away. She must have seen this as a sign of guilt and turned away with a smug look on her face (picture professor Umbridge from Harry Potter)

How do i politely say im insulted about her accusations and attempt at interrogating me??? Even on days i'm sleep deprived (i struggle to sleep during daylight hours) i still come to work and  stay awake, weather its by staying on my feet or drinking coffee and get the work done like i should. I should not be accused of something that a past employee did and painted with the same brush, but the accuser has worked here for many years, is older than me and has superiority. 

It would almost be impossible for me to fall asleep here, there are cameras facing the main entrance so they would see me leave/turn lights out (which is how the fired employee was caught out) there are no blankets or bedding and the office is just big enough to have a small table and chairs and kitchen bench, i doubt there would be enough room to lie flat.

"Me [41 F] with my husband [49 M] 12 years, fighting over potential job interview I'll have soon; control over me.


I've been SAHM to our 2 boys for 7 years this Spring and worked as a professional for 18 years prior leaving workforce. It was always discussed that when our youngest kiddo starts kindergarten (fall of 2019) I can start looking for PT/FT job again. New opportunity came up with a job that's right up my alley now and interviewing for it next week.

The issue? Husband doesn't want me to return to work cuz he feels it'll disrupt our lives. Never mind the fact I've yet gotten the job, who knows! but his true colors is coming out. Apparently over back and forth discussion/arguments, he doesn't want me to return to work cuz I'll have my own income which means I'll run up my credit card. I made that one mistake 10 years ago when we first bought our house and I went bit crazy with my cc with stuff on new home, I was excited! but after a fight, and learning from said mistake I haven't done anything like that in 10 years since. Even with 2 kids on top and on one income vs 2 incomes pre kids.

Even if I don't get the job, I still can't forget his comments as that feels like control over me. He also made the comment of how our oldest son asked him, ""daddy, what does mommy do all day every day?"" and I got a very lukewarm explanation of his answer to our son, as if my husband was thinking the very same thing.

TLDR; Husband's true colors coming out. My feeling of being controlled is much bigger than this potential new job.

"My [22M] girlfriend [21F] still wants to be friends with a guy that tried to get her to cheat on me with him. Is it rational for this to upset me?


So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years now. One of her long term friends had been low key flirting with her for quite a while over text. She started showing me the texts when she started wondering if he was flirting. Now to be fair it wasn't clear cut at the time whether he was just being a friendly old friend, but my gut feel, especially knowing the way a lot of guys think, was that he was definitely flirting. 

We agreed that she shouldn't call him out on it though, because it could ruin a friendship she holds dear if she's wrong. (Just to add, they were really close in primary school, but started to drift apart in high school. They would see each other now and again at parties but they basically just talk every now and again over text).

Sometime last year however, he upped the ante and asked her if she wants to come over and give him a massage because his body is so stiff from the gym (wink face). She responded with ""Firstly, eww. Secondly, this is really inappropriate, I have a boyfriend"". His response, ""He doesn't have to know"". Then she ignored him.

Now we had a long talk and I 100% believe she wouldn't cheat on me. I trust her. But I sure as fuck don't trust Mr Sleezebag. They kinda just ignored each other for a year, but now she wants to try and reconnect with him, because she feels he went through a rough patch with his mother passing away (I do feel for him over that). My problem is, I still don't like him. He never apologised to my gf for thinking she would stoop so low as to cheat. And I feel he's going to do his best to try and sleep with her. Even though I know she wouldn't, it still pisses me off. I've told her this but her response every time is 'If you trust me, it shouldn't bother you'.

Now the advice I need is: is it irrational for me to not want her to be friends with him anymore, and am I overstepping by asking her not to be friends with him anymore? If not, how can I explain to her that it bothers me, even though I trust her not to do anything from her side?

TLDR: My GF still wants to be friends with a guy that tried to sleep with her (and knew she wasn't single). Am I in the right to ask her to end the friendship?"

I told my fiance about my father's offer and he also recognized what was happening immediately. Predictably, he got pretty sad about this latest attempt. I told him that I was not going, not only because I would be going alone (likely with my father having planned out my itinerary and pre-purchased tickets so he always knew where I was), but also because I need to use that time to apply to jobs (very true). He was worried that he was preventing me from doing something I really wanted to do, but I told him that was not the case. I'd rather spend a week with him playing video games in pajamas than spend a week by myself in an unfamiliar city in obligation to my manipulative father.


I didn't bring up the offer to my father until this morning but realized that if I stayed silent on it he might go ahead and buy tickets. So I messaged him and turned it down. 


I did take a bit of a cowardly way out and didn't confront him on not including my fiance in the offer. Instead I cited the fact that I need to use that time to find jobs, and brought up the car agreement by saying it was crucial for me to find a job so I could pay car insurance. I figured that he couldn't argue with me wanting to find a job and wanted to leave no wiggle room and avoid an opportunity for him to insult my fiance some more (I don't want to do that shit over Facebook messenger).


He was clearly not pleased but did not try to push the issue. We are actually now in the process of going through with the car agreement, so that's a nice unexpected thing. I'm going to pay him in full upfront so that would not be a continuing debt.


I'm still on his phone plan. I can't afford one of my own right now and my fiance is on a friends and family discount plan with his brother in law so I couldn't be added to his. Once I secure a job I'll be able to back out of that if necessary. 


Thank you everyone for your comments and advice! Hopefully fiance and I can take our own overseas trip someday soon(ish)! Anyone who wants to pet-sit, let me know ;)


tl;dr: Turned down the trip offer, he was pissed, but is now finally making good on an old agreement. "
"My (23M) wife (25F), together 4 years and married since July, wants to control when I go to bed and cries when I don't go to bed at the same time as her. Help?


She wants us to go to bed at the same time every night. During the week I have no problem with this - I work full time so going to bed when she does works for me anyways.

I'm a serious gamer, and don't get much time anymore to play. So on Saturday nights I like to stay up later (3-4am) and have some me time, playing video games. But my wife gets really angry at me and cries, followed by passive aggressive comments like ""fine do whatever you want, sorry I want to spend time with my husband"".

She complains that it's unhealthy for me. I'm aware that staying up late is unhealthy compared to going to bed early, but on a Saturday night I feel like it's fine.

In any case I feel like I should be allowed to make my own choice here without being guilt-tripped. What do you guys think?

Tldr: my wife wants to set my bedtime but I'm a grown person."
"Am I (23/F) overreacting to my BF's (26/M) female friend?


I just really wanted to first preface this with the fact that I don't think of myself as a jealous person. However, I'm a bit annoyed at what recently happened between my boyfriend and I on Sunday.

We have been dating for nearly a year, but a lot of it has been distance. He comes to visit me more often than I come to visit him, and as a result, he has met some of my friends and roommates, whereas I have not had the same luxury. There is a girl that he texts often, we'll call her Janet. He has texted Janet for a long time, and they are friends that met at work a few years ago during some kind of internship. Last week, my BF went to the movies with Janet, and he told her that he couldn't see Black Panther because he promised he'd watch the movie with someone else. That prompted me to ask to see Janet (on social media), because I was curious about his friends (I've never met any of them, but knew of 2 of them). He refused, and I figured it was because he didn't want me to feel insecure or whatnot? But anyways, they go to see the movie and all is good. This weekend, he came over to see me, and I was using his phone to play Hearthstone (lol), and Janet's messages came up. I saw that he referred to me as his ""friend"" when he said that he was in a different city. That prompted me to ask him about whether or not Janet knew about me, and he said that she didn't. So I naturally was kind of like, wtf? I've incorporated you in my life and you know about all the people in my life and they know about you, but Janet, this girl that you text FREQUENTLY, doesn't even know that you've been dating me for over a year? He got super annoyed and defensive and said that I was making something out of nothing, but even if he wasn't cheating, I felt like what he pulled was shady. Am I being too sensitive?

tl;dr: BF texts this girl often and says they are friends, but she doesn't know about me even though we have been dating for almost a year. Sketchy?"
"My [20F] mom [55F] is constantly yelling at me for not excelling in my uni course despite doing well in it


So last year I decided to study architecture even though I want to be an artist. Don't have faith in myself to make a living out of art, trying to make the adult decision etc etc

So anyway, I'm pretty disciplined with my uni work, despite not finding it fulfilling. I would be one of the people in my class that turns up the most and that would've stood out a bit from my peers in terms of creativity and successful projects. In fact, last year I even got a prestigious architectural job. My mom knows all this but it's not enough for her. To give an example, here's how my morning has gone today:
- I was woken up at 9:30 am by my mom coming into my room and giving out to be excessively (cant remember it all cause this woke me up)
- I go downstairs to make breakfast and she keeps giving out to me. Her complaints being that although I'm doing alright in school, it's not good enough because I'm not 'excelling' and apparently because of that I'm pissing my life away. I tend to argue with her that I'm going in an hour or two late because I'm majorly depressed, but she doesn't care.

tldr: My mom is mad at me for not being the ultimate best person ever despite my depression and actually doing pretty well. How do I get her to appreciate what I AM doing, and that I don't need to excel at something I'm not passionate about?"
"In-Laws (M/F) want us (31M/F) to welcome SIL (27F) back into our lives after she treated us badly.


Beth has always been the golden child and enabled by her parents every step of the way, often at the expense of my husband.  As a child that meant she got to pick every movie, she got double Christmas presents, etc.  If she did not get her way, she would have a tantrum and her parents would give in.  She is now an adult and her parents continue to treat her this way.  While Husband loves his sister, he also dreads going home for holidays or  going on trips with his family because everything will be all about Beth and she will have adult tantrums that include screaming, throwing things, breaking other people's belongings name calling, wishing she was dead, threatening suicide, etc. Husband and I have been together 6 years.  When he told me about some of these incidents, I had not seen them myself except in very small doses such as her parents rearranging their day to accommodate what she wanted for dinner or her mom taking her on excessive shopping trips for no reason at all.  

We went on vacation with them around Christmas time and I got to see all of these crazy behaviors first hand.  She had tantrums, screaming, crying ,throwing things at my husband, wishing we were all dead.  DAILY for 5 days.  For not getting her way about the most minor of things.  My 7 year old daughter would not be allowed to act that way.   

I posted about this on relationships and you all arm chair psychologists unanimously agreed that she has borderline personality disorder.  

Anyway, flash forward to now. We have been no contact for 4 months.  I am about 6 months pregnant with our first child together and their first grandchild.  When they visited us for Easter, I showed MIL the guest list from their side of the family and asked her if I had invited/not invited all the right people to the baby shower.  She added a cousin, removed a few family friends.  When they were alone with Husband the next day on the way to the airport, they told him he had to invite Beth to the baby shower.  He said she had not apologized or gotten help for her mental health problems so that would not be happening.  Cue the guilt tripping. They want him to just forget all of it ever happened.  He let them know that he does not want to expose my daughter or our son to that kind of toxic behavior.  More of, ""you know how she is"" and that she will never apologize.

I decide to just cancel the shower altogether but that upsets them more.  They tell husband that they will make her apologize and then we can invite her to the shower.  It is also implied that she will now be invited to all sorts of holidays, visit after birth of the baby, etc.  They want us to just send out an invitation with no apology.  


I know how this is going to go.  Everyone wants to just rug sweep this.  I personally do not want to deal with this at all.  I am pregnant with a high risk pregnancy because of a chronic health issue so I am already miserable.   I don't want her at my baby shower.

At the same time, I do not want to damage the relationship with Husband's family.  He talks to his parents daily and they have done for us from visiting and calling after my major surgery, travelling 6 hours each way for my daughter's birthday parties, and gifting us the downpayment for our house.  They are lovely people who have been very welcoming to me and supportive of my husband.  

Should I just let her back in to make them happy or should we stick to our guns and wait for an apology that will never happen?

**TL;DR**
FIL and MIL want us to be one big happy family no matter how terrible their daughter treats us.  "
"My [22 F] boyfriend’s [26 M] parents [50s M &amp; F] have convinced him that I don’t understand his dietary requirements


Apologies that this got so long - also throwaway because my boyfriend reddits.

My boyfriend Drew and I have been dating for the past 2 years, and we moved in together 6 months ago. The crux of this issue is that Drew has a health issue that affects what food he can and cannot eat - think gluten intolerance but with a more obscure foodstuff that is very common in most pre-prepared and manufactured foods. It’s not an allergy as such in that he won’t have a severe and immediate reaction if he consumes this ingredient, but it does affect him internally - his body takes 3 months to restructure itself every time this ingredient is consumed. I will say now that while I have never had to live or prepare food for anyone with any kind of dietary issue, I have taken every consideration to make sure that I triple and quadruple check the ingredients of everything I use, and I always make sure that the kitchen is scrubbed clean so nothing that would’ve had this ingredient in eg. biscuit crumbs have been accidently left where my boyfriend can be exposed to them. Drew has always been super complimentary of the steps I take when cooking, to which I always tell him that I would be a shitty girlfriend and a shitty person if I chose to ignore his medical issues.

Drew’s parents visited us last week (we live around 2 hours from them) as we hadn’t seen them since Christmas. This was the first time that his parents would be visiting since I moved in with Drew (we decided at the start of my final school year that I would move in with Drew, he has been living in our area for several years). I have always had a good, cordial relationship with Drew’s parents; I wouldn’t say that we go out of our way to talk to one-another, but they have always been pleasant with me. As soon as they entered the house, there were little comments made about all the changes that my boyfriend has made to *his* home (we’ve moved around the seating because we’ve bought a new television and I keep my kitchen mixer out on the side because there’s little room in the cupboard, that’s it). In my mind at this point I thought that they were just worried that I was taking liberties in living with my boyfriend while still in school (ever since I moved in I’ve been paying half of Drew’s former rent and we pay equally for utilities, and we had me officially added as a tenant to the property so I am arguably as equal as possible to Drew in our house), but I wasn’t going to let a couple of snide comments get me down. It was when we started discussing meals that the real issues started. We had planned for both Drew and I to cook a meal that evening, and then eat out for the majority of the other evenings, maybe cooking a meal here and there. I’d prepped most of the meal beforehand, and asked both parents how they wanted their meat cooking, which Drew was doing. Both parents shared a look then his mom asked me if I had taken into consideration Drew’s dietary issue. I said that it was all taken care of, and explained how I had made sure that none of the food included the ingredient. When we sat down to eat, Drew’s mother took a bite of one of the pre-prepared foods and said that she could taste the specific ingredient. Drew said that he couldn’t taste anything and that it was all delicious, to which his mom said that he would have no idea what it even tasted like anymore (Drew got diagnosed with his issue when he was 20, so he does know what he’s missing). She scowled throughout the rest of the meal, asking Drew repeated if he wanted her to go and cook up something ‘safe’ for him.

The rest of the week wasn’t better - we have a list of where Drew can eat out safely in our city, however whenever I made a suggestion to eat at any of these places, his parents insisted on double checking online for reviews and dietary restrictions and warnings, even for places that Drew said himself that he loved, and where they know us on a first name basis. If I ordered a meal without asking for all of the ingredients beforehand (for the first few months of our relationship I always did this, but Drew said that he didn’t want to force me into voluntarily cutting things out of my diet), they asked if I really understood Drew’s condition because I was eating something containing the ingredient right in front of him. Unless I literally tipped my meal onto his plate or french-kissed him with a mouthful of food, he’s not going to be affected by me eating my meal at the same table as him. Drew said he noticed his parents cross-examining me, and thought it was odd since whenever he went home his parents ate meals containing the specific ingredient all the time. Even as his parents were leaving, his father slipped him a $20 and told him to go and buy a meal ‘he actually wants to eat’.

Drew knows that this has upset me, however I think his parent’s words have got to him. For months if I have been cooking a meal he leaves me on my own or makes casual conversation without really paying attention to what I’m doing, ever since the visit he has been watching me like a hawk and constantly asking me if I’ve checked the ingredients I’m using or if I have **definitely** washed out that bowl or wiped down that surface. I know that people with dietary issues are cautious with what goes into their food, but I would be a lot more accepting of this if he had been this way from day one, and not just because his mother told him that she doesn’t think I can look after him as well as she can.

I don’t know what to do about this? Do I tell Drew to trust me? Do I just stop cooking meals and risk his mother lambasting me for not caring enough about her little boy?

TL;DR - Boyfriend’s parents don’t believe that I am capable of managing his dietary issues even though I have proven that I know what to do/not do; boyfriend believing his parents’ words over my actions."
"My [25f] big brother [30m] was killed a couple months ago. I want to reach out to his girlfriend [29(I think) f]. I don’t know how to approach her, or even if it is a good idea right now.


As stated, my big brother died unexpectedly a little over two months ago. Some asshole had a few too many drinks and drifted across the center-line on the highway and plowed head-on into his motorcycle.

I’ve been struggling alot because, basically, I don’t feel like I really knew him as well as I wished I did.

He left home when I was 13, we went very low contact for a while after that. We somewhat reconnected a few years ago when he drove across the country to help me get settled in at my college. We basically re-bonded that night over some crappy burgers and a couple beers he got for us to “celebrate”. 

But we lived on two opposite sides of the country, and were living two *very* different lifestyles, so I don’t feel like we ever really knew each other that well.

I was heartbroken when news of his death came in. We had planned for me to go spend the summer out in Cali with him and his friends. I had really been looking forward to it. Instead, my first trip to California was to attend his funeral.

I briefly met his girlfriend, Roksana, while I was there. I wanted to talk to her more in-depth, but she was really not in a good emotional place and I just wasn’t able to. They were together for give or take 7 years (I’m not entirely sure when they started dating) and by all accounts were crazy for one-another. I know when he cane to visit me at school he was constantly talking about her and how awesome she was and he thinks we would really get along. I’m fairly certain he intended to propose before long. 

Obviously things didn’t work out that way.

She has been on my brain alot lately, because she is the person who knew my brother best for his last few years. I want to speak to her, and just ask her how he has been, and what he was like, and how his life has been since he left. These were all things that I wanted ti know about him before, but obviously I can’t ask him now.

But I don’t know how to broach it, as I really am a stranger to her. And compounding that, I’m not sure it is a good idea.

From talking to some of their friends in California that I’ve been in contact with, she is taking it *really* hard. Theyre telling me that since his death, she has pretty much been shut-in the apartment, only coming out to go to work. She doesn’t go out with friends anymore, where they used to all the time. They say they dont think she is really eating, or sleeping. 

I don’t want to make things worse by making her talk to me when she is in this state. I just want to know my brother, and she is really the only one I know of that can help. And maybe I can help her in some ways, too? 

I’d really like to reach out and talk to her, but I don’t want to make her feel worse. Is it okay to contact her?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My brother died a couple months back. I want to reach out and talk to his girlfriend, but I don’t know if she is in a state to talk about him, or if she ever will be. Is it okay to try?"
"My (28f) neighbors (50s/60sF) dogs bark constantly. I have tried everything to get her to take care of it but can't/won't. My next step is getting her dogs taken away, should do it?


Some things I need to say:

1. I have thought about it and this is not a legal issue, since I've been going round and round with this situation for almost 1.5 years, I am very well aware of my legal rights/responsibilities. 

2. Barking is only one of the issues and the one that affects me the most, but she is also hugely neglectful of the dogs and doesn't take care of them beyond feeding them. I put the main issue in the title. 

So background on the situation, I bought my first house about 3 years ago and I literally love it. It's am amazing 1920s craftsman in the heart of our downtown. I've put my heart, money and soul into this place. 

about 2 years ago a couple moved in catty corner to me. The man was very nice but his wife would scream at him constantly, they'd have huge battles and finally one day I heard him say ""I'm not f---- doing this anymore"" and he left, I literally have not seen him since. Almost to the day after I heard this, the wife started accumulating dogs. I think at the most she's had at least 7 and maybe more at any given time. I know that several have died so I would guess she's gone through 10 dogs on a rotating basis in the last several years. 

I need to say here that we have a neighborhood facebook page and I think it was through this that she found my page and friend requested me. I figured why not so I regularly see her updates. Her entire page is kind of like a combination of ""oldpeoplefacebook"" and ""dankmemes"" and ""cringe"" all put together with 90% of her page being things like self created memes that say ""happiness is dogs!"" ""99% of my life is my dogs, the other 1% is details."" So in her brain and/or outward appearances she is a huge dog lover. 

But the reality is totally different. Her dogs bark constantly. I mean constantly. There isn't a minute that goes by in any day where her dogs aren't barking. I tried very politely to ask her if she could bring them in so I could sleep, she said no since they scared her birds. I offered to take them all for walks (for free) since maybe the bark because they are so couped up in a small yard. I even contacted rescue organizations who peeked over the wall and contacted neighbor to take the dogs because of the horrible conditions they live in, but she refused.  I've tried contacting our neighbors but they are both AirBnb owners and since people are generally in and out in a night, they haven't seen it as a problem. I tried one of those anti-bark ultra sonic device and that seemed like it made the problem worse. 

Finally I called the police. The police cited her for a noise violation but we went to court and the judge waived the fine. The judge actually scolded me saying that I was wasting his courts time and that this is the reason animal control exists. 

I called animal control and it was a nightmare to get through to them. When I finally did, the way the process is works is they send her a letter, she has 10 days to correct the problem and then I either call back and say it's fixed or its not. Well the first letter nothing happened so I requested another be sent. This one she responded to and said there's no problem at all and ignored it. Animal control did nothing and we had to start the process all over again, this time since she didn't fix the problem we had a county sponsored mediation where I explained the problem, played the recording I did with my go-pro (from my bedroom) but she refused to agree to any fixes. Next I had to keep a log of when the dogs barked for 15 days and then go before a judge. 

All of this had taken 3/4 of a year at this point, and I hadn't had a seconds peace in my own house. We went before the judge (not same as before) and she finally agreed she do something about the barking. She did nothing so we had to go before the judge again and he fined her $100 for every day the dogs had barked past the last court date which was something like $3200. He also warned her that the next step was the complete removal of her dogs by animal control and he had the authority under state law to prevent her from owning animals for up to five years (I think, not sure of the time frame). She begged and begged the judge that she would fix the problem and that her dogs were her life and that she would literally die if they were taken away and that since her husband left the only love she had in the world was her dogs. For the first time I actually felt sympathy towards her. 

That really got her attention and I had some peace and quiet for about 3 weeks. I even gave her some grace time when the dogs would bark for an hour or so. 

But this weekend the dogs started barking at about 6 AM Friday and have not stopped and it's not almost 3pm Sunday. Saturday evening, I went over to talk with her and I know she was home but she didn't answer the door. 

Basically, I call animal control the dogs are gone. 95% of me feels that she was just putting on a show for the judge with her speech but part of me worries that 5% chance it was true, she may really suffer from the dogs being taken away. 

Do I just need to call and get this moving? Have I put up with this long enough?

**tl;dr: my neighbors dogs bark constantly. I have been through almost 1.5 years of police, courts and animal control with her. The judge said next complaint and he bans her from owning animals. There's a small chance this will really affect her and I feel some guilt over that. What do I do**?

"Me [37M] and my wife [30F] 3 kids, together 10 years. She wants to sow wild oats. I want her to become an adult.


I'm the sole provider for our family. She's going to EMT school. 7/7 days I'm alone with our kids and I work. I work a high stress job Sunday through Wednesday 9pm-9am. She has class m/t/th. She ""works"" on Friday/Saturday nights and brings in about 150$total each week.  I make 60k/yr

Last night we had a talk about our relationship. During the conversation she said she felt like she needed to be wild. To sow some oats. I asked her if that meant having sex with other people and she said possibly. She had previously setup tinder for me to meet other women and has been pushing me to fuck them. I explained that while the idea was nice, I would prefer to just fuck her. We also talked about how we don't really talk and our anger issues. Our conversion revolved around my anger and especially jealousy of the amount of attention she gets. She is beautiful,  and sexy. I'm a guy. 

Before I went out tonight with her brother we had sex. At 1030pm I left. Before I left she told me to hook up with someone. To try to get a bj At least. I came home at 2am and... well I read her text messages. She's going out of town tomorrow for work and texted a classmate of hers ""alec"" at 1040pm, ten minutes after we had a conversation, and sex, that she was going to a different town tomorrow and he could join her. That she wouldn't take advantage of him unless he wanted her too. 

We're done right? 

That's literally showing no care at all about our conversation. About whatever feelings we shared. She literally texted a guy to have him travel with her and fuck her after we talked.


**TL;DR wife wants to sow wild oats. We talked. We fucked. 10 minutes after that she invited a guy to travel and stay in her hotel.**"
"I [27F] feel like a third-wheel in my own marriage compared to my best friend [25F] with my husband [28M],am I being overly jealous?


The three of us have been friends ever since I was around 6-years old, yeah we split apart for some years but we met whenever we could. I’ve been in a relationship with my husband for 5 years now and married for one, we’ve had a wonderful relationship throughout. We’re both musicians and love playing together, creating music, covers etc. But it’s mostly romantic or classical music.   
My best friend, let’s call her J, recently moved close by after being away for a number of years and of course we were overjoyed when we heard the news; we made a welcoming party, got her to know the neighbors and helped her settle in. J was interested in the recording room at our place and all the instruments we have and started coming over bc she wanted to record some of her own stuff, being friends we allowed her.

After like a week I come home and see them recording stuff together, apparently she kept nagging him to play/sing with her and he eventually gave in. Honestly I was a bit upset (which I know is stupid) because I considered duets our “together” time but I let it slide since they seemed to be having fun. After that she just started coming over more and more to sing with him until I told them to tone it down a notch but by then they already had like 6 complete covers.   
Whenever we go out together and she’s with us (like when we were showing her around town) people keeep thinking she’s his gf or commenting on how good their chemistry or vibes are. She’s really chummy with him and they seem to have a lot of inside jokes from even before we dated.

He seems to have a lot more fun singing with her than he does with me and her personality is a lot more bubbly than me by nature and it just seems to multiply when he’s around. I asked her how she felt about him and she told me she looks up to him but admitted to crushing on him when she was a teen, which was apparently because he helped her through a kinda rough patch in her life. Even if I wanted to do the kinds of songs they sing, my voice isn't the kind that sounds good in the metal music they like.   

I trust the both of them, a lot, and I don’t believe he’s cheating on me, they’re both wonderful people I’ve known for a long time. But seeing them together is painful to me. Idk if I‘m being unreasonable, or jealous or controlling but I need an outside perspective on this

**tldr**: Old-time best friend of both me and my husband reappeared and now I feel like a third-wheel whenever she’s around"
"I (F27) recently found out my mom (F54) fought against letting me get psychiatric care when I was a teenager and I feel betrayed


I was diagnosed with clinical depression a few years ago, but it started when I was 10 years old. When I became a teenager, it steadily began to get worse, I went from being a straight A student to barely passing. I had no friends, I had hallucinations, I self harmed and had suicidal ideations. I ended up dropping out of community college when I was 19, I attempted suicide when I was 22, I've been in the psych ward several times. I still have nightmares that I have to go back.

I became completely dysfunctional; unemployed, poor hygiene, borderline alcoholic, I'd lay in the dark all day and cry. For several years after my attempt, I thought about suicide every day, a warm glowing exit sign in the darkest place. I was in constant pain, an ache in my chest that didn't recede for years. I'm slowly getting better, but my emotional health is still shaky and I feel like a failure everyday, I still feel like I live in the shadow of the worst time of my life. The only ""adult"" accomplishments I've made is that I'm not living at my parents and I've gotten married. I can only work part time because my mental health is so fragile. It's humiliating when my old teachers see me working a retail job in my home town. It's frustrating to me that I will probably never experience true independence.

I recently found out from my father (M56), while he was apologizing to me about my mental health, that he had discussed with my mother that I was unhappy and needed help when I was a teenager. She fought against it, told him I was fine, and ended any further conversation on the topic despite him pushing for it numerous times throughout the years.

I thought I was okay with this, but just broke down into big ugly sobs about it because I feel so betrayed. I knew I needed help when I was as young as 12 and I didn't know how to ask for it. I was still a kid, I needed someone to take care of me, I didn't understand what was happening to me. I've suffered greatly because of my depression and missed out on a lot in life. I know from her comments when I was attending therapy as an adult that she denied me help because she was afraid of looking bad to the therapist and doctors. She's made comments about, ""be sure to not blame it all on me,"" or, ""don't make me look bad!"" like, that's what was on my mind at the time. 

Unrelated, but to give you a small taste of her parenting style, she's made ""jokes"" about how now I look like Sally from Nightmare Before Christmas because of my self harm scars and that really hurts. I'm super ashamed and self-conscious about them.

I feel like my future was ripped from me. I know with mental illness, I probably would have never been 100%, but she was fine with letting me float on my own. For years I figured I'd suffered unnoticed and in silence, but to know that my parents knew and didn't do anything about it, I can't even articulate it... I literally almost fucking died. Several times. I FORCED myself to get help, but that was after I made a very real attempt on my life. I don't know where I found the strength, but it wasn't from her.

My sister had been diagnosed with a learning disorder when she was younger and my mom moved Heaven and Earth to accommodate her. I suffered badly from middle child syndrome and felt like I was unloved and a burden for most of my childhood. That's why it was so easy to believe my parents didn't see how badly I was hurting. Finding out they knew and she wouldn't let my dad do anything has shaken me to my core. She went out of her way to help my sister for years, but she couldn't handle taking me to a therapist. Just to have had my pain recognized and validated at that age could have made all the difference to my younger self.

I'm super salty about this and  want to go no contact with my mom, but she's unfortunately part and parcel with my dad. How do I proceed with a low contact relationship with my mom? Should I tell her that I know now? Should I try to have a discussion with her about this or just leave it? How do I handle her when I have to see her in person? How do I let go of my salt and ""what-ifs""?

TLDR: Had troubles with depression at the onset of adolescence, never got help for it until early adulthood after a suicide attempt. Assumed my parents hadn't noticed, found out from my father they did notice and my mom fought him about getting me help because she was afraid of looking bad. I feel salty and betrayed and don't know how to continue a relationship with my mom."
"Guy (25m) I'm (20f) known/dating for about a year says he's going to participate in a ""secret martial arts tournament in Taiwan."" This is 100% BS right?


Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am pretty active on this thread and I know for sure that this will get an accusation of a ""creative writing project"" and that's fair. I'm just asking that you hear me out because I fully acknowledge that this is probably total BS but I just want to make sure before I go nuclear on him. 

I'm in my last year and half of university at a really large state school. I'd say about 9 months ago a guy (Ken) from one of my classes asked me out. He is incredibly good looking but I didn't know much about him so in order to not get myself in a bad situation, we met for coffee on campus. It turns out he's ex military at school on his GI Bill, he's in ROTC to go back as a higher rank, is a good student and is really into books, working out, self improvement and working out as well as martial arts. He seemed so much more mature than any of the other guys I'd dated and I really liked him and started seeing more of him. 

So things were really, really cool for a long time and although he had a lot going on, it was all very believable (for example, i'd see him in his Army uniform on ROTC days, he is very well read, in great shape and he helps teach the beginning Karate class with the entry PE classes). But things just kind of got weird, for example we went to watch UFC at a bar on the Air Force base close to us and he was saying things like ""oh that's a such such square shape choke"" (or whatever, I have no idea) and a guy next to us said something like ""actually that's a such and such super kick."" Ken actually ended up getting in this guys face screaming ""I'm a black belt in Karate, I know what the fuck I'm talking about!"" The guy shouted back and they both ended up getting kicked out. I hadn't been in a situation like that since I was in high school and it was so humiliating. I expected Ken to sleep it off and apologize the next morning for putting me in that spot. 

Instead he seemed to double down on his knowledge and I think almost the first words out of his mouth the next day were like ""can you believe that guy had the balls to challenge me on martial arts knowledge?"" It was such a stupid, pissing match contest I didn't care and I said I was actually embarrassed at the way he acted and while I am interested in martial arts I didn't care who knew what things were called in a bar (I've always wanted to do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, should have said this in the beginning and one of the reasons I liked Ken because I thought maybe he'd inspire me to finally start). I told Ken I needed a little break and that I still really liked him, I just needed some time to process what had happened. 

Well instead of backing off he actually doubled down on the martial arts stuff. First he emailed me like pdf files of descriptions of moves explaining why he was right. Then he signed me up for an introductory class at his off campus Karate school. When finally I told him I really wanted to do JiuJitsu he said his method was supreme. I said I really just like the look of JiuJitsu. 

So this Saturday I finally saw him again and he started almost making fun of me for wanting to try JiuJitsu. I tried to explain it to him that I'm not really into learning the ""best"" method, I just thought it looked like fun and good exercise. This is where things got f-ing crazy. He then told me that I needed to take him seriously as he's done a ""secret tournament in Taiwan every summer since he was 19"" and that JiuJitsu is great in the UFC but in ""real"" martial arts where ""death is on the line"" (yes, he actually said that) his style was the best. I was incredulous and asked if he was going this summer. He said ""of course."" 

I tried to change the subject but he kept going on and on about martial arts, secret tournaments and finally I had such a headache just from the sound of his voice I had to leave. I cut the date short and had him take me to my apartment. 

I do feel bad about this part because my roomates were home and we talked shit about him late into the night. We also did a ton of google searching on ""secret"" martial arts tournaments and the best we can gather is a ton of people used to claim they were real but since the internet age has come about and you can fact check anyones story, it's almost 100% that ""secret tournaments"" were never really a thing. 

The thing that sucks is I really liked him. I liked that he's in the military, I liked the fact that he's so smart and well read, I liked that he's in great shape and good looking so this really sucks. And it seems like there's ZERO reason for him to have said these things, our relationship wasn't built on him being like a bad martial arts movie. 

I haven't seen him since Saturday, though we've shared niceties over text. I usually see him on Tuesday afternoons between classes and I don't know what to say. 

My two questions are:

1. This secret tournament thing is complete BS right?

2. Is there any way past this?


**tl;dr:** I am dating a guy I really, really like for many reasons. However he recently said he has fought in a ""secret"" martial arts tournament in Taiwan and is going again this summer. This is BS right and is there any way past this?

"One year ago my (28f) husband (31m) quit his corporate job to create an artisanal welding company. Business has not been great and he wants to quit, I want to use my inheritance and stick it out because he so much happier.


Edit I didn’t realize this is so long, Tia for reading 

 So background on this is my husband had a great corporate job where he was steadily climbing the ladder but was miserable and not happy. He pretty much spent most of his free time creating these gorgeous welded security gates for doors and windows as well as some other neat little craft items. A realtor drove by and saw our gates and started asked where they come from and I told her that my husband made them. In a a few days she had orders for three of the houses she was listing and it really seemed like he might be able to make a living at this.

So with my full encouragement he quit his job and started up his company where he basically welds these artisan all items full-time. His mood went from sour all the time except for weekends to being happy to wake up and spending 12 to 14 hours a day working without even realizing that time had passed. He was happier I was happier our kids are happier everyone was happy.

He’s had a few orders but to put to but it in terms of dollars, his salary has essentially been cut by about 75%.  We arent struggling to pay our mortgage or feed ourselves but we arent saving for retirement our kids college. but to be totally honest I’m very happy with that because just in general we have such a better life. 

He’s freaking out that he made a huge mistake and behind my back went and talk to his former employers and they said they would be happy to take them on as soon as he is ready to start. They even offered a 15% raise and 6 extra vacation days they are so desperate for somebody with his experience 

 Without even really talking to me he accepted the job is and is supposed to start again on Monday. I’m begging him to reconsider because I just don’t want to go back to the life that we left, but he says he’s fully committed to this. I know his former supervisor very well so I called, which maybe I shouldn’t of done, and asked if there were any options. His supervisor told me that they would be willing to work out any number of arrangements with my husband because they are so desperate to have him back .  My head I formulated that my husband could go back to work half time at his former employer and still continue to do the welding thing and I could supplement our living expenses with some inheritance money that I’ve never really touched that I got from my grandma.

 I addressed this with my husband last night and he said that no, he just can’t mentally handle doing two things at once. I’m absolutely brokenhearted because I just don’t want to go back to the way it was before. I begged my husband to please consider using The inheritance money because that’s why we have it. He said he’s worried that I resent him you because it’s in evitable that his business is going to fail. My thing is is that it’s going to take off someday and we need to just expand our market outside of the pretty small city that we live in. That onc his crafts get widely known I bet we could do better monetarily in the long run.

I would love any advice. To ask a direct question what should we do in this situation? Do I just need to back off and let him do his thing? Or is it appropriate for me to continue to press the issue?

 *tl;dr: Hudsand is ready to quit his artisinal welding company after one year on his business. He is so much happier ( and we are so much happier as a family) with him not working in the corporate world. He got  his former job back and is ready to start Monday but I am desperate for him to consider other options including working bith jobs part time and even using my inheritance to keep his business afloat so we don’t have to go back to that miserable corporate lifestyle.*"
"I [19 M] have been told that I only have 2-3 years left. Suggestions on how I should tell my best/closest friend of 5 years [18 M] about this?


So, I've recently had a few tests and things performed, and without getting into any potentially identifying details, something was detected as a result, giving me about 2-3 years until I'm gone.

I'm not going to bottle this up and not tell my friend, as I feel like that's going to lead to more pain, and possibly feelings of betrayal amongst all the other emotions that'll flood in when the time arrives.

And this is where I need your help, Reddit. I'm not sure how I should word and deliver this. I feel that ""I'm going to die in 2, possibly 3 years"" is a bit blunt and might hurt quite a bit, but I don't want to drag it out either.

Any suggestions?

"I think my (21m) older brother (27m) is abusing his girlfriend


My older brother “Sam” and his girlfriend “Sarah” have been together for almost 4 years. They live together and have a dog, and everything up until recently has seemed to be okay. 

I always looked up to my older brother for advice and he is my best friend. That’s why this is so hard. 

Two weeks ago I went out for supper with Sam and Sarah and my girlfriend came along too and noticed that Sarah was quieter than usual. She is usually bubbly and cheery. 

As the night went on I was talking to Sam about my graduating soon and my girlfriend was talking to Sarah. At one point, Sarah laughed loudly at something my girlfriend said and all of a sudden Sam got angry and grabbed Sarah by the arm and whispered something to her. 

Sarah almost recoiled when this happened and didn’t say much for the rest of the night. I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t sure what I had just seen and it was so unlike Sam to do something like that.  

But when my girlfriend and I got home, she told me that Sam really scared her when he did that and that she’s worried about Sarah. 

Am I overreacting? Sam has always been my best friend and has always been such a good guy and I don’t know how he could do that or what it even means. 

Should I confront him? Or ask Sarah what’s going on?

I’m really upset at this. Our dad used to abuse our mom so I thought he would know better. He knows what we went through growing up. 

What should I do? 

Tl;dr: I think my brother is abusing his girlfriend and I don’t know what to do about it "
"My [24F] childhood best friend [26M] says he wants to marry me and convert to Islam. Advice please?


This is my first time posting on Reddit, so first of all hello world!

Okay, so background: I am Asian and from a practising Muslim family. I wear a headscarf and refrain from pork, alcohol etc., but really it doesn't affect me much in the long run - my best friends are all non-Muslims who respect what I do and vice versa. 

The said 26M, Nick, is the son of a friend of my mother's (Lucy). She converted to Islam when I was about four and gets on very well with my mother, whom she asked to be a witness at her conversion ceremony. Her husband is an atheist but they have a very good relationship. Nick and I used to play together quite a lot as children before he moved away, we then reconnected by going to the same uni, where we hung out a lot and became really good friends. We make each other laugh and we really clicked. I had a massive crush on him but kept telling myself that nothing would come of it, I decided early on that I wanted to marry a Muslim to make general life easier. It doesn't help that physically he is definitely way more attractive than I am. 

The last few months he's been having loads of questions about Islam, which his mum and I were of course happy to discuss with him. But today he asked me to meet him and basically told me that he's in love with me and has been for years, he thinks I'm really funny and even though he hasn't really seen me without a headscarf since we were children he claimed I'm gorgeous. Essentially, he proposed, and said he wanted to convert. 

I asked if he was only converting for me and he said definitely not, he planned on converting anyway because he'd been intrigued ever since he was a child, but that he loved me and talking through religious matters with me in a logical way had really helped him cement his decision. 

I told him we should discuss it further, even though he insisted he'd been thinking about proposing to me for a long time and was sure he'd thought everything through. I really want to say yes to him. But I never expected this to happen. Frankly, I think he's wrong - I'm super short, average-looking and on the plump side, he's... not. He could definitely do better than me and it feels too good to be true. What do I do?

TLDR: A childhood friend proposed to me, and I'm worried he hasn't really considered everything that's involved - namely, changing religions and the fact I'm really not that great a catch. I don't want him to regret it."
"How do I (23/f) be okay with my boyfriend's (26/m) relationship with his sister (24/f)?


We'll call his sister, Anna, and him Ben. 

Anna and I have been friends for a few years, and she set me and Ben up after he saw me at a party and thought I was cute about a year ago, last April. Ben lives in a different country but is visits ours for work fairly often. I checked in with Anna to make sure it was okay, she was like ""100% go for it!"" and we had a great date. That date turned into the entire weekend... then plans to hopefully see each other soon after he went home. 

Anna seemed super excited about it and said we should both visit Ben's city together soon. I told her I was getting my schedule from work soon and would let her know. The next day, my schedule came out with just one five day weekend (we work weird shifts) and I immediately texted Ben the days I would be free in June. He offered to buy my plane ticket, and he did on the spot. When I got home from work, I texted Anna the dates and that she should come, too.

She texted back with a long, stern message of how I screwed up by texting her after I texted her brother, outlining everything that happened that day and how I should have done it instead, making her feel like I planned the whole thing with her as an afterthought and ""made her feel like sh*t"",  which was of course not the case at all just a misunderstanding as I couldn't do any planning at work. I felt really bad that maybe it did come off that way, and sincerely apologized for my poor timing. But in the end I only had that one weekend free, and I wouldn't have bought the ticket if he didn't. I tried to call her to explain that but she told me ""it wouldn't end well if we talked tonight."" 

The next morning, she texts a ""Oh we're totally fine - I know you'd never hurt me!"" 

Following that, Ben and I become official and she can't handle it. She unfollowed me on social media, would have long skype calls about how 'I swept her brother away' and how she was jealous of our relationship, etc. I feel for her because it sounds to me like she's seen her older brother as a fatherly figure, and they've had a rocky past and not the best sibling relationship. But still, this hurt so much coming from a trusted friend. She acted visibly uncomfortable when we were all together, going as far as storming out of a restaurant and hiding in the streets after Ben and I were holding hands and laughing (had she texted one of us we would have stopped!) Our friendship was strained for months, I would ask what was wrong but she'd reply ""nothing."" and wouldn't give me eye contact for a long time. Though it was an ""Anna and Ben"" thing that was projected on me, god, it f-ing hurt. 

Moving to now, well, not only did they make up but now they can't get enough of each other it seems. She moved in his place to care for him for two weeks when we was injured. When he's in our city visiting me, they need 'alone time' by getting dinner and drinks for three hours (he's there for a weekend). Now, they're back in their home country together with family, again hanging out all the time and going for drinks alone, eating all their meals together. All of this has happened in the past 4 weeks. And although Anna and I haven't had any talks about this since maybe August, out of nowhere her and I are best friends again. Not that I mind, I'm just so confused.

I could just never understand the nature of this. I have a brother, too. I never wanted him to ""make me feel like a priority, special, beautiful, supported"" (my boyfriend's words of what she wants from him). And I feel kinda second place now. Him and I have been struggling lately too, conveniently, the past 4 weeks that they've been barely getting enough time with each other.

This matters, because I'm moving to his city soon, leaving all my friends and family behind, signing a two year contract for a job, etc. He mentioned that he really wants her to move to his country, and that she might, which gives me a baby lil panic attack because of how quickly and sharply she's turned on me before, and how much time they spend together now. He had my back when we were first dating and this all went down, but should this happen again, he's already said things like ""you just need to look the other way and give her a pass."" 

Whew sorry that was so long. How do I get to a place where I can be okay with this?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Sister (my friend) set us up, was totally okay with it until it WASN'T OK AT ALL (and too late for me to back out). Now, months later, not only is she suddenly my friend again but Anna and Ben are attached by the hip which is new for them, and I feel really weird about the whole thing and want to be ok with it before I move in with Ben and close the LDR gap."
"My girlfriend [30F] says I’m [26M] too uptight. I think she’s lazy.


I moved in with my girlfriend 6 months ago and I am considering breaking up over her habits at home. She’s lazy at keeping the apartment clean. She separates the kitchen sink into two parts: one for her dirty dishes and the other for my dirty dishes. She won’t wash her dishes until the sink is full or there are no more clean utensils. Usually there will be a weeks worth of dirty dishes in the sink. It’s disgusting and when I tell her to wash the dishes she’ll say I’m nagging her. 

She won’t throw out the trash. She’ll let the bin overflow and use plastic bags to contain the extra trash instead of going out to clear the trash. I went away for 3 days to visit some family and when I came back the trash was not cleared out and there were flies in this dustbin. She also doesn’t put her dishes in the sink. If she has pasta on the couch she’ll leave the dirty plate on the coffee table until I tell her multiple times to put it in the sink. 


She cannot cook anything except for: eggs, boiled vegetables, instant noodles. I didn’t realise that she eats outside everyday for every meal. So now I cook everyday but she doesn’t even clean up even though I’ve asked her to help. She says she’ll do it but never does it. When she does laundry she doesn’t fold her clothes and just dumps it on the floor or her bed. Her closet is so full of clothes that you can't open with a mountain of clothes falling out. Her laundry basket is always full of dirty clothes because she’s too lazy to do laundry. She will wait until the pile of clean clothes on her bed is gone before doing any laundry. 


Am I wrong to think she’s lazy and dirty? I love her, but I am feeling resentful and annoyed after 6 months of living together. She’s 30 and still cannot prepare a meal for herself. I finally sat her down and told her her habits are making me feel resentful and she says I’m just an uptight person. Am I? Is her way of living normal? With my ex-girlfriend we had a system of ensuring the sink was clean and empty and all the trash was cleaned out before going to bed. The living place was always clean and tidy and laundry was done promptly. There was no scoring system. Whoever came home first cleared the trash and we did the dishes alternately. Is my ex an unicorn and am I really being unreasonable and uptight? 

**tldr** GF says I'm uptight about cleanliness, I think she's lazy and dirty. She doesn't wash the dishes, cook, clean, take out the trash or do laundry promptly. "
"I (35M) had a very abusive and terrible childhood. My girlfriend (27F) wants me to seek therapy for it, but I don't want to. She has continued to push it even when I told her no. Now she is blaming all of my problems on the fact that I won't go and get psychiatric help.


Grew up in harlem in the 1990s in the projects. Dad was a dealer, barely home, mom was a drug addict, so I was raised by my 4 aunties. I had a very rough childhood. At just 15-16 years old I carried a gun for self protection because my area was so ridiculously rough. I wasn't even a bad kid, I got good grades and went to a good school downtown, but it didn't really matter, I was still the target for gangs and dealers and everyone who didn't like me. Because of something my dad did, men went up to me and my friend and stabbed us and beat us. I was in the hospital for 4 weeks recovering. 

I moved to westchester to be with my girlfriend at the time after the incident. I cant even express how much of a change it was to go from the projects to go to a nice wealthy white suburban family, they treated me like family, helped me get a job, made sure I continued school etc. I ended up going to brown university. My girlfriend at the time broke up with me, but she came out as a lesbian, so nothing changed, we remained good friends. 

Anyways, long short short, I went from a terrifying childhood in the projects to going to brown university. 

Its been a long time, and I've been with my current girlfriend for 4 years now. I love her very much, but for lack of a better term, she can be kind of... sheltered? Idk if that makes sense. She is kind of a bit of a stereotypical liberal hipster white girl, and it can result in her being kind of ignorant to the realities of how I grew up a lot of the time. When I tell her stories about my childhood, she literally gasps in fear sometimes, or worse, she starts to cry and ask how anyone could possibly go through something so horrible. I know she is just trying to be good to me, but it can be a bit unnerving. One time I wanted to tell her a funny joke that involved my aunt slapping me on the back of the head and when I laughed she told me it wasn't funny and then spent the whole dinner asking how I could possibly think it was funny. We went hiking with a friend who I grew up with, me and the friend were laughing and making jokes about people in our neighborhood being violent and stuff, and my girlfriend actually got a bit mad that we thought that was something okay to joke about, and confronted me and asked why I was being so calm about such serious stuff. 

Recently, in the past 4 months or so, she has been asking that I go to therapy. I told her no, I dont want to. I'm not exactly made out of money, and I don't feel I need it. At first she backed off, but over time it got worse, she kept saying I really have to go, and that nobody can just go through what I went through as a kid and be okay. Then she started saying that the only reason I dont want to go is because I, as a man, am told I cant express my feelings and that my childhood probably imparted that on me. She was basically saying the reason I dont want to go is because my masculinity makes me not want to go. 

Now, since we had those series of arguments, she blames all of my problems on the fact that I have some untreated trauma or something. Like, a lot of stuff. I was late to an event, and she literally told me ""you would feel so much more organized and on time to things if you just went and sought mental health treatment"". When the house was a mess, she sort of implied the reason why I didnt clean it up was because I am mentally ill and refuse to treat it. One time we both went on vacation, and I wanted to get drunk with a few friends, and she said I shouldn't get drunk because people like me are prone to alcoholism. 

I am just... really frustrated at these comments. I dont think she means to be hurtful but it really is hurtful what she is saying. I am not some traumatized monster who cries in the bathroom alone at night because of my horrific memories or whatever like she thinks I am. She is *so damn convinced* I have some hidden trauma. It honestly kind of hurts my feelings that she has begun to think of me this way... The thing is, not only can I not afford therapy, at this point I just would feel like I am giving into her demands if I went. 

I don't want to break up, not at all. And please, don't think she is some terrible person based on what I said, don't forget this is supposed to be me complaining about a problem with her, so all you hear are the negatives. She is an absolutely amazing girlfriend overall and has many, many positives. This is just... a very big negative. 

What am I supposed to do? She acts so incredibly sheltered to the realities of how I grew up, and this is kind of the result of that. 

TL;DR - - Had a rough childhood. Girlfriend wants me to seek therapy for it. I dont want to. She blames all my problems now on the fact that I wont get therapy. "
"My sister (30) asked me (34M) if I'd be okay with being named guardian of her kids in her will incase something happened to her. I'm not and now my family hates me.


Hate may be a strong word, but they're certainly not happy.

My sister has two kids, one five and one two. I love them, but I'm also content just being their uncle (I also said the best part about kids is being able to hand them back to their parents). My sister is my only sibling and we've always been fairly close. 

Yesterday she asked me if I'd be comfortable with her naming me as guardian of her children in case something ever happened to her or her husband. I said no. You would've thought I told her I hated the kids, that's how badly she reacted. She asked me if I'd rather they go into foster care or our elderly parents take care of them, and I said our parents are a perfectly acceptable alternative since they'd need something to occupy their time now that they're older. She stormed out of my house and told my parents. I've been called numerous times and texted by my mother who's called me every name under the sun and told me what a selfish person I'm being. My dad has also told me he supports my mom and thinks I should ""pull my head out of my ass and think of someone other than me"". Even my own girlfriend is blaming me for this.

Look, the truth is that yes, I make more than enough money to support a family. I'm very well off. However, I never wanted children. I don't even want a pet because it'd take away from the lifestyle I currently enjoy. While I fully intend on marrying my girlfriend at some point, I've been very clear to her about not wanting children because it would take away from us and the life we have together. Yes, this includes adopting my sister's kids.

My girlfriend is now pissed and saying she doesn't know if she can be with someone as selfish as me. She's trying at every turn to make me feel guilty, as are my family members. Is there a way to make my point clearer without coming across as such an asshole? I agree that I'm selfish. But better my sister find a better guardian for her kids than me, who'd be a terrible parent.

tl;dr: Refused to be named guardian of my sister's kids in case something happened to her. Butthurt from everyone close to me in my life ensues."
"My son[10 M] plays baseball. My wife [37 F] has become THAT sports parent. I'm [39 M] the coach.


Throwaway account. Too many IRL folks know my primary.

My son plays rec league baseball, and I coach his team. Note this is not super intense, hyper competitive youth travel ball. This is standard park rec league - everybody who signs up gets to play, evaluations are done to make sure teams are pretty even in terms of talent.

My son likes baseball when he's playing it. He likes being outside, being around his friends, having a jersey with his name on it. He doesn't like it enough to want to put in extra practice time or take any kind of lessons. He really doesn't care for team practices all that much. As such, he's a pretty mediocre player. And really I'm being generous - given that he's not really a gifted athlete, coupled his unwillingness to train, he's actually pretty awful.

And I am perfectly OK with that. He plays right field. He bats at the bottom of the order. And he's OK with *that*.Because he has fun. He goofs around in the dugout with his buddies, chants for his teammates when they're batting, puts on his rally cap when we're trying stage a comeback, and spends the entire 4th inning begging me for cheese fries.

His mother (my wife), however is NOT okay with it. She is convinced our sweet child is the next Albert Pujols. If 10 balls get hit to him and he misses 9, she ONLY sees the one he gets. He's had 12 plate appearances this season. Struck out 9 times, most of them looking. Walked 3 times. She hangs her hat on those 3 walks to bolster her opinion that he has a great eye and should be moved further up the line up because his good decision making gets him on base.

She complains to me constantly. She thinks he should bat in the top 4 of the lineup and start at 1st base. She accuses me of being too hard on him and not giving him a fair shot. Anytime any of his teammates make an error, she loudly complains that *her* son could have easily made that play if he were just given the opportunity.

She's done this in previous seasons, but it's never been this bad. Lately she's been rallying the parents of some of the other kids who are not very good, getting all of them to complain that I'm not giving their kids a fair chance. Her parents won't talk to me because she convinced them I have given up on my son in order to promote other kids into better positions. The icing on the cake came after our game on Saturday when on the way home, she turned around in the car and said to my son, ""Don't worry baby. I know what you're capable of and how good you are even if your Dad refuses to recognize and punishes you by sticking you in the outfield.""

Here's the thing: I do give him (and all the kids) a fair shot. I make sure every kid gets at least one inning in the infield. I move my batting order around the first few games until I get a feel for who is going to try to get on base and who isn't. But the thing is some of the kids on this team are good. And they go the extra mile in practice, they go out and throw with their parents every night. They take hitting lessons. They want to be out there because they really love the actual game of baseball.

I've tried to explain to my wife that when I am on the field, I'm an advocate for all the kids on the team, not just my son. And even though it's rec league I owe it to them to put them in the best position to win. That means starting the best player at each position. To elevate my son over someone more deserving just because I'm the coach is the definition of Daddyball and I'm not going to do it.

Anyways, she's not hearing it. She remains convinced our kid is the superstar and I'm stealing his shine. She won't speak to me outside of one word responses to my questions or to again fuss at me about what position he plays. Not sure where to go from here.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My kid stinks at baseball but he loves being on the team. My wife thinks he's awesome and should be playing a high profile position. Since I'm the head coach, I feel like doing that would be playing Daddyball. It's affecting our marriage."
"[Update] My [26M] sister [27F] has just contacted me after not talking to me for 6 whole years. She says that she wants to meet up so that we can talk, and I'm having mixed feelings.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8alw40/my_26m_sister_27f_has_just_contacted_me_after_not/)

I did end up calling her back. I wasn't prepared to meet her right away, so I took a suggestion given to me in the previous thread and gave her my email. I told her I would rather us email together for a while before getting together, and that she could start by telling me what happened, where she has been for all this time, and why she's seeking me out now.

She initially sent me an extremely long email, so I'll just provide in outline what happened. So, according to her when we were around 15-16 she began to develop some inappropriate feelings towards me. She said in the beginning it wasn't anything serious, but she knew it was wrong. During the period in which our father got sick and eventually passed away she started to rely upon me more and more which made apparently made these feelings more intense. She felt like she couldn't be a good sibling to me like she felt that I needed at the time, and that continued contact between us would only make things worse. So she thought it was best if we just broke things off, like pulling off a bandaid I guess. She says that she knows things might have been hard for me so she's going to try to be honest and open with me going forward. So she admitted that she doesn't think that she's completely over it, but that I've been on her mind lately and she really doesn't like the way we left things. Since we've stopped talking, apparently she's been doing quite well for herself. She ended up finishing her CS degree and has been working as a software developer at a game development studio.

After emailing back and forth for about a day or so, I agreed to met her for coffee, and we planned to chat for 30 minutes or so. It went really well, and I was pretty happy to see her. We ended up talking and catching up for about an hour and twenty minutes, before I had to leave for a video chat I had scheduled. 

All in all I think this situation is very bittersweet for me. It's relieving to have some sort of closure/explanation after all this time, and it was really nice seeing her, and I look forward to maybe gradually including her in my life in the future. That being said, there is certainly a part of me that is very squicked out by the whole thing and would have preferred to be left in the dark or lied to.

**tl;dr**: Ended up choosing to contact her and see how things went. We emailed each other for a while then had a face to face at a coffee shop."
"My (23f) parents (50s) are tearing down my tree house to install a hot tub and gazebo. I know this sounds so childish but I'm devastated. It was my sanctuary from their constant fighting. How do I deal or convince them not to?


First of all thanks for reading, secondly let me apologize for the nature of this post. I know people have real problems out there and mine isn't one of them but this is deeply affecting me. 

So background on my childhood, my parents ran a business together and constantly fought. I mean constantly, the fights would sometimes devolve into physical altercations that were terrifying to me. I was an only child so I think I'm the only person in the world besides them who knows how bad it actually got. To the outside world, we were a very normal family. When I was 6, my grandpa asked me what I wanted most for my birthday. Even then I knew I wanted to escape so I said a treehouse. 

I helped my grandpa with every single nail in that place and it became my literal sanctuary when there was utter chaos in my house. I was in there when it was 100 degrees outside, I was in there when it was below freezing. I painted it every year, I decorated it, I treated it like it was almost a religious retreat for me. I came home every summer from college and cleaned, painted and even slept in it most of the time. 

I permanently   moved out about a year ago but I also had fantasies that I could someday introduce my kids to my tree house someday. In my ultimate pie in the sky dreams, I thought about taking it apart board by board and reassembling it in my own yard. 

Yesterday I got an email from my mom that almost as a footnote, she said very casually ""oh me and your father are tearing out that old oak tree with your ugly treehouse and finally putting in a gazebo with a hot tub! Aren't you excited for us?"" 

My parents always denied how much they scared me when they fought, they also flat out deny that the fights got as bad as they did. Or they say that since they found Christ, the fights and altercations have been ""forgiven"" and I should forgive them too. But I just can't forget and now threatening to tear down my special space seems like the ultimate admission that they either don't know or just don't care how much they tormented me with their constant battles. 

I'm crushed over this. Apparently its coming down Saturday and I just can't get home to do anything about it. I asked politely if they could try to please save the pieces and my mom said ""we're hiring laborers, I just don't think they'll care enough to try."" Thanks a lot mom. 

What can I do here? I'm so crushed. Is this just a part of growing up and being an adult that I have to deal with? Should I pay over $1200 for a last minute ticket tomorrow and try to save as much as I can?


**tl;dr: my parents are tearing down my child hood treehouse and I'm devastated. How do I deal with this? How far should I go to save it?**

"My brother (33/M) is letting his stripper girlfriend (36/F) move in. He's blinded by her big boobs and big butt and fails to realize he's being used and manipulated. An intervention is needed - I really truly need your help.


TL;DR My (29/M) brother (33/M) moved in and out of his self-centered stripper girlfriend's (36/F) house within two weeks because it was not working out. Now she and her kids are going to move in with him only after he builds a $25k garage he can't afford so she can park her Mercedes. He cares more about her looks than her manipulative personality.


I'll try to keep this short but really need help. My brother is divorced, he was married to a beautiful girl who simply used him while she got her degree. He was absolutely miserable while married (they had two children) and they divorced after she graduated.


Fast forward a couple years and he's headed down the same track. He's been dating a stripper that has 4 children, is a felon, is abusive, and has tons of unwanted baggage. Three weeks ago, I helped him move into her house. Apparently is wasn't working out, my brother is a total slob and she is a clean freak. She even punched him in the face and gave him a mark so bad he took a day off work. 


So last week he calls and says he's moving out. He spent that weekend with me, self-medicated with alcohol, and was drunk the from Friday night to Sunday night, even polished off an entire bottle of wine Sunday morning. This girl is making him miserable, but seriously he only cares about what's on the outside. They fight constantly and his drinking/smoking has increased significantly, he's falling into the same trap.


So we move him out (RIP 2nd weekend in a month) and he tells me she and her kids are going to move in with him. I didn't say anything at the time, but this is the worst thing that can happen. She's recently retired from stripping and wants to be a stay-at-home mom while my brother makes all the money. There are so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.


First, his house is barely big enough for 3 of them, there's no space for 4 more people. They would be doubling or tripling up bedrooms for the kids. Second, he is a total slob and she's a complete clean freak. He vacuums twice a year and she vacuums twice a day. I refused to take my shoes off while carrying 60 lbs dressers down her stairs and she now hates me. She can't compromise - sure I understand you like clean carpets (my shoes were very clean), but I also like not breaking my toes. She didn't lift a finger either weekends, not even carrying the light stuff.


She now has no source of income and it's either moving in with my brother or moving back home to her abusive family. Now here's where it gets really interesting. All of a sudden my brother wants to take out a loan to build a $25,000 garage (he cannot afford this) and she's going to move in when the garage is done. She has a nice Mercedes and I can only assume she convinced him to get a garage so she can park it there. 


She only cares about herself and will not compromise at all. Soon my brother's house will have rules that he'll have to take off shoes and so on. A lot of my brother's furniture is old and dirty and soon she'll start saying ""We should get a new couch"" when really she means ""You should buy me a new couch so I have a place to watch TV while you work"".


My mom and I agree we need to intervene. I want to bring in a realtor so he can learn how stupid adding a garage to a house that needs internal work really is. I guess I'm writing because I'm not sure how to intervene. I really need help here. "
"I (22F) don’t know what to do about my boyfriends (22M) resentment of my Crohn’s disease.


My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I have Crohn’s disease and it honestly sucks. I’ve been diagnosed for 2 years. I’ve had 17 inches of my colon removed after a horrible infection. I feel sick most days and when it’s not the Crohn’s disease it’s my arthritis or my constant kidney/bladder infections or my chronic anemia or my random migraines that give me crazy light shows or maybe even my recurring ovarian cysts.

He resents me because I’ve only been working 25-27 hours since last October. He resents me because we are in credit card debt + medical debt (from me). I’m currently working on getting a full time job again. I hope I’ll be hired on by the end of the month. 

He’s been upset all day and I asked him what he wanted to do. He said he what he wants isn’t possible because I’m always sick. He’s been making a lot of snide comments about me faking being sick. I hurt my back/shoulder today at work (Again) and told him about it when he got home. He just said I was careless. 

I feel like he thinks if I just tried hard enough I wouldn’t be sick anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’m trying really hard to be healthy but it is not working.

tl:dr My boyfriend resents me for being chronically ill, I don’t know what to do about that."
"My boyfriend [27M] said I make all our problems about me [28F]. How do I stop?


My boyfriend and I have been going through a rough patch. We had an issue that we were working through and I was feeling really low about it yesterday. He came and hugged me and asked what was wrong, and we talked for a bit. He was explaining why a certain thing has been a problem for him, and I started crying and told him I felt like a burden to him. He blew up at me. He yelled at me for five minutes about how I always have to make every single situation about myself. He went so far as to say he was going to leave, but then changed his mind and stayed. 


I think he's right. When we have problems, I have a tendency to talk about how I'm feeling and get upset about how things affect me. He'd told me that he was feeling upset by something his friends were doing (somewhat related to me), and I'd made that into me being the problem, not them. He said he doesn't tell me stuff anymore, because he knows I'll just turn it into a problem with me.


The thing is, I don't think I do this in any other areas of life. I looked it up and it's called personalising, assuming something is about you. But all the advice is for people who do it for *everything*, like 'oh it's raining, why is my day always ruined by bad weather', stuff like that. I only do it in our relationship. When something bad comes up, if he's in a mood or things aren't going well, I assume it's about me and I don't really believe him when he tells me otherwise.


Another example is that we hadn't been as active in the bedroom. I'd asked him multiple times about it and he would always say he was just really tired and didn't have much sex drive recently. But I decided to myself that he must not find me attractive any longer, since he hasn't had this problem in other relationships. He mentioned that as an example of him telling me the problem and me assuming it was me anyway.


I didn't even realise I was doing it until he pointed it out, but I do see it now and I think it's partly a defensive thing - I want him to reassure me that I'm not the issue. But he's sick of having to do that, and I can't blame him. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you teach yourself to look at situations and not assume the worst? And how do I do this without becoming completely submissive? I'm worried that I'll go too far the other way and when we have a problem, I won't feel able to talk about my feelings or tell him when something affects me.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: When we have disagreements, I tend to focus on me being the problem in the situation, even when he's telling me that's not the case. I don't know how to stop thinking like this."
"I [24M] told my wife [24F] of 5 years that I wanted to separate last week. This has been extremely one sided and I don't know where to go from here.


Before I go into my current situation I'll give some background on my decision.

My wife and I met when we were 17, we hit it off great and fell quickly in love.  She almost immediately became my best friend.  Due to personal issues I had in my life I joined the Military, something that she was not on board with but was tollerable.  We get married, move in together and start to live our lives.  After a few years go by our relationship starts to form some cracks in it, and we change slowly as people.

I wanted her to challenge herself and go to school, get a job, volunteer or do something with her time to contribute to the relationship.  I expressed my concerns (the response that I got at the time was litterally 'get off my ass') however in the course of 5 years she got her AA and held a job for about a year of that.  Throughout this period I had always wanted more from her but I didnt want to 'stir the pot', so this is my fault in a way due to my poor communication.

Our interests have gone in completely different directions.  I've grown to be increasingly more of an independent person, where she has grown alnost entirely dependant on me.  I'm really into fitness, hiking, climbing and though she's not overweight she has no interest in anything physical. 

When it comes to my work, I absolutley love my job, it keeps me active and gives me a true sense of purpose, and I love my teammates.  About a year and a half ago she told me ""This is not an ultimatum, but I'm letting you know right now that you can't have us both.""  (Referring to her and my job)  And my response wasn't the best, as I signed another contract the next week without consulting her on it.  I was a little salty about it.

Soooooooo I take the mentally unhealthy route from that point and hold on to all of this, keep her out of the loop, don't communicate and dread coming home for about 6 months.  I did this really because at the end of the day, I just didn't want to hurt her.  She's completely enamored with me, and also has been dependant on me since we were teenagers.

So I let her know how I'm feeling last eeek and essentially that over time and for these reasons; I've fallen out of love with her.  I dont mention that it happened years ago, but I mention that it happened.  I also let her know that I want to separate..  That rolled into the most difficult three hours of my life, a lot of tears, begging me to change my mind, and overall was emotionally stressful for us both.  But I'm firm in what I want to do.

I leave and stay with my father and have had little communication with each other.  She has a counseling appointment on the 19th, and she signed up for a group counseling on the 27th of this month.  Though I don't mind having someone there while we talk, I don't want to go to the counselor because at the end of the day, I don't want this to continue.  I'd rather get out now with my happiness and sanity than later in life when we have kids, a house, and she would get half of my pension for litterally doing nothing.

How should I go forward, she wants me to come home, go to the counselor, and communicate about all of this.  I feel like that may give her false hope on saving the marriage.  In her eyes this came COMPLETELY out of left field, and in some ways it did.  Is there even a way to continue without it being so difficult?  Would it be counterintuitive to do the counseling since I have 0 investment into this relationship?  I care about her deeply, I'm just not in love with her anymore.  I'm afraid that I'll feel so sorry for her and end up digging myself father in this hole..

TL:DR  Been together with my wife for 7 years and we basically grew up together.  I fell out of love and told her I wanted to separate.  She was absolutley emotionally destroyed by this, and I care for her so it is physically painful for me to see her this way.  However, we're a bad fit for eachother and both need different things from a relationship.  She wants to make it work, should I do counseling to make it easier on her?"
"I (25F) found out 2 years ago that my husband (34M) is cheating on me. How to end it and what to say?


Married for 2.5 years.



I'll be short. Sorry for grammar mistakes.



I moved from Spain to Germany to be with my boyfriend and we got married shortly after. Also, shortly after getting married I found out about his cheating. Lets say it politely, I wasn't happy about that, but I also didn't plan to move back home after 6 months of marriage.



Over these few years my husband supported me, I learned the language and finished my degree and I am doing well now. After divorce I plan to move to the new city and move on with my life.



My husband seemed so nice and was very nice to me the whole time (except cheating oops). He is handsome and sweet so he won't be single for a long time.



I'm wondering what to tell him? Should I say I knew the whole time? I'm not even sure if he knows that I know, because someone sent me anonimous message on facebook few years ago about it then I confirmed it on my own. I was hurt, but after I found out only thing I could see in him was my father- and trust me, lets say it politely, I don't like my father. I just wasn't ready to leave him back then, but I also didn't want tears, and drama, and 'I will never do it again bullshit.'


He worked a lot abroad and now is back home for good so it's hard to pretend everything is great between us. I definitely don't want his kids. Ugh.

Tl;dr: my husband cheated and I don't love him anymore. I waited too long to confront him."
