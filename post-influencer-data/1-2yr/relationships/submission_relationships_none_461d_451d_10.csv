"[UPDATE] My (20F) boyfriend (21M) of a year and a half drunkenly kissed my friend (21F)


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7my0k7/my_20f_boyfriend_21m_of_a_year_and_a_half/

I know my original post didn't get super popular but I thought I'd give an update 5 months later. I ultimately decided to forgive both him and her, which turned out to be a huge mistake!


School started again a couple weeks after this happened. I went over to his apartment when I got back to school, expecting things to be normal, but instead he sat me down and told me that he'd been thinking things over and didn't feel like we were right for each other, so he broke up with me. I was completely heartbroken and told my friend (the one he kissed) everything that had happened.

She was so supportive and helpful during that time, telling me that my ex was awful and helping me move past him. She also started telling me about a new guy she was dating who she was super excited about. She would talk about how it ""just felt right"" with him and how amazing the sex was. As her friend, I was happy for her.

I still had some stuff of my ex-boyfriend's that I needed to give back to him, so about a month after the breakup he came over to my apartment and picked everything up. After grabbing his stuff he told me that she and him had actually started DATING a few days after we broke up and said that he was ""much happier"" with her and she was his ""best friend"". I kept my cool and said I was disappointed but hoped things worked out for him. I was surprised but at the same time not shocked.

So after my ex-boyfriend left I texted my ""friend"" and asked if the new guy she was dating was my ex. She said yes, and she also said ""I wish I could say I regret it, but I honestly can't say that, I really like him and I just wish it had been done differently"". I replied ""thanks for telling me everything but please don't talk to me again"". 

I blocked them both and began the process of moving on. I blamed myself for the longest time and cried for days straight missing both of them. I also tried to spend time with my other friends and went to the gym a lot. It was a slow process but one day you just kinda wake up and realize it doesn't hurt anymore. It's been 5 months and honestly, I'm happier than ever now and I don't miss either of them.
I'm glad they are out of my life now.


The number 1 thing I learned is that FORGIVING THEM WAS A MISTAKE. If someone cheats on you, please think long and hard before forgiving them! 

TLDR: forgave friend and boyfriend, they started dating behind my back, I blocked them and moved on with my life and am happier than ever!"
"[Update] I [18M] am confused about this girl [18F] I've been talking to for the past week, because she's always engaged in our conversations, but never initiates them. What does this mean?


https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8h6ksg/i_18m_am_confused_about_this_girl_18f_ive_been/

It's been about 1.5 months since I made my original post. 

A few days afterwards I asked my friend out on a date. She was ecstatic about it, and told me how happy she was that I did it in person, and not over text.

I honestly didn't expect to get that far, so I didn't plan out what we were going to do, but luckily she had a few ideas.

We decided to watch a movie, and then get dinner afterwards. The movie we watched was Deadpool 2, which is clearly a perfect romantic movie to see on a first date.

We had sushi for dinner, and then she made fun of me for using a fork, because apparently you're supposed to eat sushi using chopsticks, lol. 

After dinner she told me that she really liked the time we spent together, and then she gave me a kiss, which was a big relief for me because I was too nervous to initiate one.

So that was our first date, and my first kiss. She texted me afterwards to say that we should go on another one, and we've been dating ever since. I guess she really was too nervous to start any conversations with me, because now that we're more comfortable with each other she texts me every day.

Well, that worked out a lot better than I expected. I have a girlfriend now!!!

**tl;dr:** I asked my friend out on a date. We watched a movie, I got roasted for eating sushi with a fork, and then she kissed me... We've been dating ever since, and she's my girlfriend now!

"UPDATE Dad (50M) wants me (24F) to change the location of my son's(1m) party.


Previous post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jv0jy/dad50m_wants_me24f_to_change_the_location_of_my/). 

Thanks to everyone for their advice and sharing their personal stories. It really helped assure me that I wasn't crazy. 

I decided to call my dad's bluff and not change the location of the party. They text me a week ago saying I hadn't updated them on the location of the party. I simply said ""Son's party will be on this date and time at our house."" The reply was ""well maybe you all can come by the day after"". I didn't reply and just went about my business. 

The party was yesterday and surprise surprise they still showed up. My dad decided to sit on the back porch the whole time and kept trying to get me to move the cake and sing happy birthday outside (which I did not do) and wanted to get the song out of the way as soon as possible. I was too busy talking to guests and hosting to even entertain him. His wife stayed in the house most of the time and even offered to help with setting things up. 

At the end of the day, it was all about my son and everyone had a good time. My son even slept through the night which he never does, so win for me. 

Tl;dr Didn't budge on location, dad showed up anyway

"My (36f) husband (35m) is blatantly disinterested in our kids (13f, 10f, 5f) unless they want to do something he's interested in, like video games, watching nerdy movies, etc.


I'm not on this website a lot, but a friend of mine told me that the user base of Reddit leans very far towards the ""nerdy"" so that you guys might have more ideas on how to work on this issue. 

Greg and I met in high school. We weren't high school sweethearts, but we were in the same friend group. After college, we began hooking up regularly, and established a relationship. Two years into it, we had our first daughter. Then we decided we wanted to get married, and things have been pretty great. 

I guess part of this issue is mine, because it wasn't until the 10 year old daughter came to me and asked me about it that I even realized. 

Greg is not what you'd call a very involved dad. He shows up for school functions as necessary, and we have family dinner most nights. But outside of those types of things, it's like he lives a separate life from us. 

The 10 year old came to me recently and asked me why Dad doesn't eve want to do anything with her other than play video games or watch Star Wars or things like that. I asked her what she meant, and she said ""Well remember all those times he was trying to get me to watch Star Wars? I kept telling him I didn't like it and it was boring, but he kept trying to get me into it."" And I remembered that when he backed off, it was with a comment about how it was ""disappointing"" to him that he couldn't share his interests with his own kids.

After she brought it to my attention, I thought harder and took better notice. Greg tried to get the 5 year old into something relating to Marvel Comics and their movies, I think it was the Avengers. None of the kids had any interest in it. The 5 year old asked him if he'd read to her, and he would only agree if he could pick out -- and you guessed it, it had to be something comics related, or related to sci-fi/fantasy. She would be patient and she would pretend to like it, but the fact was that she was clearly only doing it so she could spend time with her Dad.

The 13 year old is your average teenage girl. She has a lot of different interests, but one of them is books. Right now her favorite is Children of Blood and Bone. She gave the first book to her Dad to see if he'd like it. It sat around for a week and when I asked him if he'd had a chance, he said ""Not interested"" and chuckled about it. I asked him if he could just read some of it and at least talk to her about it to share something, he snorted and said ""Why would I do that? I'm not interested in it. If she wants to read Lord of the Rings, or the Hobbit, then we'll talk.""

I guess it was that moment when I realized there really IS a problem here. Unless it aligns perfectly with his nerdy interests, he just has no capacity to show interest for the sake of spending time with his kids. Thinking back, when the kids would watch cartoons, it would always have to be Batman the Animated Series or something like that. He tried desperately to get them all into Doctor Who, but they all thought it was boring. We tried to find some common ground, and he suggested Futurama, which the girls again, think is boring, but they will sit through it with him just to spend time with him.

For the record, it extends past media (it sounds like we're all glued to the TV, we're not, but they're good examples). He's not interested in sports, where the 13 and 10 year old both play soccer, and the 5 year old does gymnastics. He never comes to their games/meets, citing that he'd rather just have some free time to himself. But if he suddenly has an interest in, say, hiking, we are expected to rally and follow him. Truthfully, we do, because again, we want to spend time with him. 

(He works a standard issue 40hr/week job. It is not a stressful job, either. I work a similar job. Mine is also not stressful. We do not hurt for money in any way.)

When it comes to family vacations, we've only taken one. I really wanted to go to the Grand Canyon, and so did the girls. He acted like a child about it, honestly. And he insisted that on the drives, we had to listen to his podcasts. Which we did! And some of them were enjoyable. But on the drive back, the girls wanted to listen to In the Heights and Hamilton, and he would not stop making snide comments about it. 

When I initially tried to talk to him about it, he retreated and told me that I was trying to ""change"" him and try to ""feminize"" him in some way. I have no idea where that came from, honestly. I asked him, point blank, why he doesn't want to spend time with his daughter, and all he could say was ""I just don't want to waste my time. We only have so much time on this planet.""

Seeing the way my daughters have brought this up to me and seeing how they feel about it, I am honestly a little heartbroken. Is there work that can be done here? Has anyone dealt with this before with their family?

tl;dr: My husband is not very interested in spending time with his kids unless it is in relation to his very specific interests. Other than that, it's a fight to get him to spend time with them. What can we do?"
"[UPDATE] How do I [31M] assure my wife [26F] that she has nothing to feel bad about while being a SAHM?


My first post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nusfi/how_do_i_31m_assure_my_wife_26f_that_she_has/).

Thank you for the wonderful messages of support, advice, and even some of the harsher reality checks.

I realized really quickly that the issue wasn't guilt about being a SAHM. It was that I hadn't been communicating well about money.

I approached her when all of the kids were asleep/busy/etc. It wasn't the type of discussion that I wanted to get interrupted. I, as directly as I could, told her about my concerns and worries about everything with money, her feeling afraid, what everything looked like from my side and apologized that I hadn't been direct enough in telling her.

She admitted that it did bother her that she didn't know how much I was making which left her blind as to what was okay/what wasn't. She also shared with me that when we were at a small get together for my family that a family member of mine (cousin, not parents or siblings) made a few snarky comments about how one of her friends was a SAHM and then her husband left her with nothing, got bitter about it, what does she do all day, yada yada. A bunch of bullshit. I guess she had also made a few comments about how a lot of men got their wife expensive gifts when they were cheating.

This cousin is nothing but a raging mess who can't keep a friend or a boyfriend around for more than 3 weeks at a time. So she can go fuck herself. I don't have a big connection to her anyway. So its not like it'll cause a bunch of drama for me to block her everywhere. So we did that.

I offered to let her go through my computer/phone/etc. I didn't know what else to do there to prove that I'm not cheating. Keep in mind \- she was NOT aggressively insisting it. She didn't really, actually, truly think I was cheating. The comments just made her insecure because she (her words) has baby weight to lose. My wife assured me that she didn't want to go through any of my stuff and that she trusts me. I'm still slightly fuming about any family causing drama, but thankfully I only have to see her once every few years.

I figured (after I thought about it) that a serious family discussion didn't need to happen in a FA's office. At least not immediately. I did re\-give her his number and she can go see him whenever she wants if she needs assurance or something else. We sat down and talked about my income each year, how much of that was going into what, and how much was left over for ""fun"" money. Guilt started bubbling and she felt bad which is when I did whip out the prices of nannies, cleaning ladies, etc. Thanks for that suggestion. My wife (as precious as she is) made me cut down the maids portion in half because we do still have someone come in sometimes. Either way \- it was still a large amount.

We talked for a few hours and I asked her if she wanted to see the FA. So we have that scheduled to go there soon.

It was a long discussion that got interrupted despite our best efforts. I asked if she wanted to go therapy and she said yes. So she made me take off how much it would be to get someone to regularly come in each week off of the babysitting column of my ""this is how much money you save us"" list. So shes going to start therapy in 2 weeks.

I love my wife. We talked for a long time about retirement, the kids future, money in general, how she felt about it, etc.

Sorry I don't have any super exciting news or drama to report. I just wanted to tell anyone (who was curious) how it went.

I know we probably still have some communication issues to work through. Her making me cut down and edit the ""list of services"" shows me that she still does have some old issues surrounding money (which she did admit to). But as long as we're going forward we'll get there.

P.S She did go and buy her regular non\-cheap skincare stuff.

TL;DR We had a really long talk about everything and how we would handle money going from then. A cousin had made her even more insecure that I was buying her nice things cause I was cheating (but she was already nervous before that). We talked about money and shes going to go therapy to work through issues rooting back to taking care of everyone else for years. "
"My boyfriend [21 M] ditched me [20 F] to spend time with the boys right after my father passed


My Dad unexpectedly passed away a month ago and I had to find him, but that isn’t what this post is about. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years. He has a full time internship  so I don’t get to spend a lot of time with him. 

Yesterday afternoon, I asked him what his plans were. He said nothing. I suggested that when he is off from work, him, his brother, and I should go bowling or to a movie. I figured including his brother who is super close with would make his happy. He said that he would like to do that and would contact me after he gets done with work. I based my plans around this and didn’t make plans with anyone else. 

About an hour or two after he gets off of work, he texted me that he is drinking with some guy friends and can’t come see me. I told him that this weekend I really need him because it’s my first Father’s Day without my father. I also said that he should have just not made plans with me in the first place if he wanted to hang out with the boys. He didn’t respond even though he read these texts. I just couldn’t imagine doing this to him if he was in my situation. In his mind, he thinks that I don’t want him to hang out with his guy friends, which isn’t that case. I just think that he should stick to his original plans and maybe be a little more empathetic to what I have been going through. Also for context, this isn’t the first time this has happened. Even a week after my Dad passed, he ditched me for his friends when I needed him most. I talked to him about it then. He didn’t think it was a big deal, but apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again, but here we are.


TLDR; my boyfriend ignored our plans to hang out with his friends"
"UPDATE: I [25F] am not allowed at my boyfriend’s [23M] house because his parents hate me


Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nrbr0/i_25f_am_not_allowed_at_my_boyfriends_23m_house/?st=JIG2370C&amp;sh=65b3dec0

I wanted to make an update since a lof people responded to my original post and helped me out.

I confronted my boyfriend one last time about the situation with his parents and said I was willing to work on it but I wouldn’t stay if he wasn’t willing to work on it as well. He ended up leaving me, because apparently he needs time alone and he doesn’t see himself in this relationship anymore, but he still wanted to see me as usual. I disagreed because it didn’t make sense to me. I found out today that he’d been dating a girl, i don’t know if he was dating her at the time we were still together, anything’s possible. So here I am trying to get over a trash ex- boyfriend all while dealing with questions about my self worth and why I didn’t see any of this coming.

Tldr: confronted boyfriend, he left me and is dating someone else."
"Did I [27F] do the right thing by getting in the way of my husband’s [27M] time with his sister and friends?


His sister is in town and two of his friends will be taking jobs in different states in a couple months so we all went out for drinks. However, when I mentioned my husband is an aggressive drunk, they all made it their mission to get him shitfaced. I’m not usually okay with him getting super drunk because he starts throwing things around in the bar and I’m pretty useless in a fight but I thought I’d make an exception for tonight.

Around 3 AM he gets to his limit but he’s behaving because his sister is there. He asks me to take him home which he’s NEVER done before, so I knew it was going to get bad. I try getting him out of the bar but his friends and his sister just think it’s funny and keep feeding him drinks and spinning him around. He asks me to take him home another two more times but I can’t get him away from the group. He was in pretty bad shape at this point. 

Anyway, I didn’t want to leave him and I couldn’t trust that the group would look out for him so I started pulling him out with me. At this point, his friends try to pull him back and his sister was trying to shove a drink in his face. I lose my shit and slam the drink down and start yelling at everyone to “BACK THE FUCK OFF” and just generally acting crazy to get him out of the bar. 

I feel bad because it was all probably in good fun, and his sister mentioned that they’ve never gotten along before and this is the first time they’re really bonding, and I hate that I might have gotten in the way of that. 

TLDR I lost my shit when trying to get my husband home away from his drunk sister and friends. "
"Me [51M] with my sister [45F], kids [14F and 16M] and couple of fellow parents [47M and 46F]. I am dying and need help figuring out what the hell to do. My wife has passed away and I have not remarried.


This is long and perhaps one of my last posts on Reddit.  (I have a main).  I have a medical condition which gives me only some months to live.  No one except the doctors know I have this condition.  

LEGAL STUFF (relevant and can help explain):
Currently, I have a will that I made after my wife died.  She died when my kids were toddlers and in my stupidity I have not updated the will.  I am in the midst of making an appointment to update it.  In this will I have made my wish known to have my sister be the guardian of my kids in the event I died.  I had thought of getting my kids emancipated and setting up a trust to give them a weekly stipend for their living expenses, but that is legally not likely.  So I need a guardian or two perhaps.  I had thought of making sure they are protected emotionally by putting in a mandatory condition of visiting a counselor until such time as the counselor determines they are no longer needed to get the weekly stipend for their living expenses.  This is also not likely. 

ABOUT MY CHILDREN:
Times have changed and so have my children.  After my wife died, my sister moved in with me to help out because the kids were toddlers.  We have really no other family or blood relatives.  My sister stayed with me for about 5 years after my wife passed away.  She moved to Delaware because she got a fantastic job which she loves doing.  The kids had grown up and after a few more years, I returned to an office position (whereas before I stayed at home mostly).  Since my daughter has entered middle school, I have started to give more hours at work because my son and daughter could stay at home after school or go to a friend's house or stay at school and then go home while I worked.  Thus since my sister left, my son and daughter have learned a quite a lot about what young people call ""adulting.""  They have learned a lot about handling money, buying groceries, doing laundry, cooking, and cleaning.  We have a good system for equitable distribution for the chores (which includes handling financial things, such as paying bills from my bank account).  To date, I have not had to discipline them once for not completing these chores.  I entrusted them with access to my bank username and password so when the schedule calls for them to pay the bills, they can do so.  Today, I say we are more like friends/roommates rather than parent-children.  Of course, I check on their grades, friends, etc. but they have not given any reason to doubt them, so I don't exert my parental authority perse.  My philosophy on parenting ever since my kids have entered teen years is to parent when necessary.  If there is something emotional going on, I have always tried to engage them as I would with my friends.  I have taught them about safe sex, relationships, etc as much as I can do. 

REGARDING MY SISTER:
My sister is an absolute gem of a person.  I would have gone crazy in those early days without her.  Thus, I feel it would be unfair to ask her to move out to CA, leaving her job (and family I might add) to parent kids, both of whom need less parenting/supervision and more friendlike mentors.  In anticipation of my death, I imagined what may happen if my sister gets guardianship of my kids.  She is the type of person who would leave her job, and repeatedly make round trips between California (where I live) to watch both her own kids and my kids.  This is where the thought of emancipation came in, at least for my older son,  with a weekly stipend for the both of them.  Both of them are pretty independent in completing the tasks they know they have to complete FOR THEIR WELL-BEING.  I know they do everything I ask them to do, not because it will help me, but it will help them.  In my calculations, there would have been no difference in their daily schedule between right now and after I died.  They use the public transport and usually, they get groceries and I cook.  We each do our own laundry and clean our own bathrooms.  We will help each other when it is really required (such as when my kids have exams).  We rotate on making sure the bills are paid from my checking account and other financial accounting.  With me gone, there will be a huge emotional toll, but in terms of logistics, there wouldn't be much of a difference, especially because their school is close by.  What more, my son recently got a job and started to drive, so that takes care of recreational activities they may want to do.  Thus, one of my decisions has to be how should I approach my sister with news of my condition?  How should I tell her that?   I have to appoint one, legally.  Otherwise, my children may end up as wards of the state, and go to a foster home in an area where they may have to change schools.  They have an awesome friend circle who is really supportive on the emotional front.  

REGARDING MY FELLOW PARENTS:
In the early days after my sister left for Delaware, I needed help occasionally between my job and taking care of the kids.  During this time, I left the kids with ""Martha"" and ""John.""  Their son is my older son's best friend, and their younger son (13M), I suspect, has a crush on my daughter (who I also suspect likes the kid, but won't admit it).  I would not say that I am extremely close to them, but we have met at each other's houses for dinners or other outings, once every 3-6 months, and do generally know about their parenting styles from conversations with them.  At this point I have known them for approximately 8 years.  I looked them up from one of those background check websites and they don't have a criminal record, so I don't suspect anything.  Should I approach them for guardianship?  How should I approach them?  To be clear, they will not have to pay a single penny for my daughter or son.  I have enough money for both of them and their college educations.  Pending a further background check, (which I will ask my lawyer about), I would like to appoint them as guardians with as minimal possible disruption to their daily routine and my kids daily routine as possible.  That means no moving houses.  I will of course be looking for them to check in emotionally (and friends etc.).  

ABOUT ME: 
So I am currently at the end.  I can choose to extend my life by up to a year, if I wish to, but those treatment options will involve a lot of suffering and pain.  I will be of no use to anyone.  Not to my job, my children, or my sister.  Throughout my life, I really didn't have that many friends.  My wife was the more social one, but after she passed, I really didn't hang out with people that much except for 2-5 people.  That too was just occasionally.  I threw myself into my work because I realized my work would make my kids more financially secure.  I am glad I did that because whatever happens with the guardianship issue, money is not a problem today.  I can die in peace.  The guardianship issue is the only stressful/serious/extremely important thing for me at the moment.  It means trusting people emotionally and being vulnerable.  I have never been great at trusting people emotionally.  The only person I was emotionally vulnerable to was my wife.  

**TL;DR** I am dying and need advice on how to approach my kids, my sister, and potential guardians regarding my medical condition and what happens after my death.  My kids are pretty independent and responsible, who could live on their own right now.  Legally, they cannot.  So I need advice on approaching potential guardians on guardianship issue while maintaining maximal independence for my kids.  Guardians will not have to pay anything."
"My two (23F) friends keep overstaying their welcome at my (22F) apartment every weekend how do I make them stop?


## 

I am the only friend that lives in a big city, they both still live in our small town about an hour away. I love them and I have a lot of fun with them but EVERY TIME they come up even if I can't hang out because I'm at work, they always stay at my house. I made the mistake of letting them know where my spare key is. Now every time I come home from work they are at my apartment. They get wasted and make a mess and all their shit will be in the living room, and the kitchen will have empty food boxes and liquor bottles out! I am constantly cleaning my house because they continue to leave messes.

What thew me over the edge was that my apartment complex recently had a break in. I'm extra paranoid now and more on top of making sure my doors are Locked. We went out last night and they stayed up after I went to bed. This morning I woke up to my balcony screen door wide open. They didn't even bother to close the damn door, it was left open the entire night!! I immediately talked to both of them about being more considerate and aware of what they are doing and to please clean up after themselves. One of them responded with ""BBBattlestarDW, NO ONE breaks into a house when there are people inside."" I just about killed her when she said this because it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard and her response in general was so fucking lax and this was serious to me. She was hungover when she said this but STILL!!!

Anyways, I came home after a long shift at work thinking they're probably gone by now... and I walk into my apartment and ALL. THEIR. SHIT. IS. STILL. HERE. I washed the dishes this morning and their dirty dishes are now back in the sink. My living room is a mess, and I'm fucking done.

I love them and one of them was in an abusive relationship and that's why I told her where the spare was so that she can come over whenever she got in a fight with her SO (which was all the time). but now they're using that to come over all the time. One of them is very sensitive and she's been my bffff since we were 6 and I have to be careful with how I approach this cause I don't want her to think she's not welcome in my home, but I'm done with them being so inconsiderate and not respecting the rules I've set.

How do I tell them that they need to stop doing this and they are overstaying their welcome at times?

**TL;DR** 2 best friends keep on staying at my apartment and are inconsiderate during their stay. They continue to over welcome their stay even after I talked to them about it."
"My girlfriend (25F) wants to come to a meetup with me (27M) and I don't want her to


Hi all,

We've been together for almost two years now and relationship is looking great so far. The only red flags I've noticed so far were a few situations with jealous outbursts for petty reasons (a girl that liked my statues frequently) , but we've talked that through and it seems that it isn't an issue now. I don't cheat on her nor I have desire to, I trust her side is the same. 

So I've been invited to speak at a local meetup, and my girlfriend wants to come with me. I've already told her that I don't feel comfortable with her coming with me as I will certainly feel stage fright when there is a closely related person (I've no troubles speaking in front of a large crowd of unknown people but I don't feel comfortable when there are people close to me). She said it's fine and that she understands even though she'd really like to come and see me.   


However, today, when they announced me on social media, she again asked me to come. I said I cannot forbid her to come and she can come if she wants but I won't feel comfortable.   


Also, as it is a great networking opportunity, I don't feel like I will be able to freely approach other people as I would feel the obligation to be around her all the time. 

What is the best way to approach her and tell her that I really don't won't her to be there and still avoid the fight or hurting her as I really don't want that., she's currently having a tough time dealing with post\-graduate depression and is looking for a job. The meetup is not in her professional field. 

Tl;dr: Girlfriend wants to come with me at a meetup, I don't want and not sure how to explain. "
"My parents[58f, 59m] are giving me[25f] an ultimatum concerning my fiancee's[23f] leg hair.


Hi all. I'm facing a bit of a dilemma centering around the upcoming 4th of July weekend.

My fiancee doesn't shave. Besides just plain not wanting to, she has extremely sensitive skin and the process is tortuous for her. She's already tried many products, none of them work for her. She's also a naturally very hairy person; her leg hair is quite dark and noticeable. My parents have expressed their discomfort with her natural hair before, and I just walked out of the conversation because I'm not about to tell her what to do with her body. I don't mind her hair one bit myself.

Here's the issue. A couple months ago, just before Easter, which was the first time she was going to meet the rest of my family, my father brought her hair up to me again. He told me how uncomfortable and embarrassed it made him and my mom, and how it would make the rest of the family uncomfortable too. He told me I should suggest to her that she should shave. I told him I wouldn't tell her what to do with her body, and he gave me something of an ultimatum: either she shaves her legs around our family, or he and my mother will not be attending gatherings with us.

I don't know how true that is. He also framed it as if my fiancee should be doing everything in her power to be accepted by our family because we're gay, and shaving her legs would be a sign of respect and show an attempt to assimilate into our family. The irony of that is that my parents are way more homophobic than my extended family. Before I came out, my dad called around to everyone and told them to watch out for a ""big announcement"" from me in their emails, and he was certain things were going to go badly. When I announced our engagement, which simultaneously served as my ""coming out,"" I was met with nothing but love and adoration, even from my 92\-year\-old grandmother. When I brought my fiancee to Easter (she was wearing long pants), everyone was very kind to her. My aunt even gifted us a cute couple picture frame and a congratulations card. So I don't think my fiancee shaving her legs is an effective or necessary way of ""showing respect"" to the family, but who knows.

Anyway, this issue was avoided when it was cold for Easter, but I know we're going to be invited to my uncle's house for 4th of July celebrations. It's going to be hot and my fiancee is going to want to wear shorts or a skirt. What should I tell her? I'm 99&amp;#37; sure she's not going to shave no matter what, but she's already anxious about being accepted by my whole family due to the homophobia my parents showed her in the past. Telling her that my dad gave us this dumb ultimatum will just upset her more. If we do go to the gathering and my parents make good on their promise not to come with us, how do I deal with feeling like a shitty daughter because of it? What the hell would I tell people when they ask where my parents are?

tl;dr Parents told me if my fiancee doesn't shave her legs, they won't attend any family gatherings with us, and if my fiancee truly respected our family, she would shave her legs. 4th of July family party rapidly approaching."
"UPDATE: I [F26] am feeling lonely in a relationship of 2 years with my bf [M28] due to his constant phone use


Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q7kib/i_f26_am_feeling_lonely_in_a_relationship_of_2/)


Thank you everyone for your helpful advice and comments. My post didn't get that much attention but I wanted to update for those finding themselves in a similar situation.


I spent the next day after our fight formulating the words to say to my boyfriend when he got home from work. I wanted our conversation to be as constructive and non confrontational as possible. I explained calmly and rationally how his phone use makes me feel. Infact, I had to explain four or five times because each time he said he didn't understand why him being on his phone so much was an issue. But, I stayed calm and rational and tried to be patient with him. It paid off and we agreed that he wouldn't use his phone unless necessary when we spend time together. He also reassured me that him being on his phone doesn't mean that he doesn't want to spend time with me, and he loves me and isn't bored of me. (Thanks, anxious brain)


We've been engaging in a lot more conversation during our Netflix binges now that I don't feel like I'm interrupting his phone use. And now that he isn't distracted by his phone all the time he initiates conversation about what we're watching. We've spent some time together with my son the last couple of days, and he's been incredibly conscious of his phone use, which I thanked him for, and told him I feel like we really spent some quality time together where he was always 'present'. We're now madly in love again and if the phone thing becomes a problem again, I know I can speak up about it.



**TL;DR** just talk to your partner, and if you have anxiety - nothing is ever as bad as it seems in your head"
"SO [28M] of 4+ years doesn't want to travel anywhere I do, until his dog passes away, the dog is 4 yrs old and healthy


My partner M has a German shepherd that hes very close to. But this problem in my eyes has nothing to do with his dog and everything to do with how selfish M is. 



M has never had a relationship before me so he has struggled with the idea of compromise from the beginning. but he has ""tried"" to get better. 


But the problem is he only wants what he wants. This means he only wants to eat certain type of foods, visit certain type of restaurants and more importantly visit only very small portion of the world we live in. 


From the beginning Ive told him that I'd like to travel with him to other places and that this was important to me. 


It seemed he always had an excuse as to why he couldn't/cant. 



So I tried talking to him about wanting to travel somewhere with him again. And he does too BUT only to the area he wants to travel to. 


Ive asked if hes ever going to travel elsewhere with me and his response 


SO : "" I don't want to go anywhere outside of country x until my dog passes away, because I don't want to spend my time away from my dog"" 


Me : isn't traveling to country x taking you away from your dog ? 


SO: "" yes but its doing something I WANT TO DO so its worth it"" ""going to country x makes me happy so if Im going to miss out on seeing my dog then I want to do something that makes me happy""


Me: You do realize your dog has 10 years of life left in him, so we're just going to visit country x all the time till then, what happens when he does pass away ? you're already wanting to get a new dog so the same thing will just repeat itself. Also why wouldn't you be happy traveling and seeing the world together. 


SO : He has less than 10 years left, this breed of dogs dont live that long. And you look up to my mother right and she only started traveling in her 60s so we can wait and do it then. 


Me: Your mother had 2 young kids to support from a young age. She could only start after you guys grew up. We may have a child at some point and yes that will restrict our travel plans but I don't want to wait till Im 60 to travel !! 


SO : You dont have to, we will travel often ... to country x. 



At this point I feel like hes completely delusional that he cant even see how selfish hes being. And hes using his poor dog as an excuse to get away with it !


I feel like I need to end this relationship because I just don't think we're compatible if he can't compromise. He thinks I'm being too dramatic and that we will eventually travel - "" we have the rest of our lives to worry about that"" but at this point it feels like he's just telling me what I want to so that I shut up about it. 


is there a solution that I'm missing here ? any tips on how we can compromise when hes so rigid and set on his ways. 


** tl;dr; SO of 4+ years is selfish and only wants to travel to the location he thinks he likes. He has no interest in ever visiting anywhere else. Hes now using his young and healthy dog as an excuse to ""not travel"" anywhere else until we're in our 60s "
"How can I tactfully address poor homeschooling?


I have four female cousins of ages 6, 10, 12, and 15 who are being raised in a very censored and obsessively catholic home. The younger two can recite bible verses but cannot name the months of the year, and all of them are extremely behind academically in every subject but religion. The 10 year old has some sort of mental retardation and instead of getting her the help she needs, her parents simply act like she is a lost cause and therefore dedicate no time or resources to teaching her. Their mother is a stay at home mom in NM and their father works in CA, where most of the family lives so my aunt is essentially isolated with the kids. They only socialize with other people from their church. My aunt never went to college and is not qualified in the least bit to homeschool 4 children, but does so to prevent them from being around people who do not share their beliefs. They do not have a housekeeper and the children do not help around the house, and it seems like my aunt spends more time on domestic work and facebook than teaching. I feel an intervention is necessary because it is so unfair to these children who are essentially being denied an education. However, I do not want my aunt and uncle to feel attacked and be unreceptive, so I have to approach this tactfully. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**TL;DR: sheltered cousins are not being educated in much else besides religion and I want to approach their parents without causing offense**

"My(37m) Fiance (35f) has developed strong feelings for her training partner


My partner of 6 years started martial arts a couple of years ago and about 6 months in, she started training with a new partner, who is a few years younger, extremely handsome and seems like a really nice guy.  He's also talented and has helped her develop her skills and she's developed a strong bond with him.  She always trained with him because they train well together and are the same level.

I was a bit jealous at first and let her know that in a laid back way.  She always maintained that it was just training and nothing more, but then I found out she had been texting him A LOT outside of training and that came as a bit of a shock.   Any concern I had about the texting was shutdown as paranoia and that she was just mates.

Over the months things went on and I noticed her becoming more distant.  I asked her if she developing feelings for him and she swore blind that she wasn't.  All this time getting more distant with me. It was almost like she was pretending to play happy families but I could tell she was pre\-occupied.

It got too much and I approached her this morning and told her that it's obvious that this guy is in her mind and I can tell that she's losing interest in me.  She finally admitted that she has feelings for him and him to her, but she also says she loves me and wants us to be together and wants us to be a family.  She claims that she wishes she'd never met him but yet she can't escape her feelings.

In normal circumstances I guess she would limit contact, but they are training partners.  She would literally have to stop her martial arts completely as there is only one school in the local area that she can train at and she is extremely passionate about her hobby.

I have no idea what to do.  I've been tortured by this issue for months, knowing her heart is with someone else.  At least now I know.  But I love this woman and we have a child together (plus I have a child from a previous relationship) and we live as a family.  

I can't go on anymore and nor can she.

TLDR : Fiance has developed a major thing for her training partner and limiting contact seems impossible."
"Gf [26F] wants me [27M] to pay rent for staying at her place 4 days a week, but refuses to let me move in. Is this unreasonable?


I just want some outside perspective on this. 

Gf and I have been dating 1.5 years. She is very careful with finances but I feel like sometimes she can border on taking advantage of others for the sake of being ""frugal."" 

Anyways we live separately but work in the same CBD area. She lives ~20min away from work and I live ~40min away. My place is bigger but farther away. We pay roughly the same amount in rent. 

All in all, we spend on average of 4 nights together every week. In the beginning we would rotate, she would come to mine one week and then I would go to hers. After a while she complained about the inconvenience of the commute to my place and refused to go anymore, so I would stay at her place. Note, this was purely her decision and preference. I'm fine with the distance to my place and don't mind the commute tbh. 

Well, last week she approached me and told me she wants me to start contributing to rent at her place. I'm a bit surprised since I already pay for half the utilities at hers (since I shower at her place and she never comes to mine). But now she wants me to pay at least 30-40% of her rent because I'm spending the majority of the week at her apartment. 

I told her it's unreasonable to have me pay for almost 1.5x my current rent and I'd much rather we just find a place to live in together that's also close to her workplace. She doesn't want that either because she doesn't want to ""officially"" live with me and she likes that I have my own place to go to for parts of the week and she gets the place to herself. She still refuses to come to mine. I tell her she's giving me two options essentially: break up (since we'd never see each other) or have me pay a chunk of money for the privilege of seeing her. She disagrees and thinks she's being more than reasonable but she says it's only fair I pay something. What should we do? What should I do? Is she being unreasonable in this?

Tldr: Gf wants me to contribute 30-40% of her rent because I stay at hers 4 days a week. But only because she refuses to stay at my place due to distance. She also doesn't want me to give up my current apartment and move in with her. Is this unreasonable? What should I do?"
"My (35M) girlfriend (35F) let me know that she expected me to pay for her graduate school tuition. Am I right to feel put off by that?


Since we began dating, she let me know that she was very excited to get into grad school. She took the GRE multiple times, studied hard, and got accepted into a local college. We were about six months into the relationship when she told me that she wasn't able to qualify for student loans, and that she therefore couldn't afford to go. I offered her my support and my sympathy, as a I truly felt bad for her. She sounded truly disappointed.

Several months later, after an argument, she let me know that she resented that I didn't offer to pay her tuition. In her words, she was angry that I ""didn't see that as an investment in us"".

Am I right to feel put off by that? It would have been different, maybe, if she had asked. I would have carefully considered it. But her attitude is that I should have offered of my own volition. Six months into a relationship, it seemed premature.

tl;dr: My GF let me know that I let her down when I didn't offer to pay for her graduate school tuition. She sees it as a sign I'm not committed. Am I right that this is inappropriate?"
"I (f25) was hired my my friend (f27) to do makeup for her wedding, but am not invited to the wedding afterwards


Hi there. I’m not sure if this is standard or not, and could really use some advice on how to deal with this situation. This is a long post with a lot of set up, so I thank you in advance for reading.

I am a makeup artist as a small side job while I’m in grad school to become an elementary ed. teacher. I have know ‘Jen’ since I was in middle school, as her sister ‘Leah’ is my best friend. I like Jen a lot, but definitely had to earn her love; she is very intelligent, a bit of a control freak, and pretty stubborn with her opinions. That being said, she’s also extremely hospitable, kind to her friends, thrifty, and cares a lot about bettering the world. She is getting married to ‘Max’, a gentle sweet man that i met through my own sister back in high school. This is all to say that I’m very close with the whole family here, and have spent a lot of my life around them all.

Jen asked me to do the makeup for her and 7 others for her wedding in December, and I was psyched. I hadn’t ever booked a wedding gig, and have really worked mostly with stage/screen/specialFX. However, I like doing beauty makeup, and could use the cash, so why not? I did her consultation last month, she liked it, we’re a go for the wedding next month. A day afterwards, I get a call from Jen’s mother, ‘Denise’, who I love dearly and has been a stand in mom for me at times. She called and booked me for her own makeup consultation next week so that I can teach her how to do her own makeup. She said she didn’t want to take time away from the bridal/bridesmaids makeup, so I’ll be teaching her some makeup skills and then just checking in with her on the day. However, over the phone she also asked me if I was free after I finished the makeup that day...

Well, I hadn’t realized up until that moment that I hadn’t received an invitation to the ceremony or reception. Denise asked me if I could babysit all of the little kids whose family were invited, it’d be about 8-10 children ranging from infancy to 12. I work with children a lot, so Denise immediately thought of me for this job. I REALLY don’t want to do it, especially after rushing around to try and get 8 people’s makeup right for the wedding. I feel pretty hurt that I wasn’t invited. All of Jen and my mutual friends are invited, and I’ve been involved for months in this wedding now. I’ve bought products specifically for Jen’s wedding, just to make sure everything is perfect for her. It feels like I’ve been reduced to ‘the help’ and expected to either disappear or jump right into another taxing service for them after I finish this one.

I haven’t been told any info about the wedding either, except for the date of it. So I don’t know yet where I’m going, or what time. I’m thinking about reaching out to Jen or her mother to say ‘hi, I realized I haven’t been sent any information about the wedding yet. Could you let me know where you would like me to go and what time? Also, I hope it’s alright for me to pass on the babysitting afterwards, I would not feel comfortable staying during the ceremony as a babysitter.” I am worried that this message would not have enough tact though. I don’t want to cause drama, I’m sure they have enough without me and my hurt feelings. 

Any advice on how to proceed here? I love these people, but am starting to wonder if this closeness has been one-sided the whole time. I would have loved to attend the wedding afterwards, but would be okay just leaving after I do the makeup (I understand weddings are expensive and they may just want to keep numbers down?). I am NOT cool with hanging out in a hotel room with a bunch of kids, waiting for their parents to scoop them up after a fun time eating/drinking/dancing with my friends. The kids don’t deserve the bitterness I’m afraid I would feel.

TL;DR friends with Jen and her sister Leah for over a decade, asked to do wedding makeup for Jen, but never got invited to the wedding. Now Jen’s mom is expecting me to babysit during the wedding after I finish the makeup. "
"UPDATE Me [25F] with my partner [25M] of nearly 7 years, seems to have checked out of relationship after failing to get into med school


Original: https://redd.it/8oekv7

Well, we had a conversation about my feelings and I mentioned that living together wasn't working out anymore. I said I wanted to talk about the possibility of moving out without breaking up, but rather rekindling our relationship, and he interrupted me and said ""If you move out we're breaking up. It means you want to break up.""

Which was irritating, because I hate having words put in my mouth. Anyway, I said ""All right,"" because at that point the will to keep trying with him sort of died in me. So I've been sleeping on the couch in the living room for the last few days, and we haven't talked at all, despite seeing each other every evening.

He was supposed to go to his first therapy appointment today, but I think he canceled it to take a shift at work (I saw him leave in his scrubs this morning and shifts are 8-9 hours long). He did say that if I was moving out and we were breaking up he didn't need to go to therapy anymore, so I'm not surprised if this turns out to be the case.

Not sure where to go from here. I guess I'll start looking at places. I just can't believe that someone I've been with for 7 years would let our relationship die without a whimper, or a single protest, or any effort to repair things at all. It seems like he's content to let it be like this. I'm devastated.

  **tl;dr**: Partner is unresponsive after being asked to explore options to fix our relationship. I'm apartment hunting."
"Wife [29F] keeps getting terrible reviews at work. She's upset and I don't know how to help.


Been with my wife for 4 years, we're both 29. We work in similar industries but my wife has really struggled with her career since she graduated university. 

She's already switched jobs 3 times in the last 5 years and every time her employers have seemingly nothing but bad things to say about her. It's nothing about her behavior or anything, just things they think she's below average on or how they think her performance is too poor. She's been placed on ""performance-improving programs"" like 
4 times already. They also say she's the ""weakest"" employee out of a group of new recruits and so her responsibilities get less and less. I don't know what she's doing to be falling behind, but it just keeps happening. 

The thing is my wife works super hard and I see that in her. I have no idea why her employers are always giving her such a hard time. She's never been laid off, but she's had to quit several times after she said she felt like her coworkers were distancing themselves from her and bosses were ignoring her. I have no idea why this keeps happening. We've even found a good career counselor that was recommended by her university and even he doesn't understand why she keeps getting squeezed out of jobs. 

My wife isn't really qualified to work in any other industry without taking a major pay cut. I've suggested she find work in a totally different field, but she refuses. She says she loves her current field and doesn't want to work anywhere else. However, she has basically had 0 promotions since she started working 7 years ago. It's getting a little ridiculous. What can I do to help?

-------------------
tldr: Wife keeps getting squeezed out of jobs for ""poor performance"" and never progressing. I don't know what she's doing wrong because she works really hard, but employers are unsatisfied. What can I do to help?"
"My [F/18] mom [F/53] thinks there are demons in my house just because (1) my sister [F/20] told her a dream about demons and (2) I deal with depression. She won’t stop screaming for God to “cast them out” and it’s bothering me.


Long post. 

I wouldn’t say I’m too religious of a person. I definitely believe in a higher power but I can’t say I belong to a particular faith anymore now that I’ve grown old enough to take in my own knowledge about religions and Christianity. While I would like to call myself a full blown Christian, I always feel indifferent about doing so. My mom, however, full-fucking-blown Christian. 

About a month ago, my sister told my mom about this nightmare my brother [M/26] had involving demons chasing and trying to drag him and my dog down to hell (lol) and my mom took it very very seriously. She called him and said this super long prayer for him and the rest of us and in my eyes, the whole thing was blown out of proportion. My brother felt it was as well and we were trying to figure out why my sister would share that with my mom knowing how she is. 

Now the other morning, my sister and I woke up at the same time before my mother left for work. She told my mom about this nightmare she had of demons infesting the house saying that there’s “No hope for us” and other creepy stuff like that. Again, my mom took it very VERY serious and made us get on our knees while she said  (screamed, actually) a prayer begging God to cast the demons out of the house and out of our spirits and such. It was weird, and I’ve never really seen her do that before. After the prayer she went about her remaining 8 minutes in the house screaming “Cast them out!”

This morning—it’s about 7am— she came into my room and just sat down on my bed. I asked her if she was okay and she said she felt sad. Mind you I’m like wicked tired so I look at her and I’m like “oh...I’m sorry moma. It’s okay to be sad.” And she doesn’t respond. I later ask if she wants to talk about it and she says no. As she leaves, I tell her I love her and she responds with the same. 

Six minutes later this woman is SCREAMING again.

“CAST THEM OUT.”

“I REBUKE THESE DEMONS IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.”

“DEPRESSION IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL. TAKE THE DEMONS OUT OF MY DAUGHTER.”(???)

“(SPEAKING IN TONGUES)”

So here I am, in bed, typing this post. I’m getting only a little bit annoyed with this and I really don’t want it to persist. How can I get her to kind of chill with this whole demon thing? I really don’t believe in demons and shit like that, and I definitely don’t believe that depression is the “work of the devil”, but I suppose it’s not about me. I’m more concerned about getting this woman to relax. She has too many worries to be screaming every morning about demons that don’t exist. Any help will mean the world. 


ALSO. I feel like it’s worth asking for no one to have a religious debate in the comments. I get that there are plenty people that don’t believe in any of this stuff and I truly respect your differences of opinion, but for this one post I ask that you please just stay on topic. Thank you. 


TLDR; Sister told my mom about some demonic dreams she and my brother had, and now my mom thinks there are demons in the house and in our souls. Need help getting her to relax.

"Me [35 F] with my husband [40 M], he's lost his mind over sex and won't listen to my side. I'm trying my best to satisfy his needs and I can't do better right now. He's acting emotionally abusive. I suspect he might be trying to justify cheating or he is cheating.


PLEASE help me with insight here. All possible sides that maybe I haven't considered. I am going to show him this thread and try again to talk to him about this (totally unsuccessful last night). This is crazy and besides this, is totally out of character for him.. so I am so confused and hurt by this. This all happened over the course of less than 24 hours. 


Okay. So yes, I know this is said on Reddit all the time. But besides *this*. There are *no other fucking red flags*. He is great. He communicates, he is kind. He is not an asshole to me, or our kids. We have been married many years and he has always been considerate of me and we talk things through... with the exception of this *one* issue. This is his issue that we keep re-visiting and cannot seem to come to any sort of compromise on that keeps us both happy. 


He has a higher sex drive. Maybe not extreme, but compared to me, yes. Daily, sometimes multiple times per day. At 40, he would ideally still want sex probably once a day or a blow job once a day, perhaps skipping a day here or there. 


I have a history of a lot of abuse and sexual trauma. This includes childhood sexual trauma, which caused a diagnosis of PTSD. For the most part, I have put it behind me and it's allowed me to have a normal sex drive. I have occasional PTSD flare ups, but they are spaced out more and more as long as I avoid triggers. Recently I was triggered by something outside of my control. I have had a *lot* of anxiety building over the months, getting worse and worse. It caused several long stretches of insomnia that got me very desperate to get back onto a medication to treat my anxiety. This medication also completely kills libido. I talked to my husband about this before taking it, because I have taken it before many years ago and know about this side effect. I was willing to accept it to get rid of the anxiety and to be able to sleep better. He agreed with me. I also wanted to add: **I do not have health insurance, and mental health care/counseling is cost prohibitive, even with the sliding fee scale. I cannot afford therapy**. I *can* afford the cheap medication prescribed through the sliding fee scale clinic, but I cannot afford therapy. It would probably help me get through this rough patch of PTSD flare up, but I cannot afford it. Please please don't recommend therapy in the comments bc I just can't, I don't have access and I have exhausted all avenues. We live in a smaller town with no access. I use reddit on my main account and use it as 'therapy', and I find it helpful. 


Now it has been a month and a half. I haven't even refilled the prescription yet (2 month supply). It is helping somewhat, in that I'm sleeping better. However, I *still* am having bad anxiety. The meds aren't working like they should. I am really struggling. I have talked to my husband and he knows how bad it is. It's bad. My libido is, as expected, totally dead. However, I am putting in an effort to tend to his needs. I am being proactive and asking him if he would like a blowjob, or if he would like sex. I will admit that I probably don't ask him enough. I have almost never turned him down when *he* asks *me*. I am almost always willing to do whatever he requests of me and have made that clear.. just ask. I am avoiding sex stuff in our bed. I still do it.. but I avoid it. We do things in the shower to work around this. I know it probably sucks for him. I apologized to him and told him that I was in no way upset with him or blaming him. I had a realization about a month ago that every time we had sex in the bed at night, that I would end up awake *all night* with anxious racing thoughts that same night. I very much just want to get through this rough patch so that I can hopefully get back to normal sex in a bed. I haven't had it this bad in a long time (years and years). 


Sex frequency has dropped though, as it has in the months leading up to me taking this medication. He is not happy. We are at about once or twice per week sex activity. So he masturbates and is unhappy. He was raised that masturbation is a 'sin', so he feels like what he is doing is 'wrong'. I think *that* is where his resentment is coming from, and he is taking it out on me. Like he thinks it's my 'job' to take care of his sexual needs, and when he's unfulfilled, it's my fault? I have noticed in the last few weeks that he seems sulky and pouty. I have asked if anything is wrong and he always said no, everything is fine. 


Yesterday, while at work, I got a text. It said 'I am unhappy sexually'. That was it. I asked for clarification and didn't get a response right away. I waited a while, then sent a response that basically said I am trying my best to take care of him, but that I felt he was being selfish. I told him that he knew I was having a hard time, and that it wasn't intentional. I told him that it seems like all he is concerned about is how I'm not horny, and not the fact that I'm not emotionally okay. 


He called me shortly after, and was very hyper and upset. He accused me of dismissing his feelings. I accused him of dismissing my feelings. I told him he was being selfish. He told me I was being selfish. I told him that I was *not* being selfish, and that if he wanted to see me being selfish, that I would just stop putting his needs into consideration *at all* and would stop putting in the effort that I am currently putting in. He then screamed 'FUCK YOU!!!!!!' into the phone and hung up on me.
 

I texted him right after he hung up that I wanted an apology for that and that it was totally unacceptable. He texted me back 'No, Fuck you, you are withholding sex'. For clarification.. I didn't mean that I was going to withhold sex when I said I was not going to put in effort. I meant that I would stop proactively offering sex/blowjobs. I meant that *he* would have to come to *me* for those things. Then he would see that I *was* trying. I did explain this to him when he came home, but he didn't seem to care. He also texted to me 'just divorce me'. We have an agreement that this sort of thing is supposed to be off limits in arguments. 


He came home late, and did not apologize. I asked for an apology again and he said he did nothing wrong and that I was in the wrong for dismissing his feelings and making it all about him. He got on his Playstation and ignored me, playing with his friends and talking with them, laughing like everything was fine. I stood in front of the TV and demanded we talk it out (I do not usually do this sort of thing FYI). He was rude and dismissive of this, tried to shoo me out of the way and said I was in the way. I turned off his game (again I never do this sort of shit). We had words (not much, just a rehash of the above), he followed me into our bedroom where he again shouted 'FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU!!!!' repeatedly at me, then stormed out of the house for about an hour or two (not sure of time passage). 


Again, I *really really really cannot handle being screamed at*. I have PTSD from childhood trauma, from an abusive father, then an abusive husband, and am currently in a downward spiral emotionally.... this *really* fucking sucked. It was the emotional equivalent of him punching me in the face. *He knows this*. 


He came back, and was back on his Playstation, me in our bedroom. I laid in bed and eventually it all overwhelmed me and I started bawling. After I calmed down, went pee, I again went to try to get him to talk. He again refused, and was being dismissive and condescending. He was smirking and saying 'Go away', shooing me with his hand. Then he said 'I heard you wailing in there'... he heard me crying.. and he just.. didn't care? I wasn't crying for attention.. I don't even cry really.. I don't cry until I hit a breaking point. And he just totally dismissed my crying like it was a big stunt. Of course, that hit me wrong and made me cry again. It was like he was a totally different person. *This is not who he is*. I asked him why he was so quick to storm out of the house, and where he went for so long. He didn't answer that and asked me what I was doing. I asked if he was looking to cheat on me (it feels like he is pushing me away so that he has a 'reason' to cheat on me), and he asked if I was cheating on *him*. He fucking knows thats the last thing I would be doing right now. I'm barely alive and coping right now.. not having a fucking affair. 


We had more round and round discussion about me 'dismissing his feelings' over the original 'I'm unhappy sexually' text he sent me. I grabbed his phone, which was sitting right there on the couch cushion, to show him my original text response to him and show that it wasn't dismissive or rude (he was insisting that I was being those things in my response). He jumped up very quick and snatched his phone from me. That really triggered my red flags there... why would he be so protective of his phone???? Is he seriously hiding something on his phone?? I didn't push it or hold on to it.. I gave it to him.. but I am so confused and seriously pondering if he is starting up something with someone else, and all of this shitty behavior towards me is him trying to justify an affair. He also insinuated last night during our argument that I could 'do something' about all of this by going off my medication. Which I have only been on for a month and a half. Which *is* helping me sleep again. It hasn't even been long enough to kick in yet and help me with the anxiety. He is asking me to go off this medication to get back my sex drive, and doesn't seem to care what happens to me emotionally or psychologically as a result. *This is so hurtful to me*. From my perspective, this feels like he views me as nothing but a sex object. From his perspective, I am being selfish and don't care that he is suffering from a lack of frequent sex. Because when we first got together, we did it all the time. We also had less children. He had a different work schedule. I wasn't in the midst of a PTSD flare up. It's like he cannot see or think clearly and all he thinks about is his penis. He sees one stretch of time that lasts a couple of months, and forecasts it as 'forever'. I don't understand this thinking at all. I don't know how to work with it or get him to see reality. He just looks at it black and white.. 'No sex now= no sex forever and ever'. 'No sex now= this is how it will always be'. I don't even understand why this is being prioritized over his wife's mental and emotional health, or why he is failing to see my efforts. I could totally see his point if I wasn't even trying at all.. or refusing/turning him down. But I have literally turned him down like *maybe* a handful (twice?? three times??) in the *entire* time we have been married. I don't turn him down! 


I don't know what happened to my husband. It is like a switch was flipped and he became a monster with no emotion. No compassion. He was acting last night like I was trying to emotionally manipulate him?? Which I have never done to him or anyone. He ended up sleeping on the couch, and this morning woke me up abruptly to let me know our baby was awake before he left for work. He was out of the bedroom before I even got a chance to open my eyes and see him. *What the fuck is going on*. 

TLDR; I'm not sure. I think maybe my husband is being emotionally abusive out of nowhere to justify having an affair with someone. He's having a giant temper tantrum over not getting enough sex. I am trying my best to satisfy him but my best isn't good enough right now. I honest to god cannot do any better and it's bringing me to dark hopeless places. help. "
"My (20f) friend (21f) is going to great lengths to ‘prove’ that my boyfriend (24m) is cheating even though I know he isn’t


So I live with Emily, a person I met a couple of years ago. We became fast friends, admittedly moved in together last year out of convenience, but have stayed true to our friendship, which has definitely strengthened. My boyfriend is Sam, someone I met about a year and a half ago. We’ve been dating for just over a year, with our relationship transitioning into an LDR about 5 months ago because Sam moved for work.

I never thought that there were any issues between Emily and Sam. In our early stages she was very gracious and seemed to know the perfect balance between socialising with Sam and giving us space. It was only when Sam moved away that she started making little comments about how ‘funny’ it would be if Sam had a side chick in his new city, or that I was actually a side chick and he’s gone home to his family. There is no way this is true - Sam has always been honest and open, has always mentioned that he quickly shuts girls down if they try it on with him, and as for the family thing I helped him move into his small 2-room apartment, and not a family home.

I’ve always shut this down very quickly whenever Emily starts on with it, however recently she’s been taking extra steps to try and make me believe that my boyfriend is cheating on me. She told me over dinner the other day that she had proof that Sam had ‘slid into the DMs’ of one of her friends, and showed me a screenshot of Sam’s ‘secret’ Twitter account hitting on her friend about 9 months ago. This account was not Sam’s username at all, and just in case it had been a secret account, I searched the username and it came up with a profile of a 15 year old boy also called ‘Sam’. Though I told Emily this, she was insisting that this profile was my Sam, and that he was clearly catfishing using this kid, or that he was Sam’s younger brother (Sam has no younger siblings). Last night she sent me an SOS message saying that there was an emergency, but after rushing home to see what was happening she said that the ‘emergency’ was that Sam doesn’t have his Facebook relationship on his profile, and that it was obvious he’s trying to appear single. The reason his relationship isn’t public is because I asked for it not to be, since I don’t believe that my relationship status is everyone’s business - we are ‘in a relationship’ on Facebook, but only privately. Yet again I explained this to Emily, and she still tried to argue that he could still be cheating, and that I was subconsciously manipulated to keep the status private by him (I really wasn’t).

I’ll clarify here that I’ve never said to Emily that I think Sam will cheat on me in his new city because I don’t, simple enough. It may have been that she was jealous or wanted him for herself but she is in a relationship of her own; her boyfriend of 2 years is over usually 2 - 3 nights a week. I’m definitely going to put her on an information diet regarding my relationship, but should I consider going further?

TL;DR - My friend and housemate is constantly trying to convince me that my boyfriend is cheating on me using flimsy evidence, is there a way of getting her to stop?"
"My father [54/M] asked to bring his cheating GF [45?/F] to a fathers day get together my wife and I had planned for him.


Hello everyone. So I am 27 years old (so is my wife) and my dad is 54. My wife and I had invited him down this Saturday for an early Father's day celebration. It was just going to be us 3 and we were going to grill out food and go see a cheap movie. I was really looking forward to it until yesterday afternoon. You see my dad has known for a couple of weeks now about my invite and did not say any word to me about anyone else coming until yesterday. He calls me and started out our conversation like this ""Hey do you mind if I don't stay the night Saturday and do you care if I bring someone else along?"" I told him I was just planning on it being us but he then said that it was unfortunate I felt that way. He wouldn't tell me who it was but I guessed it was his girlfriend.


Shes at least a few years younger than him (not entirely sure) and she barely speaks English so that would already make it awkward because I can't speak Spanish. To make matters worse they have broken up multiple times and she has been cheating on her husband with my dad off and on for over a year now. She claims he is abusive but won't leave him and seems content to use my dad for money and nice things. 


He proceeded to try to make me feel guilty about the whole thing like I was being mean to him. I stuck to my guns though and I said she was not welcome. It has really been hurtful towards me honestly to feel like she is more important than what I had planned for my dad. He's considering cancelling the plans and just not coming at all because his GF isn't welcome. I told him to do whatever he's got to do but I am honestly angry and saddened by the whole ordeal.


I guess my question here is am I wrong to not want her around me at all? I told my dad I wanted nothing to do with her and that this was just supposed to be a father's day celebration. She wasn't originally invited and I had no idea until yesterday that my Dad was planning this. He tried to blame it on me and call me judgemental but, I digress. Its very rude to invite someone I have never met nor have any desire to meet to my apartment during a fathers day celebration I planned. I basically told him that it was either him coming alone or not at all.


He has not yet told me his decision but I feel like he is choosing her over me and he already knew how I felt about her. Am I just prolonging the inevitable here and I am being judgemental or was my father wrong to request this meeting? Should I be more open minded here or stick to my guns and stand my ground on what I believe is a moral and personal issue I have with his situation?

Thanks!


**TL;DR; : Father asked to bring his girlfriend who is cheating on her husband with my father to a father's day event I had planned for him and him alone. He knows I don't like her and they have broken up multiple times before. He asked last minute and I told him absolutely not. He told me I was being judgemental and now he might not come visit. Am I being too harsh or judgemental?**."
"I [24 F] just found out my amazing work friend [29 F] also happens to be my boyfriend's [26 M] ""lying and cheating"" ex. He hates that I look up to her.


My boyfriend ""Bill"" told me about his ex, his first love who cheated on him, and who he had a long drawn out breakup with. He told me he blocked her on all social media, blocked her number, and his friends don't talk to her anymore. He didn't know where she ended up, though last he heard, she was job searching in the city we live in. All this happened 5 years ago.

He always called her by a nickname. Let's say, ""Kate""

-----

This year, I started a new job, as a civil engineer. I really liked the job, despite the fact that it was super male dominated and had some of the shittiness that comes along with that. 

There was only one other woman on my team. Let's call her ""Kaitlin"". She became a kind of professional mentor to me, and I looked up to her, for her intelligence, and her ""take no shit"" attitude. 

We'd often hang out after work, at happy hour with the team. One night recently, Kaitlin and I both had a lot to drink, and started talking about some personal stuff. It turned out we both had something that we thought of as a defining moment in our lives, after which our whole mindset and outlook on the world changed.

Mine was in college, the first time I lived away from my abusive dysfunctional home, and I saw that so much that I had seen as normal, and taken for granted wasn't true. My parents and a lot of my hometown were racist, and homophobic. Seeing how that wasn't the case everywhere made me face up to a lot of my own biases, fucked up beliefs, and past hateful actions towards people different than me. I even came to terms with my own bisexuality.

Kaitlin said her ""big change"" happened about 3 or 4 years ago. Way back when she was 14, she was in a relationship with an adult man, who made her feel worthless except for what she could give him sexually. She never told anyone. From the time she was about 14, she had been in relationships nonstop. She couldn't be alone for any amount of time, even to the point where she'd start setting up the next relationship when she felt her current one was getting rocky. 

It was only when she started seeing a therapist, that she started to realize how she was looking for validation and confidence in all the wrong places; from a string of boyfriends and flings instead of from within herself. And that self-assurance and confidence I admired in her had been hard won.

We both ended up staying at the bar later than everyone else, getting drunk and emotional and hugging each other and saying how proud we were of each other.

I know that sounds like a lot to share between coworkers, but it really didn't affect how we worked together. 

----

Last weekend, Bill saw a text from Kaitlin pop up on my phone. (Her contact in my phone is her full name) and he asked me how I had gotten Kate's number and why I was talking to her.

I didn't get it. I said she was texting me about work.

Bill said ""what the hell are you talking about, that's my ex, Kate.""

Then I realized, his ""Kate"" and my ""Kaitlin"" are one and the same. 

-----

Bill absolutely hated Kate, she was the first person he fell in love with, she cheated, and lied to his face for months. After not talking for years, and ending things so badly, I think he's built her up in his head like some evil thing.

He can't believe I like her, I look up to her, and we've become friends. He told me he's not OK with me being friends with her, and he questions my judgement for liking her so much.

I sincerely think Kaitlin has changed. I personally understand how it feels to realize your worldview and your actions were so very wrong, and I like to think people can truly change for the better, and be judged by their current self rather than their past. I don't want to cut Kaitlin out of my life.

I don't know what to do. I think it would be wrong to judge Kaitlin on who she was 5 years ago, rather than who she is now, but my boyfriend is completely uncomfortable with that, and with me continuing to look up to her professionally or be friends with her.

------

TLDR - I just found out my friend / mentor at work also happens to be my boyfriend's lying cheating ex.

"My Wife [F 20s] is Upset That I [M 20s] Am Never In the Mood for Sex, But She Won't Put Herself Together


TL;DR at bottom.

Right off the bat, I want to make it clear that when I say my wife no longer ""puts herself together"" I'm not saying that she stopped wearing clubbing dresses all the time or doesn't wear as much makeup as she used to. We live together. I think it would be unfair for me to expect her to have to stand in front of the mirror for an hour just to lounge around in her own home. If she wants to let loose in her own house every now and then, who am I to judge?

Rather, when I say she no longer puts herself together, I mean she'll go days (sometimes weeks) without showering or getting out of her pyjamas/comfort clothing. She works from home and has literally no one in her life other than me. I am her only family, her only friend and her only social contact. When we do groceries, she'll go shower and brush her teeth or whatever. But because she won't step foot out of the house for a week at a time (other than to sit in the car to go to a drive thru), she feels no need to keep up her appearance.

I feel bad saying this, but she also has a smell. And again, I don't expect her to smell of perfume 247. But when I walk by her and can only smell BO, there's a problem. And when we *do* have sex (maybe once a month) if I use my hands at all, I need to keep them far away from myself or I'll gag. I'll also make a point of not breathing through my nose the entire time. I know vaginas have their own smell and that's fine. I doubt my balls smell like flowers and sunshine. But I've never in my life had to exclusively breath through my mouth during sex to prevent myself from gagging.

I know that there are some mental health issues at play here and am not looking for answers pertaining to this. Not because I don't care, but because that's another issue that we're already working on. I just don't know what to do about this particular issue.

My wife gets upset that we don't have sex like we used to. She, at one point in the past, even used the term ""emotional abuse"" to describe my innability to put out. But I think that's unfair. I don't believe you can slam someone for having less sex with you if you go from makeup, hair extentions and sexy clothing to pyjamas and extreme body odor overnight.

I don't know what to tell her. My current strategy of making up excuses (I've been having an outrageous amount of ""stomach pain"" for the last couple years, some real, some made up) ends with her getting upset that we don't have sex, even if she no longer actively gives me shit for it like she used to. But if I told her that I'm not attracted to her because of her extreme BO and innability to put herself together, my life would be hell. I already spend at least 30hrs a week being her emotional punching bag on account of said mental health issues. If I told her what's really going on, I'd lose my mind. I don't know what to do. I can't spend the next two months hearing her yell and cry and everything in between for ten hours a day (I'm not exaggerating). I just can't. I've already made posts here under a sifferent account regarding her tendency to use me as an outlet for her depression. I can't knowingly make that situation worse.

**TL;DR - Wife no longer takes care of herself. To give an example of the severity, her BO is sometimes so extreme I can smell her the second I walk in the living room. She has mental health issues which result in her venting at me for 30hrs a week minimum. She gets upset that we no longer have sex. If I told her why we don't, I'd spend the next couple months being her emotional punching bag for much longer than the current 30hrs a week and I just can't do it. I don't know what to do, but I can't tell the woman who uses me as a human vent that she is imperfect in any way. I just can't deal with the fallout that would create. What the hell do I do?**"
"My (26f) husband (30m) Just walked out on me and our two young kids. I don’t know how to fix it.


I don’t understand. There has been no cheating, no issues. He makes this all my fault. He is unhappy and I think he is not adjusting to the dad life very well, and is regretting having another baby. I don’t know because he refuses to talk about it. 

We argue a lot, over stupid things. Last night we argued because we, as a couple, agreed to get a puppy to add to our family. We picked out the puppy, paid for the puppy, and last night when I said we needed to go get some supplies for OUR puppy he said “you mean my puppy?” I said no we talked about this being a family dog. He said absolutely not, it would be his dog to do with as he wishes and it won’t be allowed in the house. I told him if that was the case I don’t want the dog. He doesn’t ever listen or compromise, it’s his way or the highway and he has all the answers. 

This morning, as soon as I woke up he refused to speak to me. I’m unsure why. I asked him what was wrong and he said he just didn’t want to talk to me. I had only been up less than 5 minutes so I’m unsure what I did that was so offensive, I tried as hard as I could to keep the kids as quiet as possible. 

Our 4 month old has also been pretty sick since birth, including several hospital stays. I’ve been worn thin taking care of her. She was sick again last night and I was up with her all night. My husband does not get up with her ever, he never has. He does work but he works shift work, so is often off anywhere from 3 to 7 days at a time. He still doesn’t get up with her. He was off today, but I was up with both of the kids all night, and I have a cold as well so I feel horrible. I run my own business and don’t have “set” business hours, I just work from home. And it’s a legitimate business, I make just as much as my husband, and it’s not an MLM or sales. I created this business on my own. I clean, cook, keep both of the kids full time, run my business and do all of the nightly feedings/changes. He just works and sometimes takes out the trash if I remind him several times. I never get help. But this morning I was so tired, he was off work and had slept all night and didn’t get up until 9am, so when our 4 month old went down at 10, I handed him the monitor and told him I was going to take a nap. I woke up 20 minutes later and found our three year old inside watching tv alone and my 4 month old screaming and sweating in her bed, with the monitor on the couch. My husband was outside sitting in the barn in the back of the house. I opened the window and yelled and asked wtf he was doing, and he came in and tried to get the baby to which I said no,never mind, I was awake. He stormed out and left. He claimed I didn’t tell him he needed to watch the kids. 

I’m just so tired. I don’t know what to fix at this point. Couples counseling is very difficult to do our schedules and being able to find sitters, but maybe it’s to the point we need it. 

I think I just suck at relationships and need to be alone. 


TLDR; husband changed drastically after the birth of our second child. I don’t know what to fix when I don’t even know what’s wrong. "
"I (43 F) just realized my husband (45) of over 20 years is a creep.


I found hundreds of pictures on my husband’s old phone of our female neighbor. The pictures were taken while she was in her front and backyard. He was on our property while taking the pictures. They’re zoomed in and slightly obscured in the foreground by a fence and through the slots of our deck. 

Also pictures of women walking across the street taken from inside our home.

Some pictures of me taken without my knowledge. 

It’s been going on for years. He has sort of admitted it after I pressed and told him  that I have proof. He says it’s wrong but not a big deal and that I’m making it out to be worse than it really is. He says he won’t do it again and that it rarely happened. I believe nothing he says.

It’s apparent that he uses this for masturbation material because he has his computer password protected and locks his door to look at this stuff.

I think what I found is just what he forgot to delete and is just the tip of the ice berg.

Realizing he gets off on this has come to a complete shock to me. I feel like I don’t know him. The non consent aspect of this really grossed me out.

I believe this is why he cannot climax from sex with me. He’s says that’s not the reason. 

There are many other problems in our relationship, namely his alcoholism and refusal to seek treatment.

How do I even go on with him from here? 

How creepy is this?

Why would he do this when we had an active sex life?

TL;DR My husband gets off on images of women that he has taken without their knowledge and I am creeped out."
"I [27/F] walked in on my husband [29/M] cheating on me.


My husband and I have been together for seven years, married for six months. Our relationship has been, in my eyes, perfect. We had an instant connection and fell in love very quickly. We moved in together after 3 years, got engaged at 5 years, and married on our 7 year anniversary. We never had any issues, everything between us worked smoothly. It was like fitting a piece of the puzzle together. 

When I met him he was having a hard time. He is in the military, and during bootcamp, his parents got a divorce. I helped him through this time and I believe that's what brought us even closer. We have been through a few deployments, and he has done well throughout each. In all, I've never had a reason or doubt to suspect anything was wrong.

We recently moved to Norfolk because he received orders to there. This was a huge decision, as my family is in California, and I couldn't imagine being away from my home. But as man and wife, I knew it was time to branch off. After we moved out here, 5 months ago, he has been acting strange. He is always on his phone, and he recently put a passcode on it. I thought this was odd, as he thinks it's stupid. I don't snoop through his phone, but he invested one of those ring doorbells. He was in the shower when the notification went off, when I went to look, that's when I noticed the passcode. I thought it was odd, and it began bugging me. When I asked, he said someone from work stole his phone as a joke and downloaded porn on his phone. I laughed it off, but still feeling odd about it. I also noticed his work hours increased.

(I am currently 24 weeks pregnant at the moment.) The next day, I made an appointment for a usual check up, however it turned out my appointment was cancelled that day because there doctor called out sick. I had missed that phone call so I had already driven to my docotors office, which isn't far from our home. I decided to stop at the grocery store before going home. In all this maybe took 45 minutes to an hour, normally I would have been gone for at least 2 or 3 hours. 

When I pulled up to our driveway, I noticed a car that wasn't ours. I found this very odd so I took photo of the car in our driveway, and the license plate. I went inside and upstairs to tell my husband there was someone's car in our driveway. When I walked in, they were in the middle of having sex. My husband freaked out and confused to as why I was home early. I didn't acknowledge him, I told the other girl to get out of my home. I gave her five minutes to get our otherwise I call the police. I walked out to go downstairs and I hadn't realized her clothing was on the floor in our living room. I am thankful I did notice because I decided to take a photo of her name tape. 

After she left, my husband came downstairs carrying and begging me to stay with him, that it was a mistake. I didn't believe him. I asked to see his phone, and he did. I found countless photos of her, conversations, etc. She is also married. I took screenshots of certain conversations and forwarded them to myself. In all honestly, I didn't have much to say. I asked him to leave our home or I would. He didn't want me to leave, so I packed my things and was able to stay with a friend. She was one of the first few people I met out here. I'm currently staying with her, but I do not know to proceed. I did not tell my husband where I went, and he's been texting me demanding to know where I am because I'm endangering our child. I told him I was safe and he needed to not worry. He is still texting me to come home and talk, and that he needs help and doesn't know what love is vs meaningless sex because of his parents divorce. I call bullshit.

What do I do? The obvious answer divorce, which I want, but I don't know how to proceed, how to move back home with our unborn child. My mother will be flying out here in a few days, she wants me to go home with her but I don't know if I can leave?

*TL;DR: Husband, together for 7 years, married for 6 months, has been cheating on me with his co-worker, for 5 months. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant. I want a divorce and to go back home to California but I don't know how to leave with our unborn child.*"
"I [28M] think I may have just lost my best man [28M] for my upcoming wedding


Hey Guys,
 
.Throwaway account, names have been changed, yada yada. I was really trying to keep this short, but I obviously failed
 
TL;DR: I’m not inviting my best man’s S.O. to my wedding after her behavior at the past couple events.
 
So here’s how everything has built up. I’ve been friends with Jake (27M) since we met at camp when we were both 12, and continued to go to this camp every summer (as a camper at first, and then as counselors) up until our early twenties (I stopped going a little earlier than him, had to get a real life job). Additionally, we went to same university, hung out constantly with the same group of friends, and lived together for a year in the dorms. When I was struggling with whether I should propose to my now fiancée and has generally been the guy who I feel like is willing to see eye to eye and discuss issues with even if he’s not personally involved.
 
Jake was dating a girl named Erin (30F) from about freshman year of college (winter of 2009) until about a year and half ago (Fall of 2016). They had a rocky end to their relationship in my opinion. They had a few different periods of breaking up and getting back together throughout their relationship and towards the end Erin wanted to get married, but Jake was not into it. I think it was pretty obvious that their relationship was over, and Erin ended up breaking up with Jake at a wedding in September 2016. They were LDR at the time (they were both in graduate programs at different universities), I was kind of relieved at the time because this relationship had been dead standing for a while with their significant differences in how they wanted to move the relationship forward.
 
It’s worth noting that although Erin didn’t go to our camp growing up (it’s an all boy’s camp) but was a cousin of one of our friends and went to our sister camp. She also worked at our camp for a few summers with Jake. The point of this is to say she has established herself as a friend of most the people in our camp circle.
 
Two big things happened right after Erin and Jake broke up. The first is that my fiancée and I moved back to my hometown where large contingents of camp friends live, including Erin. Jake specifically encouraged us to hang out with Erin as he didn’t want this break up to create a rift in any relationships. I really respected this, as I knew there was still animosity between them.
 
The other big things that happened is Jake immediately jumped into a new relationship with his current SO, Jess. We were introduced to Jess and hung out with her a couple times just the four of us, and she seemed nice but quiet. No problem whatsoever, I understand it can be really hard to meet new people, and it’s not like she was rude or anything.
 
The issues with Jess have stemmed from the last three times we’ve hung out together, which happen to be in big groups. The first was during a big party for a local sports event; all of our camp friends got tickets together for a local NFL game in fall 2017, and my Fiancée and I hosted a party the night before (Saturday). I thought everything went well, but according to Jake and Jess, Jess tried to approach Erin and Erin was pretty standoffish and didn’t really give her the time of day. I’m not sure what else happened after that, but Jess didn’t really jive with any of the other girls there. My fiancée had a long talk with the two of them after the game on Sunday, where Jess expressed that she wasn’t feeling like she was making connections with the people in the group. My fiancée tried to suggest strategies, but what it came down to was to try and stay positive and hop in when you can!
The next event was a New Year’s (2017/2018). This was again a camp party where about 20 people all met up at a friend’s family’s lake house. Again Erin was here, but everything was going fine. While a bunch of the guys (myself included) went for a hike in the cold, Jess actually led a Yoga session for all the people in the house and it seemed like everyone had a really good time! On New Year’s Eve, all the girls got dressed up with each other, and Jess went out of her way to help do all the girls’ hair. Everything seemed to be going well from the outside.
 
From talking with Jake though, apparently there were some perceived slights from the other girls towards Jess. The one that literally blew up was later in the evening; Jake and our friend Joe were having a conversation around the kitchen island while Jess and Joe’s GF, Lisa, were just standing next to their guys. Joe, in an attempt to get the two of them talking, says “Hey Lisa, you’ve met Jess right?” in a joking manner. Lisa responds in kind by saying “Oh no, hi Jess I’m Lisa!” Jess obviously doesn’t perceive this as a joke, and responds “how could you say that?! I was just doing your hair for three hours!” and storms off. Jake goes off to console her… and then comes back and gets in Joe and Lisa’s faces about how they won’t give Jess a chance and how they’re acting shitty to her. And by in their face, I mean screaming right at them. My fiancée tries to come over and intervene, explaining that she saw everything and Jess must’ve just missed the joke… so he starts yelling in her face too. I’m not present for most of this, but I got outside at one point to see Jake still yelling at Lisa so I get between the two, tell Jake to leave, and try to console Lisa.
 
In Jake’s “defense”, he had not been drinking much at the time due to a medical issue and was definitely blackout due to his low tolerance and the day worth of drinking that we had all done before then. He kind of apologized to Joe and Lisa in the morning, but didn’t remember that he also got in my Fiancée and my face (I brought this up recently during our talks after the most recent event). But it was a side of Jake that none of us had ever seen before; quite frankly it was scary.
 
After this date Jake was moving out west for work so he and Jess took a long road trip across the country, after which Jake moved into his new place and Jess went back home to her parents on the east coast, where she is currently working. They have been doing the LDR relationship since that time.
 
The final and most recent event was a joint Bachelor/Bachelorette party that my Fiancée and I threw at her parents’ vacation house on the Eastern coast over Memorial Day. It was a group of about 25 people from both of our lives: college friends, friends from both of our hometowns, and a few camp people mixed in there too (Erin was NOT there). The weekend was incredible, everyone made friends with other people from the separate groups and got along just fine… except for Jake and Jess. They went off on their own for the most part (e.g. taking out a canoe for just themselves for hours while everyone else was hanging out, not being present for yard games we played, etc.) There was one point where everyone was in a big circle on the porch and they specifically chose to sit 15 feet outside of the circle just the two of them. I said “why are you guys sitting there, come hang out with everyone!” and tried to get them involved. It just felt like they were really there to see each other, and not to celebrate our upcoming nuptials which really hurt, especially coming from the guy who agreed to be my best man.
 
Anyways, on the last night a bunch of the girls turned on some pop-y dance music and were having a dance party on the porch. I had gone up there and was dancing with my fiancée, when Jake comes over and grabs me and Fiancée to go “have a talk with Jess”. So we immediately comply, and Jess says that she’s been feeling excluded. She brings up a bunch of examples like that she wasn’t invited to the dance party (no one was, all you had to do was go up there and dance), that my fiancée made “a face” at her during a bachelor/bachelorette card game, and some other minor slights that she perceived. We did get offensive and raise our voices saying that those slights are BS, and brought up that they have been basically excluded themselves! After some back and forth, we are very exasperated and are basically yelling “What do you want us to do to make you feel more included?!”
 
At this point she basically runs off crying, and attempts to start driving home at 1:30 in the morning. Thankfully the Maid of Honor comes over and talks to her and tries to hear her out, which I guess made her feel well enough to stay the night at least. The MOH’s direct quote from that conversation is that Jess seems to have “a very rough perception of reality”. They end up leaving the next morning without saying goodbye to anyone or helping to clean.
 
Since then, my fiancée and I have been in contact with Jake a few different times over skype. We tried to hash out how to move forward from this, and he really wanted us to apologize to Jess for yelling at her (which we did immediately). We tried to explain that nothing good was going to come out of a drunken late night confrontation like that, and were pretty upset that he basically walked us into a fight like that.
 
This past weekend Jess had flown out to visit Jake, and we had a skype call between the four of us. She never really gave us an apology for bringing up accusations against us that night, but instead used this call to go through all her justifications on why she was acting so shitty that weekend and in general. She admitted that she was not looking forward to coming down for that weekend, but wanted to do it anyways because she doesn’t get to see Jake often. She admitted that she was shut down and reserved because of how girls associated with our camp had treated her in the past, and made a bunch of statements about “how girls are”. She explained that she has a hard time telling the difference between camp people and other people at our party (understandable), so I guess her reaction was to shun everyone.
 
 She also described herself as “real” in the sense that if she has an issue with someone she won’t act “fake” and nice to them, but will rather bring up any issue directly. She explained that she just wanted “a buoy to hang onto” that she could socialize with at these events and felt like she wasn’t getting that.
 
My fiancée and I were unsure whether we wanted her to attend our wedding after the bachelor/ette party blow up, but after the skype call with her we decided that we didn’t want her there. In our talk with her, apparently a couple of camp girls that are close friends with Erin were outwardly hostile to her, and all of them are coming to our wedding (Erin included). In addition to that, Jake is supposed to be my best man and will be stuck hanging out with the rest of the groomsmen and I all day so she’d be on her own. Out of all these other events, she has not been able to make a significant friendship with someone else there, so she’d really be on her own all day. She would not have a good time, it would be seriously stressful and distracting to the guy who’s really supposed to be by my side that day, and she brings the potential to have another big dramatic fight; all things I don’t want at my wedding. Additionally, if she can’t be there to be happy for us and celebrate at our bachelor/ette party, why do I think she’ll be able to do that at our wedding?!
 
I texted Jake yesterday to let him know that we aren’t going to invite her. This obviously stressed him out, and he sent responses along the lines of “The exclusion continues… from my own friends” and “Jess is the easiest person to remove from the situation for your wedding to go smoothly and I get it. But it’s not totally her fault”. I immediately called him and we had a 1.5 hour conversation about what to do going forward. He agreed that she wouldn’t have a good time, but said that she’s obviously going to be hurt by this and the relationship between us and Jess will be forever damaged by this. He went on to say how they’ve been talking seriously about marriage and starting a family, and how important she is to him. He also explains how he’s going to feel sad at our wedding because he’ll be thinking about Jess.
 
Honestly, I feel bad because at this point I feel like I’m driving a wedge between him and his SO. I let him know that if he feels like he can’t handle best man duties, that’s totally fine. I go on to say that I don’t want to fuck up his relationship with Jess, and if he feels like he can’t attend our wedding while doing that, that he’s more than welcome to skip the entire thing. I told him I didn’t need his answer right now, and he said that he really appreciated my sentiment. He said he had to think on it, and I said that’s fine, but please let me know when you do because I’ll need to get a new best man.
 
I don’t even know what my question is from here. I’m honestly really hurt that Jess is driving this huge divide between him and all his friends associated with our camp, but I’m more hurt that he’s letting her. He’s told me of some of the catty things three of the camp girls have done towards her, but it’s already poisoned her view of the entire group and it’s obvious she wants nothing to do with us. It just seems like she has some victim-complex and needs all of Jake’s attention on her at these events. Other people have commented to him about how different he is around her, and I really just want my friend back.
 
I guess my question is what do I do now? Our wedding is in August, so I really don’t have much time to bring in a new best man or anything like that. Should I just bite the bullet and invite her, and pray that she doesn’t come (fiancée is 100% against this idea)? Is this just one of those times where people grow up and grow apart and I need to let him go his own way?
 
If you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read through my jumbled thoughts. I don’t expect this to get big, so I assume I’ll be able to respond to all comments.

TL;DR: I’m not inviting my best man’s S.O. to my wedding after her behavior at the past couple events. I think he may not end up coming too."
"I've (30f) been going to a therapeutic massage place for years. The best therapist (20s?) speaks broken English, or so I thought. I saw her out last night and she was American as apple pie. She's used her ""lack"" of language to her advantage. Do I call her out? Quit going? Let her be?


Basically this is one of the weirdest situations I've ever been in. I've been going to a local therapeutic massage therapy spa for just under a year. I was in a severe car accident and got a pretty generous settlement from the other insurance, one benefit was more or less monthly massages. 
 
This place is totally on the up and up and not an ""Asian Massage Parlor"" at all, though by far the best therapist I've clicked with is this girl ""Po"" who claims to be from Thailand, though she is a LMT in my state. She is literally a miracle worker with her hands I think that part of my recovery from the accident can very much be attributed to her skills. Po claims to speak very little English, but we've always communicated well. However she is constantly mis-ringing up credit card transactions to her benefit, giving improper change, claiming she thought a massage was 90 minutes or 2 hours when the person only scheduled one...


Then what she'll do is claim that she doesn't' understand what the person is asking her to fix and usually people are so satisfied with the massage and the amounts are so small ($5-10) and she takes so long to ""fix"" the problem, people will very often say ""oh it's ok, we'll settle up next time"" or ""just keep it as a tip."" She doesn't do this to me anymore because I would always just call the manager to fix the problem instead of waiting for her and I am also a very generous tipper since I'm not paying for the massage out of pocket (tip comes out of my pocket). Basically none of the above has ever kept me from going to this place, nor does anyone else seem to mind too much and they just deal with it. 


I don't go out very often since I've hit 30 but last night I decided to hit happy hour at a bar that is about an hour from my ""normal"" part of town. There was a table of younger girls next to us who were as buzzed and as loud as you can be. I happened to glance over and saw ""Po"" looking more like a typical American Instagram girl than a demure Thai massage therapist. She also sounded like Hannah Montana with perfect American vernacular. 


I was shocked and couldn't keep staring at her. I kept trying to convince myself that it wasn't her and sort of overheard her stories where she talked about going ""wake boarding behind BAE's sick boat"" I was almost convinced but she noticed me and our eyes locked and I knew for certain it was her.  I didn't know what to do so as I sat and thought she apparently convinced her table that they needed to leave because within 5 minutes, they were totally gone. 


So what do I do with this? Do I call her out? Do I report her to her boss? Do I just let her be but quit getting the amazing massages? Do I just keep my mouth shut and let her do her thing?


**tl;dr: I just found out that the massage therapist I have been going to for a long time now actually speaks perfect English, when she has pretended to not understand and used that to her benefit for as long as I've know her. What do I do with this information?**

"My (24F) father (46M) refuses to come to my wedding because it wont be on ""American Soil"" I'm really upset and my father thinks I'm being Overly sensitive.


Some background: My father is a bit of a nationalist.... hes a little much. I love my country but not like he does. We dont agree on much to be honest. My father wasnt around much until my teenage years. My parents separated when I was 6.

 I planned most of the wedding with my mother we decided since I don't have many friends and we decided a cruise wedding would work best for us. And it was WELL within our budget. I want a tiny ceremony and figured this would make it easy for everyone. I had told my father ahead of time that we were probably going to go on a cruise. He said that was fine with him. 

Skip forward to now, were about 7 months out from the wedding and were trying to put the down payments for everything we need now. I call my father to confirm information with him in terms of pricing and such since he is helping us pay. He asks me where the stops on the cruise were. I explain that were going to the Bahamas. He asked if any of those places were American territories. I told him no. He then starts hooting and hollering that his daughter is going to be married on American soil, he refuses to get on that ship, and he's never leaving this country. And how He thought were doing an Alaskan cruise. I was a bit shocked by this outburst and got a bit upset. He told me I was being too emotional. We fought back and forth for a bit and it ended with him saying, ""If you work hard to convince me and don't pout about it I might change my mind."" Before hanging up on me. 


Now I'm just sitting here and I dont really know what to do. I want my father there but I already set my heart on this cruise. So do I continue with it as just say screw my dad or do I spend the next 6 months begging him to come on this cruise with me? 


Tldr: My dad refuses to go on a cruise off American soil for my wedding and wants me to try to convince him otherwise."
"[UPDATE] My [21F] Parents [46F][61M] have decided to put down the family cat but won’t let me be there.


If you don’t know the first part, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8l6a31/my_21f_parents_46f61m_have_decided_to_put_down/?st=JIGC38CD&amp;sh=22f4862a) it is. 
A bittersweet story unfortunately. Ping (the family cat in question) was put to sleep at 10:01 am today, 6/15/18. I am an absolute mess about this but the only good part is that I was there. I convinced my mother to not only let me be present, but to individually take Ping to the vet. I am so thankful for the few minutes we got together privately before she fell asleep forever in my arms. 
I’m sorry, I wish I had better news. 

TL;DR: I took Ping to the vet and she was put to sleep in my arms. "
"Update. SIL (25F) announced my (29f) baby's birth on Facebook without my knowledge.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8cw34y/sil_25f_announced_the_birth_of_my_29f_baby_to_the/?utm_source=reddit-android

So this is just a tiny update (vent). It's my daughter's birthday, and SIL has posted a flipping SLIDESHOW of images of my daughter on her Facebook page, with a long long paragraph about her ""special bond"" with her ""mini me"". (For context, we live on opposite sides of the country, and they have the same eye colour, so this is a bit of a stretch)

SIL has been told and told again that we have set up a private Facebook group for the kids for sharing this kind of thing. Over the past maybe year, she has been pushing the boundaries of this with reposting old photos which we let slide. 

I'm just mad because this slideshow is all photos she didn't take (including at least one grainy screenshot of a photo taken by my photographer friend) of events in my daughter's life she wasn't there for (that she has downloaded from the private page) interspersed with the photos she does have of herself and my daughter. 

I get that she's just excited, loves her nieces, misses them, wishes she could be a part of their big days but can't. It's sweet that she made a whole slideshow and heartfelt paragraph. But on the other hand I'm so irate that she keeps using my kids to fish for likes and attention, without my knowledge or permission. 

I'm sick of trying not to hurt her feelings when we bring this up. We're always like ""Oh hey it's so nice and thoughtful that you made that photo collage on Facebook for baby's first st Patrick's day (wtaf) but maybe next time just post it in the private group (that we set up for you because you can't live a moment of your life without putting it online)""

What to say to her now..?

TLDR: 3 years ago SIL announced the birth of my child on Facebook while I was still in surgery. Now it's baby's birthday and she's covered Facebook in stolen images of my kid. Can she just not. "
"I [18F] found a “Creepies” folder on my boyfriend’s [18M] photo/video back up app and don’t know what to make of it.


My boyfriend and I have been dating since July 2016. About 30 minutes ago, I found an album called “Creepies” backed up to one of his many back up accounts. I believe I logged into the wrong account because when I was on his last one these pictures weren’t there and there were thousands more. On this account, there are about 70 photos (29 of which are “Creepies”) and 6 videos. 5 of which are him touching me in my sleep and recording it (videos I was definitely not aware existed) and the 6th is of a random 50 year old-ish woman dancing at what appears to be a festival. I believe I used the wrong email (he has multiple) to log in and his password is always the same so I was able to get in.

In the “Creepies” folder I found 29 photos that really creeped me out. They were all of 2 different (one of a third) girls from behind. Clearly meant to take a picture of their butts. Their outfits change about 3 times and we were in high school at the time and it appeared to be the same class and definitely the same girls which implies he did this for at least 3 days. 

I was absolutely shocked when I first found them. I can’t be 100% sure but I’m pretty positive one of the girls was a girl he said he had a crush on all the way back in freshman year. It looks exactly how she looks from the back. I assumed immediately that all these photos were taken back then. The photos were mostly her (at least more than half). I was still upset and pretty creeped out myself to find them. I decided to look at the date of the first photo to see that it was taken September 16, 2016. It took me a while to figure out if it was before or after July 2016 (either way we had been basically devoted to each other by about May 2016) and while this would have taken me like 1 second under normal circumstances I had to stare at the date for a good 45 seconds. When I was 100% positive these photos were taken while we were dating I started shaking and my stomach instantly knotted up. 

I don’t know what to make of these photos and I’m scared to death someone is going to tell me this is “normal” because this does not feel normal. I feel violated in so many ways. I just need to know how you guys would feel if you were in this situation and I need some advice moving forward.

TL;DR: found a backed up album on one of my boyfriends many back up accounts titled “Creepies” which held 29 photos of 2 different girls (one more than the other) from behind, clearly aiming to photograph their butts. We were dating at the time these photos were taken and I need advice on how to move forward."
"Our (27/F and 29/M) neighbors (50's/M&amp;F) are insane and we are afraid to leave our own house.


Hi everyone. 

I have been a subscriber here for years and see how much you help everyone, and I am at the end of my rope and need advice. Not even using a throwaway because at this point IDGAF. 

My husband and I have been happily married for 4 years, and bought our first home in 2016. We had normal neighbors who kept to themselves, we waved back and forth and shared pleasantries during the holidays - normal neighbor behavior. Well, those neighbors moved and sold their house and a seemingly nice older couple purchased it. They were pleasant albeit a little loud/sarcastic, nothing we couldn't handle. For background's sake, my husband and I are very much homebodies and we love nothing more than being home with each other. I am a full-time nurse and full-time student and he runs his own company, so we get 2-3 hours together at night and then weekends which never seem like long enough! That being said, we are still social with those we cherish and do go out and do things once or twice a month. We just love being home, playing PS4, making lavish dinners, drinking and being merry, just enjoying one another. 

Our neighbors started to encroach the day they moved in. The husband, we will call him Kerry, came over and banged loudly on our door and then asked for my husband's help moving a sofa. No big deal, my husband and I are both overly generous/overly nice people and even though my husband had hurt his shoulder at work that day - he went and moved the couch for our neighbor. The next day, I got home from work and saw Kerry peering out the window into our driveway. No big deal, we live 30 feet from each other. Well, 20 minutes later, when my husband pulls in, Kerry appears in their front yard and shuffles around and then calls over asking my husband to come look at something. My husband goes over, and ends up crawling around underneath their house in the crawlspace checking for mold. My husband came home an hour later filthy and covered in cave crickets and dirt, saying he wasn't really given the option to say no.

(*CAVEAT*
My husband and I both, as I said, are nice to a fault. We have had a hard time with people in our lives saying no even when we were being taken advantage of, so I know this is partly our fault, but bear with me.)

The next day, the wife, we will call her Rudy, shows up asking for some baking materials like baking powder. I tell her I don't have any, and she says she will be making us dinner and will be back soon. I can appreciate the kindness in this, but I didn't ask for it, and dinner is an event at our house and we look forward to it all day. She said that was nonsense and she would be back over with it. She did return and I thanked her. 

Meanwhile, she texts and calls me constantly throughout the day while I am working, asking me medical questions and getting upset if I don't respond. This goes on for days and I mostly ignore her because I am working and don't think anything of it, I have told her I am working and am not available. She shows up at my door nearly nightly, so it is becoming hard to literally ignore them, or if we are in the back yard Kerry will kick around their gutter til one of us looks over at him, then he will engage us and invite themselves over. The next day I give her the names and numbers of reputable physicians here in town and tell her I can't give her medical advice, but to get established with any of the physicians I named. She didn't reply to me and I hoped I had gained some ground. 

I hadn't. Kerry was peering out the window again about a week later when my husband and I arrived home together, and he bursts out his front door and makes some comment to engage us. Now afraid of the commitment of engaging with him we wave and shuffle towards our house, but Kerry follows us. He asks my husband to unload and move in a refrigerator for him. I jump in and say my husband just hurt his shoulder and shouldn't, but Kerry really ignores me and confronts my husband directly about doing it. Again, pushovers that we are, he helped him.  

Meanwhile, Rudy brings over baked chicken and says we need to be there at 9am the next day for breakfast burritos and won't take no for an answer. She insists she is ""helping me"" by taking the pressure off me to make food since I am working and going to school full-time. I assured her this was not necessary and that we do enjoy cooking together at night. She said that isn't possible and that she would be back. 

This goes on for literally months, until I break. Every instance of eye contact with either one of them turns into hours of commitment because they invite themselves over/won't let us leave/literally refuse to go or let us go or when we protest tell us it's nonsense and that they are helping us. Her and her husband at this point text me throughout the day each day (neither of them work) and call me within literally seconds of me pulling into my driveway. If I am in my backyard, suddenly one of them will appear and just sit out there making noise and watching me or my husband until we look over (we sometimes never do, so they just yell as if they have just noticed us and engage in literally 1-2 hours of them talking to a captive audience). I have gone so far as to set up calls from my family to save us from them, which they still ignored and tried forcing us to stay. 

Moving on, this had gone on about 2 months when my dad had a stroke and I was caring for him and at the hospital as often as possible while taking 18 credit hours and working 40 hours a week. I stopped responding to them because frankly I didn't have the energy anymore and began pretending I was on the phone when I got home and my husband did the same. Kerry would follow me across the yard and ask if I was on the phone, literally while I am holding the phone to my head and having a fake conversation. We stopped answering the door and Rudy began coming over days in a row knocking on the door, having full conversations with my dog through the window asking my dog where I was and what I was doing, she would stand outside my door for 20-30 minutes talking through the window and texting me from outside that she was there. It was torture for a passive person like me. I responded to her that I have a lot going on with school, work, and my dad and that we are private people who appreciate our alone time and we hope they take care. She never responded. They continued their usual habits and we continued ours until the other night, my husband and I were outside having a beer and Kerry literally came walking up behind the bushes in the pitch darkness and yelled over to us. We were caught so off guard after being so careful and within a minute they were piling into our back yard and pulling up chairs to tell us about their medical problems and ask why we didn't answer the door anymore and I told them I had issues with my phone and we don't answer the door anymore because we value our privacy and if we were expecting anyone we would answer. Kerry and Rudy totally ignored this and began both calling me right in front of me to see if my phone was truly broken. Luckily I had the foresight to turn my phone on airplane mode once they started coming into our fenced yard so none of their calls went through and I didn't have to have a confrontation or make up more lies which I am terrible at. This was yesterday, and today she has already been at the door and stood there for a long time talking to my dog through the window. What's more, is that when they were over in our back yard Rudy admitted that they watch for us to come or go ""just so [they] can see [us]"". 

I am at a loss. We are terrified to leave our home or come home, we don't come or go without pretending to be on the phone or checking to see if they are outside first, and even when we do dash to the car it never fails that their garage door starts raising or they burst outside looking for us no matter where we are, it has happened every time for so many months I can no longer chalk it up to coincidence. I know we are private, and at first I felt to blame, but I literally feel like a prisoner in my own home and I don't know how to approach this. I really went out of my comfort zone by telling Rudy we are private and don't want a relationship with them, and it was ignored. Their nature is to ignore any resistance and to take what they want, even if they are forcing it. I feel crazy, and I need help. 

tl;dr: Neighbors are basically stalking us and I feel like a prisoner in my own home. "
"My [20F] friends [20-24F/M] said I'm a snitch because I acted as a witness to a hit and run.


Hi.

On my way home from work on Tuesday night, I was at a red light when I saw one car t-bone another. The car had ran a red light, and the moment the car stopped spinning, two guys ran out of the car towards a nearby building. I started to drive away and called my mom to tell her how crazy it was, but she urged me to do the right thing, turn around, and wait for the police.

I'm glad I did, because although there was one other man who stopped to be the witness, from my angle I was the only one able to see the two men fleeing on foot. The little old woman was fine and was able to crack a few jokes, but she had just dropped her husband off at the hospital and she had just bought their car that week. I gave my statement to the cops but they soon asked me to identify what they thought may have been one of the suspects and I was able to positively ID him. Basically, the car had been stolen, and they were driving recklessly because they were running from a chase in a nearby city.

I was telling my friends about the ordeal as it was happening, thinking it was a crazy adventure I didn't expect to have. I sent them a picture of me in the passenger side of the car and they said I was hanging out with the pigs. They called me a snitch for identifying the suspect and said I should have minded my own business.

Most of my friends who were saying this were black or hispanic - however, I'm also black. I'm very pro-black and involved heavily in black culture, and without getting into a debate, support some aspects of BLM. When it comes to snitching, I genuinely don't give a fuck as long as you aren't harming anyone (for example, I don't smoke, but I'm not going to rat out my neighbors when I smell them doing it). I felt like in this case, these dudes were absolute douche bags for doing a hit and run especially on an old woman having a stressful week. It wasn't like I ratted out some dudes I saw doing a drug deal. 

TLDR: I identified a suspect of a hit and run and my friends are telling me I am a snitch and siding with cops."
"My boyfriend (M/23) saves photos of girls he knows to jack off to and it gives me (F/21) major creeps.


My boyfriend of soon to be 4 years will not stop saving girls pictures from Instagram/Finstagram(a second Instagram account for girls to post half naked or fully naked photos to). It wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't girls we know but it is girls we know. 

He also secretly takes photos of girls' asses in public which really gives me the creeps. We have always had issues with this. When we first started dating he was telling other girls he wanted to be with them and so I left for a few days but he begged and pleaded for me to come back. Now here we are 3 years later and he's still doing weird shit. I've brought it up that it really really bothers me and makes me feel like I'm not good enough and he basically just gets mad I went through his phone and tells me it shouldn't make me feel any type of way.

I just don't understand why he thinks him saving photos of girls so he can jack off to them is supposed to be okay with me or at least ""not be a big deal"" as he likes to say. Is it acceptable to leave him for this? Or am I just overreacting?

Tl;dr: My boyfriend thinks him saving photos of other girls is normal and that all guys do it."
"My [25F] boyfriend [23M] is obsessed with keeping his bed clean. It's affecting our sex life and it's kind of odd


Using a throwaway because he reddits a lot and hoping he doesn't see this. 

Okay so my boyfriend ""Mike"" is wonderful. We've been together for almost 8 months now and things could not be better. He's handsome, kind, great sense of humour, we're like two peas in a pot. There is this one issue though. 

Ever since I've known him, he's a bit of a hygiene freak. Showers every day, usually twice in the summer because he 'sweats a lot'. However things take a turn when it comes to his bed. He's really picky when it comes to sleep, the lights must be off, it should be complete silence and his bed needs to be clean. 

What I mean by that is that he will shower every night before going to bed. He will only get in the bed after he's put on his pajamas, which are to be worn in the bedroom only. Any other thing is not permitted on the bed. I found out when I came to his place after work. I climbed on the bed to kiss him, he shouted at me because I was wearing my work clothes. According to him, the clothes that you wear during the day are 'dirty'. You go out in them, you sweat in them, they're not supposed to TOUCH the bed. Everytime I sleep at his, I need to bring special night clothes and lingerie to wear on the bed. Even when I'm changing I cannot throw my day clothes on the bed. 

Now onto sex. He has a high libido, so we do it almost every day. After we finish, this is what goes down. He gets up, takes a shower. As soon as he's done, he expects me to take a shower. Meanwhile he will go ahead and change the mattress cover, the duvet cover, the pillow cases and replace them with fresh ones. He's got like 6 sets of each because he changes them so often. I've told him sometimes I want to just cuddle with him and fall asleep instead of having to do this 30 minute ritual before going to sleep. He's adamant in his ways. I'm starting to dread sex because I know it'll be 2 AM and we'll be changing sheets and shit. 

Also I'm the complete opposite. It's not that I'm dirty or anything, but I do not regard my bed as 'tainted' if I accidentally let my show touch the edge of the mattress. 

I don't know what to do. He's made it clear this is how he is, he won't change. Does anyone have any advice? Anyone facing a similar issue? How did you find common ground? 

TL;DR : boyfriend is obsessive about keeping his bed 'clean' and it's affecting our sex life and I just find his behavior about it rather odd "
"I [29F] want more time alone but husband [35M] wants more ""family time""


I am a stay at home mom to a 2.5 year old boy who I'll call Bo. My husband and I have been married for 3 years and have been together for about 5 years. 

It wasn't completely my choice to be a stay at home mom (SAHM). Bo has severe eczema that requires medication, asthma and numerous allergies so my husband and I decided it would be best if I stay at home and care for him. 

I went to school for engineering and have always loved learning and working at tough jobs. I find taking care of Bo extremely boring and I feel like I don't do anything all day. My husband and I agreed that a good solution to this problem is for me to work on a side project related to the job I held before Bo was born. However I don't have time to do it because I can't just sit at my laptop for a couple of hours ignoring a toddler. Another option is to stay up late or wake up early but I'll be cranky and Bo will bear the consequences of that. My ideal solution is for my husband to come home from work and watch Bo for an hour while I do work alone, but he says he comes home from a tough day at work and doesn't want to watch Bo alone. He wants to spend time all as a family (I think partially because it's easier for him to watch Bo when I am there).

What's a good compromise?

TDLR; A stay at home mom wants time alone but overworked husband wants family time."
"My (32m) clingy overly-attached ex girlfriend (26f) won't give up despite the fact I'm married. Found out she's made fake Instagram accounts just to follow me.


I dated Kay for 2 years and I ended the relationship because she was too clingy and dependant on me. I loved her and planned on marrying her one day, but I couldn't live like we were living.

She was codependent, clingy, overly-attached, paranoid etc. We talked about it multiple times with her swearing she'd change, and then never changing. One day it was just too much, and I had to end it.

It's been almost 4 and a half years ago that I ended it. Since then, I met an amazing woman and married her, we've got our life together started and she's pregnant.

Kay was constantly coming around in any kind of way she could. She showed up at my work a few times, begging me to take her back. She's called and left a million messages and texts, so I blocked her number. She got a new number. Did it all again. Blocked again.

I couldn't ever get through to her that we're done. It's over. Not happening ever again. 

More recently, I discovered she's created multiple fake/catfish accounts just so she could follow me and see what I'm doing. I'm private on Instagram so she went all out just to be accepted.

She's impersonated my friends. One day I asked my buddy why he made a new Instagram.. He was confused and asked what I meant. Showed him and he said it wasn't him. Now this has happened multiple times so I've become careful of who I accept.

The first time she did this, she saw my life now and that I'm married and have a child on the way, and she immediately DMed me from one of her legit new accounts, and said I was causing her to be suicidal and she couldn't believe I'd betray her and marry someone else.

That's when I first found out she was making accounts just to follow me.

I don't know what to do. It probably goes without saying, but she's got mental problems most likely from her past abusive relationship. But she's not moving on and it concerns me.

I don't want to go to the police because I feel horrible and she's not necessarily done anything God awful, it's just annoying at this point.

Just need some reddit friends to help me out here.

Tl;dr; ex girlfriend still won't get over me. She made fake Instagram accounts that I accepted, then God mad and said she was suicidal when she discovered I'm married with a child on the way. She had a rough relationship before me that left her scarred and mentally she isn't 100%. I haven't gone to the police for this reason. Do I have any other options? "
"My wife [26F] suddenly wants me [28M] to switch jobs from skilled trade to an office job. I am extremely opposed to the idea and she is refusing to listen to me.


Hey! I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting a little frustrated by this, but I'll try and keep feelings out of it and just give you an unbiased version.

I started dating Erin five years ago, and we got hitched three years ago. I was in the military at the time, but working more\-or\-less the same thing I do now (mechanic). I really, \*really\* enjoy my job. I find something weirdly relaxing about just tuning out the world and focusing on making a broken car not broken. And getting paid to do that is even better. I think I have been pretty clear throughout the entire relationship that I like what I do and I intend to keep at it until I am physically unable to work on cars anymore.

Erin is a wonderful girl and I absolutely wouldn't want anyone else as my wife, please don't take anything I say to mean otherwise. But she had a hard time nailing what she wanted to do in life. She went to college for a while, decided she didn't like it, now she works in a ""creative"" field. She seemed happy with her place in life and never gave any indication she was unhappy with mine.

And I should note, we are not hurting for money. Between the two of us we are doing just fine financially.

So anyway, we were cuddling on the couch last week one day after we both got home, and out of nowhere she mentions her brother\-in\-law, Joey. Joey works office life for a certain well\-known company in our city. Erin told me that Joey had mentioned some openings in his office, and he could get me an inside track if I was interested. I'm technically qualified due to some side\-stuff I did in the Army, but those skills are well\-rusted. And I don't want to go work there anyway.

Erin told me this and then asked me if I'd be interested and I told her ""Um, no, not really"". I think I was just kind of surprised that she would even ask considering I already have a career I'm interested in and honestly I haven't made any real effort to hide some mild contempt I have for the ""corporate environment"" (No offense to anyone who works there, just a personal thing).

Erin seemed kind of disappointed by me turning it down. I asked her what was bothering her and she said ""Well it was just really nice of Joey to make us the offer and I hate to tell him no."" I told her I also appreciated Joey trying to hook us up (And I do), but I would hope he would understand not wanting to turn around and leave a career you love.

Erin let it go for a short while, but she keeps bringing it back up. She talks about how I would make more money, which is technically true but it's only a difference of like, $200 a month, and it is well\-worth that much to not have a job I hate, in my opinion. And as I said, it's not like we're hurting for money.

Then Erin will bring up how much ""nicer"" it is working in an office. Clean, Air\-conditioned, doesn't smell like motor oil, etc. Again, I can definitely understand why someone likes working in an office, but personally, I'd rather go stamp out a checmical fire with my face. I like where I work, where I don't have to bother shaving if I don't feel like it, I don't have to cover my tattoos, I can go out and smoke a cigarette when I want to, and I can occasionally shout a cuss word across the bay without anyone getting bothered.

Plus my co\-workers are all cool as shit and I sincerely doubt I would find people I enjoy working with as much as them if I were to leave.

I don't know, I guess this is kind of getting on my nerves. I feel like I have been pretty clear with Erin that I don't want to leave where I work but she just will not let it go and be done. I never even raise my voice at that girl but every time she asks me about that damned job now I want to shout ""NO, I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING WORK AT \[COMPANY\]!!!"".

And this is all so out of the blue. Before last week she never once gave me an indication that she did not like my job or my place in life, so why is she suddenly trying to make me jump tracks?

How do I get this girl to drop it with the damned office job? And this is one of those things that seems like there is some hidden root\-issue, but I don't even know what the hell it is? Help?

TL;DR: After BIL offered to help me get an office job at his company, wife keeps trying to convince me to try it. I really, really don't want to and am plenty happy where I am at. She won't drop it."
"My girlfriend (30F) left the country after I (32F) got pregnant


I'm posting to a throwaway because I'm a little mortified by this entire situation. Also, sorry if my thoughts aren't very coherent, things are crazy right now.

My girlfriend and I dated for 4 years, but we never really had interest in getting married. It just seemed so unnecessary to us, so we just skipped over it when we started moving forward in our relationship. We got an apartment together, and decided a little while ago that we wanted to try and have children. We went the IVF route with a sperm donor, but my girlfriend said she didn't want to carry, so I volunteered. Obviously, it was a taxing experience and it was new for us both, but we made it through, and about a week ago, we got the news that we're expecting!

This is where everything just goes wrong. The next morning, she wasn't around, but I wasn't too worried, you know? I figured she might've gone for a jog or something. Then, I realized that both of her suitcases were gone, as well as most of her clothes and other things. When I checked our safe, all her jewelry and documents were gone. All she'd left was a note saying that she felt as though we'd been rushing into things, and she wasn't even sure if she was a lesbian anymore, and she needed time to experience adulthood and find herself before she could come to raise a child. Towards the end of the note, she said she was leaving the country with some friends, and didn't know when she'd be back.

She withdrew roughly three thousand dollars from our savings over the past few weeks (I hadn't been checking on our finances lately), so even if she's still in the country, she's got a good amount of our money with her. And, here I am. I'm pregnant, no girlfriend, down thousands of dollars. I don't even know. I'm so lost. What do I do?

Tl;dr: My girlfriend left me after we got pregnant, and she's now out of the country."
"I think the security camera in my [19/F] house is ruining my relationship with my new boyfriend [21/M].


Okay this is going to be a very ridiculous story to some of you but I advise you I am serious about it. 


My parents very recently installed a security camera inside my condo (I am living away from home for university, about three hours away from them). At first, it was for security reasons but now I feel like they're ""keeping an eye"" on me. I very recently talked to them about how it makes me feel uncomfortable being watched and they told me that it wasn't for them to watch me, but for security and ""peace of mind"". They are paying for my rent so I can't do very much about it. It sits facing the living room and front door. 


My boyfriend of three weeks came over to visit me the other night (I've known him longer, but it has ""officially"" been three weeks). He stayed until about 1 AM. We stay in my room, which is not recorded, but my parents can see if he enters. He told me the security camera made him feel uncomfortable. Ever since then, I've felt that it might be a threat to our new relationship of three weeks. I want him to feel comfortable when he stays over, but at the same time, I am kind of in an awkward position. Well, my parents found out that he was over and brought it up to me about how he shouldn't come over at night, but he has stayed over a few times (outside of their knowledge).


This is driving me insane because it feels like I'm being forced to choose between my boyfriend and respecting my parent's decisions. At the same time, it feels as if my parents are becoming obsessive as they often monitor my behavior. I don't understand why they all of a sudden decided to keep an eye on me, but I want to know if their decision to install a security camera is justified. 


I have turned off recording through the night, but they can still see the live stream. This bothers me a lot to feel as though I've run out of choices and are deceiving my parents. I really don't want my boyfriend to feel uncomfortable, but at the same time, I don't want to disrespect my parents. 


Are my parents justified in doing this? Should my boyfriend just accept it? Should I just accept it? What should I do? The relationship is still new so I don't want this camera to scare him away. I don't want to think that ""if he loves me enough he will just live with it"" or anything like that. I know we both deserve privacy.


tldr: parents recently installed a security camera to keep watch on what enters and goes on in the common areas of my condo. New boyfriend of three weeks feels uncomfortable because it feels like his privacy is being invaded through being watched. I feel like I'm being torn in half to choose between my parents and my boyfriend. It also feels like my parents don't trust me, but they say it's for their own peace of mind. "
"My(29F) Parents(58M, 58F) are ruining my wedding by being total assholes but they are paying for everything.


THIS IS A BIG BLOCK OF TEXT I AM SO SORRY: 

My FH and I do not have a ton of money so when we originally decided to get married we thought we would have a small courthouse wedding and then go to our favorite pizza joint/dive bar afterwards. This would have been totally fine with us and we would have paid for everything ourselves and we would have been happy. For reasons that aren’t necessary to explain with this story, we are still going to do that for Wedding #1. 

Now this is where it gets complicated. I come from a very upper middle\-class home. While I don’t have money, my parents do. And because they have money, they offered to pay for the traditional big wedding. I initially had some misgivings about taking them up on this offer, but I decided to accept because I could see it was important to them and it’s really hard to say no to your dream wedding. From there it has been a complete disaster. 

It started when they wouldn’t give me a budget to work within and I could tell that they didn’t understand initially how much an average wedding in our area costs. I work in events and plan them regularly, meaning I always knew that the wedding in their head was a $30K wedding – which is why I knew I couldn’t pay for something like that, which is why I wanted to go to a pizza place. Explaining that to them was a nightmare because when they got married in the early 80’s they were able to do it for under $10K. Eventually they understood after hours of arguments. I have to say here, the arguments were NOT me demanding my parents pay for such extravagance, the arguments were me trying to cancel this second wedding and my parents getting angry over the fact that I couldn’t plan an opulent wedding on a $10K budget. 

My parents are kind of cheap. That’s how they got rich though, they were really cheap. And I admire that in them, I try to be the same way. Which is why I just wanted a pizza parlor wedding. 

Like I said though, eventually they understood and we moved on. We booked a beautiful wedding venue for my perfect date. We booked a band, we booked a photographer, I bought a dress, we had almost everything planned and it was perfect. 

Then situation #2 happened. My parents are American and my FH parents are Irish. In Ireland the parents do not pay for anything. Understanding that, we were not planning on asking my FH husband’s parents to pay for the traditional rehearsal dinner or anything else. However, that was not OK with my parents. To be fair, my parents did understand that they had more money and said that even if they could just buy some cases of beer and a couple bags of potato chips it would be fine, they just wanted the gesture. My FH’s parents thought it was ridiculous and my parents got angry with them. However neither side was talking to each other – it was my parents yelling at me and my FH’s parents being passive aggressive with him. Eventually his parents gave in and said they’d host something small and everyone was kind of happy. Except me, because once again other people’s emotional shit was threatening to ruin my wedding and that never would have happened if we just didn’t have one. 

Then last night happened. 

The wedding venue has a small separate hotel on the premises. The hotel books based on a first come first serve basis and at the time of the booking had not opened their books for the timeframe of the wedding date. The wedding date is on a holiday. When they did open their books, they called the first person on the waitlist and that person booked the best room in the hotel. Next, they called my mother, who I thought could handle the simple task of booking a hotel room, so I delegated that responsibility to her. However, when they informed her that the best room was taken she got upset and the receptionist hung up on her. 

I know my mother, she definitely escalated the situation and the receptionist maybe shouldn’t have hung up on her, but I would have if a stranger started yelling at me when I was just trying to do my job. Then the manager calls back and my dad gets on the phone. I also know my dad and I know that my dad also definitely flipped out and both sides agree that he threatened to sue the hotel several times. The manager then told my dad that he was no longer welcome on the premises and was going to recommend that the wedding planner cancel the entire wedding. After that call my mom calls me and says she’s really sorry and sort of explains the conversation. 

I frantically call the venue, the hotel, everyone trying to get someone there on the phone. Finally, that manager calls me back and explains to me her side of the story, which I think is probably the more accurate one. I apologize to her and she’s kind enough to say that her issue is with my dad and not with me. She also says that she’s meeting with the owner today or tomorrow to talk this through, but she doesn’t think the hotel will want the liability of allowing someone who has threatened to sue them stay on the premises. I say I understand and appreciate her position. I say I just don’t want my wedding ruined over this one instance and if she can just give me any advice on what I could do to fix this it would be greatly appreciated. She says she will see if the owner thinks that there is a way to move forward and if there is a chance she will work with me. I then ask her to please only speak to me going forward she says she agrees and we hang up. 

I then call my mom and I tell her that I take that manager’s side. If I was on the phone and a strange man called me up, starting yelling at me and threatened me, I would want nothing to do with him either. Then my parents get mad at me, saying that I’m not being loyal etc. I don’t care about being loyal to them when they are being so belligerent. The excuse I keep getting is that my dad just got off of a whirlwind three\-day trip to Europe for business and he is tired. I say I don’t care about his excuse and neither does the hotel, they don’t know him, they don’t know me, they just know that he was aggressive with him. 

After that I just refused to speak to them further and it’s been about 14 hours since I last talked to them. I want to cancel the whole thing. I want to just marry my FH in a pizza place and honestly, I don’t even want to invite my parents to it. They want to re\-plan the whole thing at a different place. My friends say I should let them do that but tell them I will have nothing to do with anything and just show up on the day in my dress. But I don’t think that they are capable of letting me do that. I just am so mad at them and I don’t know if my anger will fade and then I’ll regret not getting my dream wedding or if going along with them will ruin the joy I currently have of getting to spend the rest of my life with the man I love. At the end of the day I just want a happy marriage and I don’t know which path with lead to that, please help. 

TL:DR My crazy parents got me kicked out of our wedding venue and now I don’t know what to do. "
"My (mid 20s F) husband (late 20s M) suddenly said he wants us to see a marriage counselor. I'm hurt.


First post, kind of rambling because I've never shared our issues with anyone. Not incredibly specific in case he finds this. 

Some background: my husband and I have been together almost 4 years. We've never been the best communicators. He had a rough childhood and any conflict makes him just shut down and let me ""win,"" which I can't stand because it feels like we never come to a true resolution on disagreements. My issue in conflict is that I become incredibly defensive and my feelings are easily hurt. Also important to note is that for entire relationship until my recent difficult pregnancy, I handled pretty much all domestic duties like cooking and cleaning while working at least one full time job, and sometimes a part time job as well, while he's only ever worked one full time job. 

So we recently welcomed our first child into the world. I've been staying home with the baby and trying my best to keep up with domestic duties, but it's really hard for me to do everything with this newborn still needing so much attention and care. The baby comes first, the vacuuming can wait. After our entire relationship of me begging him for help with cleaning and giving up asking after awhile, just cleaning up after him, he has decided there is nothing more important in the world than having a clean house and he has been lecturing and nitpicking every day. This is really difficult for me to handle after so many years of not getting any help from him at all. I'm also just tired from caring for the baby. I try to do what I can and whenever I get something done, I feel really great about it until he points out something else I've messed up/haven't done. He keeps saying he's not pointing things out as a personal attack on me, and that ""we"" need to work on things, but every time he does point something out, it's something I've personally left. Meanwhile, he still leaves messes/doesn't complete his very few agreed upon chores and I don't say anything about it because I don't want to upset him. I've tried to tell him that I'm happy to do some cleaning if he could just watch the baby for awhile when he gets home from work, but he says he's too tired. Some days he doesn't do anything involving our baby, not even holding the baby, and not only is it frustrating because I struggle to get things done, but it's absolutely heartbreaking to see him not want anything to do with the baby. 

So the other day we got into an argument where, again, I was feeling good and happy for getting some things done until he pointed out something small that I didn't get to. I really just completely broke down, telling him that it's really hard caring for a newborn and doing everything else. So then he shut down, said he wants to see a marriage counselor, and we've barely talked since then. Counseling has never been brought up between us, ever. Since we're not talking and I'm with the baby 24/7, that also means he hasn't done anything at all with the baby, which hurts me the most. I usually would try to talk to him in the past, but I don't want to make things worse. 

For me, with my parents' failed relationship, marriage counseling means all else has failed, you're about to give up, and divorce is coming. It scares me so much that he feels our marriage is heading in that direction. I'm worried we're going to try counseling and nothing will change and that will be the end of it. 

Anyone in a similar situation that has gone to counseling? What was your experience? I'm so afraid we're going to spend time and money on something that won't change anything.

TLDR; my husband and I have a history of poor communication and he suddenly said he wants to see a marriage counselor. I'm afraid that means it's the beginning of the end. "
"My (30F) boyfriend (28M) inadvertently said something to my dad which caused my dad (63M) to commit suicide. I am not sure how to comfort him, or how to deal with this at all.


So my mom died from a heart attack earlier this year, completely out of the blue. Obviously me and my dad were distraught. My dad moved into the town I live in and we sort of reignited our friendship after not talking much the past 5 years. He also became really good friends with my boyfriend, who he liked a lot. 

One night, my boyfriend and my dad and me all went to a bar and we just hung out, then we went back to my apartment and I fell asleep. Apparently my dad and my boyfriend got into some deep discussion about life and stuff. My dad prompted the conversation. The conversation apparently went towards how my dad was supposed to live a normal life after my mom died, and my boyfriend in an attempt to comfort him said that his dad died as well and his mom lived a normal happy life after, even if it wasn't entirely the same. Apparently my dad started asking what her life was like and my boyfriend just said she spends most of her time alone with her hobbies and her job and that she has a few friends. My bf said my dad looked sad after that, then he left. He took his car and drove about 4 miles away to the side of the road, and shot himself. He wrote a suicide note on his phone for us to read about how he could not stand the idea of just living by himself without his wife. He said that he tried to stay happy and alive but that he recently has thought about what his life might be like, alone in the future, and it scared him too much. In the note, he apparently said a few things which were similar to what my bf described his mother as being like, and he described how he didn't want to be like that, and that it wasn't worth it. Apparently the gunshot was heard at around 12:05, meaning he shot himself only 30 minutes after leaving our apartment. The note was written at 11:59. 

Obviously I was devastated for days after. I didn't know my dad very well really, he wasn't around for the first 20 years of my life because he was in and out of jail (organized crime and what not) and even after that I only spent a tiny bit of a time with him. Then we got into a big fight over something and I sort of cut off most communication until my mom died. But the past few months I got to know him better than all of the years past combined. I realized I knew such a small amount about his life really, I knew he was an emigrant from northern Ireland and lived through the troubles but he never talked about that much. I learned he was a hardline marxist, something I also never knew. It was interesting really talking to him more for the first time in my life. Regardless, my own mourning over this is not the topic of the post. 

My boyfriend is insanely distraught over this. When he found out he locked himself in the bathroom and didn't speak for like an hour. Then he told me the conversation he had with my dad, and I realized why he was so unbelievably horrified at this. He feels like he caused this. He read the suicide note, and how much it correlated with his own story of how he described his mom. He just emotionally burst out into tears and left our apartment and didn't come back for hours. 

Its been 5 days since. He hasn't really gotten better. But he told me he doesn't want to focus on himself because it was my dad, not his dad. But I could literally see in his face how hard this is for him, I don't even know how I would feel in this case. That would devastate me to know what I said caused a man to commit suicide. I saw his hands literally shaking while he was eating dinner and then he randomly got up and went to his room without saying a word. He then took two days off of work to stay in the house all day. 

I told him he should go to therapy, he said he can't afford it, and that he is fine, and that I should be the one upset, and that he is just being a baby and that he will get over it. I told him, please do not downplay how terrible this is just because it was my dad and not yours. I would be absolutely fucking torn apart if my words accidentally lead to someone commiting suicide. 

I told him it isn't his fault, and that he likely was suicidal beforehand. But he cried again and mentioned in the suicide note he says he was 'happy and was coming to terms' before a 'recent revelation' made him realize how lonely he was going to be without his wife. He said that made him horrified, and confirmed it was his words that lead my dad to suicide. I wasn't even sure what to say. He was right. Even if he was trying to cheer up my dad, its obvious that what he said was the catalyst that lead to him killing himself. I didn't tell him that, but still. My boyfriend kind of broke down and said ""I feel like I fucking killed him"" and I just told him no, no, no you didn't do that at all. He said he knows, but he cant help but feel that way. 

What do I do? How do I deal with this? I just... idk, I feel terrible. I am sad about my dad but to be honest I barely even knew the man that well, and the times I did see him were mostly negative encounters growing up. I almost feel like he is way more broken up about this entire situation than me. 

TL;DR - - my boyfriend said something to my dad which became the catalyst which resulted in my dad killing himself. My boyfriend is absolutely destroyed by this. "
"My [22F] boyfriend(?) [26M] wants to postpone our breakup for another 3 months


My boyfriend and I have been in a LDR for a year now. We only see each other on holidays or when he's off from college. The distance itself isn't a problem, but throughout our relationship we have discovered many deal breakers and incompatibilities that have left me in tears. Sometimes he'll reassure me that there is no such thing as a perfect match and that we were the best each other could do. A few instances he has given me the option to end things with him, which I always felt was unfair because he was putting all the responsibility on me.

We are each other's first relationship, so we were able to ignore our problems in the beginning because we don't really have anything else to compare to and learn from. Just recently though, a controversial topic came up in our discussion and it finally solidified just how incompatible we are. My BF finally agreed that we ""had an expiration date"" and that we should break up. Although I felt the same way, I was still pretty upset about parting ways. He proposed that we postpone our break up for another 3 months, which is the next time we see each other. That way we can get some closure and he could ""enjoy [my] body for the last time"".

I was okay with it at first, but then during one of our routine phone calls he started talking about future girls he was going to date. I lost it and started bawling. It hurt to hear him talking about future relationships so easily, so we attempted to DTR.

He considered our arrangement to be a FWB situation, but he still wanted to call me his girlfriend because he still loved me. I asked him what would happen if we found someone else and all he could say was that it would be impossible for us to find someone in a short amount of time. To me this excuse just feels like he's trying to avoid the question. 

Again, he gave me the option to end the relationship, but not without telling me he loved me. I am confused if there is even a relationship to end. Is there such a thing as FWBs that call each other bf/gf and exchange ""I love you""'s? I want to start seeing other people, but I don't want to cheat on anyone.

Tl;Dr My BF said we are going to break up in 3 months. I am confused as to whether or not he is still my BF. "
"I (27F) feel intensely uncomfortable with the obvious attraction my boyfriend (28M) has towards our roommate (30M).


So my boyfriend is, I am pretty sure, bisexual. I am like 95% sure. I've just had so many little things build up over the years (we've been dating since we were in high school) that made me think that. The first one was that all of his guy friends used to tease him about being obviously gay/bisexual, saying that he always got a boner and tried to hide it in the lockers and that he had multiple sleepovers with a gay kid at our school. He denied it, but it was like an open secret. Then after that little things always built up my suspicions. Its just too many things now, I am pretty sure he is. 

Anyways, he denies it. I don't bring it up really at all, I have sort of jokingly asked him about it but if he denies it then I am not gonna push him at all. I know for a fact he is attracted to women considering we have sex everyday and he is almost always the one to initiate. Not only that but I remember finding a bunch of porno mags of women in his room when he was like 18. 

So we got a new roommate, Kevin. Kevin is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously hot. Literally all of my friends are head over heels over this guy, its actually kind of funny. Apparently, including my boyfriend. 

I first sort of noticed when Kevin would be shirtless all the time in the apartment and my boyfriend would stare at him sometimes. Or we would be watching television and he would constantly glance over at Kevin. Like, a lot. I would see his eyes just sort of glare over at kevins body a lot. I can't even count the amount of times we have just been hanging out and kevin comes around the living room and my boyfriend gets an obvious hard on just by him being there. We would be cuddling for hours, then suddenly Kevin walks in shirtless to get some food or some shit and then just then and there my boyfriend gets a hard on? Come on. 

Its been 3 months, and its become increasingly more and more uncomfortable and honestly obvious that my boyfriend is attracted to this guy. It makes me feel like, really weird honestly. 

But I can't even bring it up to my boyfriend. He denies being into men at all. I don't want to pressure him but now its getting sort of weird honestly. 

How do I bring this up? Its a really strange topic overall obviously. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend is really obviously attracted to our new roommate but I can't even bring it up to him because he denies being bisexual. "
"My mom (F53) threw my (F23) dolls away?!


Sorry if this is not something that can be helped on this subreddit. Last month I went on a trip to the czech republic and left my mom in charge of watching my apartment. I have/had five American girl dolls in my closet from when I was 9 years old that I was keeping to one day give to my potential future child. When I came home everything seemed normal until yesterday when I noticed that my dolls (and their accessories) were gone. 

I dismissed the idea of a break-in simply because nothing else was missing and who would chose to steal dolls over electronics. 

So I called my mom and asked her if she had maybe brought them back to her house for whatever reason. She said that she had thrown them in the dumpster because ""it is pathetic for someone your age to keep dolls"" and ""the dolls are f\*\*king useless."" Then she hung up on me. 

**Tl;dr.** I went on a trip, mom threw my dolls away while I was gone"
"My (19M) brother (16M) opened a phone contract under my name and I just received a £850 bill from it.


So this is still pretty weird for me, a few months ago my brother opened a new phone contract with Vodafone and by what he  told me my parents had the contract on their name, that was back in September 2017 and now June 2018 I have received a letter from a debt collection company with the contract under my name and saying I owe £852.27?.

I went to the local vodafone store and got told to call a number to find out details about my account so I asked my brother for the phone and I called just to be told “You came in September and opened a £59/month contract for an Iphone 6s+ and haven’t paid it since December so a default has been set on the account” and I have to pay the full contract in one go.

The letter gave me 7 days to contact them but my brother hid it and now it’s past that date! 

I am going to university in September and I’m short of money right now so I can’t afford to pay £850 in one blow.

I confronted him and he is unable to even make money because he has no job! I’ve asked help from my parents and they said they will help but I feel this should fall on my brothers shoulders not anyone else


any advice?

Tl:DR: Brother opened an account under my name and was unable to pay for it, now company wants full amount ASAP

"My husband [27M] has cut off almost all intimacy with me [25F] out of fear of pregnancy.


My husband and I have been together for 8 years (married for 2 years). We have had sex, but now it's non-existant. He has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and is on medication. He's been taking medication for 1 year now. He even goes to therapy.

The last time we had sex was a few months after our wedding night. We hadn't had sex before then as our idea was to save ourselves for **the night**. Now and again I want it so bad with him and he feels the same with me but we don't even fool around, maybe makeout but that's it! We've had conversations about it all.

Last night we had a falling out. I was all ready to go. I wore something sexy, made myself up, etc. and he comes into the room and *sighs*. 

His argument is that condoms are not 100%. As for birth control we can't afford it. We also can't afford a vasectomy/ sterlization. He offered to perform oral on me, but that's it. (I've offered blow jobs and hand jobs, but that would mean my hands would be soiled and I could end up pregnant even if I washed my hands...according to him.)

Reddit, I am so mad. I have so much pent up sexual aggression. Sure I take care of myself once in a while, but I want my husband...all of him. 

What do I do? How do I go from here?

**TL;DR: Husband cut off almost all intimacy due to the fear of getting me pregnant.**"
"Me (35m), wife (32f), friends (29f/29m) and the mystery of the missing pills


**Background**

I've been taking prescription Adderall for the past five years and have never had a problem with running out or running short until recently...

Three months ago I started running out of pills before it was time for my refill (I have to get a refill in person every 30 days because it's a controlled substance).

The first time it happened, in April, I was a few short and I assumed that I had messed up my appointment dates and accidentally made them five weeks apart instead of four.  The second time it happened, in May, I asked my wife if she had taken any.  She suggested that maybe the pharmacy miscounted which had happened to her before.  I asked my doctor and he said he hadn't changed anything about my prescription and also suggested that maybe the pharmacy miscounted.

**Current Mystery**

When I got my latest refill on May 26th I counted and made sure that there really were 30 pills.  On June 7 I realized that I only had six pills left.   24 pills gone n ten days and because I only take it on weekdays that meant that there were actually fifteen pills missing.

I asked my wife again if she knew what happened to them and she said she did not.  We talked about it for a few minutes and realized that only two other people had been in our apartment since I got my refill \- my wife's best friend of 7\+ years and her best friend's boyfriend.

My wife raised it with her best friend that night.  The best friend and the boyfriend both said they had no idea what happened.

**How I Feel**

So now I am in a really tough spot.  In my mind the only possibility is that one of these three people stole pills from me and is lying about it. 

At first my wife agreed that it had to be the best friend or the boyfriend but now she is in denial.  She's saying that it had to be something else that we're not thinking of and a couple times has gotten mad that I would even accuse her or our friends.

I freely admit that there could be other explanations for a few going missing \- maybe I took two by accident one day.  But fifteen is a completely different story.   On the one had I don't feel like it's fair to force my wife to ""pick sides"" but at the same time I have no other even remotely reasonable explanation. 

**Advice?**

At this point I just feel very alone with no good path forward.  My wife has written it off as it must be something else and moved on (one of her ideas was that maybe she sleepwalked and flushed some down the toilet even though she doesn't sleepwalk).  I've told her how I feel and mostly have been dismissed as it not being fair to blame the friends.  With no evidence I'm asking my wife to write off a seven year friendship but this is really serious to me.  We used to have these people over all the time but I don't want them in my home anymore. 

I have no real idea what to do.  In hindsight I wish I hadn't said anything and just paid more attention to when the pills were disappearing but it's too late now.  It's unlikely I'll ever get evidence.  So I either need to forget this happened (which is tough because every time I think of these people now I get upset) or make some serious life decisions based on no evidence.

I can provide more background if requested (for example my relationship with the friends or details about when they were over) but didn't want this post to get too long.

**tl;dr** My Adderall started disappearing and only my wife and two friends have had access.   Everyone denies it and I'm feeling very isolated."
"Friend (29F) contacted me (28F) with a crisis - I was in the process of cutting her out.. is it right to respond or not?


We've been friends for nearly 15 years. We have very different personalities. She is high-strung, impulsive, temperamental (but funny and sweet most times). I am very calm and a good listener. Since the beginning of our friendship I was always her therapist for when bad things happened, and she was my comedian to cheer me up. The problem was, it started becoming more and more lopsided. 

I mean, this is over a period of 15 years so it was a gradual progression but basically she started to not be very nice to me, sometimes exploding at me during small disagreements, criticizing me for my choices or opinions, and just being generally very judgmental and confrontational about everything in life (she got REALLY into feminism, #metoo, etc). Every single time, I would give in to her and try to reason with her, get her to calm down, and then I would forgive and forget. I was a fucking doormat. 
And it became more and more. To the point that I was afraid to disagree with her or ask for help or advice because I didn't know what her reaction would be. 

But inevitably, something horrible would happen to her and she would call me CRYING and hysterical and I'd be there for her. She doesn't have a lot of close friends (no surprise there) and when shit blows up, I am her rock.

Well, this year, I had a few major things going on. She was dismissive and absent for most of these issues. Then a huge thing blew up for me. I texted her PLEASE can we talk soon, XYZ is happening and I really need to talk- literally begged her. She replied something like she's busy. I said, I just need like 10 minutes of your time. She replied ""Maybe the weekend?""

After that incident, I just lost any feeling for her at all. Just completely. This wasn't just some minor thing. It was a BIG issue that happened. She didn't give a fuck. I decided that I didn't owe her an explanation. I decided then to just fucking cut her out. Screw 15 years. Screw everything. And she didn't contact me again after that.

Until today. She texted me like 20 times to tell me she is pregnant and freaking the fuck out. It was not intentional. She is not married, had no plans of being pregnant, etc, etc. I know that already. I know from her language that she is again hysterical, probably crying, etc. 

I really don't care. Usually, I would give in because I have a soft spot and I feel bad for her, knowing she doesn't have any close friends, but this time, I seriously don't care. I mean, I care on a human level- but as friends, I don't. 

My questions are - 1) is it right for me to just go no-contact with her like the way I am and ignore everything? 2) Or should I respond to say something like ""I know you're having a hard time, but I can't help you."" 3) If I respond to her, should I include why I don't want to help? (ie. ""When I needed you, you weren't there for me."") 4) Or, as friends for over 15 years, is it my obligation to help her through this time, whatever she decides to do?

Reddit, I believe I am an extremely patient and compassionate person, and she is not inherently an evil person. She just has a lot of issues, she has no close friends, she also has no family - but I cannot continue to have her suck the life out of me. Or is that just simply too cold? I know that if I don't respond to this issue - our friendship is effectively over and she will never forgive me. Do I owe her an explanation? I mean, she didn't even try to contact me until this shit blew up.. do I need to be the one, once again, to be a responsible adult?

TLDR: I have cut ties with a close friend I've had for over 15 years due to her explosive temper and disrespect towards me. I felt good about that. Then she contacts me out of the blue hysterical because of an unplanned pregnancy. She has no friends, no family, and I have always been there for her. Is it right for me to respond? Just ignore her? If I do respond, what should I say?"
"I [20F] apparently moaned someone else's name in my sleep so my boyfriend [22M] searched through my entire phone


Hi Reddit,

Kind of in shock and looking for some advice, as I am not really looking to bring this up to anyone I know.

A few nights ago I woke up around 4 am and noticed my boyfriend wasn't in bed with me. This is unusual, so I got up to look for him and found him sitting on our balcony and he couldn't even speak to me he was so upset. I sit with him in silence until I can get him to go back to bed, but on the inside I was freaking out because I had no idea what was going on. He has a history of mental illness so I was afraid he was having an episode. 

The next morning he is super cold to me and will barely speak to me. I decide to give him space and he says we will talk after work and he has time to think.

After work, I get home and he is being warmer to me and sits me down and proceeds to tell me that I apparently had a wet dream in my sleep and was moaning someone else's name and saying vulgar things (the person is someone we know). I have absolutely no recollection of this at all, so I am just sitting silently listening to him talk. I felt so confused because I have not once since being with him even thought of being with anyone else. He said that he freaked out and was yelling trying to wake me up and I wouldn't. From here, he decided to take my phone and go to the balcony and searched through the entire thing. Obviously there was nothing related to cheating or bad on my phone, but he did find certain things that he didn't like. He told me he wouldn't hold any of it against me and that he just wanted to be open about the fact that he did it, and said he forgave me.

I was and still am in shock that (A) I allegedly did that, (B) he looked through my phone, and (C) that he is the one forgiving me. After the conversation, I could barely speak because I just wasn't sure how I was feeling or what to say, and I still am not. He is being extra loving and affectionate, and keeps telling me that he trusts me. The problem is, do I trust him? Should I trust him? Who is in the wrong?

TL;DR I moaned someone else's name in my sleep and my boyfriend searched through my entire phone. What is your take on the situation?"
"My (19f) boyfriend (20m) of 1 year was prescribed opiates after knee surgery. Now out of the blue all my moms prescriptions are missing. I'm disgusted but he's supposed to live with us for the summer. What do I do?


Some backstory, my boyfriend and I are home from college. He was on the wrestling team but had a probable career ending knee injury this past season. The doctors gave him a choice of waiting and since he knew a great surgeon in our town he waited until the summer. The main issue was his family was going to be gone this summer so my parents agreed to let him live with us so we could help him get around.

Surgery was 3 weeks ago and he's doing ok but still can't drive so I've been taking care of him. He was prescribed opiates (I'm sorry I don't know which ones) for the pain but they kept dissapearing faster than he was supposed taking them. He swore up and down that he wasn't taking extra and that most days he was trying not to take them at all. So I started keeping his medications in my bathroom that would be really hard to get to and if he needed one, he could ask me for it. They still kept dissapearing. We had to go the doctor and ask for more. The doctor was very reluctant but he agreed.

My mom is on some sort of opiate pain killer for her back that she takes once a day and now not only have my BFs pills disappearing but hers are too. She confronted me about and demanded that I take him back to the doctor to get his pills refilled so he'd stop taking hers. I said I couldn't do that because of the doctors reluctance. My mom is extremely pissed and agitated at me and I feel stuck.

I know my boyfriends in a lot of pain and he swears to me that on most days he's only taking ibuprofen because he wants to try to wrestle again and he can't so that if he's on opiates. But the fact is the pills keep disappearing. I'm so disgusted that he would steal from my mom and lie about it but he can't leave because he's stuck and immobile.

What do I do in this situation?


**tl;dr: my Boyfriend is living with us post knee surgery, he's sneaking all his opiates pain killers and is now stealing my moms as well. He denies even taking his let alone stealing my moms but that's ridiculous. He can't leave because he's immobile but I don't know what to do in this situation.**"
"[UPDATE] Me [22F] with [20M] of 1 year, I am at my wits end of his relationship with this certain video game.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zobzt/me_22f_with_20m_of_1_year_i_am_at_my_wits_end_of/)

As many commentators guessed in my previous post, yes the game was League of Legends. This chapter in my life has come to an end therefore I wanted to post an update of what went down since then but also to thank everyone last time for the advice but also as a reminder to myself of how stupid I was. 


I quit playing the game altogether shortly after and each time he played I excused myself. He soon stopped playing as well and we later pursued other multiplayer games together. Although we talked about the issue, it was never fully resolved as he did not believe the game affected him that way and every time I brought it up he brushed it away or feigned ignorance that he does not remember acting that way. Throughout March, Apr and May, we hardly talked or mentioned the game. Each time it was brought up he stated the game was good and fun but the community was toxic (Ha ha ha). By the end of May, we’ve run our course of multiple video games and my friends are asking me to come back to League. I started playing casually again once a week or so with just my friends.


Last week his interest in the game peaked and we talked about the game several times. He mentions he wants to try it again but he knows I won’t talk to him while he plays. In my moment of weakness and remembering the fun days we had when we first met each other on this game, I decided to give him another chance suggesting to play together again. After playing and losing a bunch, things began to turn sour and his negativity seeped through. When I apologised to a friend about the bad game he accused me that I was talking shit behind his back, he called me a liar, and he said he couldn’t stand me anymore or any of this. He threatened to cancel our upcoming trip happening in a few weeks. Once again, I felt as if walking on eggshells again with a paranoid distressed feeling on the verge of a breakdown.  Eventually things did calm down after I apologised however last night I finally gave up. He abruptly left whilst we were in a bad game with another friend, and although I knew he was more than upset, I wanted to forfeit this game quickly, let him calm down, talk to him after and move on. He did not take this well, he told me he was unbooking as I don’t care about him etc. All I replied was “sorry to hear that”. He then said I have one minute before he unbooks, I explain my actions and tell him that he can unbook. He is really angry at this point, tells me he will not deal with this and that I am using him for sex (what?!) and good luck. He calls and says he has deleted everything then hangs up. At this point I am somewhat relieved, it is over isn’t it? Nope, he messages me saying how could I turn from caring, sweet and nice to someone he despises because I don’t care or give a fuck. Proceeds to give me advice on future dating to show that I care and asks if I understand. I don’t reply and he proceeds to write “doesn’t even have the decency to answer”. What a rollercoaster of a ride. I’ll be losing 150 euros due to the unbooking but that’s the price to pay for being stupid.


&gt; It’s not because I don’t care but we’ve done this too many times that it is becoming silly to care. I felt I was always the one doing the apologising and making amends, scrambling behind you to pick up the pieces. I even began to doubt myself, question my version of events and make excuses for your actions. When you started threatening me each time, I felt powerless, paranoid and scared. So this time I will stop fighting for this so called relationship and let you have your way. If only you knew how much love I have for you and how much you truly mean to me but no, you refuse to listen or believe because you see me agreeing as the fact that I do not care. 

These are the things I want to tell him but I cannot and will not open that connection because I love him stupidly still. Breaking up isn’t easy because for nearly 1 year and half, we were inseparable and shared every single day of our life together. However with this throbbing pain in my chest and heartache, I am now ready to close this chapter. I still genuinely hope the best for him.


Tl;dr: He never changed, lashed out at me, I had enough and we broke up.

"My friends (30s/M&amp;F) keep convincing me (32/F) that my girlfriend (33/F) changing me has been abuse


A year and a half ago, I experienced the hardest break up of my life. We were dating for 6 years, and engaged for 3. It sounds corny, but she was my everything back then. We had plans for the rest of our lives together, but we both started making excuses and putting our wedding off, and eventually, she couldn’t take it anymore and decided to leave. It destroyed me. I’ve never done all that over the top self-care, but I just really gave up. I started drinking a lot. I wasn’t showering, I wasn’t brushing my teeth. My hair got to it’s longest length because I stopped cutting it. I lost my job. I hit rock bottom to the worst extent.

A few months later, a mutual friend set Ellie and I up on a blind date. I tried to clean myself up, but it was obvious the kind of person I’d become. And despite that, she still took me. Ever since, she’s taught me to love myself and care for myself, and be the best person I am. And I just try so hard to love her and care for her in return, even though it’ll never be enough. I seriously love Ellie. She’s so smart and funny, and she’s incredibly good at couponing, and whenever she sees cows in a field she makes the cutest face, and she’s always better at games than I am so whenever I can’t beat a level, she beats it for me. Seriously, I love her. And I’m so grateful that she took a chance on me despite the fact that I was jobless, alcoholic deadbeat. She made me a human again, it’s all Ellie.

My problem isn’t with Ellie, I love her a lot. My problem is with my friends. I’ve got a friend group of four (3 guys and a girl) that I’ve known since grade school, and we’re all super close. They helped me get through my break up, and I like spending time with them. But it feels really hurtful the way that they talk about my relationship. They tell me that Ellie changed me too much, and when I try to bring her along on outings where they’re bringing they’re SOs, they tell me she can’t come because she “ruins the mood.” Ellie has a much different vibe than my friends, she’s more mellow and quiet, but I think she contributes in her own way. I don’t drink anymore, and they say I’m less fun because of it and it’s all Ellie’s fault.

Recently, my mom decided to back her support of Ellie by giving me my great-grandmother’s ring to propose with when the time comes, something she refused to do with my ex. I was so excited and I told my friends about it, and they literally got me to go out with them so they could stage an intervention. They told me that they wanted what’s best for me, and they think Ellie has changed me for the worse, and that I’m not even recognizable as their friend. They told me that they think it’s manipulative and abusive behavior, but I don’t think so? They seemed genuine, and I know I have changed, but I always thought it was for the better. But, my friends said that Ellie was grooming me and didn’t have any interest in me.

I guess I’m just at a crossroads? Is this truly bad behavior? Should I cut off my friends? How can I reach out to them to make them more accepting?

tl;dr: My girlfriend changed me for the better, but my friends are convinced it’s abuse. "

This didnt get much previous traction but it's a pretty big milestone for me anyway so thought I would update. 

It's been three months since our first date and we're pretty much in a relationship now. After being pretty nauseous and on the verge of anxiety attacks for the first two months, everything has started to ease a little. I am experiencing quite strong feelings towards him and while there are quite a few more steps to take, I'm fairly happy atm. I've met his family and he's met mine. He has been very sweet and patient and said a few times how much he likes me and can see a future which is scary but also kind of amazing, since I never thought any of this could actually ever happen to me. Its a weird feeling but I'm just gonna try and go with the flow. Thanks to those people who did give me advice. I hope my story maybe helps some of you in the same position struggling with depression and anxiety.

TL;DR experiencing a first real relationship after struggling with anxiety and depression and going through many many periods of doubt. Finally let myself just give it a go and its actually workng out"
"My friend (25F) invited me (26F) to just the ceremony of her destination wedding and I found out the day of.


I went to high school with a girl who got married recently. I knew her pretty well and we were part of a fairly tight-knit group of 10 or so people. I was invited to her destination wedding about a year ago. My whole family was also invited because my parents are friends with her parents.

The event took place a 2 hour plane flight away from me and a nine hour drive from my parents.

We received one invitation stating that the event would start at 10 AM. When we got there, the wedding was over 300 people and very glamorous. The groom arrived in a Ferrari. I knew it would be a big event because they had spent a year planning it and had an event planner and many trips to the destination to make sure everything was just right. 

At the ceremony, there were 3 hours of rituals and then a simple buffet luncheon (no meat and no alcohol). At the buffet, I sat with some high school friends who were all discussing the official reception at 6:30. This was a black tie affair with a cocktail hour and then dinner and dancing. 

I had not heard anything about the reception from my parents, but I assumed my parents knew more about the day's schedule than I did, since the invitation went to their house, so I said of course I was going.

After lunch, I talked to my parents who said they had not received an invitation to the reception. They also observed that when they went to congratulate the mother of the bride, the MOTB said ""see you at 6:30"" to the woman in line before my mom, and ""I hope everything was good"" to my mom.

They said all of their friends that they sat with had received one, except for one other family. Based on our sample size, I'd estimate over 90% of people were invited to both. 

My friends / other guests insisted there was some kind of mistake, and that it wouldn't make sense not to invite someone to the reception. They showed me pictures of what they received (evidently the invitation to the reception came in the same envelope but a different slip). They discussed whether the bride texted me about the RSVP (she reminded all of us that the deadline was approaching, but she asked some people whether they were coming to ""both the wedding and the reception"" and she did not ask me that. The RSVP was just an email address and I just said ""5 of us are coming.""

Eventually as 6:30 grew close, one friend offered to check whether there was a seating chart to prove to me that either there was no seating chart, or that there was one and we were on it, to prove that we should go. 

Unfortunately, there was an explicit seating chart and none of my family was on it. My friends looked visibly uncomfortable and kept apologizing. So I went back to my hotel and sat with my parents. My mom was crying in our hotel lobby and was extremely hurt. We had all traveled to be there, had taken off work, spent 2 nights in 2 hotel rooms, and gotten her multiple gifts off her registry.

My question is: should I say something to the bride? If so, what? I still keep trying to think if there's a way it could have been a mistake. I just don't see how it could have been. My mother was so hurt and kept crying and crying. 

Tl;dr: My family was not invited to the reception of a destination wedding where 90% of the guests were invited to both. Should I say something to the bride?"
"Me [34 F] with my new life [2 yrs], not doing well, frightened


**TL;DR: Moved to a new city, no support system, in a bad place emotionally. I feel stupid for having to ask, but can anyone help me figure out where/how to get help?**

Hey, Reddit. I'm not doing okay. Two years ago I moved to a big new city for a big new job. Things have not gone well.

I'm bad at the new job. I've never been bad at a job before. Usually I'm the person getting singled out for bonuses and promotions-- but here, I suck.

I don't have a support system. I live alone and I don't really know anyone in this city beyond the guy I'm dating. Everyone at work is at each other's throats. My family lives in another time zone. The two primary friend groups from my old home/job have fallen apart.

I'm in the midst of an ED relapse. I've lost 60 lbs since last summer and as of January I'm making myself throw up again.

About two thirds of the time I can keep it together. I remind myself that the bad feeling always passes. I buy fresh flowers and go on long walks and cook. Objectively I believe just being alive and self aware is pretty incredible and deserving of awe. But there are more and more moments like this one right now where I am crying at my desk frozen by self loathing and I can't make myself engage or care about the things I need to do to function.

It feels like such a stupid question, but how do I even start to do better? Like, what is the actual next step? When I feel okay, getting help seems like an overreaction. When I feel bad, it seems like the least manageable process in the world."
"My (23M) girlfriend (22F) won’t follow some rules in my strict parents’ house. I have to remind her of them every single day, and she either ignores me or rolls her eyes and gets annoyed.


We’re staying at my mom’s for the summer. My mom is pretty uptight about cleaning counters, not leaving crumbs/stains on counters. It’s not really *that* strict. I agree that it’s a bit gross to have granola scattered over the counter or pesto smeared on the counter above the sink. My girlfriend has already stained the couch with a bit of chocolate and stained the rug with a bit of melted peanut butter (she sat on the couch with PB toast without a plate. When I told her the PB was dripping, she straight up didn’t respond until I raised my voice sternly, and didn’t believe me that it had spilled on the rug). I had to wipe it up and go get her a plate. When I show her this as proof that she needs to be cleaner, she acts like it’s not a huge deal (it may not be for her, but the parents wouldn’t like it if they saw it.)

And some of the cleanliness standards aren’t even just my mom’s. I get bothered for my own reasons. She ate some chips earlier and just threw them back in the cabinet without putting the clip back on. When I asked her to, she said she would later, and “they won’t get stale if I leave them for 5 minutes.” It’s not even about staleness really, I just feel plain disrespected. Sometimes I raise my voice at her which I know isn’t ok. But even when I try to bring it up calmly or softly, she gets visibly annoyed and sometimes raises her voice to say “shut up”, or tries to shut me up by saying “ok ok I’ll do it, it’s not a big deal.” It’s like it doesn’t stick in her mind that these aren’t simply *my* preferences, but the preferences of the people whose house we’re living in. 

Whenever my girlfriend and I stay at her house, a hotel, or a friend’s house, I couldn’t really care less what her cleanliness habits are. But I’m back at home for now and I am NOT in the mood to get chastised by the parental figures. I’m getting really exhausted of wiping the counters after my girlfriend eats and doing her dishes before anyone gets home, so I’ve asked her to help out. She does sometimes, but I have to ask her *every time*. I also have to ask her not to put open beverages next to my open laptop almost every single time she sits down with my laptop. It’s really wearing away at me, because I feel like she isn’t listening to me or respecting me. And I feel like she has no sympathy for my anxieties about ruining my computer or getting criticized by the parents, even though she has anxieties of her own, and I feel happy to accommodate that in any way. 

She’s started to ignore me or say “shut up” and roll her eyes when I ask her. I feel like a parent. When we’re in her house, her mom is *very* loud and strict with her cleaning, and I’ve never understood it til now. 

Today when she got frustrated with me, I said I’d stop asking her to do all this cleaning stuff if she would just *do it* before she even sits down to eat. I may have sounded a bit tough but I really don’t know what else to do. I’ve told her I’m tired of bearing the brunt with my parents for her messy habits. But it’s like she shuts off and doesn’t care or understand it. I feel resentful of her when I have to clean up after her. It feels like my only two options are to clean up after her and get annoyed, or to remind her to clean up after herself and have her get annoyed. 

Is there anything different I can say or do? Am I going about this the completely wrong way? Am I even seeing the situation clearly? Is there something I’m missing or what?

**TLDR** Girlfriend and I are staying with parents for summer out of necessity. Leaving not an option. I ask my girlfriend to wipe the counters, be mindful of spillage, and do her dishes almost daily, as these are both the rules of the house and partially my preferences. When she doesn’t do these things, I get asked sternly by my mother to do them. I’ve told my girlfriend that I’m tired of having my mom confront me over this, and she didn’t care/believe me (even though she knows how strict my mother is), probably because she felt I was nagging her. I’m tired of doing my girlfriend’s cleaning, and I’m tired of asking her to do it. She’s tired of being asked, but she won’t do it unless asked. When I try to talk to her about this I feel like the parent of an edgy preteen (and I’m sure I sound like an uptight parent to her). What is going on here? Anything I can do differently?"
"My (28f) mom (59f) is terminally ill. She got here through her own volition by refusing treatment. I'm so angry and frustrated and I don't want to be anymore, but I don't know how.


It kind of all began when my dad died suddenly from a cancer he didn't know he had. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and a week later he was gone. My mom fell into a really deep depression after that; she's never really recovered from him dying. I took over alot of the day to day responsibilities like making sure the bills were paid and taking care of the house because I promised him that I'd take care of her.

Losing him was so hard and, if I had to be honest, very traumatic. After he died, I started urging her to get regular health screenings to make sure that nothing was wrong with her. Each and every single time, she shot me down and refused. It got to the point where I'd beg her to go, and she would just lose it on me and tell me that I needed to see a psychiatrist to get help. I threw my hands up and was done with it.

Two years ago she began getting really sick again. It got so bad that we had to rush her to the ER, and it became pretty clear that she had colon cancer. I jumped into action right away; my sister and I made her appointments at the best hospital in the state with the best oncologists, and she still refused to undergo treatment. When she started getting sicker, she refused to go to the superior hospital-- she insisted we take her to what is arguably, a second rate hospital, because they were ""catholic"" so they ""understood her"". I told her that we needed to start treatment immediately because her doctors told her that she had every reason to hope for a cure, but she still insisted on getting second opinions, wanting to try holistic healing, the power of prayer, ANYTHING to avoid effective treatment. It was one of the most frustrating and hair pulling experiences of my entire life.

She's only getting worse. The cancer has now spread and she's approaching her final months. She's been saying for the past year how ""she just wants to die"", and she's ""had enough"" and ""needs to be with her husband"". This....infuriates me. I just don't understand. I'm so angry. Why the fuck didn't she want to stay alive for us? Why weren't we enough for her to want to live? She was always pretty quick to tell us when we weren't good enough while we were growing up, but everytime she says something like this it feels like a literal slap to the face.

I don't want to be mad at her during this time. I love my mom. I don't want anything more than for her to stay because I really am not ready to be without her. She could have lived and stayed with us and she deliberately decided she didn't want to, and it's just tearing me up inside.

I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: Mom is dying from cancer because she refused any and all treatment for the last two years and keeps saying how she wishes she were dead. I'm so angry and upset with her and I don't want to be."
"My girlfriend [22F] is furious with me [26M]. Help me understand her side of this.


I don't get this. We have been dating for almost 6 months and she has met my parents before so they sometimes ask some basic things about her. The other day they asked me what were her plans for the summer (because she's studying at uni she has a long summer break) and I told them she got a summer job at a hotel.

As I found out today this was apparently a secret. She confided in me and it was never meant to be spoken about to anyone else because it is something that is ""in the future"" and ""why would they need to know that"". I have no idea why something this normal would ever be considered a secret? Now she's really pissed off with me. Can someone help me understand her side of this?

TL,DR \- My girlfriend \[22F\] is furious with me \[26M\]. Help me understand her side of this."
"My [25/M] girlfriend [24/F] is demanding me to pay half of her bills.


As the title says, my girlfriend wants me to start paying half of her bills. 

Let me start off by saying my girlfriend is the most frugal person I have ever met. We've been dating for one year and I am reconsidering continuing this relationship. We do not live together, and I don't stay over at her place. She has roomates so I prefer to come to my place, I live alone. 

She is the type of person who will eat an entire meal, and then complain about it until it's taken off the bill. It's very embarrassing. She insists that we eat out twice a week, and I always have to pay. I don't mind paying or taking her out once in awhile, but all the time is getting expensive. She makes a fuss if she has to pay or if we split the bill. I once forgot my wallet, unintentionally, and she blew up. I swear it was like she had a temper tantrum x1000. She later apologized and said it was ""that time of the month,"" and took me out to dinner that next day. 

She will also use 80%-90% of a product, and then return it because it ""didn't work."" 

When I offer to buy us groceries, I tell her she can get what ever she would like, she always declines and days it's too expensive. I've started buying groceries anyway and precooking my meals so I don't have to eat out. She is very offended I'm doing this. I offer some of my food and she declined with the worst attitude. She began throwing away all of my meal prep. She said it had gone bad but I know it was not bad.. I just made it. She consistently says I'm intentionally starving her, that I want her to be anorexic. 

She recently started staying at my place because she and her roommates got into an argument. She's been here a month and is not paying any bills, nor has she offered. She is home practically all day, uses electricity, water, etc. My utilities have gone up majorly. I have a good salary, so I can afford it, but like any reasonable person, I like to save extra money. When I asked her to contribute at least the utilities, she freaked out. She said she shouldn't have to because I invited her to stay over. Yes, this is true, I did. But I invited her to stay until her roommates and resolve the situation, and they have. She was beyond upset about this. 

After that conversation is when she began demanding that I pay half of her bills. She told me that I had to pay half of her car payment and insurance. Her reason: because of the few times I drove the car, which she asked me to take her to x place. She demands that I pay half of her Amazon membership becuase she purchased an item as a gift for me. She demands that I pay half for her Netflix and Hulu. She logged me out of my accounts on my PS4 to use her accounts. She wants me pay half of her rent and utilities because of the times she's stayed at my apartment. She also wants me to start paying for her makeup, getting her hair done and waxing. Her reason? Because she does it to look good for me, and it gets expensive.

She event went out of way and made an invoice for me with her expenses. 

I am honestly so baffled. And I honestly don't know why I stayed with her when all of the red flags were there. 

What the fuck do I say to her? How do I address this? 

*TL;DR: Girlfriend of one year wants me to start paying half of her living expenses, including her rent, car payment, etc. Her reasons are because I drove her car a few times after I took her to x place. Various, unstable reasons.* "
"My mom [50F] wants me to add her name to my [18F] bank account


My parents have been super controlling for as long as I can remember. When I got a cell phone, I was to hand it to them every night because they don't trust me to have it in my room. No electronics were allowed in my room and everything was outside. Internet cuts out at 11, all that. I don't get allowance, and never have. I'm not even allowed to keep my own health card because my mom thinks I'll lose it. I'm going to university in a few months. I had a bank account opened by my mom for me before when I was younger, but it was sort of hard for me to access and deposit because there are no branches near me that I can easily get to, and my mom had access to everything and frequently would bring up my spending and chastise me telling me I was wasteful, when I had just used 5 dollars to get Wendy's.

When I turned 18, I rushed to open a bank account for myself. I have a job, and so I put all my savings in there. It felt great, it felt like I was in control of myself. It made me feel like an adult. I could spend my own money on things I saved up for, or just everyday small purchases without worrying about my mom confronting me and telling me I'm wasteful. I didn't tell my parents about this bank account naturally, but one day they were talking about it and I thought if I don't tell them now, it would be me lying so I just casually mentioned that I opened up my own bank account.

My mom froze for a bit, then immediately told me I should change it to a joint account and put her name on it too. She then suspended my old bank account since now I have a new one. I asked her for the remaining 200 dollars on my old bank account but she said she would give it to me, after I added her name to my new bank account so it would be a joint account. I wasn't comfortable with that, I didn't want her to look at all of my money and what I spend them on and have her blabbing at me, and I just liked having my own account. She said she only wanted a joint account with me so it would be easier for her to transfer me money, but I still don't like it. The thing is, from reading all of this you may think my parents are super poor or something. They're not, and I think we're actually fairly rich compared to the average person. 

Right now my job doesn't earn me enough for me to be sustaining myself, I still rely on my parents to pay for my school tuition and all that, so it's not like I""m ready to just up and leave. But I really want my own privacy with these things and they can't seem to understand that. What do I do? 

TL;DR Parents are super controlling. I recently opened up my own bank account, mother wants me to add her name to it and make it a joint account. I really don't want to. "
"My (34/F) husband (35/M) has been lying about finances for our whole marriage (5 years). Do I stick it out and hope it gets better?


I've posted in the past about my husband's small business. He has been struggling for years to properly manage it, and as a result, it has put a huge strain on our marriage. Despite asking him to take certain actions to mitigate some of the strain and going through couples counseling, it's only gotten worse.


Over the years there has been many instances of him lying about finances. He will miss payments on bills or rent and then I'll only find out once a late notice has been sent. This resulted in me taking over all financial obligations, but then he would tell me that I'm treating him like a child and demand that he be given some responsibility. Inevitably, he would fail to make payments again and the cycle would repeat. We are completely 50/50 in our finances, and I would come to find out that money I gave to him to pay for my share of the bills was never utilized for the appropriate reason; he was instead funneling it into his business to make up for lack of income.


Recently I found out he hadn't paid our child's school tuition bill for 4 months. This led to the school threatening to remove our child from the school. I had to empty my savings to pay off the balance and keep our child enrolled. I was devastated. 


The potential last straw came today. He received a collections notice on a credit card that he just hadn't been paying. His credit score is in the toilet. His excuse was that he just wasn't paying attention. I'm starting to think this is just an unmanageable situation and that I may need to leave him to do what's best for our child. 


TL;DR: husband is constantly lying about and hiding issues related to finances. I don't know if I can handle it anymore."
"I [20sF] recently had a baby and my distant, unstable aunt [50sF] won’t stop pestering me


I had a baby recently and one of my aunts, who I’ve seen one time in the last 15 years, won’t leave me alone about wanting to meet the baby. I don’t know her, she never made an effort when I was a kid/teenager to be involved in my life. 
She has Münchausen syndrome and is constantly trying to gain attention and sympathy for an ‘illness’ that she has that prevents her from leaving her house and working. No doctor has ever been able to confirm that anything is wrong with her, and she always creates a ton of drama around her being ‘sick.’  
A handful of years ago she popped up out of the blue and emails and calls me all the time. Every time I talk to her she says nasty things about my parents and even about me. She’s also asked my parents for money many times and even asked me if she could have my car when I was away at college. My dad even found her an easy job that she could do from home but she quit almost immediately. She made a huge drama out of not coming to my wedding because of her ‘sickness’ which added a lot of stress on me just days before I got married. 
I’ve tried to be politely distant but she just doesn’t get the hint. Now she wants to meet my baby and I’m really not comfortable with it. I want to tell her to leave me alone but I don’t want to create a huge family problem. I’m not sure how to approach this, any ideas? I’m afraid if I keep letting her into my life she’ll push more and more and eventually start asking my husband and I for money. 
TL;DR I had a baby and unstable aunt that I barely know won’t leave me alone. How do I handle this? "
"Wife [37f] and I [39m] have lost all of our children and our marriage is falling apart. How to stay united when dealing with grief?


We had 3 children, who were 18f, 18m, and 15m. About a few months ago, our daughter was lost in a car accident. Her loss had us all messed up, but especially her brothers. Her twin became isolated and would lay in bed for days without doing anything, didn't even come to the funeral because he couldn't go a minute without crying. Someone always stayed with them both, My wife or I. 

But one day I took the youngest to a therapist appointment while he and wife was still asleep. Apparently she thought I had taken both the boys so she left to run errands. When we came back home he was dead (I'm not going to get graphic with details or anything). This broke our youngest even more, who we admitted to a hospital because he was speaking of killing himself next. He was released eventually and we watched him like a hawk, and we'd all sleep in the same room so he wouldn't be out of our sight. But we failed. Last week, our youngest ended his life, leaving behind a note telling us the pain was too much and he can't handle his siblings being gone, how he doesn't want to grow up alone without them. 

We've blamed each other, ourselves, and have argued until we were blue in the face. There are times when we just sit on the floor and cry for as long as it comes out. Wife cannot function anymore, has quit work, and is prone to random emotional outbursts (throwing things, becoming violent). I'm not shaming or blaming her, to be clear. I feel her pain, and know exactly why she's acting like that. Our children were everything to us, our oldest was just starting her life, and her brothers were just behind her. Two of them committed suicide, and we couldn't stop them. It's pathetic, and our kids needed more. She won't go to any sort of counseling, and I honestly don't blame her. I don't know what we need right now, but as naive as it sounds I want us to still be together. To try to get through this somehow. We've lost our children, and the last thing we need is to lose each other. I don't exactly have a stable mind to figure out what I need to do, as a husband 


**tl;dr**: the death of our children has ruined my wife and I along with our mental states. Cooing is going horrible and counseling is unappealing in the moment. Not sure how to make this work and stay together. How I can be a good husband?"
"My best friend (29M) buys me (28F) a gift whenever he buys one for his GF.


This is kind of a weird one, sorry. 

I've known my bestie for a few years now, and he started seeing a super nice girl last year. I've noticed that whenever he buys her something big, like a cool painting, he buys me a gift around the same price point. 

We're big on gifts, always picking up little things for one another, but never anything that expensive. Last week he picked up a vintage comic for her, about $80, and then later that day got me a $100 ring. It's beautiful, and I love that he got me something so cool, but it's not our normal way of things. 

It's definitely a new behavior! And he's kind of sketchy with me about how serious he is with her, so now there's a little pit of anxiety in my stomach. I don't know what it means, if it means ANYTHING, or if I'm just over analyzing this. 

**TLDR** - My best friend started buying me expensive gifts whenever he buys one for his GF, and is purposefully unclear with me about their relationship. Does it mean anything, or am I just being anxious about this new thing?"
"Was I (23 F) wrong for asking my brother's bf to change shirts?


This is just a small thing that just happened a few minutes ago. My cousin graduated high school and we met at my brothers house to take all one car to the graduation dinner. He was not dressed when we got there and when he put clothes on his shirt was of a drag queen legs up and somewhat open (detox).  I just asked if he had a different shirt since it's a kids graduation and he went off and called me a bitch and said I must really not want him to go . He slammed the door and refused to leave so we are on our way without him. My brother says he makes big reactions like this when he's invited somewhere but doesn't want to go. My husband said I shouldn't have said anything and just let him wear it while my brother said the shirt his bf was wearing was too much and he should have changed... So reddit what do you think? I think his bf is trying to make me out to be homophobic though since he mentioned it while he was yelling at me -.- 

**Tl;dr My brothers bf wanted to wear a shirt with a drag queen with legs out and when I pointed out that we are going to my cousins graduation dinner and that maybe he should change into any other shirt (it could have been a pride shirt I wouldn't have cared really). He said I was a bitch and refused to go.**"
"Girlfriend [24F] gets crushes easily/frequently and needs to tell me about them. They're giving me [25M] extreme anxiety and I feel on edge all the time.


Our relationship is otherwise great. I love her with all my heart, but this one issue is slowly killing me. 

So my gf gets crushes extremely easily and frequently. Maybe 1 serious crush every couple months and they can last a while. She tries to do the right thing and tells me about them, but the frequency of these crushes are absolutely killing my self-esteem and mental stability. 

The last one was on her coworker, who she works closely with on projects. She told me she has a crush on him and wanted us to talk about it together. We did and then she would text me sometimes during the day when she was particularly ""crushing"" on him or whatever. Her motive was always good. She said she wanted to keep me in the loop so I know she doesn't want to actually do anything, but still, it hurts. 

It's gotten to the point where I get anxiety attacks whenever I see a missed call from her during the day (which is usually when she ""confesses"" to another crush). It's absolutely unsustainable and I feel like I'm losing my mind slowly. I've talked to her about this but she gets really upset. She thinks she's doing the right thing by telling me, but she doesn't seem to understand that it still hurts me. 

I also feel extremely on edge whenever I hear her mention anything to do with an old crush because I fear her developing a new one. She gets mad when I tell her this because she says she should be allowed to have friends and she doesn't want to feel controlled by my fears. I get her logic but I feel like I've been broken somehow and now I can't help my emotional responses. What can/should I do to make this go away?


Tl;Dr: Girlfriend gets crushes very easily and frequently and needs to tell me about them every time. It's given me extreme anxiety and feeling of dread every time I'm near her or see a missed call/unread message. What can I do to make this feeling go away?"
"I’m [29F] having second thoughts about marriage because of my fiancé’s [31M] over-involved and demanding mother.


On a throwaway because I didn't want this linked to my account.  Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any advice.

I've been with my fiancé for over three years and he is a very supportive partner. We have similar interests and I can truly say that he is my best friend. But, I’m posting here for advice, so obviously things aren’t perfect.

For some background, I moved to the city we currently live in just before we met and started dating. My parents have both passed away, but I still have a few family members and close friends in my hometown, which only a couple hours away. My fiancé is an only child and was born in this city. Both his parents (divorced), his stepfather, and cousins live here. He also has other family that visit frequently. While his entire family can be pretty needy and demanding, the biggest issue I’ve been having in our relationship is his mom. How she treats him, others, and of course, also me. His stepdad isn’t helping the situation either.

His mother and stepfather lived overseas until about nine months ago and even while they were away, she was pretty demanding. Called every day, sometimes multiple times a day. His mom usually visited for holidays and demanded that fiancé spend every single one with him and threw tantrums if he ever went against her plans while visiting. Okay fine, I got it. She lived far away. We never spent holidays with my family (or his father for that matter). I probably could have coped better if it was just that. I also thought this would let up once they moved back to our country. 

I started penting up emotions even while she was living abroad because of the stunts she would pull. There are so many examples I could give, but I’ll just list one that still irks me. About a year ago we planned an extended work/vacation trip that would last a month. We let her know well in advance because she started talking about coming home to visit during that time. She hadn’t purchased tickets and we had already booked everything, so we made sure she was aware we would be gone for that period of time. She didn’t have a job at that time so she could have adjusted her travel if she wanted to spend time with her son. Instead, she proceeded to buy tickets that arrived just after we left and then asked us to rebook our trip to fit her dates. I got upset with my fiancé, who defended her and tried to convince me to see her side. I put my foot down and then he came up with a compromise that she could just JOIN US for the trip in the ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT we had rented. I said absolutely not, but he never realized how weird it actually was until a mutual friend called him out on it. We ended up sticking to our original plan and she cried to family and friends that we were leaving during her visit, making us look like assholes until I corrected them and let them know she booked her trip knowing we would be gone. 

Again, that is just one of many instances, but this is already getting long. I’ll get to the most recent problems we’ve been having.

Fiancé proposed at the end of last year. His mom has been unbearable since then and things have been boiling up inside.  She has never, ever asked about my family, friends, or anything about me in general. She has never asked what we wanted to do for a wedding. She has, however, told us exactly what to do for holidays, engagement parties, and the wedding itself. I usually just don’t engage her and stay silent for my fiance’s sake and try to let him handle it, but she always steamrolls him. We tried to tell her multiple times that we wanted a private ceremony for the two of us and then a reception to follow, but she flips out. Every. Time. Saying things like it will ruin her life to not see her only son be married and she will always be sad, thinking about it every day until she dies. She then will continue to describe what we will be doing instead... and what she describes is exactly what she did for her own wedding to fiancé’s stepfather earlier this year. 

Fiancé finally decided to confront his mother and put his foot down about having a private ceremony. She began talking over him and trying to change our plans. Saying she needs to at least be there to see us get married. It’s important to note that she cannot be in the same room as fiancé’s father (because of her, not him), so she just wanted to exclude him from everything completely.  When this was pointed out, she tried to say it would be fine, but then fiancé’s stepfather started getting angry and yelling at us. Saying he would regret it if he kept his mother from seeing us be married. He then went on to yell that I couldn’t understand because my parents are dead. I burst out crying at that point and asked why it is always has to come up, because it is something that fiancé’s mother brings up constantly when going on her wedding rants, despite never asking me anything about myself. They tried to play it off by saying they only bring it up because they care about me. Yeah. Right.

Me crying seemed to diffuse the situation somehow. I wish I hadn’t but I just couldn’t keep it in at that point. His mother kept saying that she understood that she couldn’t be there because I “don’t have a mother” and “it all makes sense now.” I gave up explaining. There are so many reasons why we want a private ceremony, but she never asked anything about what we want and won’t listen when we try to tell her. I’m still surprised she hasn’t learned anything we want because fiancé has a habit of oversharing with her.

She has a trait of rewriting history and now acts like this blowup never happened, but keeps trying to control the reception we wanted to plan. At least she thankfully mostly only brings it up to fiancé. I’m over it. I don’t even want to have a reception anymore. I’m not excited.

Everything is giving me second thoughts and while my fiancé has slowly tried to put up boundaries, he still overshares with his mom and doesn’t always call her out on her bad behavior. I know it can be difficult because she denies and rewrites history, but I feel like I’m going crazy. I love him so much and he has helped me through the deaths of my father and other family members. He supported my studies and always encouraged me to do better, but I cant help but feel like his mom is too involved and won’t back off. I feel like maybe she will never go away and maybe it is a mistake to go forward with marriage at this point. His other family members can also be invasive and demanding at times, just not nearly to the extent of his mother.

I don’t want to lose him, but I also don’t want to live like this. Any advice you can offer very appreciated. 

**tl;dr!** I'm having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé due to his mother.  She has never taken an interest in me and constantly makes demands or ignores our wishes.  Things have only gotten worse since our engagement.  Don't want to lose my fiancé, but don't want to spend the rest of my life walking on eggshells."
"Me [26F] with my controlling and narcissistic grandmother. She wants to name my first child and I refuse to indulge her, but the name is what I'd already picked out for my daughter.


So basically, my grandmother (my father's mother) is incredibly controlling and narcissistic. She emotionally manipulated my mother and father into letting her name my two siblings. For my older sibling, my mom let her because she liked the name that my grandma picked out. But when my mother was in the hospital with my brother, she kept calling my parents, insisting on the name she'd picked out for my brother, even when my mother hated the name, and kept pushing and fighting until my father gave in, and then my mother eventually gave in and settled on a shortened version of the name she wanted (think ""Alex"" instead of ""Alexander""). My mother had gone through her third c\-section at this point and was in no state to argue with someone over this. 

For some reason, my grandmother thinks she has the naming rights to everyone. She's named 11/15 of my cousins on my dad's side using, I assume, similar tactics. So basically, I have a very low opinion of my grandmother, but because of our culture, her behavior is tolerated and my dad is still close to her, and my mother is over the name thing by this point and tolerates my grandmother. 

I'm the oldest of her grandchildren to have a child, and so she's already picked out a name that she wants for my child. Obviously, I couldn't give two shits about what she wants the name to be, and have clearly told my parents and her this, and my parents support me, even though my grandmother keeps pitching fits about it. Now the problem is the name that she'd picked out is the same name that I have wanted to give my first child (if it were a girl, as I know it will be) for years. 

I really like the name but I in no way want her behavior to be rewarded. She would definitely see this as me giving into her demands and after hearing about the lengths she went to manipulate so much of my extended family into giving her naming rights, I can't stomach giving in to her. I have other names picked out and I guess it'd be fine if I named my daughter something else, but I've been attached to this name since I was a teen. 

I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR Manipulative grandma wants to name my daughter, I don't want her to, it turns out she'd picked out the same name I picked out. "
"My [19F] best friend [19F] dropped a bomb on me right after I booked plane tickets to see her


So, she and I have been friends for 6 years and long distance for 3. We were neighbors, but I moved away to a neighboring state. This has been really hard on us because we're very close. So, I decided that I would fly down in the summer for a month to come see her. We've been talking about this for a long time so she's aware. I've made plans, saved up all of my money, I've been covering shifts left and right and working my ass off just so we can make the best out of the short time we have together before I have to go back and won't see her for another year. Today, she tells me that her boyfriend (also long distance) who I've never met or spoken to might be flying in at the same time I am to come stay with her. She tells me ""I want to spend as much time with you as possible but he'll be here too"". I was under the impression that this was going to be OUR time, time for us to catch up and make memories because it might be the only chance we have for a long time. Now, I know it's gonna be all about her bf and I will be left in the dust. It also takes me a long time to feel comfortable around new faces and she KNOWS that. I don't want to spend my time there feeling awkward and left out. I'm angry and upset that she dropped this on me out of nowhere but I don't know if I have the right to be. We also have never fought and I fear confronting her with this will disrupt the peace. She's never really done something like this to me before. What do I do? 

tl;dr Booked flight to see long distance best friend, she just told me her BF might be coming at the same time. I know I'll be left out and I didn't want to spend the only time we have together like this "
"Husband [M27] and I [F26] married for 2 years, he's in constant pursuit of his dream job. I support him and want him happy but also feel like he needs a stable job to support our growing family. He's frustrated, thinks I don't care if he's miserable.


My husband has always had big dreams of making it rich off his own business, never having a boss, and living off ""residual income."" Before we got married, he was heavily involved in a variety of MLM schemes with the dream of making it big. Since we've gotten married, I had him stop his involvement in all MLM schemes, but I also supported him in starting his own business (a podcast that loses ~$250 each month). I'm fine putting a few hundred dollars into the podcast each month because I know he enjoys it and has dreams of it making money some day.

My husband currently has a job with GREAT pay for not having a college degree ($75k/year) and OK benefits, but he hates it - it's in an industry that he never wanted a career in (although he's been successful in the industry and working in it for the last 7 years). He is constantly coming up with new business ideas (some of the more recent ideas include getting a loan for $200k and ranching sheep; starting an Amazon business and buying stuff cheap from China to re-sell; starting an at-home daddy daycare; going to school and become a lawyer; etc.). As you can see from the examples, his business/career ideas are ALL OVER THE PLACE.

My husband's dream is making his own money in the outdoor industry. When brainstorming jobs, he has a few main priorities (not in any particular order): 

1) Being able to go on hunts whenever he wants.

2) Never missing a visitation with his son. He doesn't have primary custody, so he gets his son every other weekend during the school year, all summer, and then for various holidays throughout the year. He wants a job that allows him to spend essentially every day all summer with his son. We've had to get a babysitter for a total of 14 hours this summer and he hated it, said it made him feel like a terrible dad.

3) Not having a boss.

4) Residual income.

My priorities are a little different. I want him to be happy, but I also think there are certain times you need to suck it up and consider your RESPONSIBILITIES above your dreams. I want him to have steady work with a consistent paycheck. We are in a bunch of debt and slowly trying to pay it off. I want him to have good benefits. I am pregnant with our first child together and it's important that we have things like life insurance and health insurance set up for our family (I get this through my job, but I still feel more comfortable having it available through both of us just in case something were to happen to my job). 

My concerns are that every single job idea he brings up is entirely random. I am all for investing in his future to help him find a career that he wants and enjoys, but when he throws out such random ideas, it makes me feel like it would be stupid to invest in it because he's likely to get bored of it or not like it anymore after only a few months. I'm also not willing to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in a loan to start a business (like ranching sheep), when he can't even bring in income for his current business. I'd feel much better letting him start additional businesses if he could show that he is successful with the first one.

He feels like I'm not supportive of him being happy, and that I'm content to just let him ""be miserable"" in his work. I absolutely LOVE my job (I went to undergraduate and graduate school for this field, studied hard, and worked to get hired in my dream position). He thinks that because I'm happy, I either don't understand what it's like to be miserable in a job, or I just don't care.

I don't know how to address this issue with him. The other day he mentioned going to school to be a lawyer. I told him that in that career, he wouldn't be able to do all the hunts he wanted and would likely miss a lot of visitation time with his son (not like he could just tell his clients ""sorry, I actually can't make it to the deposition, I haven't filled my deer tag yet!""). He sees my response as immediately shutting down his hopes and dreams and wanting him to be miserable. I'm just trying to help him find a job that not only lets him do everything he wants to do and be happy, but also gives me the peace of mind that we will have consistent income to support our family.

How do I address the issue of helping him find a job he likes that fills both his and my priorities, and not making him think I want him to continue being miserable?

TLDR: Husband wants dream job. His dream job is literally a job you might only find in your dreams - very few people have jobs like this. I want him to have steady work to help support our growing family and pay off debt. He thinks I want him to be miserable."
"My [ 25M] girlfriend [25F] is expecting a proposal during our vacation that we are taking together next week I was not planning on proposing then. What should I do?


My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years and we’ve discussed marriage a lot. The past 3 years we’ve gone on vacation together to different places and we are planning on going to Italy next week for a week.  

Now this is the problem. I found out from one of my friends that she is 100% expecting a proposal during the vacation. Long story but I asked one of her friends who apparently can’t keep a secret for advice on rings and the friend told her. In addition, we have talked about marriage a lot recently so I guess in her head it makes perfect sense that I’m going to propose on our vacation. 

The thing is I wasn’t planning to propose then but on my birthday in August since both our families will be around. My family lives really far away and they are planning on throwing a party of celebrate my 26th birthday and me graduating law school. I thought that would be a great time to propose.  

What is the best thing I should do? Should I just tell her that a proposal is not coming? I just really don’t want to ruin the vacation for us with her disappointment.  Should I forget about my old proposal plan and propose during our vacation? I'm not really sure what to do. I kind of wanted it to be a surprise when I was going to propose but I also don't want to hurt her. 

**tl:dr my girlfriend is expecting a proposal during our vacation but I am not planning on proposing until August. What should I do? **"
"I (26/F) was dating a man (32/M) who I’ve just found out, is married and expecting a child with his wife (32/F) of five years.


First, I had no idea he was married. Genuinely not one clue. I’ve been cheated on before. I know how it feels. I would never do that to another person by choice. 

He and I met whilst I was away on business in London a couple of months ago. I had some free time the last couple of days, swiped through Tinder not expecting to actually meet anyone. He and I matched. He sent me a message. We exchanged numbers, met for drinks later that day, and texted for the duration of my stay. We didn’t have sex, but we did kiss. 

I don’t use social media that often, so I didn’t actually add him on anything, or search for him at all, but now I wish I had as I potentially could have found out that he was married sooner. 

Anyway, I went home to Vancouver after the trip. He and I kept in touch. Three weeks later he said that he had business in Seattle in a few days and he asked if I’d like to see him. I agreed to meet him for dinner in Seattle. It’s only a short drive and I have a couple of friends in Seattle anyway, in case anything happened. We met, had a really good time at dinner, and ended up having sex in his hotel room that night. 

It was the weekend, so I stayed with him in Seattle the rest of the day, during which time he told me he really liked me and that he couldn’t stop thinking about me since London. There was something about the way he said it that felt off to me. Yeah, we were having a good time together, but he came off almost ... nervous to go back home. At the time I assumed he just wanted a change of pace in terms of work, not that he was *married* and expecting a child with his wife of five years. 

In any case he was getting a little too attached. Once I was back in Vancouver, he kept texting me and asking when we could see each other again. On the one hand I was touched but on the other I was getting more and more suspicious of him. 

That said, I did like him. I felt that whatever worries I had were all in my head. Nothing serious. 

It came to a head when he stopped by Seattle again earlier this week. I set aside the mixed feelings and went to dinner with him again, had a really good time again, and (I wish I hadn’t, but) had sex with him again. About an hour later, his phone kept ringing. He ignored it at first, but after the tenth time in the space of five or ten minutes, he got up and thought he’d declined the call, only for the sound of a woman’s voice to come through as soon as he had set his phone back down. 

She sounded really frustrated and said something like, “How is your phone always on silent?” 

His face drained of colour and he quickly took the call in the bathroom. I put my clothes back on and got out of there. At the time I figured he was seeing someone else. Not a big deal as he wasn’t my boyfriend and we had only hung out a few times, but something had felt off about the situation anyway, so I decided to leave. On my way through the door, he cut in front of me and tried to get me to stay. 

By then he’d ended the call, thought that I’d pieced it together, which I hadn’t, and quickly explained that he and his wife were having problems, she’d tricked him into having a child by going off of birth control without telling him, wanted his money, didn’t love him, etc. 

I had no idea what to say. I was in shock. Finally it all fell into place. He was married. 

He said a bunch of shit once. He said he was sorry for dragging me into his problems and that he wanted to tell me what was going on at first, but he didn’t expect to that he would “fall so hard” for me. I told him to get out of my way so I could go home. 

He reluctantly stepped aside. I got out of there. Now a few days later I’ve blocked his number, tracked down his wife on IG with the help of an old friend who works for the same company as this guy in London, and ... I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve made some pretty horrible decisions with regards to this guy, and everything that’s happened. I should have searched him up right away but I trusted that he was just a normal guy who was genuinely interested in me. I feel really stupid, but I don’t want that to be the driving force behind whether I contact his wife. Going by her posts on IG, she has no idea that he cheated. She’s updating regularly, posing for photos with him, replying to comments that her friends and family are leaving, saying how excited she is to start their family. 

Honestly I feel gross for my involvement. Again, I’ve been cheated on in the past. I’m still working through it in many ways. I can’t imagine how much harder it is to be cheated on by someone you married and whose child is growing inside you. It’s not just about feelings at that point. It’s a broken family. 

Part of me wants to message her right away to let her know what’s going on, but another part of me wants to just forget this ever happened. I want nothing to do with him. But I have all the screenshots to prove that he said he was single and that I had no idea he was married. 

My roommate is telling me to just walk away from the situation. His wife will find out eventually. But one of my other friends is telling me to follow my instincts and send a message to the wife. Let her know what her husband has been doing.

Obviously I’m leaning more towards telling her but I don’t know what to say. It would be easier if I knew her personally, because then I’d know how to bring something like this up to her, but I’ve never spoken a word to her before. I had no idea she existed until a few days ago. 

How do l go about this? 

**tl;dr** I had no idea he was married and expecting a child. Should I tell his wife that he was cheating on her or should I let her find out on her own? I’ve never met this woman. She has no idea that I exist.

"My [26F] boyfriend [28M] is upset that I don’t think he should have partial ownership over the house that I am purchasing on my own (which we will live in together soon)


I’m on my phone so sorry for the wall of text! Long post: 

My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years, and have lived together for 1.5. When we moved in together I discovered that his problems with mental health (anxiety and depression) and alcohol addiction were significantly worse than I had ever imagined. He is currently a grad student and I have a professional job in healthcare with a steady income. 

The past 1.5 years have been really rough- about what you might imagine being the supportive partner of someone struggling with addiction and mental health can be. The past 6 months have been even more tough and I have tried to remain as open and honest as I can with him- at one particularly tough point I did express that I imagine my future differently than the current track is taking us (implying I might be done with our relationship if things don’t change). I don’t trust him and I know that he is still occasionally drinking to cope- but way less than he used to. He is actively seeking help, seen by a psychiatrist and doctor.

I don’t want to paint my partner with a completely negative brush but in regards to our past he has stollen money from me (probably less than 700 dollars in total) and does owe me money from times he couldn’t pay rent. We have discussed this at length and he tries to pay me back as able. He has probably $45,000 of debt between student loans, line of credit, and credit card debt. He has never allowed me to look at his finances with him and claims I’m being nosey/ doesn’t think it’s important that I know what he is dealing with.

I’m getting a cohabitation agreement drawn up by a lawyer to protect my assets as I’m paying a significant cash payment on the house and am probably going to inherit a good chunk of money from elderly grandparents soon (not to be morbid!). I’ve brought this up with him and h is very offended- thinks that by doing this I am saying we are going to break up/I only care about money.

I’m purchasing a fixer-upper that will require some Reno’s to bring it up to the standard that I would like. He keeps saying that he could and is willing to do a lot of the work himself, but in exchange wants a percentage of the house as legally his. I’m totally fine and think it’s only fair that labour costs would go to him if we split- but he wants ‘ownership’ in the house and thinks this is unfair. He doesn’t want to spend his free time renovation a house that ‘he could be kicked out of at any minute’ which I totally understand. I would never do that anyways- but the cohab agreement is meant to address the worse circumstances that could arise.

Anyone have any ideas of how to further explain this? Am I being unreasonable? Thanks!

TL;DR boyfriend wants ownership in house for helping renovate despite very rocky relationship from lack of trust and addiction. Unsure if this is reasonable or if keeping track of labour is enough. "
"Should I (25F) talk to my transgender girlfriend (28F) about her wig?


Hey Reddit, this is a throwaway because my girlfriend is not out as trans to most people in our life.

I've been dating my girlfriend for two years and lived together for one. She started transitioning years before we met and I didn't realize she was trans on our first couple of dates. One thing I did notice, however, was that she was wearing a wig. I didn't care about it at all at the time, and I knew it would be awkward if I pointed it out and asked questions, so I never mentioned anything about it to her.

Fast forward to now, it's almost impossible to pretend that I don't know about her wig because we've been living together for a whole year and I know where she keeps her hair products. She still thinks I don't know. Every once in a while, she would encourage me to hang out with friends. When I come home, I would notice that she has changed her wig while I was gone. I like hanging out with friends, but I feel bad that she needs to wait for an opportunity for me to be out of the house to do something about her hair. She also orders her hair from a website and she would be very nervous whenever the package arrive because she doesn't want me to suspect what's in the box.

I don't want her to feel like she has to hide this from me and live with stress of trying to keep it a secret. But I don't know how to tell her that I've known about this from the beginning. I think another reason she's trying to hide it from me is because all the male members of her family have hair loss problem, but not the females. She's probably uncomfortable with the association. Her younger brother and her dad both wear wigs but not her oldest brother. 

I feel like after being together for two years, we should be able to talk to each other about everything, and we mostly do. I'm so worried that I would hurt her feelings or make her uncomfortable that I feel like I should almost just play along with it forever. Yet we're thinking about getting married and the thought of her having to hide it for the rest of her life is just... I don't know. It shouldnt be this way. 

Tldr: girlfriend wears a wig and thinks I don't know about it. I don't want her to have to hide it from me and need advice on how to let her know that I know"
"My [28F] husband [28M] throws my sexuality in my face whenever I want to discuss our sex life.


We have been married two years and together around five years before that. He was a virgin when I met him, I have had two of partners before him. 

I know what I like in bed, I’m comfortable with my body and know how to get myself off. He was inexperienced and I knew that, and respected it. We have done a lot of experimenting and he’s found things he likes too. We are mostly compatible, but do have different kinks and needs. 

I don’t mind doing things he loves but he refuses to do the things I love. It’s taking a toll on me. We communicate okay for the most part but he can be a brat (see post history.) 

He hasn’t made me cum in a few months and it’s just getting overall boring for me only doing the things he likes, I LOVE to see him get into it and have a good time, but I want to have fun too. I finally spoke up and it turned into a terrible fight. 

I stay calm but he gets really upset and angry when I tell him I haven’t got off in a while, he says he can see/feel that I’m not reaching orgasm but “he doesn’t care in the moment” when he’s having fun. 

The worst part is I’m bi sexual and he blames me liking other women for not being able to cum with him. I’ve never had a problem with any partner, male or female, getting off. But he throws it in my face the because I like women I’m broken and it’s not his fault. It makes me feel dirty and unloved when he says these things, like I’m the problem although I’ve been more than accommodating. 

All of this I’ve expressed to him and I’m trying to convince him to see a therapist (I currently go on my own.) How can I make this situation better/communicate more effectively? I don’t accuse or make it negative when I approach it, I always say I have fun, etc, just that we need to try other things I like. I just can’t get through to him. 

**TL;DR** My husband doesn’t want to get me off and when I try to communicate I get shit down and called a lesbian for not being “normal.”"
