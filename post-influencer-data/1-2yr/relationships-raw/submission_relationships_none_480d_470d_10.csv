0,"A girl [15f] in my [17f] school was mocked because she wore a regular outfit to prom. She could not afford a dress. Is it wrong to talk to her and try to help her financially?


I'm not from the states/an english speaking country so sorry for any grammar errors.

A girl in my school wore a regular outfit to prom (jeans and a t-shirt) because she couldn't afford a dress (she said so). So many people mocked her, and a guy said ""there is no need to try and make yourself even more ugly, you're already hideous by nature"" (the best translation I can come up with). She left right after he said and I found her walking home, sobbing. I talked to her for as long as I could until she stopped crying and then I took her to meet my friends (who are older and already in college) and we all went out together.

I'm feeling really bad for her, though. She is a very bright and intelligent girl. I go to a private school, but where I live, I'm not sure the english name for it but you can go to school for free with a program if you are smart enough. She also skipped grades. She's very intelligent but her parents are very poor. Is it inappropriate to try to help her financially??? My parents could, and I talked to them, and they were very angry about what happened and told me they would help her with anything. But should I?

tl;dr: a girl in my school was mocked because she could not afford a prom dress. "
1,"I [F 27] realized that my husband [M 25] is a psychopath after he assaulted me and I want out.


Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8gsy0f/i_f_27_realized_that_my_husband_m_25_is_a/

First of all I want to thank all for your kind words. My post wasn't popular but I wanted to write an update to give hope and inspire other women in similar situations.

The very next day I got up early, when he was asleep. I took my phone and bag and went straight to the police. It was Sunday morning, two days after he beat me. I had some visible bruises and cuts on my face and hands, so I could back my testimony with physical proof and I also showed the texts he sent me about how he was in control the whole time and he beat me only with 20% of his strength and if he didn't I wouldn't get up again. Afterwards I went to the doctor to document all the bruises. I wanted to get back to the apartment to pack my things but we was there, so I wanted to go back to the police station to have them protect me but they have already sent a car to the apartment to question him. I went inside, we woke him up and he started babbling incoherently about how he didn't do anything and I hit him first. I packed most important stuff and downstairs I told the police that I want to go to a safe house. During the weekend there are no admissions to proper safe houses for women, so they sent me to an old school which served as a refugee camp. It was most uncomfortable as I was among men that were from the same country as my ex and they were sitting there idly observing me each time I went to and from the classroom I had to sleep in. Fortunately this situation didn't last very long, after 3 days they called the safe house and they admitted me. I had 20 EUR cash and -500 in my bank account at the time, not counting other debt he accumulated on my name. The safe house didn't charge me anything except for a small deposit to be paid when I get my next salary. 

In those first 3 days in the refugee camp I was a mess, crying constantly and reading articles about narcissistic abuse. I started getting out of a fog my mind was in during my relationship due to constant psychological, verbal and financial abuse (which started long before the physical abuse). In my lowest moments I reached out to my family and friends, most in my home country, and I told them the truth and they supported me through it all. I even wrote my colleague from work that I always liked and I had an impression that he cares about me and he insisted on coming to help me get my stuff from the refugee camp to the meeting point (accompanying someone straight to the safe house is forbidden). 

Since then I quit my job (this weekend is my last), paid off a portion of my debt, found a lawyer to file for a divorce and bought a ticket to my home country and I'm planning on writing me thesis there and sending it per post to the university. I've already discussed it with them and it's perfectly fine. I will take my time simply living with my parents during this time and when I'm finished I plan to move back to the country I've been living in, because ever since I got free I started enjoying simply being there again and I found myself being happy. 

When I was leaving the refugee camp I gave my two teddy bears I used to hug while crying in a fetal position during my abusive relationship to two little African girls that were there with me and that had no toys at all. Seeing them hug those teddy bears and carrying them around gave me such joy and happiness that I almost cried. It was a very cathartic moment. I felt that my soul and personality is saved and that I can be free and happy again. 

Living in the safe house I started taking care of myself again, in this short 3-week period I started walking a lot, already lost some weight, got a tan and started using makeup and nail polish again. All my friends at work complimented me on my changed appearance and newfound confidence. 

When I was in this abusive relationship for a long time I felt my life and love shouldn't look like that but I thought I had no alternative. I will never find anyone else again, I was a mess, used goods, ugly and getting fatter. When I left and took care of myself again I felt pretty and worthy of love and attention again. I started writing my colleague from work every day for hours and going out and before I realized I fell in love with him and he confessed that he had a crush on me from the start but now as we got to know each other better outside of work he fell for me completely. I'm still cautious and sensitive because of my experience and I'm usually letting him speak his opinions about important things first to make sure he really thinks that and is not just mirroring me and I came to the conclusion that we do have the same ideas about love, life, politics, religion and so on. He's also OK with me leaving for a couple of months and he's declared that he'll be waiting for me to get back and I can even stay at his apartment while looking for a job and a place to stay when I get back from my home country.

*TL;DR* I went to the police, started paying off debts and fell in love with a good man in 4 weeks since leaving my abusive ex. I'm happy, full of love and hope for a better future."
2,"I [30/F] have been estranged from my daughter [12/f] for 10 years. I just found out that her father [37/m] died.


When I was 17, I was in a relationship with an older \(25\) man and had a baby girl with him. At that time, I was extremely depressed and unstable in every aspect of my life. I resented him and the baby for my position and ended the relationship. I tried to be a mother for a brief time but I had neither a support system, a steady place to live nor any way to provide for my daughter. After a brief custody battle, I signed away my parental rights to my ex and his mother. I knew that at the time it was best for everyone, but that decision has always haunted me. I have since moved to a different state and started a new life \(not because of my daughter but because I was generally in a bad situation in my home state\).  Nobody here knows about my daughter with the exception of my partner, and it's not something that we talk about often because he knows that it hurts me.Last week, I decided to do some Facebook snooping for the first time in a very long time and came across memorials to my daughter's father on numerous peoples' timelines. He was sick with cancer for a year and died last month. He was married and had two other children. After a week of debating how to reach out, I decided to message his wife on Facebook \- to sincerely express my sympathies and leave my contact information in case she or his mother cared to call me. She called me back a few hours later and thanked me for reaching out. I told her how sorry I am for her loss and asked about my daughter. She told me that she's handling things as she can, and that she mentioned wanting to call me. She gave me my ex's mother's cell phone number and told me that she was expecting a call from me. I called his mother and we talked for a while...about my daughter, about my ex and his last days, about general other happenings. I told her that I'm a different person now, that I'm a normal adult who is emotionally stable and lives in a nice house in a nice city and has animals and healthy, fulfilling relationships with lots of people. We both agreed that the current custody arrangement should not change for the sake of  maintaining status quo but she said that my daughter has been asking to contact me, and that I should call her at home after school tonight if I'm comfortable with that.I'm absolutely floored that these people who have been through so much, and with whom I have such painful and resentful memories, have responded to me with such forgiveness and love. I was truly afraid that I would be further traumatizing them by making myself at all apparent. They both thanked me for calling. His wife told me that she was sorry for MY loss and said she knows I must be grieving too. That meant so much to me. His mother told me that she gave my  daughter a picture of me to put in her room and she keeps it there and asks questions about me. I have been so afraid of this first contact for so many years. I don't even know what to say to her besides I'm sorry. I want to be there for her emotionally and however else she needs me but I don't want to overstep her boundaries. I want to help her remember her dad in ways that she might be curious about. I don't know how much he told her about me or our relationship. The last time we spoke was on awful terms and I'll always wish that we could've both worked through our pain and anger to understand each other. Any suggestions on how to tie up these loose ends and make amends would be very much appreciated.

Tl:dr \- Left my baby daughter in the care of her father and mother when I was a teenager. We haven't had contact in 10 years. I just found out that he died and my daughter wants to speak to me. "
3,"My [30m] childhood best friend [30m] is an unsuccessful indie game developer who has lost touch with reality


So, lot to unpackage here. 

I've been friends with Tom since we were kids. We met back in the first grade and were damn near inseparable until high school. Our lives followed relatively similar trajectories. We went to close-ish colleges, majored in something similar. Went off to grad school around the time for the same. Back then, we were always very much on the same wavelength. We had similar interests (games, tv, etc) and got along super well. 

I guess the problem came about when my friend, who since childhood had dreams of becoming a game developer, published his first game on PC. He had worked on it for years, and I had admittedly not seen anything of it until release. Kept it very secretive. Well, upon release, it became apparent how bad the game was. Screenshots and items from the game became memes and it was widely mocked for a variety of reasons. To Tom's credit, he handled it mostly well - keeping his cool but taking criticism to heart. Though, he also was clearly defensive about a lot of it. 

Since then - he has not relented in his game development and has released many more games - and to be frank, they have all been atrocious. To the point where YouTubers and game reviewers have featured his games as an example of terrible game making. 

Over that time, he's pushed away anyone who's been critical of him, even those that have approached it in a caring manner. I've tried to be supportive, but he's truly gone off the deep end. He believes in conspiracies of game reviewers and trolls against him, and has became thoroughly unpleasant to be around. All he talks about is his game development. He quit his job a few years ago to focus on games full time, despite it not getting anywhere close to a living wage. He lives with his parents and believes that he's only a few steps away from being self supporting. 

We've been friends for a long time and I've tried to help him get his life on track (offering suggestions and advice to go back to school etc) but he's been totally resistant. I want to help and support him, but truly, he's barely the same person I once knew. I've been gentle with my suggestions, knowing he pushes away people who criticize him harshly, but I'm at a real loss here. Do I walk away? What's left to do?

**tl;dr My friend has lost touch with reality and has become a thoroughly unpleasant person due to his game development failures. **"
4,"UPDATE: I [17F] had an abusive childhood which led to suicidal tendencies. Asked the sub for advice 2yrs ago and here I am now.


link to old thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3udnbn/my_parents_38mf_used_to_abuse_me_as_a_child_now_i/

Hello, Reddit! This update is 2 years overdue but I felt that I owed you guys an update for the support you've given me. I only just found the password for this account because I saw the old hidden .txt file for it.

First, can I just say that I am sorry that I couldn't get back to you all? It was a very vulnerable period for me and it took *so much* to interact with people online or otherwise. Two years ago, I posted that thread in this sub. Aside from the comments, I also received PMs offering help and advice. They may not seem much but they're just what my past self needed to live another day, another week, another month. 

A lot more things happened after I posted. My family didn't instantly become better, my grades continued to slip, and one of my dogs died. It was a dark period which led to self-harm, multiple suicide attempts, and plans to run away then ""seal my fate"". Fortunately, these became a wake-up call for my family. At some point, I broke down while trying to prepare for school. I couldn't remember much what happened then but my parents told me that I was in hysterics. I was sobbing and murmuring for hours until I fell asleep out of exhaustion. I didn't go to school that day and the week that followed. 

It was also then when my parents decided to take my mental issues seriously and find the right professional for me. It took several doctors, different medications, and multiple visits but it all worked out in the end. Through this, my parents found out how much their actions affected my mental state [and our family]. As I said earlier, it really was a wake-up call and they've been better parents since. There hasn't been a case of domestic violence in our house for more than a year now. My parents also talked to my siblings about my ""condition"" and they have been very supportive. My father even attended seminars and such! There are occasional bumps on the road but things are comparably much better. I've also been open with my family about my sexuality and they showered me with love and support. (My father was overwhelmed at first but at least he didn't react violently. He's also continuously working on being accepting of others which means a lot already.)

As for my schooling, it really was impossible for me to graduate at the time with grades like that. My mother had to literally beg for some of my teachers and two higher-ups to let me graduate. She was in tears (she's always been the type to cry easily) when she came to them. She also told them the fact that I've been having *issues* - complete with proofs from the doctor himself. I did graduate in that school year (albeit undeservedly). Because of my poor grades though, my only option was a less than stellar university.

Personally, I consider myself to be a better person overall compared to who I was two years ago. Because of my experiences, I have become more empathetic and appreciative of life. I am also more at peace with things, if that makes sense. Though inevitably, I found out I have legit triggers, trust issues, and other issues about building/maintaning relationships. 

I can't say that everything has been peachy - *because it hasn't* - but it's safe to say that I've been in a much better state than before and I wouldn't have been alive now if not for this sub. I had a relapse late last year and everyone's support from this sub stuck with me. And while I didn't know the password again until now, I still visited that thread and reread what everyone told me.

Again, thank you all so much! This sub was part of what lead me to recovery :)

PS sorry for the long read!

tldr; had a shitty life, was suicidal, and asked sub for advice two years ago. am better now and just wanted to thank you all!"
5,"I [30f] don’t want to go on road trip now that friend [30f] announced that her son was coming with us


I [30f] have a friend group consisting of all women of my age. We all met in high school and have been close friends since.
We all live in different cities in the same state.


My friend Alice is going to have a baby in a few weeks. My friend Becky brought up the idea of road tripping together to Alice’s city to meet the baby at a time when Alice said it’d be convenient for her to do so (we wanted to make sure that we wouldn’t impose upon her as she healed and adjusted to parenthood). I liked the idea and so did our other friend Claire. Alice said that she’d also be bringing the baby to my city later in the summer so we could also meet the baby then if we couldn’t make it up to her city.


I told Becky and Claire that after we visited Alice, I’d like to make a vacation out of the trip. I get very little time off of work each year and Alice’s city is one of the largest cities in the country with lots of museums, art galleries, pubs, trendy restaurants, unique stores, and other stuff that appeals to me. I told my friends that if they didn’t want to extend their trip, that I could simply drive to and from the city separately and I’d do my own thing after baby time and after they left. Becky and Claire liked the idea of the vacation and said they were on board. I said that since my city was on their way up to Alice’s city, that I could drive us from here provided that everyone pack very very light (my car is tiny). Between our gifts for Alice’s baby and our luggage, it’d be just enough room.


Becky and I recently just went through messy, painful breakups with our long-term partners. Before we spoke about this trip, I mentioned that I really needed friend time since none of my close friends are in town. It would help me heal to have girl time. Talking on the phone just isn’t the same to me. So I got really excited about this trip. Becky felt the same way. She too has been a wreck.


Claire has a 10-year-old son, Charlie, and is married. Every so often, Claire comes into town and stays at my place. She doesn’t have any friends in her town and we like one another’s company. She likes to get away and my city has much more to offer than her small town. About half of the trips, she asks if she can bring Charlie and I always say yes.


Overall, Charlie is a great kid. He is often very sweet and has a good sense of humor. However, he’s extremely hyper and talks non-stop. Very extroverted. He’s also used to being the center of attention.


Whenever Claire brings him for a visit, everything is centered around what Charlie wants to do. Charlie calls the shots in where to go to eat, for example. If we decide to do anything not kid-centric, Charlie whines the whole time. For example, I had been working on making a gift for someone and wanted to stop by a craft store to get two items while we were out and about — in and out in less than 15 minutes. Charlie complained the entire time even though we’d just spend the entire day taking him to a carnival, Build-a-Bear, and Chuck E. Cheese.


When we are all at my house, my friend sends Charlie to play in the backyard or in my TV room and is told to take his tablet and toys with him. This way she and I can have adult talk. He’ll be in either of those places for all of 5 minutes before he comes back in and wants to know what we’re talking about, to say that he’s bored, to tell us about whatever game he’s into, and/or that he wants to go out and do something fun. He’s also started developing an attitude. Last time my friend and I were taking, he came into the room and whined that us talking was annoying him and interfering with his game concentration — and that we should be quiet. He did this a few times. I was taken aback seeing as how that’s not the type of thing I’d have gotten away with saying as a kid, especially to someone who was hosting me. I wanted to remind him that he was a guest in *my* house, but decided it’d be best for Becky to  handle it since this was her child. She didn’t say anything any of the time she did it.


So as Becky, Claire, and I are talking about the trip, Claire tells us that Charlie is coming with us. She didn’t consult Becky or me.


One things that came up is that every Airbnb in our price range had enough room for the three of us. Adding another person would require getting a bigger, pricier place and I got the impression that Claire still wanted to split the cost 3 ways and not 4. In past group trips, Charlie was so small that he could just sleep in a bed with Claire so his presence didn’t have an impact on the number of beds we needed. He’s bigger now and needs his own bed.


As for transportation, we wouldn’t be able to take my car. Becky has the same car as me, so her car wouldn’t be an option either. Claire drives a massive SUV that she calls the land yacht. She gets driving anxiety in cities and taking her SUV to Alice’s big city would require Becky or I to drive it. Becky and I have never driven a large vehicle like hers but could probably learn. The concern is that it might not be the best idea for Becky me to attempt parallel parking a land yacht in such a dense city, seeing as how we have such little experience with such a vehicle to begin with.


The idea of a rental car came up and it was going to come out to over $300 dollars. Claire again mentioned this being split 3 ways and not 4. Of course I don’t expect for a child to shell out money, but seeing as how we’d only be getting a rental because Claire is bringing another person, I thought that he should be factored into that expense. 


I don’t make much money, so all of these added expenses are going to hurt my wallet.


At that point I wasn’t interested in the trip anymore. I’m in a lot of post-breakup pain and the idea of being with my friends and not being able to vent — it’d frustrate me. I wanted to be able to speak freely and with a kid around, there’s no chance of that happening. Also since I get so little time off, I am choosy about how I spend my vacation days. I don’t want to spend the few days that I have accommodating a child. I wouldn’t feel right going out to a pub late at night and leaving Claire behind because she’d have to stay with her child, and I wouldn’t just want to stay in at the Airbnb every night with her either. Charlie won’t go to sleep until everyone else does because he wants in on whatever is happening. I don’t want to forego the more adult-targeted attractions. I wouldn’t mind so much if I thought there’d be a balance of kid and adult things, but that won’t happen. I am thinking I’ll just meet the baby when Alice comes into town.


So what I need advice on is whether I should back out of this trip and if so, how to do so tactfully. Nothing has been booked — it’s all just been casual talk at this point. We hadn’t even settled on dates.


I know that Claire will want to know why I’m backing out because I said I was so excited about it. There’s no way I can say I don’t want to go because her kid will be there. It’d make me sound like I hate her kid and I *truly* don’t. It’s just the dynamics of the trip has changed too much from what I envisioned.


One thing I should mention is that I have a history of being overly accommodating of people. I often forego things that I want so that others are happy. I’ve been trying to change that. I’m trying to balance prioritizing myself and not being a selfish jerk. I think this situation will be practice for me.


TLDR: My friends and I planned a trip and one of them announced that she’d be bringing her child along. I don’t want to go on the trip anymore now that the dynamics have changed and costs have gone up."
6,"My sisters boyfriend [M25] recorded me [F21] showering


Throwaway account (??).

So, backstory, I live in a condo with my sister and her boyfriend. They’ve been together about 7+ years, I’ve lived with them for about a year. My sister is out of town for work for about a month and a half. The night before, Pervert (P) had asked me for a ride to work in the morning and I didn’t mind, so we had planned to leave together in the AM.

This morning, we were both getting ready and I waited until he was done showering to take mine, (unfortunately we all share a bathroom) and I asked him if he was done. He said yes, to which I obviously went and washed up. When I got out, I noticed his phone was propped in the corner of the sink and it was on, to which I grabbed it and it recorded the entire 19 minutes I showered.....which I immediately then deleted. However, I took a photo of his phone with myself in the video for proof.

I told him he left his phone and left it on the counter, showing I knew. I left for work without him and he then texts me a sorry ass pity message confirming he recorded me on purpose. I haven’t responded and I’m thoroughly disgusted and unnerved.

I already told my sister, although I’ve kept it very minimal because I don’t want to completely disrupt her trip..I don’t know how to approach P, or if I should approach him at all. Our lease ends June 30th and I’m tempted to just kick him out, beat the hell out of him, or both.

I am also concerned about what my sister [F25] should do, considering his piece of shit colors have now shown. 

TL;DR : My sisters boyfriend [M25] recorded me [F21] showering, admitted to it. How do I step forward with my sister [F25], how do I step forward with him &amp; should they even stay together? 
"
7,"My(16f) siblings(20s, 30s) realized I grew up and now are all down to the ""macho"" culture. I'm pissed off.


Hey guys, I'm not a native speaker so there might be some mistakes.

I'm the only girl on the family(except for some distant cousins and my grandma).   I only have brothers, uncles, ect so I grew up in a very masculine place.

I organized a surprise birthday party to one of my older brothers and got in contact with a lot of his friends. Summarizing, the party was great and I was happy. One of his friends(30s) started messaging me, which I found it kinda weird but ok. He then started to ask for a date and telling me some crude things. I said I wasn't confortable and said we should stop talking. He sent me a dick picture.

I blocked him and decided to talk with my brother. I was kinda sad and a bit afraid to do this, as they've been friends since HS but went throught it.

He didn't believe me, which kinda hurt but I guess I can understand. Then he basically told me that even if his friend was interested in younger people it wouldn't be me. That made me feel super bad and embarassed so I just locked myself in my room and sent him screenshots of our conversation.

Apparently he confronted said friend, who admited. Came home and apologized for not believing me(not about that last thing though). I said ok and thought it was over.

Now he has spread to the rest of the family and they're goung crazy. Like telling me to change clothes, not wear make up, blow my phone asking where I am, who are my friends. I always tell them to fuck off and try to treat them as  before but they keep being sexist assholes.

I guess I do feel hurt that they thought I was so ugly that they didn't have to worry about me being given attention and that now they realized someone might be attracted to me they wanna control my life. This is starting to affect my life, I have a lot of brothers and they are big and have intimidated a couple of male friends. So far no one has left but it's a matter of time.

I tried talking, screaming, giving the silent treatment but nothing seems to work. What should I do??

TL;DR: my brothers realized men can be attracted to me and now are on a sexist quest to ""protect me"". How can I tell the them to fuck off?"
8,"My mom [59/F] passed away recently and left her house to me [25/F]. My brother [24/M] is furious.


My mom passed away recently. It was unexpected and devastating. We ultimately discovered that she died due to complications from a certain progressive health condition. It is the same condition that killed my maternal grandmother at 53, and I discovered at 24 that I am exhibiting early symptoms of the condition as well. The past few months have been a dark blur.

But this post is more about my little brother. We found out that my mom left her only meaningful asset, her home, to me. My brother is hurt and, frankly, furious. What began as confusion has escalated into him insinuating that I unduly influenced my mom into cutting him out of her will. He has made it clear that he feels entitled to half the value of the house and would like to liquidate the property immediately. Under other circumstances, I would agree. 

However, while I never spoke with my mom about her will, I understand why she would leave her house to me. My little brother is highly intelligent, gifted, and gregarious. He also has a history of addiction, poor financial decisions, and chaotic relationships. He has had trouble with alcohol, gaming, and a wide variety of drugs, and has consistently resisted my offers to pay for rehab. He used my mom’s credit card to spend thousands of dollars a month before she limited him to a debit card. And he has had a great deal of trouble with relationships in general, his worst behavior ranging from threats of suicide to bursts of anger to outright blackmail. Due to poor grades, a suspension for cheating, and a violent incident, my brother was unable to complete his college degree—despite admission to a very prestigious school—and is now working at a part-time job to gain somewhat-relevant experience in his desired field. 

I see a great deal of potential in him. I remember many examples of him as an intelligent, thoughtful, and delightful young man. I believe my intermittently abusive father—who is no longer in the picture—has had a terrible impact on my brother’s mental health. I look forward to the day when my brother accepts my pleas for him to seek therapy. However, in his current state, I do not think it would be wise for me to hand over a sizeable sum of money to him. 

While my brother feels entitled to half of my mom’s house, he also knows that I paid off the mortgage on her house and set up a retirement fund for her before she passed away. I decided to pursue a high-paying (but highly stressful) job precisely because I knew my mom wanted to retire to focus on her health but had planned poorly for her retirement because she had insisted on paying for our educations in full in addition to sponsoring my brother’s post-college lifestyle. The profit from this house is likely to be about one year’s salary and bonus for me—a healthy addition to my investment portfolio but not a life-changing amount for me. 

It could, however, change my brother’s life. My plan is to sell the house because it is quite far away from where I live and work, and it is in an area not likely to appreciate in value quickly. I would like to diversify and invest the money and create a trust for my little brother. Ideally, I would like to use the money to encourage my brother to go to rehab, seek therapy, and return to school. Spent wisely, this money would even allow him to comfortably pursue a PhD, like he had originally planned. To ensure that this happens, I will of course have to impose some conditions on the use of this money and may want to oversee large payments or ask for receipts. However, I fear that he will see these conditions as a threat rather than an incentive. I know he is old enough to make his own decisions but I fear that if I give him the money with no strings attached, he will squander it on drugs and luxuries (he is fond of expensive clothing, food, and cars). Do you have any suggestions about approaching him? Thank you in advance for your help.

TL;DR: My mom left her house to me in her will. My little brother is angry and wants half the profit from selling the house. I would like to ultimately give him all the money from liquidating the house but I want to incentivize him to use the money for rehab, therapy, and school. How can I approach him about using the money exclusively for these purposes without belittling or alienating him?

My brother was very irresponsible in his late teens. He was unreliable, usually made a mess of things and was horrible with money. By the time he was 20 he had borrowed about $6500 from me and that was when I stopped giving him money.

The same thing happened with our other brother (borrowed $8000 from him) and parents (borrowed $10,000). That was about the time that we decided enough is enough, asked him to get his act together, come up with a plan to begin working and start paying us back and we promised to help him get through it but he didn't want that. So we limited contact. My husband was around during this time, but we weren't married and we had began to date at that time. We married 3 years ago. 

We've met very little of my brother since that time. Until two months ago when he called me and asked to meet. He looked very different, like determined and confident. He was very apologetic about everything. I was actually very impressed. He also wrote a check for $12000 for me. I was surprised but he said it's $9500 for the debt with 8% interest and $2500 for being a pain in my ass all those years ago.

He's done the same thing with our other brother and parents.

I've seen him several times since then and I'm really liking this new person that he's become. He's very different and likeable now. He's definitely someone that I feel like I can rely on now. So I want to have him back in my life in a bigger way, like our other brother is. Just giving him all his family privileges back.

My husband disagrees and thinks while my brother seems to have changed for the better (he's met him a couple of times in the last month), he doesn't think he's actually paid for his mistakes. He thinks him buying his way back into our lives is not a good thing. When I ask my husband what else my brother should have done that he hasn't, he has no answer. He just says ""more than he's already done.""

I'm also pregnant right now (four months) and daily get emotional and my husband says I shouldn't make important life decisions in this stage. I don't know about that. He wants us to postpone making this decision until after the child is born and keep my brother at a distance until then, while I want to have him around now.

Do you have any suggestions? 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Brother was unreliable and borrowed money from me 5 years ago that he never paid off. Now he's paid them off with interest and then some, and he's a very nice person. I want to have him in our lives now in full capacity but husband thinks we should postpone decision making until after I give birth to our child (four months pregnant now). What should we do? "
10,"My (23F) friend (21F) kicked me out of her bridal party.


Initially, I was asked to be maid of honor. She rescinded that offer a few months later after her sister-in-law became pregnant and demoted me to just a regular bridesmaid. Today she stated that she would like to order the bridesmaids dresses, she gave me three hours to come up with $100. When I stated that that was simply not possible at this moment she said that I was being not conscientious of her other bridesmaids and that it would be best if I attended the wedding as a guest. 

At this points I want absolutely nothing to do with her or her wedding, I do not plan on attending. And I’m tempted to go no contact with her entirely. This is not the first time she has been rude and inconsiderate about finances and other things. Any advice would be appreciated, am I overreacting?

Tldr; friend kicked me out of her bridal party, I no longer want to attend her wedding. Am I in the wrong?"
11,"My [25F] dad [54M] is cutting me out of my family unless I pay him the court/attorney fees he was charged after breaking my arm.



TL;DR My dad thinks I owe him $7000 in court attorney fees he paid after being charged for breaking my arm. Cutting me out of the family unless that happens. 

Apologizing In advance for the lengthy post.

Backstory: Feb 2017, my dad and I got into an argument when he asked me about my personal finances and I refused to give him any details. (My parents have filed for bankruptcy in the past and have a history of being bad with money). I have been on my own paying 100% of my own bills since I turned 21, so to me this wasn’t his business. 

This turned into my dad slapping my face, me taking out my phone threatening to call the police, him taking my phone from me, me reaching for it, him throwing me to the ground, twisting my arm in the process breaking my humerus in half. 

My dad spoke to me the next day telling me he would have done it again if he was put in the same situation. Not understanding and being hurt by the lack of remorse, I called the police a day later and filed a report against my dad. 

The day after that I spoke to my parents again and my three siblings and decided that I would drop the charges and try to work on our issues with a counselor/without the police. However, after removing my statement, a few days later got a call from the DA that she saw my case and decide to pick it up from the state’s end [WA] (my dad had on file another altercation he got in with my brother years before).

The state saw he had a history of aggression toward his kids and picked it up, charging him with a felony.  Months go by, he was brought down to a misdemeanor and served no jail time. All that was required were court fees and attorney fees, an anger management course, and he can’t carry firearms.

Fast forward to now: over a year later and we are working on mending things. With my mom and siblings things have been looking up, but every conversation with my dad is still as negative and still as toxic that over the past couple of weeks I haven’t been in contact with him directly.

My dad recently brought up his court fees and that in order for him to feel things have been made good again, I need to “pay him back for the money that my actions cost them” (a total of $7000). Until that happens my dad has cut himself off from me (which is fine) but has also taken any relationship I had with my mother as well. She doesn’t have much of a backbone and after years of someone bullying you into having the same opinions, unfortunately  you will lose your own. Another unfortunate thing is my sister had the same job as me so my dad is fully aware that I have the $7000, which pushes him to ask for it more. 

He sent me message this morning that he also doesn’t feel safe around (laughs! I’m 4’10, 80lbs, and a grown man is afraid to be around me). He is very religious and raised us heavily in the LDS culture. I have long since left and have tattoos, drink on occasion and smoke weed recreationally. My dad is in total disagreement of my lifestyle and in that same message said he believes I’m refusing to pay him because he believes I have a drug/alcohol addiction. When I told him I’m never going to pay him hat money because I know I don’t owe him any of it, he said he will not even attempt at mending a relationship until I am “drug and alcohol free for 6 months”. 

To me, I recognize the controlling and abusive behavior that we swept under the rug for years growing up. I’m finally standing up to my dad and he’s recognizing that he’s losing all leverage he has over me, but not before proving it by taking literally all he can first (my relationship with my mom). Hoping to hear of ways to mend serious family issues or if maybe it’s time I cut them out?

12,"She [30s F] is mad I [25 F] lectured her kids about stealing.


I threw a party at my house recently and invited some college friends and some coworkers I'm friends with. Almost none of my friends have kids so I didn't think to specify the party was adults only.

One of the people I invited was Alyssa. I don't know her too well, but she's close friends with one of my work friends so I thought it would be nice to invite her.

We hung out in my backyard and had a bonfire and a lot to drink, and partway through, my coworker Alyssa showed up with her 3 kids. I didn't want to kick her out though, so I told her to make sure she kept a good eye on her kids, I hadn't intended this to be a family event, so there was an open bonfire and a lot of alcohol around.

I kept drinking and hanging out with other people, then I went inside to pee. And I saw the tablet I use for recipes in the kitchen was missing from my counter.

I went back outside and after a while I saw Alyssa's 3 kids hiding by the woods with my tablet. I walked over and asked them if their mom knew they had it, and the oldest said no.

I sat them down and gave them a lecture about how taking something without asking is stealing, and stealing is wrong. I asked them what their favorite toys were, and asked how they would feel if they came home to see their toys were missing.

I was drunk for this so I don't know how well I articulated everything.

Afterwards I took the tablet back inside and put it in my bedroom, and went back to the party, pretty quickly forgetting about it all.

----

I woke up the next morning to an angry text from Alyssa, saying ""I'm disgusted by you yesterday, lecturing MY kids without even speaking to me first, assuming you knew what was going on, and what needed to be said better than their own mother. They came to me crying about what you said and wanting to leave early, and I know you were in no shape to handle things maturely, you were extremely drunk.""

I don't know how to respond.

If it was anyone but a coworker, I'd say that I stood by what I said, and it was wrong of her to bring her kids uninvited especially if she had any idea they'd steal stuff to play with.

But I feel like this would stir up a lot of drama at work.

Should I just apologize and not invite her over again? Or stand by what I did?

----

Tldr - My coworkers kids took my tablet without asking at a party she brought them to though it was not good for kids

13,"My boyfriend [M29] would like to propose me [F29] this summer but my parents REFUSE to meet him.


I met the most amazing man (Dan) in the world about 6 years ago. We started off as friends for a few years. While we were friends I realized that I really liked him. I decided to tell my mother about him and she was impressed by his eduational background, career and morals. Until she asked about his religion, Dan comes from a very different religion. That's when she made it clear to me, that my parents only want me to marry a man from the same religion. My parents are immigrants and are stuck on their ways. To be honest I don't think it's about religion, I think it is more about my parent's image in the community. They just use the idea of religion as an excuse. 

I continued my friendship with Dan and I realized we are a great fit together. When I am with him, I am just the happiest. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. Both Dan and I are not very religious so religion is not an issue. We started dating in 2015. Since then I have asked my parents about meeting him and each time I bring up his name my parents start freaking out. It is as if I have shared the worst news with them. My mother complains her blood pressure went up because of me. My dad says he gets pressure in his chest and cannot breathe. I care about my parents and don't want to hurt them. But I also cannot imagine being with anyone else. It hurts me to see my parents act this way. I should say, my parents have a terrible relationship. It is a perfect example of a bad marriage. 

I have asked my parents three times to meet him and each time they refused. Both Dan and I would like to start a life together, but I would feel guilty if I did something to my parents (such as put them in the hospital). They are very good at making someone look like the bad person. They have said some awful things to me (such as I am the one destroying our family, I am the worst daughter they could ask for as I have no shame, no respect, they wish I would die, etc.) It really hurts the things they say. I feel terrible for my boyfriend as they refuse to meet him and are judging him solely based on his religion. They refuse to hear all the wonderful things about him and just use the religion card. His parents on the other hand have accepted me with open arms. I feel so crappy to have to be in this situation and don't know what to expect from my family as Dan wants to ask my for my hand. 

If anyone has experienced something similar to my situation I would greatly appreciate your comments/ stories. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to ask my parents for my hand but refuse meet him because he is of different religion and that would ruin their image in the community. "
14,"[UPDATE] My (39M) in-laws (60s M&amp;F) have been extremely disrespectful to my fiancée (38F) and as such I do not want them seeing my kids/their grandkids (6M/8F). Am I going too far?

Hi everyone. Thanks for your thoughtful replies on my original post.

First thing I did was to be completely honest with Jenny about what the Grandparents said about her. I initially just told her that they were simply rude and disrespectful, which I did to avoid hurting her. In reality they were racist, hateful, bigoted, judgmental etc. She was hurt but she confirmed that she thought I should talk about them and she didn't want to drive a wedge between the kids and their grandparents. She's just amazing.

I called the grandparents during the week and asked if they wanted to meet to discuss what had happened. We made plans for Saturday, so I left early that morning to meet with them (Jenny stayed with my kids at home). When I met with the Grandparents, I told them I was sorry for springing my relationship on them. I told them I understood that it probably shocked them and that it wasn't fair for me to tell them so abruptly and that I didn't do it on purpose but just got caught up in my life. I told them how much they meant to the kids and how invaluable they have been in helping me after my former wife/their daughter (I'll just call her Sara) died. They apologized as well, they recognized it was unrealistic to expect me to be single forever.  I told them that I didn't appreciate what they said about Jenny, and found it completely out of line but I wanted them to meet with her to get to know her better (which is verbatim what she told me), since she meant a lot to me and the kids. Sounds great right? Wrong.

They said they have no interest in getting to know her and said that she wasn't good for me, wasn't good for the kids...all based on how she looks. They said my daughter needed a step mother who looked like her, what would their friends think if they saw Jenny with my kids? And the kicker was that Grandfather essentially said that Jenny was the kind of woman that was just good for sex but not someone that I should spend my life with. Just completely disgusting. And the cherry on top is that they claimed that Sara would have been offended that I would replace her with someone of Jenny's race. Sara did not have a bigoted bone in her entire body and I know she would want me to be happy with Jenny. For them to say such a thing about her beyond disgraceful and broke my heart even more.

After that I'm 100% done with them and told them they are not welcome to be around my children if they're going to spew such hateful garbage about someone they love and who loves them. I'm not raising my kids to be racist, I'm certainly not going to surround my kids with people who say disgusting shit like that. I don't want my kids' memories of their mom to be distorted either. I'm planning on consulting with a lawyer in case the grandparents try and sue for visitation, so I'll be ready for that if it comes to it. Thanks for the advice, all.

TL;DR I went to the grandparents to try and talk with them. They seemed receptive but doubled down on their racism and bigotry against my fiancee so I'm refusing to allow them to see my children unless they sincerely apologize but I'm not holding my breath.

15,"My[22F] dogs ate their medicine my sister[16F] left in their room. My dad[50M] texted her “I’m not talking to you ever again”


My little sister left a bottle of prescribed dog medicine in my dogs room where they bit through the bottle and ate a good amount of pills. My other sister “Jane” and I were home since the semester is over for us and we found that they had eaten through. Jane was freaking out and called my dad while I made sure to clean the rest of the pills out of the way. Jane called my little sister who is in school still and yelled at her. To be honest, I was upset but I think Jane took it too far. She said that it was going to my little sisters fault if they die to her on the phone. I was upset at my little sister for doing something irresponsible but in the end it’s too late to get that mad over this. I think Jane took it too far so I told her to quit it and calm down. 

My litter sister LOVES the dogs. She is the sole caretaker since my dad is never home. These are my dads dogs but he’s never home so the one who feeds them and takes them out is her. 

My dad texted her that he is never talking to her again after Jane called him about what happened. I think my dad was understandably upset but still, he is the adult. I don’t know how he could text that to a 16 year old kid. She didn’t know they would bite through the bottle. She made a mistake but did my dad really have to say that to her? I’m disappointed at my dad for acting like a kid and saying that to her. Jane called my dad after hearing what my dad said to my little sister and said that it was wrong but he just seemed nonchalant about it. He said he wasn’t serious when he said that but to me that was cruel to say to a kid who was still in school and is probably worried out of her mind for the dogs too. 

We called the vet and they said they’re going to vomit and have accidents but they don’t need to come in for an emergency.

Am I allowed to be angry at my dad for that? I know what my sister did was bad but I think he took it too far.

TLDR my sister left the dogs medicine in their room and they ate some of it, my dad texted her he’s never talking to her again and I think it was cruel of him to say that. "
16,"Should I [19F] have left him [21M] for threatening to choke me?


Throwaway because he knows my main account's username:
I have been dating my now ex boyfriend for over two years now, on and off. I have been going through a phase where I have been less attracted to him because of my depression, and him being someone who craves physical love and affection a lot immediately picked up on this. 

I wasn't planning on hanging out with him this last Thursday because I wanted my alone time, but my mom asked me to invite him over to do some work for her in the garage and she would pay him. He came over, I helped him out with it, and I'm dropping hints that it was nice of him to come over and he, immediately realizing I'm not going to be satisfying him, flips.

He starts saying that I better pay him for the work, even though he declined to take my mom's money because he did not do all that for nothing, he wanted a hug and kiss. (BUT I DIDN'T TO, WHO WOULD?) So I zelled him money and asked him to leave, and he immediately zelles it back saying he doesn't want money he just wants respect and reciprocated love. I told him no, that he needs to leave, and to lower his voice because I don't want my mom getting worried or upset. 

All of a sudden he starts saying how most guys would beat the crap out of me and most girls would be fellating him given that work he just did in the garage (even tho I helped). I was unmoved by his statement, so he put his hands around my neck, tensed his hands and arms, but he didn't squeeze. He's never laid a finger on me before. He threw a TV remote at me months ago, but that was more an accident. 

Anyways, he did it again not long later, still not squeezing but tensing around my neck and shaking. I kept my calm, tried to move away from him. I eventually said that I had to go get groceries and run errands, so when I got in my car he started screaming ""NOT EVEN A GOODBYE?! You're fucking paying me right now, I want $100 for what I did."" I said no but we settled on $66 just so I can get away from him. (he wanted 100 for hosing the garage floor, all of which took an hour) 

I drove off and he tried dropping of a cake, a bottle of wine, a love letter saying he forgives me, and he also sent me uber eats later and now I can't help but feel that he didn't actually choke me. I'm also throwing away two years by leaving. 

TL/DR: My now ex-boyfriend demanded I kiss and cuddle after doing my mom a favor, I said no, he threatened to choke me, saying other guys would hurt me. I feel like the one who ruined things.  "
17,"Update: My (33F) boyfriend (38m) broke up with me after a REALLY bad date that ended with the cops being called on him, wanted to get back together the next day, has been distant since.


Original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ymnep/my_33f_boyfriend_38m_broke_up_with_me_after_a/?st=JHDLIDS2&amp;sh=5e5dbb14

I did it! I broke up with him this morning. The last several months have been a nightmare!

I’d like to give a little more history because it’s relevant. I have PTSD from a bad childhood and an abusive marriage that ended last year. Apparently I have a habit of putting myself into familiar situations. 

At first, this guy seemed great. There were obvious problems, but I overlooked them. I knew from the get-go that he had a hard time controlling his emotions. The first thing he told me on our first date was that he used to have a bad temper but had this come to Jesus moment and was so much better now. (Reg flag)

Then after the second date I decided to choose someone else. This guy wouldn’t stop texting me, begging me not to go. It was relentless over days. I had to block him. (Red flag)

He found me on Facebook and sent me a message. (Red flag)

MONTHS LATER, he sent me a letter in the mail. (Red flag)

Finally, he texted me from his work phone. (Red flag)  At this point I was starting to feel like I created all this suffering in him so I texted him back telling him I just wasn’t ready for a relationship and I’m sorry. I had just broken things off with the other guy and I really wanted to be single. But I had engaged him by responding to his text. It opened the door. Suddenly we were communicating. He said really nice things. After a few weeks I was his girlfriend. 

The relationship was hard, partly because I have a lot of trauma in my past and partly because he was super controlling about my emotions. Eventually he pathologized everything I did and constantly blamed me for everything. The relationship became solely focused on how broken I was and how patient he was to put up with me. The truth is, he was extremely emotionally needy and had terrible control over his own emotions which is why any need of mine became problematic. 

He broke up with about once a month. I would beg him to stay and he’d finally relent like he was doing me some huge favor. 

I also have to be on a special diet by doctors orders. He would sometimes undermine me by tempting me with forbidden foods until I caved. 

We were seeing a couples therapist and two weeks ago the therapist told me that some of his behaviors are “scary” and “dealbreakers.” He specifically mentioned the incident I wrote about in this first post. 

The final undoing started last week. I had a licensing exam to take the next day, I was stressed out, I was hungry from this stupid diet, we went to couples therapy and really ironed out the food thing. He’s not going to undermine me anymore, he understands, all of that. The agreement was to take me to eat immediately because I hadn’t eaten all day. So my boyfriend drives us back to his place, gets in his comfortable house clothes, sits on the bed and starts browsing on his phone. I tried talking to him about going to eat but he wasn’t hungry right then. He suggested I eat something small and we would go out later. I pressed it (he felt like I was being “difficult again”) so we went out finally. 

We get to the restaurant and he wants to talk before we go in. We have these talks all the time: he doesn’t understand me, I’m so difficult, he’s losing patience, etc. I cry and try to smooth things over. It’s been like another hour in the car. 

Now, he has a history of when we are out in public he makes inappropriate comments to me about other women’s sexuality. He asks me if that girl over there is getting laid tonight, if that other girl over there likes it rough, why is a girl like that with a douchebag like her boyfriend. Stuff like that. So before we went into the restaurant, I told him, “look, it’s been a hard day, I feel small and defeated right now. When we go in, could you please just pay attention to me?” Meaning, not makes the kinds of comments that make his partner uncomfortable. He asks me why I would feel I needed to say that and I don’t argue with him.

Everything is fine until the very end. Some girl behind me orders this drink I really like and I tell my boyfriend how good they are. He says “yeah, and she’s going to get drunk which will make her boyfriend really happy.” I ignore it but I know where we are heading. He immediately starts saying he can’t believe that girl is with that guy. He starts judging and insulting him to me, and won’t drop that this girl is too good for him. I tell him, “maybe she has a lot of her own issues, you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.” And he says he does though. So he’s fixated on this other girl and why she’s with that guy. All the way to wondering how far along in the relationship they are because they haven’t touched each other very much. Finally I say that maybe her boyfriend treats him like a gentleman and he says “the chances of him treating her like a gentleman are about the same as if we go over there and ask her for a threesome.”  It felt so inappropriate to talk about having a threesome with someone else when I had just the one request coming into the restaurant. I started crying. He was apologizing at first but started saying harshly through gritted teeth “LET IT GO!” I told him to leave me alone, so he left me at the restaurant. 

He drove to his house to get all my things. I had started walking home. He pulled up and told me to get in the van. He took me home and dropped off all my things and broke up with me (again).

I begged all weekend for him not to leave me. And then on Monday I met with my individual therapist. She said she felt like I dodged a bullet. He used to use my therapy against me. When I was working on things like self validation and asserting myself, he’d flip things around where all of a sudden he is telling me that HE needs validation and I’m not giving it to him like I should be. So he used my therapy against me regularly. The therapist told me not to contact him anymore in any way. I tried but I was terrified of being alone. She said I needed to work on loving myself first and being alone would be good for me. I started listening to her and doing the things she recommended and I started to feel better but I also got back together with my boyfriend when he said he wanted to keep trying. 

I practice self love for a whole week and as I did, I started feeling irritated with my boyfriend. He had agreed to give me another chance but “really needed to see some big changes.” I was definitely making big changes in myself. 

After another awful week of being told by my boyfriend how broken I am and how much I need to change and how wrong and frustrating and difficult I am, we went to couples therapy again. The couples therapist tried to get my boyfriend to see that when you’re on a date with someone you don’t talk about other women, etc. He started openly saying things to my boyfriend about how he was behaving in ways that were bullying and abusive and it was triggering my PTSD so he had just as much responsibility in this as I did, that it’s 50-50. He said that because my boyfriend believed that I was responsible for like 80% of our problems and if I would just not “start fights” (meaning have an unapproved emotion or opinion, and especially not defend having that emotion or opinion) then he wouldn’t argue with me so much. And he’s “not going to back down after an argument is started” because I repeatedly would ask if we could just drop the power struggle where all he was after was being right and dominating me. The therapist even asked him things like “so being judgmental is a character trait you want to hold to??”

The last week was me building myself up and refusing to accept 80% of the responsibility for the relationship. And I started to grow angry at my boyfriend, the way he talked to me, the way he treated me, the raised voice, the constant criticism, the refusal to take responsibility for himself, the power struggles and endless arguments because he couldn’t just table an issue and have fun with me. It was so much about him being right all the time. We had a couple more genuinely stupid arguments in the last couple days. So I finally broke up with him this morning. 

I deserve better than this and I think I might actually enjoy being single now while I learn to love myself. I know it’ll be hard to learn some new habits but I will, and I really did dodge a bullet. 

Thank you, Reddit, for calling a spade a spade. 

TL;DR - finally broke up with my emotionally abusive, controlling boyfriend. "
18,"When trying to show me he was faithful, boyfriend (24M) showed me (22F) his tinder on accident instead


We’ve been seeing each other for 4 months and officially dating for 2. Before we were together he was heavy into casual dating but I never pressured him into commitment and it was something we agreed upon together. We have a passionate relationship and he claims to love me deeply. 

Because of his background and our early relationship being exclusively sexual and non-comital, we talked explicitly about our boundaries and I said point blank that him being on any dating apps was cheating in my opinion. 

Which brings me to last night. He was actually attempting to show me that he wasn’t running around on my by showing me things on his phone (messages, snap chat history) because some ghosts from his past were coming up recently. I asked him if he was on tinder and he said no, we met on a dating site and he’s said this to me before. He has an iPhone so I swiped up to search apps and turns out that was a lie. He has tinder and has been chatting with girls for a month. 

He was very remorseful and said it was because he wanted the confidence boost and he didn’t see it as wrong because it was just words on a screen and he never intended to meet anyone (which as far as I know he didn’t) but this is something we talked about explicitly. I didn’t see all of the messages but from the ones I saw the conversations were flirty/casual but not sexual and though he gave girls his number, I didn’t see date plans. 

 He wants to work things out but I don’t know how to makes things work after such an obvious disrespect was shown for me. I’m leaving for a month and a half long hiking trip tomorrow to make things worse. 

TL;DR: bf slipped up while trying to show me he wasn’t cheating and showed me he’s been talking to girls on tinder for a month "
19,"My [33F] ex-husband [29M] came out as gay and we got a divorce and now I'm seeing someone else [25M] and he's still trying to ruin my life.


My ex-husband and I got a divorce about five weeks ago, we have a one year old daughter and I was able to keep her while my husband did not. He came out as gay to me and was not interested in the relationship anymore and walked out on me. I used to work long hours while he would be the stay at home husband and he never got a job. 

However, since he met his now boyfriend, he changed and started to take control of everything I did and how our lives would run in the house at the time. He decided that he wanted a divorce and got angry whenever he wanted something he could not have. 

After the divorce was finalised, I met someone on Tinder and began dating them soon after. He is younger than me, but he is very caring and loving and very mature for his age. When my husband heard that was seeing someone else, he has been trying to ruin my life by spreading false rumours about my boyfriend and I. He has called me a paedophile (My boyfriend is 25) and said that I do not deserve to keep my child. 

It has been putting added stress onto my life and I need help! 

TLDR: My [33F] ex-husband [29M] came out as gay and we got a divorce and now I'm seeing someone else [25M] and he's still trying to ruin my life.   "
20,"My [21F] boyfriend of 2 years’ [21M] parents [50s] are obsessed with their family teddy bear


My bf and I both live away from home for college, so parents (his or mine) don’t play a major role in our relationship. However, I’ve met them for the second time this weekend and it’s getting weird. 

Their house is literally covered in teddy bear paraphernalia - magnets, wallpaper, wall art, stone statues outside etc. 

His mom is a quite childish in her mannerisms. Sometimes my bf shows me pictures she sends of the bear at a coffee shop, with pictures set up as if the bear is drinking the coffee. They’ve even taken the bear with them to see children’s films like Winnie the Pooh in the cinema. 

This weekend my bf and I were going on a road trip and the bear came with us. He doesn’t generally acknowledge it too much, just like “sit there” as he puts it in a corner or something. That said, I did have to participate in some of the posing of the bear for pics along the way. 

I have childhood stuffed animals that hold sentimental value, so I get it, though I’d never bring them out in public and would feel no reason to bring them on a trip with my adult bf. 

When we returned to the parents home today, his mom (whom I haven’t seen in a year) came out of the house and called for the bear, ignoring bf and I, grabbed it from the car and wrapped it up in her cardigan, making a big show of making sure it was safe and saying hello etc. The family all seems to play along with it, but it’s driven largely by her. 

Idk if I’m overreacting. I find this behaviour from adults disconcerting and unusual. I’m a little uncomfortable staying in the house when his mom is around. 

I love my boyfriend. I almost never have to deal with his parents and this bear, but it does make me feel a little nervous about the future of our relationship if these are the in laws I’d be joining.  

TLDR: boyfriend’s mom acts like a teddy bear is a key member of the family and it makes me uncomfortable. What do I do? "
21,"My (20f) partner (23m) of almost 3 years has had a pack of condoms and they’ve been disappearing, I’m scared he’s lying to me about them.


So for context, me and my partner have never used condoms, and we’ve never talked about using them. We have an 8 month old son together and he works/lives about 6 hours away and comes back twice a month. 


Over a year ago I found a pack of 3 in his bag, but there were only 2 in there. He told me his friend gave them to him as they were. 3 weeks ago, I found the same packet but there was only one in there. He told me that his friend asked him if he could have one.


This all seems like bullshit to me, considering we also hardly ever have sex anymore, and he’s a lot less affectionate to me. Am I being too paranoid? Every time I ask him about he gets more annoyed every time, it plays on my mind every day.


Should I sit him down and have a serious talk with him? Or should I just leave it, because I don’t want to ask again and have him be annoyed because I’m being crazy or paranoid over something minor.


TL;DR - partner has a pack of condoms despite us never using or consider using them and every time I find them one has gone, he says his friends take them, but im scared he’s cheating"
22,"My [34F] boyfriend's [33M] mom [50-60s?M] told me to leave him - should I take this seriously?


I [34F] have been with my boyfriend [33M] for nearly 4 months, and it's really been incredible - I've been in relationships before but nothing that's felt this serious before. Everything's great, his friends are great and I get along with them, we're into all the same things, it's been perfect.

He brought up the other day that his mom and dad wanted to meet me, so yesterday we went over for a BBQ. It was just me, my boyfriend and his mom and dad, and I felt like it was going really well. His parents seemed like lovely people. At one point in the evening I offered to help clear up the plates and his mom followed me into the kitchen and started asking me how we'd met, if I'd met his friends yet, what I thought of them etc. And then she asked me if I used facebook. I said I did, and she asked if my boyfriend had facebook again. I said no, he doesn't have any social media, he was upfront about that from the beginning, doesn't like it, no problem with me, I don't use it loads either. She told me that I should be careful and said that I shouldn't be 'fooled' by his charm and should consider leaving him before it gets too serious between us.

I have no idea what to think of it. We left shortly after as it was getting late. His mom was all smiles while we were all together as a group and I didn't notice any tension between him and his mom/parents. I have no idea why she would say that. Could this be some sort of revenge thing? Why would she say this stuff? I've met most of his friends at least once and they all seem great and I've even visited him at work and nothing seemed off.

I'm thinking I should tell my boyfriend about the conversation but something's making me hold off. Just looking for some general advice?

TLDR: Met boyfriend's mom for the first time and she privately warned me about my boyfriend and basically told me to leave him. What do I do?

23,"My fiance [30M] broke my trust by buying condo without me [27F] which is causing me severe wedding anxiety


I got engaged to my fiance a few months ago and are planning to get married this July.  We have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 2 months. Since we got engaged, the same argument we've been having for the last year really intensified, to the point where I'm questioning whether I should get married to him. I realized it cuts really deep for me and need help figuring out this situation.

A year ago, he about a condo on his own, with very little input from me, at a location and time that suited him and at a location and time that were very bad for me. We were and still are living separately. Because my school is very far from his work, and his condo was chosen for how close it is to his work, it would be too far for me to commute. So I decided not to move in with him, despite his initial inclination that I would do so.

He had known since year 1 of our relationship, in 2014, that I had been saving up to buy a condo for at least the past 2\-3 years and have a good chunk of savings. I brought up the idea of us buying a condo together, he said that it was not a good time for him because of changes at work and since we're not married. I was ok with that. I raised the issue again a few more times over the next two years, and every time he says 'it's not the right time for me.'

But in 2017, he suddenly started looking at buying houses, in locations that suited only him. I was taken surprised, since he knew I had been saving for years to buy a condo and had been waiting for him to be comfortable with it so we could pool our assets and do it together \(meanwhile housing rates skyrocketed\). Our relationship was pretty serious by now \(and we would get engaged only a few months later\). To my protest and unhappiness, he bought a condo with his mother's help in April 2018. At this point, I couldn't do anything, since I am legally not married to him, and I am not financially contributing to this. There was no grounds on which I could object to his purchase. But I was also extremely unhappy about how he decided to leave me out of this something he knew I was looking forward to for so long.

As I mentioned above, he thought I would move in with him. I believe he thought I would just be very happy and content with the fact that he's buying a home for us and expected I would be happy to live there. But, his condo is 1 hour drive each way from my school. For a while I thought about possibly making the commute work and even bought a car for this reason, after which I was certain that I could not spend 2 hours driving every day. So I decided to continue living separately and found a new apartment next to my school when my old lease ended.

We got engaged, only a few months later, and with the engagement, this issue has been bothering me more and more. We will have to live separately even after we get married until I finish school, or I'd have to commute those two hours/day. He's chosen the place we're going to be paying a 30 year mortgage on, and where we're going to live for the foreseeable future \(at least 3\-4 years based on our career timelines\). And I got about 0&amp;#37; say in that \(if arguments counted as say, then maybe 1&amp;#37; say\). He's made a such a big decision without me, as we were clearly getting seriously committed to each other, and now the condo is the thing we're going to have to base our lives around, our de facto home, our de facto monthly mortgage. I even considered having a prenuptial agreement where he gets all the assets AND liabilities for the condo, and then we continue to have separate bank accounts outside of joint living expenses so it's clear that only his earnings are going towards the condo, but I'm not sure if that's possible economically or legally, with state\-specific marriage laws, and it really wasn't how I intended starting a marriage.

Reddit, do you think I'm overreacting? When I bring this up, he calls me 'self\-pitying' but I really feel like this is a violation of trust. If he really saw me as a longterm partner, he would value my input, value that I had a really longterm goal to buy a condo \(for which I went through a lot of hard times just to save money\). He would have considered our joint situation, instead of only his needs, and could have waited a few months longer so we can buy a place together as husband and wife.  This is the man I plan now on marrying in this July. How can I trust him, knowing that I felt like he screwed me over before? \(He screwed me over, right? It really feels that way to me.\)  At the same time I feel like I am overreacting and being super emotional about this \- but I have a really hard time letting it go.  I worry that something like this will happen again, i.e. he makes big financial decision without me.

**TL;DR: Fiance bought a condo despite my disapproval last year, a few months before we got engaged, and at a location that is unsuitable for me. I feel trapped marrying into a 30 year mortgage and a de facto condo, and feel like I can't trust him. We're getting married in July.**"
24,"I [21 F] pepper sprayed my coworker's [40s M] wife [40s F] and now I'm worried about going into work Monday.



I started at a new job, a year ago, and I became friends with Tom from work, in a professional mentorship way. However after about 6 months, I got the impression he was interested in me, from how he switched our meetings from lunches and group outings to one one one dinners and drinks, and the stuff he talked about.

It took me a while to pick up on that, I unfortunately can be a little oblivious socially, but once I did, I distanced myself from Tom outside of work. If he'd invite me out to something intimate sounding, I'd say ""I'm not available then, let's talk that over at work in the morning""

I never directly addressed my lack of interest in anything more than a professional relationship, but I did stop seeing him outside of work. I wasn't interested for several reasons, he is much older, married, and an indirect superior at work.

----

On Friday, I was coming home to my apartment, alone at night, when a woman I never met before started screaming at me, for being a homewrecker, and carrying on an affair with her husband.

I didn't connect her to Tom at all, for several reasons. We had never had an affair. Plus I was panicking. I told her to get away from me. She didn't, instead screaming at me ""You don't get to ignore me, after what you did to my family."" 

I yelled ""Get back, get away from me, you crazy b**h"" and she didn't, she started to come at me, blocking my path to my apartment.

So I grabbed my pepper spray and used it on her, then ran into my apartment and locked the door.

I called 911 to report what had happened. When the police arrived, she was still in the yard, and they spoke to both of us. (I basically said I was harassing me, and I acted in self defense, then declined to comment further without meeting with a lawyer.)

In the discussion with the police, I realized she was Tom's wife. I didn't tell the police anything about my working relationship with Tom, or his apparent interest in me, I just said that we could speak further after I'd gotten a lawyer.

-----

I think I've got the legal side of things pretty much handled, but I don't know how to handle things professionally at work. 

I've got to figure Tom's wife saw something that led her to the conclusion we had an affair, possibly texts from the time we were on friendlier terms?

I work closely with Tom, and I have not heard from him since the incident. And I'm freaking out. If it becomes a big fuss, I don't know if anyone will believe we didn't have an affair.

---

Tldr - My coworker seeked interested in me, but I didn't return his interest. A woman harasses me outside my apartment, and I pepper spray her then call the police. I later discover it's the coworkers wife, who believes he and I were having an affair.

"
25,"My (26f) brother (44m) bought my mom (66f) a house. He's expecting all of us (5 other kids, him oldest, me youngest) to pitch in to build her a carport and deck even though he still owns the house. I say no and the family is now divided.


I will try to keep this is short as possible even though there's years worth of ""big family drama"" at play. 

My dad passed last year. My mom had no idea how to pay bills or take care of herself and we learned that my dad had essentially spent them into enormous debt and there was zero money so my mom went into bankruptcy and lost everything. It was very sad and this is where the first family split happened since we either were on team ""dad was always an abusive lying jerk"" or ""don't besmirch the memory of the dead.""

My brother is a multi-millionaire and he bought my mom a house. I am very happy he did this but he and I have never gotten along and he seemed like he was going out of his way to say ""Sis, this is still my house...don't expect it to be in any sort of estate because mom has no estate"" when I didn't even ask him to clarify. Fine, he did a nice thing and he deserves the credit for that...no one is saying he doesn't. 

However now its become very clear that the car port is crumbling and my mom would like a new deck. He hired a full on architect to design a new deck and has already spent something like $1500 just on that. Recently he sent an email to all of us that basically said ""mom needs a new carport and deck, since I've already paid for the architect, I will cover that but he is projecting the cost of the deck and a much sturdier car port at just over $20000. I think it's fair that each of us pitch in $2500 to cover the costs and any escalations. I will refund each of you what is not spent.""

I sent the group back an email saying ""just to be clear, when you sell this house, we can expect to be paid back since we are not giving this as a gift to mom, rather as an improvement to the house you made it very clear you own?""

Of course battle lines were drawn again with 2 of my brothers coming in on my side, my two sisters on his side and you would have thought we were in our house again battling it out after a pillow fight turned into a real fight. 

The two that are against us are calling us greedy and not providing for our mom after they (especially he) have done so much. I give my sisters all the credit in the world because they are the ones that are driving my mom to her doctors appointments and what not and to be very honest if there were to ask for help with gas money I gladly would. But we aren't talking about help, we are talking about pitching in more money than I can afford to literally make improvements on a house my mom doesn't even own. 

It's gotten so incredibly ugly that I'm seriously considering just giving him the money and writing it off as the cost of keeping the peace in my family. I just started my first adult job and I can afford it, but it would mean not getting some work done on my car and putting off starting my 401k. 

What should I do? Should I take back my statement to my brother and try and talk my other brothers into seeing it his way or should I stand firm on this?

**tl;dr: my brother bought my mom a house to live in (but makes it very clear he still owns it) and is expecting the rest of us to pitch in about $2500 a piece to build a new deck. I asked if we would get the money back when he sells the house and caused a huge rift in my family. Should I take back my question and just give him the money?**"
26,"My [24 F] friend's [30 F] son [8 M] made a mess of my new house. She doesn't want to pay for cleaning, or make her son pay me back through his allowance.



I had a housewarming party at my brand new house with a few friends. Jen is the only of my friends with a kid and I wasn't expecting her to bring her son but she did. I thought it was no big deal, it was a bonfire party so he could just play outside.

It started to pour suddenly, so we all went inside for a few drinks. Jen gave her kid some grape juice to drink, that she brought in her purse. So i know the kid was the only one with grape juice

After the party, I went downstairs to see that there were stains all over the rug and table in my dining room. I smelled it and it was grape juice. I couldn't tell if it was accidentally spilled or flung around, but it was everywhere. It looked like it was purposefully flung around tbh, there were three separate splashes.

----

I called Jen saying that it looked like her kid spilled on my rug, could she Venmo me money to pay for a carpet cleaner, and for a new tablecloth.

She said that she'd just come over and help me clean up herself. I said that it probably would need a professional cleaner, it had been left overnight on a light colored rug.

She didn't want to pay, saying ""If you were a mom you'd understand mistakes happen""

I said ""If you don't want to pay yourself, could you get your kid to pay me back over time from his allowance?""

She refused, saying she gives him an allowance to teach hom how to manage money, and teach him about saving, and math.

I said it sounded like a good lesson, if he damaged someone's property, he would be responsible to pay to fix it.

She told me he was just a kid, and that it must have been a mistake.

----

I'm kinda peeved at her, I didn't invite her kid over and now he's messed up my new house that I'm super proud of. It's my first house.

I'm getting a cleaner to come anyway, but how fo I handle things with Jen?

Tldr - Jen's son made a mess of my new house, she doesn't want to pay for a cleaner, and she also doesn't want her son to pay me using his allowance over time.

27,"My [29F] fiancé packed her bags and left while I [33M] was at work.


The title sums it up. I came home to an empty house and a note that said sorry with her engagement ring on it. I called her up and she proceeded to unload how unhappy she was and it’s not fair to me. She is very down on herself and doesn’t like the way she looks. She kept repeating I will find someone better.

This is all coming out of left field to me as our relationship has been great. We go on dates regularly and laugh and have fun. I’m lost on what to do. She won’t tell me where she is nor will she meet and talk about things out. Should I just give her space or what.

This has been my real first serious relationship were marriage has talked about and in the process of being planned out. She has been married and divorced once. I’m an emotional mess right now and just want her to come home so I can feel whole again and show her how much I’ve missed her and how much I love her. Please any advise on how I should proceed. Thank you.

**TL;DR;** : Fiance moves out. What should I do?."
28,"My [33M] Wife [37F] has been acting really strange ever since the birth of our second child


It first started last year after she had just had our second kid. She started to get really depressive and feel down about everything. She started to see a therapist about postpartum depression and things seemed to stabilize for awhile but after a few months her moods started swinging more and more and she kept telling me she felt gross and disgusting and ashamed of herself and her body. 

Eventually she told me that she wanted to look into cosmetic surgery to fix the way she looked and help undo the ""damage"" of two pregnancies. I kept telling her she was fine and didn't need to change but it just kept bothering her more and more and eventually she decided to go through with it, and though I didn't agree with her decision I still supported her. Because I want to protect her privacy, I'll spare the details of what exactly she had done but I'll just say she had multiple operations, it cost us quite a bit of money, and she looked a lot different afterwards.

For about a month after that, she was unable to leave the house or engage in any kind of sexual activity for emotional reasons. Since she works from home this wasn't much of an immediate issue, but it was still very concerning for me. Once she started being able to go out again, I noticed an immediate change in her behavior. 

She had always been a very modest and conservative dresser, but now every time she would go out she'd dress in the most revealing and noticeable way possible, and basically try to show as much skin as she could get away with. She would also start making dirty sexual jokes constantly which she almost never did before, and just altogether seemed to enjoy all the attention she started getting, both positive and negative. I was more than a little uncomfortable with her new behavior and I noticed a lot of our more straitlaced friends were as well but I was also happy that she seemed to be feeling better so while I brought up my concerns a couple times I never really pressed the issue.

For awhile after that things seemed to be getting better overall, and while some of her behavior grew more extreme, she also seemed to be getting a lot happier and more stable. Unfortunately this never seemed to translate into much of an increase in her sex drive and while we did have sex a couple times it was clear she wasn't into it, and she would always insist on doing it in the dark or under the covers since she was worried about me seeing her naked. She kept telling me she was getting better and to just give her time so I did.

This lasted until last month, when she confessed to be that she'd been uploading explicit photos of herself online. She showed me all the accounts that she'd posted with and a lot of the pictures were topless, fully nude, or wearing nice lingerie. She apologized for not telling me sooner but claimed that it was helping her emotionally right now.

I certainly didn't feel very comfortable with other guys seeing her that way, but I also wanted to be supportive, so I just said okay and moved on. I did insist that she not send any photos like this to people we knew or reply or chat with any of the rando internet dudes who messaged her. She agreed quickly and I believe she was being sincere when she did. She also apologized for our sex life being in such a slump for so long, and things have gotten a LOT better on that front since then.

That said, this whole situation has made me feel very uncomfortable both because of how she's been acting and how unpredictable she seems right now. None of this is remotely in character for the women I married seven years ago and I honestly have no idea where her head is at right now. Also if I'm being honest with myself, I'm very uncomfortable with the way she's been acting for obvious reasons. Although I'm trying my best to be supportive, a very large part of me is uncomfortable with how she's been acting while we're out together and \(especially\) with the idea of her showing herself off to other men the way she has been. I could really use some help trying to understand and navigate this situation.

**tl;dr: My wife has been behaving in really strange ways ever since she gave birth to our second child.**"
29,"I [23f] don't like my bf's [28] relationship with my little sister [15f]


This is going to sound ridiculous, please don't be angry at me.

I've been dating my BF for over a year now, and I'm more in love than I've ever been before. He is ridiculously attractive, charming, funny, polite, interesting... the whole package. I don't think I could ever get over him if we broke up, actually. Anyways, I have a little sister, and this is going to sound incredibly ridiculous, but I don't like how close they are.

Case in point, my BF seems to be enamored by her. He tells her all about his work because she is interested in it. He taught her how to speak his native language (kind of, she obviously isn't fluent in it but she's learned a few words/phrases). And he took her on a trip to another state WITHOUT ME. I know this is insane, but I hate how close they are. He seems to like her a lot and i should find it cute but I can't. Like... he's MY boyfriend. What can I do about this? I'm sure he'll be weirded out if I tell him this so I don't plan on doing it. Should I talk to her and tell her to back off?

tl;dr: bf spends wayyy too much time with my sister and I don't like it"

My sister and her partner are both on the same page when it comes to this. She is pregnant because these things happen, but she doesn't want to keep the baby. She told me that her partner said he would 100% support her if she chose to keep it but that if it were up to him, she would do what's best for her future.

She goes to an Ivy League and cannot throw her future in the trash like that to raise a child, so she's getting an abortion. My dad found out and he was very cruel. He said he wished our mom would have gotten an abortion, too. He has a lot of resentment towards our mother, especially since she is mentally ill and therefore he has the primary custody of both of us (which he never wanted but my mom was uncapable of raising us on her own). How to support my sister through this tough time and politetly tell my dad to fuck off?

31,"Coworkers [40s M&amp;F] condescend to me [26 F], since I don't have kids. One told me that I dont know what it's like to be busy, not having kids, when I was working my ass off cleaning up after a tornado hit my parents street.


A few of my coworkers are passive aggressive about me not having kids. I like my life how it is, I use my job's flex schedule to take a lot of long weekends out of town. I like outdoorsy stuff like camping and snowboarding and hunting, which I do with a few friends or alone. I have a fun car, a used but reliable Miata convertible, and a nice but small apartment in the city. I go out with my friends for drinks often. I'm not looking for a serious relationship, but I go on Tinder dates every so often.

I try to balance good financial choices with fun, so I put about a third of my salary into retirement savings, plus some money into savings for a house, so I won't have to worry about money later.

----

Whenever my coworkers ask about my weekends or plans for after work, and I tell them the truth, I get comments from two of them (Joe and Mary) about kids.

Stuff like ""It must be nice having all that time. Just you wait till you're married and have kids""

And I say ""haha that's why I'm in no rush""

----

This week, I had a crazy hectic time. A tornado came through my parents town, luckily they were fine and the house wasn't too damaged. But I took some last minute time off work, drove to my parents house, to help them out. (The house will have no electricity, heat, AC, or running water for a few weeks, the sliding glass doors got shattered, and the yard is a mess with a lot of uprooted trees, some blocking the driveway. The pool is full of debris.

So I spent the whole week busting my ass helping them with cleanup. Since my parents and I came out of it better then some of our neighbors, we spent a lot of time walking down rural roads that were impassible by car to check on people and make sure they had food and water.

My coworker Joe texted me during that time asking something work related, and I asked if it could wait till Monday, because I was extremely busy.

Joe said ""Haha you do not know what busy is, until you have kids.""

I was mad, I'd spend several days working my ass off to clear fallen trees, and haul stuff out of the bottom of a pool. I texted Joe, angry, saying ""Yeah, I doubt that, and I'm sick of you acting all superior. FYI I spent this week cleaning up after a tornado hit my parents street. But who cares about a destroyed neighborhood, right? Fuck off.""

He didn't reply.

I was probably harsher than I needed to be, especially with a coworker, because I was stressed and mad. 



-----

I'm just so fed up with this, and maybe it's just because of this week that's been tough, but I'm angry as hell about Joe's (And to a lesser extent, Mary's) attitude.

I know I should be more polite in the future than I was with Joe, because he's a coworker, but I really just want to tell him off.

Should I say anything to him when I return to work?

----

Tldr - My coworkers keep commenting on how easy my life is, not having kids. I got mad at one of them for that, because he made one of those comments when I was busting my ass helping out my parents after a tornado hit their town.

32,"I'm [29F] receiving vitriol from husband's [32M] family for choosing to hire nannies to raise our kids while we both work.


We have twin boys, 11 months, and I've recently returned to work after an extended maternity leave due to some health complications. Husband and I both have strong career aspirations and we never once thought about one of us staying at home. The plan was always to hire nannies to help where we can't. 

Anyways, my decision to go back to work has been met with SO MUCH hatred from both my parents, extended family as well as my husband's side. In\-laws found out that we hired two nannies, one full and one part\-time, and they absolutely lost it. My MIL called me unfit to be a mother and terrible names for choosing to leave my babies before the age of 1. I've tried to defend myself \(hell, I was raised by nannies and I turned out okay and I have a strong relationship with my mom to boot\) but it's pointless with her. 

I'd be lying if I said none of this got to me. I do feel a lot of guilt, but I know I can't give up on my career and stay at home. I know myself well and I know I'd grow to resent both my kids and my husband eventually if I'm not allowed to pursue my own professional path. My career is so extremely important to me and I have big plans on where I want to end up. However, I feel like everyone I meet thinks I'm a selfish monster for valuing my job over staying home with my children. 

Most recently, I attended my SIL's bday party and she announced that she was pregnant. It was a huge occasion and I was overjoyed for her, but halfway through she broke into a monologue about how she can't wait to be a mother and to raise her kid with a mother's touch, not by strangers. She said she's sure her baby will turn out exceptional because she plans on being \_there\_ \(emphasis on there\) and not just birthing them and passing them off like petstore puppies. 

Needless to say, it was very obviously directed at me and everyone kept searching my face for my reaction. I felt like crying but held it back and faked a smile for the rest of the party. The hardest part is I have literally 0 friends in the same situation. All of my friends are either career\-oriented and childless, or have children and stay at home/have low\-stress jobs. At my particular company, there are less than 5 women at my current level, and all of them are childless or single. 

My husband is trying to hard to be supportive and push back at his parents but I feel like he doesn't understand the particular struggles when you're a woman. I just wish I had people in my life who understood and could give me guidance. What should I do?

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

tldr: Husband's family resents us for choosing to hire nannies to raise our children instead of one of us staying home. I feel no one understands my perspective, and I'm being treated as a monster by most women. What can I do to cope?"
33,"My (26/F) photographer boyfriend (28/M) of over five years, said that he wishes my waist was as tiny as the model he’s been working with lately.


So, I’m a paralegal. Not that it matters. I just want to make clear on the fact that I’m far removed from the world of models and photography. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for about five years. Almost six. He’s my best friend at this point. I know for sure that he loves me, but he doesn’t really know how to show it sometimes. I’m his first serious girlfriend. It’s been a long, at times tiring road. There are certain things about relationships and girlfriends that he just doesn’t understand without being openly told. 

Like how you’re not supposed to compare your SO to a model, or to anyone really. 

And just so we’re clear, I work out all the time. I swim laps every morning and did ballet for fifteen years of my life. I also walk to and from work, eat healthy, etc. Basically I take care of myself. But I do it for me, not for anyone else. I’d say I’m slim. But even if I were on the bigger side, what he said is completely out of line and inappropriate in so many ways. 

We were walking back to his car after a date, and he was showing me the new photos he took at his most recent shoot. I said something about how the model had nice lines and a tiny waist, and he followed up by saying, “Yeah, I wish your waist was that tiny.” 

He said it lightheartedly but he still caught me way off guard. I know that he works in a field where it’s mostly okay to say things like that, and most people are used to it. But I’m not a model and we weren’t at a shoot of any sort. I’m his girlfriend of five years. It was a date. 

I fell silent and finally said something when we were in his car. I said that it’s not okay to say things like that. I feel good about the way I look, and there’s nothing he can say that will change that, but as my boyfriend, he should know better than to put me down like that ... even if that wasn’t his intention. He acted all confused and said that he thinks I’m beautiful, and that he had no idea he’d even said anything about my waist. 

Maybe he didn’t realize that he’d said it. Maybe it was a joke or something he’d said without thinking. Maybe he just said he didn’t know so I’d drop it. 

I don’t know. 

He hasn’t said or done something close to as bad that in a long time. Years. I thought he’d finally learned how to go about a relationship, so I was honestly shocked when he said the thing about my waist. Also annoyed since I feel there’s nothing wrong with my waist. 

It’s just exhausting now. At 28, he should know not to say certain things even if it’s what he believes. Yes, I’m his first girlfriend, and this is his first relationship, but he has five years of relationship experience now, so there’s no excuse. The worst part is that I’m not even sure that he’s trying to be mean, I think he really just doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with telling your girlfriend to look more like a model. 

Yes, this was just one thing he’d said without thinking, but this been an existing problem in our relationship since the start. And I always tell him exactly what it’s wrong to say or do certain things. I don’t just ignore it. But after five years, I’d appreciate a bit of effort from his end. 

This happened last night. 

I don’t want to break up with him, as I really don’t feel that he what he said, came from a bad place. If I were going to break up with him over a shitty thing he had said, I’d have done that years ago. I want to work it out and and continue to build on our relationship, but ... I don’t know what more I can say or do. And it kind of just hurts at this point. 

**tl;dr** I don’t think it came from a bad place, but he does sometimes allow things like that slip out of his mouth without thinking. He always apologizes and tells me that he’ll do better, but after five years, I don’t know what more I can do or how much of this I can take. It hurts at this point. "
34,"My (23M) girlfriend (22F) expects me to apologize to a mutual friend (22M) while I wholeheartedly believe I did absolutely nothing wrong.


Okay reddit. We’re pretty desperate. Using a throwaway because people know my reddit account. My girlfriend &amp; I have been together for about a year and a half now &amp; usually resolve issues on our own. After a 3 month disagreement, we have decided that we may need outside help. This could get long but I’ll do my best to keep it as short as possible. 

So my girlfriend wants me to apologize to a mutual friend over a disagreement my friend and I had. We’ll call me Damien, my girlfriend Katrina, my friend Ray, and his girlfriend Sharon. 

Quick background: 

Ray and I used to be roommates. I liked him, good kid and what not. Weren’t best friends but we had some good times. His girlfriend Sharon and my girlfriend Katrina have been best friends for about 3-4 years. In fact I met Katrina through Ray &amp; Sharon. I have one other roommate, Marcus. 

Anyways Ray &amp; I were roommates for a little over a year. Ray moved out in January of this year and was still on the lease of the apartment. He was able to find a sublet to rent out his room starting February 1st. His sublet moved his things including his bed, furniture, etc in February 1st but was going on vacation for about 3 weeks, so he was not using his room until Feb 21st. In any case, Ray &amp; Sharon came to the apartment every week to spend some time together. They would even go to their old bedroom to have sex. Yes, with the new guy’s bed all moved in and everything.  Me and Marcus kinda scratched our heads but decided to mind our business. 

Around March 2nd it was time for spring break. Me and Marcus were spending the week on vacation, so we would not be at the apartment. Marcus’s little brother asked us to stay at the apartment with a couple friends for a few days and we said yes. 

Towards the end of February, just a few days before spring break, Ray texts me and asks if him and Sharon could stay at the apartment for the entire week. He assured me they would only be sleeping there and sleeping in the living room and would spend most days out. I told him to ask Marcus. Ray then texted Marcus with the following “Hey, just talked to Damien who said I could stay at the apartment  for the week. Wanted to run it by you”. I am not kidding.  I gave him literally no indication of staying here. Anyways, Marcus told him it would not be plausible because his brother and friends would be at the apartment. He was not very happy because he felt he had more of a right than my roommate’s brother to stay at the apartment, since he lived there in the past. Marcus &amp; I, on the other hand, felt that it was not his place to say who should stay at the apartment since he does not live there anymore. I was not trying to be rude, I just wanted to be clear and direct. We go back and forth in disagreement. There’s not much we could have really done since we have already told Marcus’s little brother he could stay at the place with a couple of his friends. Simply put, there was not enough room. 

I feel as if he had no right to stay at the apartment and him acting entitled was getting to my nerves. Even if Marcus’s little brother and friends weren’t staying there, I truthfully wouldn’t be comfortable with Ray and Sharon staying there. I’ve known them for some time and do not trust their judgment, to be completely honest. Marcus has told me that in the past if I left the apartment for a weekend and Ray &amp; Sharon were over, he would hear them go in and out of my room without letting me know. They have had minor incidents with drinking and driving. Once, I left the place for a few days last fall and Ray and Sharon threw some sort of mini party. When I arrived back at the apartment, it was infested with fruit flies. Things like that. I’m not trying to bash them, I just would not consider them reliable at the moment to stay at my apartment for an entire week. They are both good people and are not ill intentioned. I just wasn’t comfortable with them staying at the apartment for a week on top of my roommate’s brother already spending the week there. 

Soon enough, my girlfriend asks me to apologize to Ray. I laugh it off thinking she’s joking (she did not take too kindly on the laughing part). Anyways, after realizing she was serious I was appalled. We have an argument over this. Shortly after we decide it is dumb fighting about so we talk it out. She explains to me that Ray’s feelings were hurt by me and he considered me a true friend, prior to this incident. Honestly, we were friends but we’re not the type of friends who typically hang out. In fact, I can’t remember the last time we spent time together. The only time we would really hang out is if my girlfriend came to visit and she wanted to spend time with Sharon, so we would double date. Anyways, Katrina felt as if I should apologize because I hurt Ray’s feelings regardless of who’s right. (By the way, this has happened once in the past where an argument between me and Ray took place over something and I was very direct to him at that time as well. Apparently I hurt his feelings and so, I apologized to him even though I did not feel like I really needed to. I tried taking the high road). I feel this is a trend with Ray and I don’t want to spend our friendship apologizing to him and fondling his balls (sorry). 

Anyways, a month later my girlfriend comes up to visit (we’re doing LD and don’t see each other often). She wants to see Sharon and a couple other friends while she’s here. While I was not thrilled, I didn’t have a problem with it. We planned for brunch. I decided I would try to clear things up with Ray and try to get past it. After all, our girlfriends are best friends. So I text him asking to come to brunch the following day. He ignores my text.

I did not apologize to him. I never reached out to him again. Katrina was upset with me because I couldn’t “just do it for her.” I told her it had absolutely nothing to do with her and it was my own principles I was adhering too. Anyways, we agree to disagree.

Recently, Katrina tells me my argument with Ray has been negatively affecting her relationship with Sharon; they don’t talk as much, it’s not the same, etc. I genuinely felt sad because I could tell she was upset about this. She also said something nice to me after we had dinner; some compliment. This was followed by her admitting that she has not been able to compliment me for the past few months, ever since my argument with Ray. I have noticed this myself, she has not been as affectionate &amp; talkative. Just a bit more distant. We are doing LD (for about 8 months now) so maybe it could be a part of that. I told her that it wasn’t cool to not communicate this with me and she agreed and said she wasn’t doing it intentionally. She said she would try harder to show more affection and communicate. 

I told her that if her and Sharon’s friendship is slightly strained because of Ray being upset with me, then Sharon is not a very good or true friend. Katrina was not very happy to hear this. In any case, I’m a little bummed out because I hate seeing my girlfriend so upset. I also don’t want to apologize unnecessarily. So I’m in a bit of a dilemma. Any thoughts? TY for listening. 

TL;DR: 

Ray, an old roommate of mine, asked if he and his girlfriend Sharon could stay at my apartment for a week. I was not going to be home for that week and my roommate’s brother was staying at the place to begin with so there would not have been enough space. Regardless of that, I was not very comfortable with them staying there for various reasons. 

My girlfriend Katrina is best friends with Sharon and their friendship has been slightly strained due to this. Katrina asked me to apologize to Ray because I ‘hurt his feelings.’ I did not apologize. "
35,"Me [late twenties F] with my boyfriend [late twenties M] of 2 years, he won't dress up for events


So here's a really low-stakes question: how do I get my boyfriend to dress up for things like weddings? 

We recently got invited to a wedding that listed ""black tie preferred"" on the invitation. From what I looked up online that's basically floor length gowns and tuxes. When I mentioned that we'd have to rent a tux for him, my BF said he wasn't wearing one. I was confused and said something like, ""well then what are you wearing?"" He said he'd wear a button down shirt and slacks but no tux. I tried to explain that wasn't appropriate, given what the invitation said. He shot back that it said ""preferred"" so he didn't have to wear a suit or a tux. 

I'm frustrated. I think it's rude to go to someone's fancy event and look either out of place or sloppy. But I don't know how to explain this in a way that makes sense. 

It does seem silly that you have to wear anything in particular to witness someone you care about get married. And it is really out of his character to own a suit let alone a tux and wear it anywhere. 

I tried to explain that it would be like if someone came to our wedding (next year) in jorts. Yes, our wedding vibe is casual-ish (sundresses, khakis, whatever) but wearing jean shorts would seem so, tacky? Idk. When I tried to explain it this way he got defensive and asked if I would be embarrassed of him. I said no. But honestly? A little bit. It draws unnecessary attention to us as guests when you look out of place, it's rude to so blatantly disregard what the couple wants, and I wasn't about to dress down just to match my boyfriend so, yeah, I would feel really awkward with him. It also doesn't sound like fun if we have to have a dumb argument about clothes beforehand. 

TL;DR Are there any arguments I can make about dressing the way you're ""supposed to"" for a wedding or do I just have to give up and stop caring what my boyfriend wears to formal events?"
36,"My friend (40M) dumped me (31F) because i’m only a teacher.


“Brad” and I have been friends for over 5 years, since we met at a friend’s wedding. I’m a third-grade teacher and Brad works for a bank. There has never been anything romantic or sexual between us. We’ve just always enjoyed talking and hanging out, kind of like a brother/sister thing. 

Two years ago Brad married Dorene (45F), who is a lawyer. In the beginning, things were okay. Brad and I still hung out and talked a lot, and we (my BF and I) would have him and Dorene over for dinner or drinks sometimes. In return he and Dorene invited us to their house for parties and things. Over time, though, Brad started pulling away. When my BF and I had him and Dorene over for dinner, they would bolt their food and then leave immediately. We weren’t invited to their parties anymore, and Brad slowly stopped returning phone calls and texts. I haven’t heard from him at all in eight weeks, when we used to talk every day.

At first I was bewildered, because I couldn’t figure out why Brad had changed. We hadn’t even had so much as an argument. Then one day I ran into “Anna,” a mutual friend of mine and Brad’s who I hadn’t seen for a while. I mentioned that I hadn’t heard from Brad lately and she kind of smirked and asked if I knew why. When I said no, Anna said that at a party several months ago she had overheard Dorene telling Brad that next time she didn’t want him to invite me, my BF, or several other friends because we weren’t “intellectual” enough. She said she was embarrassed to have us mixing with her friends, who are all lawyers and executives, and she wanted Brad to focus on being friends with the “right kind of people.”

I guess I knew Dorene was kind of a snob from the beginning. She decided that they should buy a huge house in an exclusive neighborhood and furnish it with stuff from the priciest boutique in town. She’ll only fly first class, and she drives a Mercedes. She even insisted that they get a purebred cat instead of adopting from the shelter. But I don’t know why Brad has bought into her attitude. While I know being a primary school teacher is not a prestigious career, I love my job and can’t imagine doing anything else. I also read a lot, keep up on politics, and can hold my own in a conversation — it’s not like i’m the village idiot. I don’t think I ever did or said anything embarrassing in front of Dorene’s friends. 

I’m pissed off and hurt, and I don’t know whether I should try to talk to Brad or just write off the friendship. I have no interest in guilt tripping him into being friends with me, but I would like to tell him how I feel and hear the explanation directly from him. What should I do?

TLDR — my friend and his wife are snobs and dumped me because I wasn’t high-class enough for them. I don’t know whether to call him on it or let it go. "
37,"My [24F] fiancé [25M] of 7 years left me for another woman [28F]. I don't know how to cope.


I'm devastated, to say the least.

We have been in a relationship for 7 years, engaged for 2. I've battled depression for years and just recently have been getting real help for it which I believe has impacted our relationship. I was getting better until this all happened. We agree on all major things like money and kids, we can talk through arguments, and we support each other. I'd say in the last year the spark has faded, but I've been working on my depression as I believe it's a factor. I love his parents, they love me.

In the past couple of days, I noticed him acting very strangely. Saying how he's reevaluating his life, how he knows I will have a bright future (not we). I asked what was wrong and he confided that he has a crush on a coworker. 

Him and this coworker have been friends for a few years through work. Nothing suspicious ever popped up. They play sports every so often and now share the same career path. Now lately in the past month, he's been obsessively studying her native language, looking at her social media, and texting her. Seemed like every 5 minutes her name is on his Message screen.

Now, this has happened before. It was sudden, out of the blue, and was a red flag for depression because of this. I told him such and all was well and we were stronger than ever, mostly because he said he felt he could trust me with anything and rely on my support for anything, no matter hpw difficult.

So this time around, I said the same thing. I asked if anything was wrong with us and maybe he's projecting things missing from our relationship on her. He said absolutely, all seemed well again. He said he's taken a strong interest in her cultural background. I figured okay, let's work on it and give it some time.

The very next day, he posts a picture of her on social media. I said that it was very disrespectful given what was said the previous day. He doesn't take it down, the texts continue.

The day after that, yesterday, I had a terrible time at work. All I could think about was what they were texting about. I come home and he's texting her. Tears ensue. He says he doesn't feel happy in our relationship and wants to be with her. I found his post on this subreddit explaining that he's professed his love for her already and wants to move to NZ with her. His search history has things like ""how to date a (her nationality) woman"", ""how to date an older woman"", ""how to leave a fiance"", and ""how to break a mortgage"". Also tons of porn of her nationality. I have stuffed a trash bag of clothes for him to go to his parents for a while, maybe permanently.

I am so heartbroken and don't know how to cope. The biggest part of my life and my biggest support system just evaporated in an instant. He's been in an emotional affair with her for a month so has a great support system through her. I don't know how I'm going to be able to work on Monday. I need to finish a class to go study abroad in September but I can't even fathom how I can do it. This seemingly came out of nowhere. I don't know how I can ever trust a man again or even find someone with the same priorities as me. I'm so lost.

Tl;dr: My fiance is leaving me for another woman whom he has had an emotional affair with for a month. I am so devastated and don't know what to do with myself."
38,"Me [29 F] with my boyfriend [29 M] of six years, he told me he cheated last night and I don't know how to move forward


Hi guys,

Using a throwaway but have told my boyfriend that I'm making this post, because my head is spinning and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend of 6 years (lived together for 2, known each other for 7), messaged me today asking me to come home and that he needed to talk to me asap. I asked him what was going on and he said he'd fucked up and that he feels sick. I pushed and asked what the hell was up (because I've never received a message like this before) and he confirmed that he'd cheated last night and that he wanted me to come home so that he could tell me everything. I was about two hours away at my family's house, and had some things to deal with so it was later this evening by the time I arrived back.

He told me that after his night out last night, he cheated on me with a girl, X. They had sex. He thinks it lasted about 5 minutes. They didn't use protection. He was out of his mind drunk and told me that he only has flashbacks and doesn't remember everything, but he did tell me everything that he could. They ended up in a taxi home together after being in town, as their families live close by. My boyfriend had not been out with her that night, but with one of his best friends, Mark and some others. Towards the end of the night, he meets girl X and they all head towards the taxi rank. My boyfriend gets into his taxi with Mark and girl X, but Mark insists he wants to stay longer so my boyfriend and X head home together in the taxi. Boyfriend says that he remembers X coming on strong to him, telling him that she's always liked him when they were younger, etc. He remembers being outside, her leading him to her house and having sex but not being able to fully do the deed. He then runs away home in the dark and gets sick along the way. This is around 4AM, I think. He passed out and didn't message me until later this morning as his phone is broken (he had texted me on Mark's phone at about 1AM saying that he was having pints and going to a different bar), so he messaged me on his laptop at noon today.

He is a mess, he's dry heaving, won't eat, has taken Xanax and has apologized and said that it's up to me what I want to do and he understands whatever decision I make.

Never in a million years did I expect this to happen. He's a shy guy, and without trying to put him down, it's not often that girls would come on to him or chatted him up. He's only ever had sex with me and his previous girlfriend who he was with for four years.

I feel sick to my stomach. I love him so much. Everyone says we're so good together. We've never had a major fight or had issues with cheating. I thought we were going to get married and be together forever. Am I a fool to try and work through it? Has anyone here ever been in a similar position? How the hell do I get past this?

I'm sorry for the rambling post, I just don't know what to do and this feels like a horrible nightmare. I've just spent the last two hours in the living room with him sobbing on one couch and me sobbing on the other.

TL;DR - Boyfriend of six years cheated on me last night and I don't know what to do."
39,"My(22M) family doesn't believe I'm gay


I'm kinda baffled right now so if someone could help me out it would be awesome!

I told my parents my sexuality when I was 16. I really did not think there would be any trouble, since my older brother came out and the whole family was 100% supportive.

They just kept asking if I was sure, that I didn't have to label myself or whatever. I was kinda hurt but thought maybe I had been too casual or something.

I'm a pretty private person so I don't share a lot of my romantic love with anyone. Through out my teens they didn't really seem to believe(nor my brothers/sisters/uncles/aunts). 

When I was 18 I met a guy on the internet. Long story short, we had a LD relationship for years(which I told my family, but they didn't seem to believe) but at the beginning of this year he got a job on my town! I was over the moon and told everyone. My siblings and parents just kinda rolled their eyes and didn't comment.

When he got here I didn't immediatly presented them to each other. We had seen each other face to face a couple of times but I wanted to spend some ""couple time"". I then started trying to arrange a meeting in a restaurant or something so my family could meet them.

My parentd basically refused and only one of my sister met him. 

This week I texted the family to see if they wanted to have a picnic with us but everyone had something to do, either doctor, some game, whatever. 

We did or picnic at the park and started snogging a bit(or a lot, but all child friendly, I promise), when a dog jumps on me. My moms dog. Who was staring with the rest of the whole family.

I was super confused and hurt and went to ask what was goung on. Before I could open my mouth she started saying I had to stop this stupid show, that everyone knows I'm straight, that I'm just looking for attention and to take attention from those who really need it. She then started telling my bf he should leave me because I'm only using him, that she bets I'll never have sex with him(which I had) because I'm not straight

I was near tears at this point and she left with the rest of the family. They didn't even look at me, the only one who seemed to want me was the fucking dog.

I have received several texts from different members of the family telling me to stop lying. When I try asking why they think I'm lying they just keep repeating I'm straight

I have no idea of what could be happening. I truly don't. None of this shit makes sense. My bf has a really bad impression of my family(which I don't blame him).

Anyone has any suggestion?

TL;DR: I was made it clear I'm gay, my family doesn't believe me, even after catching me and my bf snogging. My mom told me to knock this act out and stop pretending I'm gay. I don't know why she doesn't believes me"
40,"Found out my [F 43] husband [M 44] based his entire career off his fetish.


He's a foot surgeon. A few days ago I had to borrow his laptop, and found a wealth of foot fetish porn material. This is after he's always told me he doesn't watch any porn. I found that unusual but obviously not a bad thing. Now I find he's got folders full of feet related pictures and videos he's downloaded. His internet history also shows the same.

He's pulling these from the internet, but he also uploads pictures of his patients' feet, to the websites he's a member of. The whole time he's at his practice he's collecting these. He even writes long erotica for a foot fetish forum about what he sees as a foot doctor.

Keep in mind in addition to the no porn thing, he'd also told me he has no kinks or fetish fantasies, we've discussed it before. I have a much higher libido but thought we were both on the same page of pretty standard sexual interests. Not saying a foot fetish is shockingly extreme, but trying to underscore he had PLENTY of opportunity to mention it. He never did. I actually thought he's pretty disinterested in sex...I've always wanted it more than him. To be honest, this is embarrassing, but over the 15 years we've been together our sex pattern has been once or twice a month. Usually initiated by me, so finding out how deep this sexual interest runs is really a shock to me.

Anyway after sitting on it a couple days, I broached it today as it's the weekend. He exploded at me for snooping, yes I did admit I snooped through his computer. I apologized but tried to go back to my question about what I found. I mean this collection was...vast. Extensive. It was like a massive hive of folders within folders, ordered by themes, I saw items dating back years... How long had he hidden this part of his sexuality from me??? He confessed he'd hidden it from the beginning. Well he was already in school to be a podiatrist when we met... after a lot of beating around the bush type denial, he admitted he's had the foot fetish since he was a teen. It was basically the driving reason behind his choice in career.

I'm having a hard time sorting out my feelings right now. You might say a fetish isn't a big deal, people can be embarrassed of them so they keep them secret. Or if he's not being sexual towards patients at work what's the problem. That doesn't do away with how I feel like he lied to me since the beginning. I'm not sexually judgmental and he could have brought it up any time. Instead he lied over and over during normal conversations about sex, lied about watching porn, the amount he masturbates (whole other subject), the low amount of sex we have is probably somehow tied to this, etc. I just feel duped. Like him as a sexual person isn't at all who I thought he was. Then this impacted my sex life with him from the very beginning in ways I couldn't see.

Then there's the work thing, what the fuck? Who decides their career path based on their fetish? Taking pictures of patients and posting them online has to violate the law. Becoming a doctor to see people's feet when feet turn you on is like if a guy became a gynecologist just to see women's genitals (I know most male gyno's aren't in it for that, I'm just saying my husband's motive would be the same as a gyno who was, and getting off to people without them knowing.)

Does this all make sense? I'm kind of a mess right now and trying to work out exactly why this bothers me so much. My main feeling is feeling betrayed. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I don't know if I can trust him now.

My husband was really resistant to telling me any of this. Now I can't know he's not still hiding more. He was really upset, he's now left the house to cool down. One thing he said was he never wanted me to know ""that side of him."" I do not know what to begin to make of that.

Where do I go from here? At a total loss right now. Any suggestions are welcome, including if you think I'm being ridiculous at all.

TL;DR: I discovered my husband has a severe foot fetish he's completely hidden from me. It went so far as him choosing years ago to become a podiatrist which he's been doing since I met him 15 years ago.

41,"My [16F] mom abandoned my brother[22M] and lied to me about him and my biological dad my whole life and now doesn't want me to have contact with him. How do I move on from this and convince my parents to let me have a relationship with him?


This is a bit of a long story but I'll try to keep it as short and easy to read and understand as possible but keep in all of the relevant stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

So this is the version of events I had always been told growing up:

* My mom and biological dad were married and had me and my brother.

* My biodad and brother were both ""bad"" and when I was 3, my mom managed to get me and her away and married my stepdad.

* Up until last year I'd had no contact with either of them and they had never tried to contact us but that was for the best anyway because they were both ""bad"".

&amp;nbsp;

Last year though, completely by random chance I happened to run into my brother who recognized me and introduced himself and we started talking and over that time I learned more about that story and that some of it was lies.

From my brother I learned that:

* My biodad had some mental health problems and started developing drugs and alcohol addictions and having psychotic episodes just after I was born.

* Our mom and biodad got divorced and our mom remarried but he didn't know why I got to live with my mom and stepdad and why he had to stay with our biodad.

* He used to come visit every few weeks at first but then we moved and he wasn't allowed to any more and although he had a contact number for our mom, he wasn't allowed to know where we lived.

* He tried getting in contact lots of times over the years and would try to arrange to have birthday and Christmas presents sent for me but wasn't allowed.

* Our biodad died 3 years ago and even though he reached out to our mom, no one ever told me and he was left to deal with it himself anyway and still not allowed to know where we were or to contact me.

&amp;nbsp;

My brother was reluctant to tell me all of this fully but kind of had to when I started realizing that the story I knew wasn't adding up when I really thought about it and then the more little bits he told me, the more it didn't make sense until he had to tell me the full thing.

I couldn't believe it when he told me, and I was absolutely furious and wanted to confront my mom and stepdad to find out why. I wanted to know why they abandoned him and always told me he was ""bad"" even though he might actually be the best person I've ever met. I wanted to know why I was the one that got chosen to have a good life and got to be safe and provided for and he didn't. I wanted to know why they lied and said my brother never tried to contact us when I now have proof he did. Why no one ever told me when my biodad died. 

I've hated being in this house since then with all these questions burning inside and with all the guilt all the time that I got to have a good life when my brother didn't and that I just believed he was a bad person without ever questioning it or even asking what that meant and just forgot about him even though he always thought about me and even tried buying me gifts even when he was practically fending for himself and our biodad himself while he was just a kid.

My brother told me to wait though until I was calm and was sure that I could talk reasonably with them about it. He's always saying that having a family is something I shouldn't throw away lightly and that it's not doing him or anyone else any favors to throw away or jeopardize those relationships out of anger. He said I should wait until I was ready to actually have a conversation with them and be open to understanding their side (and not just have a rant) before trying to bring it up.

I tried to wait but a few weeks ago it all just boiled up inside me and I ended up bringing it up probably before I should have and before I was really prepared with what I wanted to say and it quickly turned into a bit of a shouting match. My mom and stepdad were caught off guard and didn't really have anything to say for themselves and instead tried to make it about me and saying I should have told them as soon as I started talking to my brother again instead of explaining why they treated him like they did which got me even madder and I ended up storming out. 

I packed up some stuff and went to stay with my brother for a few day but I told my parents I was staying with my friend and her family because I didn't want them to do something like calling the police and making me come back or getting him in trouble. When my brother found out though that my parents didn't actually know where I really was, he said I had to either tell them the truth or go back, so I decided to go back home.

&amp;nbsp;

In the last 2 weeks since I've been back its been either shouting matches or not talking. So far my mom has admitted a bunch of stuff and confirmed basically everything my brother said so I now know that:

* My mom met my stepdad while she was still married to my biodad

* My stepdad would only agree to take me and my mom in and not my brother so she decided to only leave with me (and thinks I should be grateful for that)

* My brother was allowed to visit us sometimes until my half-sisters were born and then my stepdad decided it was best for everyone (i.e. easier for everyone except my brother) if he wasn't allowed to see or contact us any more so my mom abandoned him for the second time with no explanation

* He did try and arrange to bring or send gifts for me but my mom refused

* He did let her know when our dad died and said he'd left stuff that was meant for me and my mom but she refused

* Even now my mom says she knows what she's done was wrong and she regrets it but she says she wouldn't change it

&amp;nbsp;

My mom and stepdad don't want me talking to my brother any more but I refuse to abandon him like everyone else has. I know if my mom would just sit down and meet with him she'd see him like I do and know she made a mistake but she refuses to and my brother says he won't come over or meet with her in public unless she knows upfront and agrees to it.

My brother says I can live with him if it ever came to it but that I need to try and sort things out with my family first but I don't see how that's even possible?? 

I hate being here and having to see them every day knowing that I got a good life at the expense of my brother. That I could just as easily have been abandoned at some whim. That my mom and stepdad have the audacity to think that I should be grateful to them instead of mad. That they don't seem to want to care about what they did or even try to make it right and just want to pretend like it never happened and my brother doesn't exist.

I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I want to go and live with my brother but I'm scared my parents would make trouble for him or ban him from seeing me legally since I'm still a minor, but I don't want to lose him again.

&amp;nbsp;

What do I do? Can my parents stop me talking with my brother? Can they stop me from living with him if it's what he both want since he's my family too?


&amp;nbsp;


-----------------------------


&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr** My mom abandoned my brother when he was 8 so she could take me and live with my stepdad. They lied and told me my biodad and brother were ""bad"" my whole life. I've now met my brother and they've admitted the truth but don't want me talking to him or seeing him any more and I don't see how I can keep living here with parents who'd do that to a child. What do I do?"
42,"I [M23] dont know how to explain to my GF [F22] that I can't make as much money as her


I met my GF, Amanda, close to 3 years ago. Amanda has always been the most hardworking person I know. Throughout our entire relationship she's been a camgirl. She's started out relatively unknown, and through lots and lots of grinding, she's established an incredibly loyal community and carved out a pretty specific niche. It's gotten to the point now that she currently makes close to six figures from being a sex worker. I'm so, so incredibly proud of her! However, lately she's expressed that she wishes I took the same initiative in my career as she did in hers. I was kind of taken aback at the comment! I work a part time job, student teach, and take classes while maintaining a 4.0! 

I tried explaining to her that there really wasn't more I could do, but she's of the mindset that there's ALWAYS more things to do. I asked for specific examples, and she basically said ""well I'm not studying to be a teacher so I don't know, but you should"". I've tried getting across that teaching isn't really a ""hustle"" job where I can just keep working more and more, but she somehow wants me to match her insane work ethic anyway. 

Is this really a dealbreaker? I don't know how else I can communicate  effectively that there isn't work for me to do! I'm getting annoyed by the constant comments, and I think she is legitimately looking down on me because I'm not as career oriented. I don't know how to show her what I mean, and I don't know if I have to break up with her over this. What should I do?

TLDR: My girlfriend wants me to match her insane work ethic and career building, but I literally can't in the profession I've chosen. I've tried to communicate this to her, and have failed."
43,"My husband[30M] is constantly praised while I’m [30F] left in the dust


My husband and I have been married a couple of years and we have a good marriage although not perfect because we aren’t robots. I have a very successful career at a fairly young age and have always been footing the bill for EVERYTHING including all household bills, vacations, etc. I have supported my husband through school and am always encouraging him better himself. His life has dramatically improved since we started dating about 8 years ago. 

My husband truly is a good partner but he doesn’t seem to notice the mental strain that I feel when he is consistently praised by others. Whether it’s my family, his family, or literal strangers on the street, he is always called intelligent, smart and generally praised for being a great person. Well, he is a wonderful person but I RARELY, if ever, get any type of complements (from him or anyone else) regarding my accomplishments or the sacrifices I have made to make his life better. My family always tells me that if we were to get divorced, they would keep my husband and get rid of me.


Over time, this has made me very resentful towards others and my husband (which I hate feeling). I work so hard for us to have a good life and I am always encouraging him to follow his dreams but I rarely get any kind of encouragement in return. He tells me it is because they know I’m smart or it is just expected of me. I sometimes wonder if it is because I am a woman but I’m not so sure. 

Basically, what the hell do I do to stop being so resentful of providing a vast amount of emotional and financial support to my husband while he basks in the glory of being constantly complimented by everyone while I stand at the side? He certainly deserves it but so do I. It is wearing me down. 

TL;DR: my husband is perfect and it’s making me resentful which I hate. "
44,"My [32F] Husband [34M] is loud. Like, REALLY LOUD. To the point I think I'm getting hearing damage. What do?


So, my husband is \*really great\*,  except for this one little thing.

He is loud. When he talks, he always, without exception, no matter the situation or context, will project his voice so that he \*\*SHOUTS\*\* whatever he's saying. We're in a little coffee shop with few other customers, he'll still shout whatever he's saying so that they can hear his side of the conversation. It's at night and we have paper thin walls and our elderly neighbor goes to bed early. He still doesn't tone down his volume and will talk as if he's in a crowded room and he's struggling to talk over people.

He's from a really loud family; his brother and mother are exactly the same, the loudest people in the room and they'll compete with each other to be the loudest. Family get togethers with them make me wish I could bring ear defenders.

But my main problem is his snoring. His loud, unceasing, jet\-engine taking off snoring. I've used one of those decibel meter apps \(inaccurate, I know\) and it clocked his snoring at 90dbls. All night. Every night. For 8 hours. Reddit, I have permanent tinnitus after a decade of sleeping next to this man. I don't know how I can take even another decade of this. I'm genuinely afraid I'm going to have hearing loss from this.

I've tried for \*so long\* in \*so many different ways\* to try to get him to go to the god damn doctor about his snoring. Not even telling him that I'm genuinely certain that he has sleep apnoea, that you can literally die in your sleep from apnoea, that I've \*listened to the man I love most in the world choking and spluttering and struggling to breathe\* and it terrifies me that I'm not going to be awake to shake him up to stop him from suffocating in his sleep.

He won't go to the god damn doctor. He's not even registered. He's not been in fifteen years. He makes all these promises, but \*never\* follows through. We've had heart\-to\-hearts, I've been weeping, in tears in front of him, \*begging\* him to go to the doctor, and he's promised, he's apologized, he's sworn he'll do it \*the next day\*, but he doesn't. We've been married for eight years, and I've been asking him for a year longer than that. 

Reddit, do I have to infantilise this man to make an appointment for him, like he's a \*child\* to fix this? Because he sure as frack isn't going to do it himself. And at this point I've given up trying to get him to use his inside voice. I've just stopped going on dates with him to restaurants and coffee shops because he will not \*ever\* stop \*\*SHOUTING\*\*  all the goddamn time. No matter how I ask, nicely, sweetly, joking, exasperatedly. I've just given up. And it makes me so sad that I can't do these nice things with him because he \*will\* shout so loudly that it disturbs everyone around us. I've watched. \(note; we're in the UK, in a sleepy little town. People are not routinely \*\*EXTREMELY LOUD\*\* here\).

\*\*TLDR\*\* I've married THE LOUDEST MAN IN THE UK. And I think I'm going deaf from it. He's even loud in his sleep and won't go to the doctor to talk about his likely sleep apnoea. I'm terrified of waking up to the love of my life dead beside me because he won't take this seriously. Please, help."
45,"My (28m) girlfriend (29f) played a gross prank on me, making me seriously think about breaking up.


We went to a local music festival last night with some friends. A few hours in we were all very drunk including her. I needed to pee so I went to one of the porta potties onsite. The rest of the group came with me, some also needing to go. My girlfriend had the idea to play a joke on me by tipping it over. She got two of our friends to help her do this. They pushed it forward and before I knew what was happening I was covered in all the waste flowed out from the toilet tank. It was absolutely fucking disgusting, and I couldn't get out because the fucking door was under me. They had to roll it over while I was screaming to be let out I heard them laughing.

My clothes were soaked in literal shit and I also threw up adding that and all the beer I drank to it. I kept puking from the waste on top of being drunk. Then my girlfriend started to dramatically  worry yelling was I okay and it was just a joke. She was still kind-of laughing. She said she didn't think it would actually fall over(???) I couldn't even look at her, I was so embarrassed and disgusted I just wanted to go home. I left once I could stand without puking. Without saying a word but I was so mad. I still am. Luckily my friend was a standup guy and came after me to drive me home, I don't really remember but I must of stripped before getting in his car and he had a towel to cover myself. He got me home I dont remember taking a shower but I must have before I passed out since I'm clean.

I woke up today now to a bunch of missed calls and texts from my girlfriend, most drunken apologies with alot of ""LOL"" and asking if I was okay. Some were totally incoherent. I guess she kept drinking after I left. 

I'm still so angry. I don't want to talk to her or see her at all. Not just about the toilet but how she then stayed for the rest of the concert after I left like nothing happened. It's like she didn't care what so ever. It was all a huge joke to her, she even let her friend record it. I haven't been online yet so for all I know that could be on social media right now.

Even if she didn't mean it badly she humiliated me in front of all our friends and whatever other people there saw it. This will never be forgotten. Especially if it ends up on the internet. This was the single most disgusting thing that's happened to me, all because she thought toppling a portapotty sounded like a brilliant prank idea. Wtf.

Basically, I don't know if I can look at her the same now. In the interest of fairness she's never done anything like this before to me or anyone else. We've been together for almost 2 years. Shes not someone with a history of pranking people. She's also been drunk plenty of times and never done anything gross so I can't entirely believe it was just because of that.

Would it be overdramatic of me to break up when this was out of character for her?

What do I respond to her with?

Tl;dr: My girlfriend of almost 2 years pushed the porta potty over while I was in it. I'm seriously upset and don't know if I will think of her the same now."
46,"MIL [64F] expects husband and I [30s] to pay for his sister [26F] (and her fiance's) honeymoon costs.


This is weird but we honestly don't know how to handle this. So my husband's younger sister is getting married this fall. She's the youngest girl out of 4 kids (3 older boys, then her) so unsurprisingly she is her parent's favorite and very spoiled. There's always been a tradition of buying her big gifts during her birthday/holidays. When I first started dating my husband I found it weird since it's so one-sided. Literally everyone in the family will gift the sister something, but no one gets gifts from anyone else (including the sister) in return. 

Anyways, the parent's logic is that the little sister has less earning potential since she's studying to become a teacher and her fiance is in a low-paying academia position (local university), BUT they're not poor by any means. In contrast, her three older brothers are all in law or finance and earn quite a lot more compared to her. The girlfriends/spouses also all work in the same industries, so as a couple I know we do earn quite a bit more than SIL and her fiance. 

I don't have a huge issue with the gifts, but I am getting annoyed at MIL's constant expectations of BIG gifts to SIL. I feel like she's a bit out of her mind to think her expectations are normal. For SIL's wedding, we all agreed to get her a gift that's like a home-good. Furniture, cutlery, nice appliances, etc. Just the typical things you get for newlyweds. Well we found out last week that one of my BIL (oldest one) and his wife are going to be paying for the first night's dinner reception at SIL's wedding. She's having a destination wedding, so there are a lot of random costs. We found out that the reception will cost them approximately 9k altogether. 

Well, that's really great and all but MIL now expects the rest of us to spend something roughly similar to ""not seem cheap."" I am flabbergasted. We were going to get her 1k in gifts anyways but expecting 9k just to match someone else's gift is insane, imo. Since we already ""agreed"" to buy SIL a gift of her choosing (she talked about wanting a table so we thought that was it) we are also a bit stuck. SIL was in the room when MIL called us out and told us our 1k gift would be too cheap, and she said it's better if we pay for SIL's HONEYMOON. It would be approximately 5-7k for their two weeks. 

Note: This was in front of EVERYONE while we were at a family gathering. Instead of sticking up for us and saying no it's too much, SIL also didn't say much and just nodded and smiled. We are now put in an extremely uncomfortable situation and we don't know what to do, esp since we agreed to buy her a present before. Husband is mad and wants to yell at his mom but I'm upset that no one thought this was a ridiculous request apparently. I don't want us to cut ties with his entire family over this. But we are also about to buy our own home soon, and frankly we can't be spending 7k on someone else's honeymoon just because. What should we do?

------
**tldr**: We agreed to buy SIL and her fiance a nice wedding present (like a table, some furniture, etc.) but my BIL stepped up and spent 9k on their reception dinner. MIL now expects all of us to spend someone similar (7-9k) for SIL. I think this is crazy but their family thinks this is normal. What to do?"
47,"Called into work sick and my boss had an attitude about it. What do I do now? (urgent)


So I work a shitty part time job at an ice cream shop. Long story short, we’re understaffed.
My bosses are really cheap and refuse to hire more people, this makes scheduling a little difficult. I’m not the worlds greatest employee but I definitely go out of my way to make sure my bosses and customers at my job are satisfied. This includes working double shifts on days when other coworkers call in. I’m always working doubles and I rarely complain about it. I also rarely call in (i’ve accumulated over 30 hours of sick time)

I woke up with a fever this morning so I knew I needed to call into work. I send my boss a text letting her know I have a 103 fever and I wouldn’t be able to come in today. She responds: “Wow!!! And no one else is available to work instead of you”

I really don’t know what to respond to this message. I personally don’t believe it’s my fault that we’re understaffed and I’m a little offended at her reaction considering I go out of my way to cover for my coworkers. I need to know what to respond to her message that’s professional and not rude. Someone help? 

TLDR: called into work and my boss is not happy about it. Need advice on what to say to her. "
48,"Me [22F] with my dad’s teenage son [16M] - how to handle possible inappropriate behavior?


Hello! I’d like some advice on how to deal with my dad’s teenage son and some probably inappropriate behavior. 

Background: parents divorced when I was really young and remarried to different people soon after. I lived with my mom, step father and two sisters (half sisters) most of my life and only moved across the country for college. I stay on my own, but because I live closer to my biological dad and his wife, I now spend most major holidays with my dad and his family and stay with them for a week or so a couple times each year. 

Enter my brother “Alex”. Alex is the son of my biological dad’s wife. My dad has adopted him, but I’m much closer to my sisters having grown up with them. Prior to moving for college, I’ve never really interacted with Alex. 

The issue: ever since I started visiting regularly, Alex has behaved... weirdly. I’m not really sure how else to describe it. When he was younger (~13) he has on more than one occasion, hugged me and stuffed his face into my cleavage. I used to think that it was an unfortunate outcome of our height difference, but little things continued to happen (e.g. hand on thigh, prolonged daily hugs, “accidentally” walking into my room when door is closed at night and I’m changing etc.). 

It was mildly amusing in the past cause he was always just a little kid but has been increasingly uncomfortable, to say the least. When I went over for Christmas last year, Alex underwent his growth spurt and is now taller and way buffer than I am and it is a little bit terrifying to be unable to extricate yourself from a hug that’s gone on for too long. Alex has taken to hugging me from behind while I’m helping out with the dishes and it’s just weird to have this kid do that. I actually woke up to Alex walking about in my room in the middle of the night during spring break?! I yelled at him and slept with the door locked after that. 

I’m at a complete loss as to how to bring this up and yet this has made me uncomfortable enough to worry about visiting. I’ve already started dressing more conservatively in that house (always keep my bra on and no short shorts). I’ve also been trying to avoid any situations where awkward opportunities might crop up. 

How else should I handle this so that boundaries are set and no one is upset? I love my dad and his wife, who have been nothing but nice to me and have readily accepted me into their family home. Also am I just overreacting and is this just a normal brother sister relationship? I haven’t told anyone IRL just in case it’s just me. To be fair, my sisters and I used to hug all the time. 

TLDR: dad’s teenage son might be behaving inappropriately, am I just thinking too much? How do I get him to stop?"
49,"My (37F) ex (38M) favors adopted child over our (12F) daughter


My ex and I were together for 5 years around our college years. Birth control failed and I became pregnant. He was very upset as he was not ready to be a father and accused me of trying to trap him. This wasn’t true at all, I was just as surprised/unprepared. I offered to raise the baby by myself, never naming him as the dad-and that’s what I did. He bailed and I went through the pregnancy alone, the labor alone. Never put his name on the birth certificate (we were not married) and raised my daughter by myself. At 6 months old he suddenly sued me for paternity and got visitation.  While this sounds promising, he was never interested in her. He commonly didn’t show up for his visitation, refused to buy anything to provide for her. Would bring her back dirty and unfed. Just treated her like an annoyance. 


Life moved on. We both married other people. He and his wife were unable to conceive a child so they adopted a beautiful baby girl. Here’s where the problem lies. He treats the adopted child (we’ll call her AC) 100x better than our daughter-and she notices. He stays at home to take care of  AC during the day (he works a part time paid-in-cash job to avoid child support for our daughter). He constantly talks about AC’s first laugh, or first tooth. He posts pictures with her all the time. He takes her places and buys her all kinds of gifts. Basically he’s the father our daughter always wanted.

Our daughter has basically turned to Cinderella. When she goes over there she has a long list of chores to complete. Sometimes she’s put in charge of taking care of AC all day so they can nap/have a date. When she’s not busy doing chores or free babysitting-they lock her in her room. No, I’m not kidding. 

My daughter is a 4.0 gorgeous extremely well-behaved child. She’s what I call an old soul, way more mature than her age. She definitely has some of her dads features and traits (and there was a dna test done to establish paternity, so no question there). 

While I’m taking my daughter to see a counselor to help with these justified feelings of rejection, I’m just baffled why he would treat her this way. Not to be cruel but our daughter is 50% biologically his while AC has no blood ties to him (she’s actually a completely different race, not that it matters). I never tried to force him into the Dad role, get money from him, etc. 

Can anyone give any insight as to why he acts like this? Or any advice on what to tell my daughter when she comes to me crying.

Thanks so much. 

**TL;DR: Ex treats bio daughter horribly compared to adopted daughter**"
50,"[UPDATE] My BF [24M] is going on a trip with his ex-GF [22F] and some friends. I [23F] am finding this a bit weird.


[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8iaail/my_bf_24m_is_going_on_a_trip_with_his_exgf_22f/).

So Ben came back from London today. He arrived at the airport a few hours ago. Jenny (his ex) was there, they said goodbye and he got in the car. He said he missed me very much :)

In the car, I told him how I was having a bit of a hard time with him going on this trip (I already told him, but still), but that I trusted him. He told me that it was definitely something weird and the circumstances were peculiar, and that he didn't plan on doing it again. He's aware that this could have been seen as something really shady and that he was grateful to me for being understanding and ""not freaking out"".

We got to my place and he didn't even make it to the bathroom until I jumped his bones. After, when we were cuddling, he gave me the Sherlock Holmes hat he bought me. I asked him if he brought me a fridge magnet because he knows I collect them, and he didn't, so I was a little disappointed. I said ""oh, you know I collect them and I always wanted one from London"" and he said ""you can get one yourself when we go there"". He caught me off guard so I just said ""what?"". He got plane tickets and booked a hotel room for us to go in August! We talked on the phone this past Saturday and he asked me if I was free that week, telling me we could spend it at his cousin's house in the beach, but he was planning this! It's our first anniversary and he really blew me out of the water.

I'm just so happy right now, he has been so amazing through all of this that I can't even put to words how lucky I feel to have this guy in my life.

TLDR: Not only my fears (or at least 5% of my brain's fears) were unjustified, he has planned a trip to London for our first anniversary. He's the best =D"
51,"My [23F] coworker [early 30’s M] is making me uncomfortable but I’m not sure if it’s a big deal?


I’ve been interning at a small company for about a year now and there’s an employee who says weird, almost sexually harassing comments to me from time to time and I don’t know if it’s bad enough to notify HR. He also has a fiancé, I’m not sure if that’s relevant. 

A few examples:

When I first started, he’d insist on buying me lunch. I took him up on it once because hey, free lunch and I’m a broke college kid, but then he got weirdly pushy after that and I started to decline his offers and stay behind. One time, another (male) coworker, who I consider a friend, got me lunch and he sulked about it and the offers stopped. 

I called out sick a few months ago and he messaged me on Facebook and offered to bring me soup. He lives an hour away from me and I declined because I thought it was weird to drive 2 hours to do that for someone, as I don’t consider us friends. 

Around the time of the soup incident, I was walking back to my office and saw him standing in a coworker’s doorway. He stared at my ass as I walked past, long enough for me to actually notice and I’m super oblivious and never notice when people are checking me out so it went on longer than just a quick glance. 

Two days ago, I mentioned to a group of coworkers how I wanted to go to the pool this weekend but couldn’t because I had a new tattoo (you’re supposed to keep new tattoos out of the sun) and the conversation ended there. But later that day, the coworker came back when I was alone and said I could “skinny dip at night” so the tattoo wouldn’t get ruined. If he’d said “swim at night”, that would’ve been fine but he’s the one who brought up skinny dipping, which made it weird. 

Yesterday, most of the company took PTO to get an extra day for Memorial Day weekend. Since I don’t accrue leave, I came into work and was one of like 10 employees there and the coworker messaged me “are you lonely?”

My direct supervisor, who is a female, took me aside a few months ago and said that it was okay for me to come forward about him since I wasn’t the first intern he’d been inappropriate with. This conversation was started by her, not me. The male coworker I mentioned earlier in the post also said yesterday that I should come forward if I’m uncomfortable as he’s noticed a few weird things as well so he would be able to provide his perspective. 

I guess my problem here is, while it’s a pattern, is it enough to actually say anything or would I just be rocking the boat for something small?

tldr; male coworker has said inappropriate things to me and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to be alone with him anymore but nothing he’s said has been super over the line and blatant sexual harassment. "
52,"My [23 F] friend [26 F] was cheated on, and now she's outing as many cheaters as she can find. I'm worried it's not healthy for her.



My friend Julie was cheated on in her last relationship. It hit her hard, they were engaged, she could see a life with this guy and then she found out he'd been fucking his intern at work.

I encouraged her to get on Tinder, get over him, etc. She did get on Tinder and has been on a few dates. But last week, I was hanging out with her, and she told me something...

She always looks up people she matches with on tinder, to make sure they're real, it's not some sketchy con or catfish. That's pretty normal, I do the same for people I intend to meet with.

Anyway, she's found a number of her matches on social media just to see they're taken. Every time, she tracks down their girlfriend's contact info and sends them evidence of their boyfriend or husband cheating. Tinder screenshots, conversation screenshots, etc.

I still thought that wasn't too bad, it seems like the morally right thing to do. I just told her that I was concerned that it wasn't helping her get over her ex, since she had cheaters on her mind so much.

---

We talked again a few weeks later, and from what she said, it sounds like she's spending more time on Tinder outing cheaters than anything else. No longer just doing it when she happens upon one, but actually seeking them out.

She turned her age preferences way up to catch old married dudes, and when she does find someone with a girlfriend or wife on social media, she will turn the conversation with the guy sexual to collect even more ""evidence"" to share. Acting like she's going to have sex with him, asking about his past hookups, etc.  

She hasn't met up with anyone or had any conversations on Tinder with guys she actually likes.

----

Morality of all this aside, I'm really concerned this isn't healthy for her, and it isn't helping her get past the betrayal from her ex. I thought getting on tinder would be good for her, she could find a fun rebound or something, but now I regret suggesting it.

Is this really as unhealthy as it looks, or could it maybe be helping her work through her feelings? 

I want to help her the best I can, but I don't know how. She's still so hurt by her ex cheating. 

-----

TLDR - My friend broke off her engagement when she discovered her ex was cheating. I suggested she have some fun on Tinder to get over him, but she's started using Tinder just to find cheaters and out them. I'm worried this is unhealthy for her, and making it harder for her to move past her breakup.

53,"After finding out I [20F] had a boyfriend, my mom [53F] treats me as if I'm a disgusting person


Outside of calling me a whore and a lot of other verbal abuse, after finding out I had a boyfriend my mom treats me a lot different than she used to.

Whenever I come home and I go in the bathroom, she questions how many showers I took and why. If I just get out of a shower, she gives me a dirty look and tells me I just took a shower earlier today, why do I need to take one again, even if I didn't. She refuses to let me wash my clothes with everyone else's despite it saving water. She tells me I need to hand wash my underwear before I put it in the washer. She bleaches the bathtub after I use it. These are just the things that come to my head.

I had one boyfriend who I am not even seeing any longer as she made me break up with him, and she treats me like I'm some filthy std ridden person. I want to move out but because of our culture and religion, I feel a lot of guilt and shame doing so. Any advice is appreciated.

tldr; My mom acts like I'm disgusting because I had a boyfriend. She won't touch my clothes, bleaches the bathroom after I use it, and constantly questions how many showers I take."
54,"My [29m] older brother [34] applied at my job and used me as a reference. When HR asked me about it, I essentially told them I did not think it would work out, did I do the right thing?


My brother and I have a very unique relationship, we don't really talk much since we're two very different people. On the rare occasions we do talk, it's no longer than a 5-10 min conversation. I'm more on the calm side while he has a very loud personality. I'm also more on the introverted side while he's the opposite, you can probably imagine how our personalities may sometimes clash from this. There's also a bit of a maturity difference, people often say I seem like the older brother in our dynamic and question my brother's instability not only in life but career choices, he can't stay in one location for more than 6 months at a time. He's also a single father with 2 kids where I'm single no kids.

A few years ago when I was in between jobs, my brother got me a job to work with him in a sales role while I was working on finding some permanent work. The short version of this was it was unhealthy. We did not see eye to eye on selling, he was super high pressured to close deals right there and then while I was more about building the relationships for the long term. He ended up yelling at me in front of customers and the manager had to sit us down to talk. I ended up leaving that job after about 3 months because it was just not working out. It definitely took a while to heal after I left but we've made our mends since.

A few weeks ago, we grabbed a beer just to catch up on things and we ended up talking about our current work and all. I've been at my company for the past 1.5 years and it's a pretty reputable company and I do well for myself now. During our beer talk, I mentioned how some of these guys at my job are pulling in insane numbers. I felt like that idea started cooking in my brother's head and he wanted in but never directly said anything to me. I later find out that he applied at my company and used me as a reference. I got an email from HR asking me about it. I requested for a quick 10 minute meeting with them for some feedback and they agreed.

When I sat down with the person in HR, I essentially told her ""While I do respect my brother and believe he would do well in this position, we've worked together in the past and our work dynamic did not create a healthy work environment."" I didn't go into any detail but the girl was very responsive and understanding about this and even expressed how she doesn't think she could work with her sisters. She told me she appreciated the feedback and will keep this confidential and take it into consideration. Turns out she already planned a phone interview with him but will let me know how the process goes if they decide to either go with him or not.

Did I do the right thing here? I have built a very solid reputation within my company and I felt like, though it was very selfish of me for my career, that I had to shun my brother's potential stability away. I know we'd work at different departments but him being there already caused kind of a stir for me and now I'm putting business with my family which I wanted to keep separate. 

TLDR; my brother applied at my job, HR asked me for feedback and I mentioned it would not be a healthy work environment. Did I do the right thing?

55,"My (29M) wife (39F) accidentally broke my daughters leg (3months). It was an accident but my wife severely blames herself and cries every night. What to do?


So to get it out of the way, the accident. My wife is a good woman and mother but she is quick to panic. Middle of the night we woke to our daughter spitting up and in rushing to our daughter, she slipped/tripped and fell with our daughter resulting in her broken leg. Took her to the hospital immediately, she’s leaving the hospital tomorrow and no other injuries can be observed. Obviously I was upset with her but I do know it was an accident. 

Now my wife for past two weeks our daughter has been in the hospital has constantly blamed herself. Wondering “what kind of mother could do that to her own child” and crying often. She’s done everything else with me, slept there with her, and breastfed every time. She has made it clear she doesn’t want to take our daughter outside and will have me carry her because “she can’t trust herself”

Obviously I know we will have to be more careful and everything but is there anything I can say to her or help her to slowly move past this? 

TLDR: Wife panicked and tripped with our daughter resulting in a broken leg. What can I do to help both of them? "
56,"I (39f) sleep in the spare room when my boyfriend's (48m) son (11m) is here


Boyfriend's son is 11.  Boyfriend and son have always slept together \(even though son has his own bedroom\).  They are very close \(I'd say almost co\-dependent\).  I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years, and when he had his own place, it didn't seem as concerning \(plus son was younger\).

We decided to move in together a year ago and discussed son sleeping in his own room.  That lasted a couple of months.  Now, whenever he's here \(which is every second week for the full week\),  he either falls asleep in the master bedroom with his dad while watching tv, or asks me if he can sleep in there with his dad \(at his dad's request a lot of times\).  He sleeps in there the entire time he's here now.

I sleep in the spare room.  Meanwhile, he has a really nice bedroom with a new bed and all his stuff across the hall.  All my clothes, pills, creams, sex toys \(!!!\) are in the master bedroom in my bedside table.

I don't fault the son at all.  He loves his dad, he's young for his age, and he wants the comfort of sleeping with him.  Sometimes he's even referred to it as ""our"" bedroom \(his and his dad's\).  As well, he \(and his dad\) allow the dog up on the bed to sleep with them, which I do not when I sleep there the rest of the time because it makes me stuffy.  I've told my boyfriend that I would prefer the dog NEVER sleeps on the bed, but it still happens.  When his son goes back to his mom's, I strip the bed, change all the sheets and clean up \(there is candy, pop, chips, socks, books, etc piled up on the bedside table beside my side\).

My issue isn't with the child.  He's 11 \(going on 12\).  I know he'll be entering puberty soon and will naturally sleep alone.  He's already taking a big growth spurt so I know it's coming soon.  **I also understand his dad probably wants to hold on to the last remaining bits of his only child's childhood.  This is how they always slept since the divorce, and it probably brings him a lot of comfort.**

My main issue is with my boyfriend.  We have had several discussions about this \(in fact, it was discussed and agreed upon before we ever moved in together last year that this would end in this new house\).  I don't want to alienate or upset his son, so I tell my boyfriend privately that I don't think it's appropriate that I am sleeping in the spare room while he sleeps with his pre\-teen son in our room.  

The problem is:  NOTHING CHANGES.  It's not like I think it will go on forever.  It's that I feel disrespected and unimportant to my boyfriend.  Basically he knows this upsets me and doesn't really care.  His desire to sleep beside his son outweighs his concern for my happiness.  So even though it will end soon naturally, this has left a bad taste in my mouth because it shows me that my concerns/feelings aren't heard or important to him.  Plus, it really bugs me that I am relegated to the spare room for 1/2 the time every month, and as soon as his son goes back to his mom's, I'm expected to come back.  It seems extra rude that I'm the one ""kicked out"" \(in theory\) instead of both of them going to sleep in his son's room.

It's worth noting that his son always sleeps in his own bedroom 100&amp;#37; of the time when he is living at his mom's.  His mother has a boyfriend that lives there, and they sleep together.  The son seems to have no issue with that at all.  It's also worth noting that \(to me\) he has a very typical, normal relationship with his mom.  However, he seems overly dependent with his dad.  He seems clingy and younger with his dad \(and his dad treats him young \-\- always walking holding hands, etc\).

Again, this isn't really about their dynamic \(which I know is unusual for his age, but I also know will change naturally over the next couple of years as he goes through puberty\).  It's more about the fact that I feel very disrespected, not to mention that there are 2 full weeks every month when sex is not happening because we can't sleep together.  \&lt;\-\- and my boyfriend doesn't seem at all concerned about that.

**\*\*tldr\*\*  bf lets 11 year old son sleep with him when he is at the house we share \(which is every second week as he has 50\% custody\), while I sleep in the spare room.\*\***"
57,"My [23F] best friend [24F] demoted me from Maid of Honor to wedding guest to promote my close college friend [23F] instead on the insistence of the groom [24M]. Am I wrong to feel upset?


The relationships of everyone in this post with each other can be confusing, so I'll summarize those first:

* I [23F] have been best friends with the bride, Sarah [24F] since high school.
* I have been close friends with the new Maid of Honor, Carly [23F] throughout college.
* The groom, Andrew [24M] has been a close friend of mine since high school. According to the best man, he used to have a huge crush on me before I encouraged him to go on a date with Sarah. This was before he began to exhibit some concerning behavior (to be addressed later in the post).
* The best man, Tom [23M] is currently dating Carly and is Andrew's best friend. I introduced Carly and Tom to each other last summer.

I hope all of that makes sense! I know it sounds like the beginning of a high school drama (with the way this is all going, I'm starting to wonder if we're stuck in one).

Sarah asked me to be her Maid of Honor a day or two after she and Andrew became engaged. I was absolutely honored (heh) to accept and helped organize her wedding planning (mostly making sure that her various plans and dreams were filed correctly in the ""wedding file drawer"" and that she wasn't going too crazy with her budget/what she wanted to do). From the moment she asked, however, Andrew has been against me being the MOH. Why? He says it's because he doesn't want Tom to walk down the aisle with anyone other than Carly. It's ""so they match"" and ""because it makes sense."" 

When Sarah and I both suggested that Tim can walk Carly down and I can walk alone, he vehemently refused to allow that as well, because I am single and it would ""make the wedding party look lopsided."" Andrew does have plenty other close friends who can serve as groomsmen, but he is absolutely stubborn when it comes to wanting couples specifically to walk down the aisle together. In his eyes, because I am single, I will make whatever groomsmen walking down with me feel awkward and if I were to walk alone, the wedding party would be lopsided. Therefore, I should just be a wedding guest and be happy for him and Sarah.

Sarah held out for a while, but it seems she's given into pressure. She messaged me about two hours ago on Facebook saying that she is so sorry but it hurts her to see Andrew so upset, so she is demoting me from the wedding party entirely and giving MOH to Carly. However, she will keep me as ""backup MOH"" in case something were to happen to Carly. An hour later, Carly messaged me very angrily saying that she DOES NOT want to be MOH. She does not know Sarah as well as I do and believes that MOH should go to either myself or any one of Sarah's family members (I have no idea what's happening with the family). She does not blame me for this happening to her, but she wants me to tell the other three to back off because they are not listening to her. And about half an hour ago, I received some more messages from Sarah in addition to messages from both Andrew and Tom begging me to reason with Carly and convince her to accept MOH.

I am absolutely tangled in so much drama, I am genuinely wondering if we're all back in high school. I definitely wish I can back out of this, but I also want to be there for Sarah and Carly, who have been with me at my lowest. I've made a two lists of reasons pertaining to this situation that I will also share here, in case it helps everyone put things into perspective.

Reasons why I SHOULDN'T/CAN'T ""reason with"" Carly:
* Sarah is my best friend, but that does not make my friendship with Carly any less in my eyes. If Carly wishes to refuse MOH, then why make her do it? She would likely be miserable.
* On principle, I am quite disgusted with Andrew's (and to some extent, Tom's) behavior. Talk about groomzilla! This is not the first time he's been controlling with Sarah, but this IS one of the worst times I've ever seen.
* Carly doesn't know Sarah will enough, despite dating Andrew's best friend. Double dates are few and far in between because Carly is in grad school and research lab all day for most days.
* They're all adults. They should sort out their drama themselves.
* I may want to stay the heck away from this mess, but I still want to be MOH, despite everything. I know, I am kind of pathetic.


Reasons why I SHOULD reason with Carly:
* Sarah is extremely upset. Her messages have increased in frequency and in panic. The word ""please"" is coming up a lot as well (more than usual).
* Sarah is my best friend. I should be there for her and help her in any way I can. But I don't want to jeopardize my friendship with Carly either (see reason 1 above).
* It is Sarah's and Andrew's big day, and it is both of their choices on who makes up the bridal party.
* Carly and Tom do indeed look much more suitable as a couple than myself and Tom.
* I can help Carly fill in any gaps she has with knowing Sarah.

I have not messaged any of them back because I want to get all my ducks in a row before I take any further steps. Obviously, the things I can't do include magically getting a boy or girlfriend in time for the wedding (I would find that to be a very odd request anyways). 

I am also worried that because both Andrew and Tom are so insistent on making Carly MOH that I have somehow compromised our friendship in some way without knowing. Both have gone on-record with their girlfriends telling them both that I was the biggest threat to their relationships after I came out as bi with girl preference (they're apparently convinced that I am in love with both women and want to steal them), but both women have brushed it off as them being ridiculous and possessive. This upsets me quite a bit, as after 8 years of friendship with both Tom and Andrew, I am nothing more than a threat to their relationships? This might also be a contributing factor as to why I am feeling so apprehensive and indecisive about this entire situation.

Sorry for it being so long. I'm also feeling very anxious and stressed about this situation in general. It really does sound like some high school drama, doesn't it? Any thoughts?

tl;dr My best friend demoted me from MOH to wedding guest after facing heavy pressure from her groom. The newly chosen MOH doesn't want to be the MOH, so now groom, best man, and bride are asking me to ""reason with"" this girl so that she agrees. "
58,"Boyfriend doesnt want me to wear leggings


My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] have had many arguments about what I wear. This is so ridiculous but basically soon after we started dating (1 year and 1/2) he began feeling uncomfortable with me wearing leggings because he noticed other people staring. I thought this was unfair since we are at a university and everyone wears them. But he thinks we girls wear them for attention. That really hurts. However, we compromised and I now wear a flannel around my waist if i wear them. It bothers me because sometimes i want to wear them with a sweater to be comfortable and cute but I cant cause the flannel ruins it. I understand he wants exclusivity but honestly it upsets me deep down especially because he said if I do start wearing them, we will break up. What should I do or say? Was it right to compromise?

**TL;DR; : Boyfriend and I have compromised about covering when I wear leggings, and he has said we would break up if i decide i want to dress that way. What do you guys think?**.
"
59,"Husband (42) Hates Everything, Including Me (31)


I married my husband because he was kind. We have been married for 4 years and together for 5. I am American and he is French and we live in France. I have basically uprooted my entire life for him and have worked through the issues of living abroad with a therapist (big fan), support from friends, amd meditation. I am happy now - got promoted and like my job, have a stable income, good food and wine, good friends though not in France, garden.  However I have worked hard to get to this point and learned the hard way that happiness really is a choice we make.  

Husband does not get it. He has everything - supportive friends and family, steady job, nice home, health, not to mention a loving and sexy wife ;) . I have not and never will nag or prevent him from doing something like going on holiday with his friends or out for a drink. I'm smart, funny, patient, clean and cook, pay my way (I make more now so even pay more of my way), good lookin' and down to chill or adventure. 

Not to boast about my qualities, but I have to remind myself often because I have never received a compliment from my husband. Nor an apology when he points out my flaws and makes me upset for example. I only hear about my flaws - how much I smoke, snore, sleep or don't sleep, spend or don't spend, the length of my showers, drop water on the floor, little things I say, etc etc etc. 

Husband is constantly grumpy and miserable in my presence. He is no longer the kind man I fell in love with, and I find myself constantly on the defense and on edge because I'm quite isolated here and the only one who will stick up for myself. We argue occassionally like all couples but by the time we have talked it out husband always suggests divorce instead of apologizing. This leads to more stress and then I get dragged down to his level and depressed instead of moving on as a normal couple would. There is no stability. 

As I am in France if we divorce I would either a) be alone in a country that I'm not the biggest fan of though I like my job or b) have to move to another country and start over. Thinking about this makes me very, very stressed. 

Last fight he blamed me for making him miserable. He could not think of any concrete examples when I asked. Says he doesn't like who he has become (I agree). I refuse to take responsibility for his problems as I mentioned, I don't prevent him from doing anything, complain, etc. 

He has all the ingredients on the counter to be happy but he will not bake the happy cake and then he complains the cake tastes like shit. Complains about everything by the way, not just me. He is quite the party pooper and things that should be fun turn into a nightmare for no reason that I can tell. 

I have suggested therapy, couples or separate, but he has no interest in improving. It's always on me to improve and I'm over it - I like who I am. He was hospitalized 20 years ago for depression and his mother is hospitalized often for suicidal tendencies. I am not a therapist and don't want to take on that responsibility. I have told him he is free to leave because I want him to be happy but he is still here so I don't understand. 

Tldr: Husband is constantly miserable and blames me/our marriage for his grumpiness/misery. I want him to be happy  and kind as he was when we met. What can I do to help him realize only he can make himself happy?

60,"Two doctors have told me I've broken bones as a kid but my mom [50s F] denies it ever happening


So I've had a couple health problems that have required imaging. Both ended up with the doctor saying that it looked like a bone had been broken in the past (nose and wrist). My nose looks pretty off to the plain eye, anyway. I have a pretty obvious deviated septum and a rough bone right by that on my nose that kinda sticks out.

My parents weren't horrible growing up but I do remember some corporal punishment like spanking and slapping.

I asked my mom if I had ever broken one of those bones and she denied it ever happening.

I NEVER got in fights as a kid or anything like that. I've always been sort of laid back.

So now I'm left wondering if maybe I was abused to a larger extent as a kid and just don't remember it, or maybe I was just REALLY clumsy? Im not sure where to go from here.

Tl;dr: apparently broke several bones as a kid but my mom denies it ever happening. Suspicious or was I just clumsy?"
61,"I (28F) am frustrated/concerned with the way our cousin (3F) is being raised by her older parents (40sF/60sM)


Upfront, this is somewhat of a cathartic rant, but it has become more apparent after their stay with us for 2 weeks. 

Back story: This is my husband's aunt's child. His aunt married late in life and thus, had her daughter in her early 40's after several rounds of IVF. The 3-year-old is their only child together and will remain so. She is very much the center of their lives and has received much attention through gifts and praise. 

Granted, the parents are older and are very well off, so giving her everything is in the realm of possibility. Saying the daughter is spoiled in a complete understatement. She has her own iphone, every toy imaginable, a nanny and is given everything if asked for. In turn, this has made her into a entitled, demanding and unpleasant child to be around. To add insult to injury, the parents hardly discipline her and to cultivate ""good"" behavior, the mother buys her gifts everyday.

Fast forward to the present: her and the mother stay with us for 2 weeks for a family event. I have grown more and more impatient each day they stay. I see a total lack of control on her mother's part as she bends her will to every request, demand and temper tantrum. I see the constant negotiation going on between them and how manipulative the daughter is becoming.

I also have a 10-month-old and the daughter displays a lack of empathy towards her. She gets jealous (which is normal?) but at one point, screamed at the baby for ripping a coloring page. 

I suppose I'm reaching out because I want to grapple with my feelings. I know it's not the 3-year-old's fault since she's a product of her upbringing, but am I being too harsh? As much as I hate feeling this way, I can't help but feeling resentment towards her. I don't feel it's my place to say anything, so it's quite frustrating. How do I handle this situation?

tl;dr: Our cousin is being raised with lots of gifts and praise but little disciple. It's become apparent how much this has backfired since they have lived with us for the last 2 weeks. Not sure how to handle the situation. "
62,"My [39M] kids [10F, 6M] say they don’t like me.


\&gt; My \[39M\] kids \[10F, 6M\] say they don’t like me.

I’m not sure if this is a “parenting” issue or a “relationship” issue, but thought I’d start here as I think this issue definitely involves my wife as well.

I’m 39, my wife is 41, and we have two super great kids – 10 yo girl and 6 yo boy. They are healthy, do great in school, have some nice friends, we live in a nice neighborhood – life should be great. I work 40\+ hours a week, and my wife has been a stay\-at\-home Mom for 10 years and has obviously spent a lot more time with the kids and has bonded with them more just as a function of being there more.

But… my wife and I have had a strained relationship for quite a while \(about 2 years or so\) and I’m afraid that it is starting to rub off on the kids.

My wife and I have been to marriage counseling to improve our marriage but honestly not much has changed. I am by no means perfect and I know I haven’t been a perfect husband, but I am trying to improve and communicate more and to be more attentive. I have learned a lot from counseling and books and am trying to put that to work in my life.

My wife is also trying, but, from my perspective, quickly falls back into her old habits which include:

\- When we are having problems, she glares and is rude and in general just shuts down. I think that everyone, including the kids, pick up on this.

\- Undermining me in front of the kids \(not a unified front at all\).

\- Supports her Mom \(my MIL\) who also is rude to me and now the kids know that “Grandma doesn’t like Daddy”.

\- From my perspective, I’m the only discipliner between the two of us. My wife will ask the kids to do things 10 times \(literally\) and then give up and get frustrated. I will ask once and/or give a warning, and then punish them \(time out, take away computers, 10 minutes yard work with me, something\). I’m not a super mean dad or super militant, but I do set and enforce rules.

I have seen this strange repeating pattern where I will have some really fun one\-on\-one time with the kids \(or just me and both kids\), we have lots of fun and basically zero problems, but then they come home and tell Mommy that they didn’t have fun and it was horrible.

For example, this past weekend I took my son camping with some other dads and sons, we had a ton of fun, but then told his Mom he didn’t like it and he missed her and never wants to go again. I’m 100&amp;#37; sure he had fun – it’s obviously when kids are laughing and smiling and bike riding and having fun – a 6yo can’t fake me out on this. My wife doesn’t “approve” of this one\-on\-one time and I think my kids have picked up on it.

That’s just one example. It seems to happen all the time:

\- Daddy is driving you to school today. “Oh no please Mommy drive us.”

\- Daddy has to work late and won’t be home for dinner. “Yay!”

\- Where to sit at dinner? “Next to Mommy.”

\- Want to ride home with Mommy or Daddy? “Mommy.”

\- I missed you guys last night \(working late\), did you miss me? “No not really.”

\- I Go camping with Daddy? “Oh no I don’t want to.” \(Has fun.\) “Oh no it was horrible.”

\- I Big hugs for Mommy. None for Daddy. \(My wife also shows zero physical affection to me.\)

I really like my kids \(obviously\) and am proud of them and have a lot of fun with them, so it hurts, even though they are little kids, when they say things like “Yay dinner with no Daddy!”

So, and why I’m writing as I’m wondering if I’m trying to read to much into this, my kids love their Mom and are super close to her, so I think when they see Mommy is upset \(doesn’t like camping\) they don’t want to go against her and they say “oh no I didn’t have fun”.

So, I guess my question is: is this normal? Does anyone else have a similar relationship with their kids? Do I just suck it up and be the “Dad” and the “man” that has to enforce the rules and am seen as the bad guy or is this really messed up?

Tl;dr – My kids have said some hurtful things about how they don’t like me, even though I really try to be involved and a great Dad. Are my marital/parenting problems rubbing off on the kids?"
63,"My [25F] fiance [28 M] keeps applying for jobs in a city I don't want to move to, behind my back.


When my fiance and I first got together 4 years ago, he worked for a company that he loved and told me he wanted to live in our city the rest of his life. We dated for a year, moved in together, and right at our one year anniversary his company restructured and he was told he would be laid off in two months time. To make it worse, he had applied for a different position in the company and his boss chose to hire someone from outside instead of saving his job under the argument that the other candidate had more experience. 

He was extremely bitter about the situation, understandably. His industry is very spread out and there aren't a ton of opportunities to stay put, so unbeknownst to me he began applying for jobs across the country. I was on a work trip in Canada when he DM'd me on Twitter (no cell reception, but internet where I was) that he had accepted a job 1,200 miles away in Texas, he was sorry to tell me this way, and he hoped I would go with him. When I returned to the States, we had a massive argument about how he had assumed that I would be okay picking up my career and moving with him because I had mentioned that I would enjoy spending more time with his family, who were now only 60 miles away from his new job. My words were completely taken out of context and he was hurt that I wasn't 100% okay with moving across the country. We were not engaged at the time but I eventually told him that I saw a future with him and I would make the move. 

We spent ten months in the Houston area, traveling quite a bit and making a lot of great friends. It was great personally, but professionally I feel like I suffered because I wasn't able to get a job in my field. I don't regret the move, though. We also spent a lot of time with his sister and parents which was a gift that I never would have been able to get otherwise. After 10 months he hears that a position is opening up back in our original town with a different company, he applies, and gets it. So we move home. 

We've been here for two years. He goes back and forth with his love for this new company but he's the kind of person who is hard to satisfy, something is always wrong and he doesn't like his new boss. But we've settled here. We have a dog, we're getting married here in 12 months and recently I was approached by MY dream company about a great and very profitable career move. I've interviewed twice and applied at the local university to begin my Masters this fall, setting myself up for a long and prosperous potential career with this company. 

After my second interview, which was with HR, I was asked to fill out a personality questionnaire that asked questions like my learning style, leadership style, how long I've lived in the city and how long I planned to stay. When I mentioned this to him, he told me that he wouldn't be able to advance his career if he stays here much longer. He says his new boss is restricting his potential to grow in his industry and a co-worker, who is very accomplished, had mentioned that if you didn't ""make it"" by the time you turned 30, you would probably never move up to an industry leader. However, the company my fiance currently works for is very stable and offered him a substantial raise last month so he's currently making more than anyone we know here. 

We had a long discussion about plans for our future and he continuously stated that he really needs to leave for a larger company if he has any chance of being successful. I told him there was absolutely no way that I would even consider leaving before our wedding next year, and if I was to start my Masters program that anchors us here for at least a year after that. And even if we did move, I wanted to stay within a certain area so we would be close to family. The entire time we were in Texas, no one was able to visit because it was such a long way from them which caused a lot of loneliness and isolation for me.

I thought we were on the same page but the last few weeks I've seen him on his computer e-mailing his resume out to several companies back in the Texas area where I specifically stated that I do not want to move back to. We have had discussions about places I would be comfortable with that aren't quite so far, but he has not been reaching out to anyone in those cities. Only in Houston. Today was the third time I've seen him reaching out to a company and ask to be considered for job openings, even after he's told me that he is okay staying at least until the wedding. 

I know I should bring this up again but I feel like he will continue to go behind my back and reach out. He wants to be back in Houston, but I absolutely do not. He has mentioned several times that my wanting to stay here will hurt his career and ultimately our family if he isn't able to advance. He says reaching out is just hypothetical and he just wants to know IF he could get the job, not that he wants to take it, but I think that's unprofessional of him and I see no point in networking in a city that I'm so adamantly against. I feel betrayed and guilty that he places the blame on me for limiting his career. 

I feel especially feel upset because I have already made this life-altering move ONCE and he assumes (again) that I'm going to be okay with it again. 

A few factoids for what it's worth: 
-His mother is very toxic (his words, not mine) and raising children near her is very concerning to me. Classic definition of Raised by Narcissists. 
-I make more money than he does. 
-He has previously said that he would never be able to move to a specific city, say, if I was offered a job because his industry doesn't work like that. So it is implied that his career is more important than mine. 
-We previously had a discussion about where I was comfortable moving to and I gave him a list of 7 cities that we had connections in, so I'm not saying we must stay in our current town forever. I just don't want to be in Houston. 

How should I address this situation and is this something that could affect our marriage? 

TL/DR: My fiance keeps trying to move to a city I have no interest in living in, because he is unhappy with his current job. We have discussed that I don't want to move to this particular city, but he is still applying for jobs secretly. "
64,"My [45F] daughter [16F] was caught shoplifting and is now suffering consequences. I'm just here wondering when did things go wrong.


My daughter was caught shoplifting with one of her friends. She was stealing liquor and was caught by the security guard. She also resisted the arrest and was given 6 months probation, detention in school on Saturdays, was told to pay restitution and was ejected from the volley ball team. It is still unclear if she will lose a scholarship but it is possible.

She has a curfew and is not allowed to go out unless for the purposes of the penalties.

It's been one month and she's now behaving worse than she was before the incident. Talks back, throws stuff at her sister when they get into arguments, tries to get into fights with boys and girls who mention the whole thing, and other things.

She had been impulsive before but no signs of criminal behavior. She has been, for example, in fights in school, but all the time it's been clear that it was started by someone else and she reacted. Of course, her reactions were outrageous sometimes, others she was attacked first.

She still hasn't showed regret and just seems upset that she was caught.

I am just here sitting in my bed, wondering what happened? What went wrong? How did it get to this point? And, what are we supposed to do from now on?

**tl;dr:** Daughter was caught shoplifting with a friend. Has probation and was expelled from the volley ball team. I have no idea how things got to this point and wonder I should do from now on. Help?"
65,"Let my [27F] husband [28M] get a FWB, now he feels he cheated on me


Me and my husband (together 7, married 4) have always had a great relationship but I realise how one-sided sex was for him; he’s always been the ""giver"" if you get me since he’s a lot more experienced, getting me to orgasm has never been a problem but I find pleasuring him to be physically difficult.   
He’s quite large down there so even after ages of foreplay I can’t fully take him in, if he thrusts too fast it starts to hurt so he does it slowly, he’s always wanted to try deepthroat but no matter what my gag reflex is too strong, also having sex tends to leave me sore the next day which doesn’t help since his drive is so high. He always tells me it’s all right and he doesn’t mind but I know he’s unsatisfied with our sex life.

After a lot of discussion we decided that he should get a FWB, I’m not the jealous type and really it was me who suggested it. A friend got me in contact with a girl (who turned out to be a model of all things!) who was might be interested, we met up and agreed on the first time being a threesome, and my husband insisted we pay her. At night we got together on the bed and did the deed. I never realised how intense my husband was till now, they really went at it!  
He came like 5 times and just kept going with her, she was great too and incredibly sexy, did everything for him. After that night I was dropping her off and she said she wouldn’t mind doing it for free/being a FWB for us which I thought was wonderful!

Next day my husband comes up to me and apologises because he felt like he cheated on me bc he focused to much on her, I tell him it’s fine and that I wouldn’t mind her being regular, but he’s still upset at himself over it. I want him to get over this and enjoy himself more but I’m not sure how to go about it  
  
edt: For clarity, I don’t intend to open the relationship on both ends since I’m 100% happy, just his side.

**tl;dr**; Got my husband a FWB but now he feels like he cheated on me even though I’m completely okay with it"
66,"Boyfriend (25m) always needs to explain/teach me (24f)things.


Hey, posting from Mobile so sorry if paragraph breaks are wonky.

Me and bf have been together for 6-7ish years as we kinda naturally ended up together and never really officially started dating. Most of this has been great, we were best friends first and have many of the same hobbies. 

The past 2ish years I had been really busy with school and then finding a job so we didn't spend as much time together as I liked but we made it work. Now that Im settled into a job I've noticed something about bf.
 
He constantly has to explain or teach me things, which isn't always a bad thing, but he constant with it and is rather isitant. This can range from politics, science, my own emotions, how I play video games and why I'm constantly wrong.  Durring these lessons I can barely get a word in and I pretty much have to sit there and take it or I'm ""running away"".
 
I wouldn't mind this every so often cuz yeah sometimes I mess up and need the talk, or its atually interesting, but 90% of the time he's either telling me something he's already lecture me about earlier or retelling somthing I told him earlier. And the things I do ""wrong"" are usually small things that don't effect him. Like he dislikes that I'm not competitive when I play video games. Aparantly I'm some sort of fool for just wanting to play a game casually, but no all games must be played seriously or there's no point.  

It's come to the point we're I'm not even sure if he like me as a person anymore or he just thinks I'm dumb. I started to kinda keep a mental track of how negitive he is to me and is a good amount, I can't remember the last time he complemented me or said something nice.

I've confonted him about it and he says he want to see me become a better person and that's why he does it so I don't think he's being malicious. I've asked him to tone it down and maybe follow the 2 positive and a negitive rule , but nothing really changed as he ""brings it up when he sees it"" so it's my fault for being bad I guess?

I just want maybe some insight into how I can make him see how hurtful he is even though he means it from a good place?or is this just a personality thing that I have to get use to?

Tldr: bf like to teach me things I already know/trys to improve my life but comes off as an arse and it hurts me.
"
67,"I [28M] don't know what to do. I think I'm falling in love with my wife's best friend [27F]


Sorry for the title. Just to clarify, I'm a widower. 

Background on me and my wife. We've been together since college, this July would have marked our 8th year of being together and our 2nd year of marriage. She and myself were highly invested into nerd culture, and frequented a lot of conventions and watched every comic book movie.

My wife and her best friend[WBF] have known each other since childhood. She wasn't into nerd culture as much as me and my wife, but for my wife's, and her boyfriend's [WBFBF] sake, she tagged along on all our nerd adventures. Needless to say, us 4 hung out a lot and made a lot of fun memories together. One night after playing board games, my wife and [WBFBF] went to get some late night snacks...They never came back...They were both killed in an car accident after a drunk driver t-boned their car at an intersection.

It's been a while since then, due to our mutual loss, me and [WBF] frequently visited each other and consoled one another. Some nights, we should just sit in a room and cry till one of us fell asleep or went home. In some weird way, it brought us closer together, as before the accident, her and myself chatted occasionally. 

Last night, me and [WBF] went to see some movie about a scumbag and his walking rug. Halfway through the movie, either due to exhaustion or boredom [WBF] fell asleep on my shoulder. A wave of emotions rushed over me, I can't explain it, it was like my wife was next to me again, sleeping on the shoulder she always used to sleep on, fidgeting around to get more comfy. At that point I wasn't even watching the movie anymore. I caught myself and resisted multiple times trying to kiss [WBF]'s forehead(A reflex, I think). [WBF] eventually woke up before the movie ended, apologized, and finished the rest of movie awake.

After the movie ended, we had a short chat and parted ways. I got into my car and started my trip home, only to stop after a few blocks, pull over and cry. I never felt so guilty in my life. Are these feelings real? Am I only falling for her because of the familiarity of [WBF] to my wife? She was and still is my wife's best friend...Should I tell [WBF]? Should I stop contacting/hanging out with her to get away from these feelings? Am I just being lonely? So many questions running through my head.

The next day, I talked to my best friend, he told me that he wants me to be happy, but, could he couldn't possibly know what to do in this situation(What a useless person lol). 

I'm hoping some insightful internet strangers have some advice for me. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Am widower, hung out with wife's best friend before wife's death. Now, falling in love(I think) with her. Don't know what to do."
68,"My boyfriend [28 M] is embarrassed to be around me [25 F] when I talk about my past. He says it's trashy.


My boyfriend thinks it's trashy when I talk about my past, but I can't help the life I've lived, and I'm not about to lie to sugarcoat it. Let me give a few examples.

We were with our friends at the bar talking about what the riskiest things we've done were. The conversation turned to shoplifting, and I said that my sister and I had been shoplifting since we were small, because our dad let us, knowing we wouldn't get in real trouble, being little kids. I didn't shoplift anymore though.

To me, it seemed like a story relevant to the conversation, a lot of people had talked about doing something illegal. But later, my boyfriend said that whatt I'd said had been embarrassing, and he doesn't get how I can just talk about it like that.

---

Another time, the #metoo trend came up, at my work happy hour that I had invited my boyfriend to. A few people were saying it was worrying that it was starting to go too far, and I offered the opinion that people were lashing out because in the past, there was too little open discussion of the issue, and too little justice. And in any situation, someone who has felt backed into a corner for a long time, tends to lash out eventually.

I gave the example of how at my old job in high school, that I had when I was 16, a mid 20s man pressured two of his underage enployees into a threesome. It was swept under the rug, he was fired for a short while, then rehired within the year. And nobody spoke up because we all needed the money. At the time that didn't even feel too unusual to me, my mom and aunt experienced sketchy stuff at work and always had to keep their heads down to not get fired. And seeing that stuff go unchecked for so long, especially against loved ones, tends to make someone angry.

My boyfriend told me later that what I said was trashy, telling my coworkers about that story. 

----

One time, my boyfriend's friend was talking about how he'd fight a mugger off, and I said ""Look, I don't know if you're joking, but seriously never try that, it doesn't matter how fit you are, it's not gonna help against a knife of a gun. Like I've been mugged a few times, and really, it's just stuff."" 

The friend asked me where I was that I was mugged so much, and I said ""my hometown"". My boyfriend really quickly changed the subject, I could tell he was embarrassed of me.

---

I've got so many more examples, but in general it seems like my boyfriend hates when I talk about my life before I was 18 (When I got out of my dead end town and got to college) 

He thinks all my stories make me sound trashy, and I just can't help that, I'm not about to lie about my life because he's embarrassed of me.

How do I explain this to him so he gets it?

----

Tldr - My boyfriend thinks me talking about my life before college is trashy, and he's embarrassed to be around me when I do.

69,"[M17] was a psychiatrist hitting on me?


I was put into the hospital for xanax overdose and I was still under the influence of the drug. A psychiatrist (guy) came into my room and asked me some questions. 

He asked about my sexuality, I said I am gay. He then started asking what kind of porn i watch (hardcore or softcore), he then asked if i masturbate a lot, he asked if i was in a intimate relationship with a guy (in which i wasnt), he then asked if i wanted to be (i said no, but i actually do want to be in one), he then asked what I prefer in a guy (body type, hair, etc.)

These questions seemed very personal and i dont understand how it would correlate to anything. I was still intoxicated so i didnt think much of it. Was this guy hitting on me? Hes in his thirities if that matters.

TL;DR: a psychiatrist started asking me personal questions regarding my sexual activity and what porn i watch and how much i masturbate. Is he hitting on me? "
70,"Me [39F] with my husband [45M] 17 yrs married, he's in a dying industry but won't look for new opportunities


 Lurker here...

My husband, a nice man, good father, is in a dying industry \(think newspapers/freelance journalism\). His career and earning potential has been a struggle more than once in the last decade or our marriage. About five years ago, it got really bad where we did counseling because I was pulling 85&amp;#37; of the financial weight and being the person who did the majority of the child rearing, housecleaning, etc and I was fed up. He ended the lease on his office and now has an office through a relative where his bills were cut a lot so he was able to bring home more dollars even if he didn't get more work. I decided at that point to stay vs. leave him even though he made it clear at that time he had no interest in doing anything outside of his choice of career despite the industry drying up all around him. \(When he gets work, it pays well, like more than I earn\- but with only a few true jobs a month... it doesn't add up. Plus he can't just hold a regular job and then do this work on the side as it usually involves travel and that would interfere with a 'real' job with regular hours.\) I just couldn't justify leaving/breaking up the family because of money... you know the whole for richer/poorer line of the marriage vows when it's not like we were headed for the poorhouse.

But here we are five years later and he's bringing home even less money. \(like so far this year, the money he's brought in is less than minimum wage if he was working 40/hrs a week\) He does do more of the childcare now\- mainly school pick up and drop off and driving to sports and maintains our vehicles \(our cars are over 10yrs old\) and mows the lawn... But when he isn't working on an assignment I look around and can't figure out what he does all day\- the house and cars have plenty of projects he could do, but they sit undone and he claims he just can't get to them. I still do 90&amp;#37; of all the housework/meals, but the kids are older so there's less childcare at least.

I work 50\+hrs a week, I make good money and we aren't hurting... but I'm resentful that I have a 'partner' that doesn't pull anywhere close to his fair share in my opinion. I resent he has no retirement \(except mine\). I resent that he does who knows what all day, while I work my butt off, frequently very stressed due to the tough nature of my job, and don't feel supported in the meantime.

I haven't brought it up to him again \(been chewing on it in my head for a few months\) but I would love some suggestions on how to make it just not ALL about the money... He's certainly sensitive when I have mentioned it and gets frustrated that the efforts he makes/marketing etc don't lead to more money... but I feel that sometimes diverts away from the bottom line of him not making more money no matter what. We live well, but somewhat frugally \(I mean, we're not buying new vehicles, our house is mostly paid for, no credit card debt, we don't go to lots of movies/out to eat, but the boys are in sports and activities etc.\) I would like to take more vacations, save more than I currently do for retirement, get a new vehicle one of these days, just general simple goals in life stuff.

I mean, he's not happy \(exactly\) about the little $ he earns; he will appear to be stressed about a client not paying him in a timely fashion or a job falling through etc\- but he isn't inclined to do anything out of his comfort zone to earn more money\- especially if it means leaving what he's done for 20\+ years. Does it have to get down to talking about separating again and maybe actually going through with it, before he gets it through his head? I'm sick of taking care of him and this has been going on almost a decade now...

I feel like a shit for thinking about separating because he's a nice guy, everybody likes him, he's a decent dad but his lack of interest in earning money and lack of support otherwise... like if he isn't making money/working regularly there should be no projects undone around the house... I just don't feel like I have a partner.

I read through this and I realized I never mentioned that I love him. I do\- we have a good, stable life... but at the same time I feel too often like the mom \(or caretaker at least\) vs. a wife. I feel like maybe our relationship could get back on track if he would more actively share the burdens of married life.

**\*\*tl;dr\*\*:** Husband is resistant to changing careers, doesn't bring home much money or help out a lot around house as an alternate; I don't know what to do, but I'm resentful and looking for opinions on how to approach him"

So.... you were all right.

It's been a shitty ride. I had him over that night to discuss things.

There's a lot more to it.

We were getting a place together. He moved in and I was due to move in in a month. We were sort of going through a rough patch and trying to work it out. For whatever reason it was like a light switch in his head where he started pushing me away. Then blaming me for distance in our relationship.

We had a lot of talks during that time. Including a two hour conversation 3 days before he kissed his ex, where we discussed how we want this and how to move forward in our relationship, and I left him room to work things out in his head for 2 weeks.

I guess.... I probably should have broken up with him on the spot when I had him over to discuss all this. But I thought we could work through it. He was swearing he loved me, he wanted this. All that.

3 days later he was back to, ""I don't know what I want."" So I issued an ultimatum that we can work on it right here and now, go to therapy, if he could just show me *any* way that he was committed to this.

He didn't. I walked. I had to, really. 

A large chunk of my heart died inside over all this. I've lost a lot of my friends, because I don't want to slander his name and tell everyone what happened. I'm not invited to a memorial day bbq over it. I'm left scrambling to find a place to live. It's just all a really really shit situation.

He reached out over the weekend, telling me he wanted to keep in contact and see where things go. But I think it's best to just cut the cord in full.

He was my best friend. And I have no idea why he changed so quickly, when he had been asking me to live with him for months prior. It was like, ""please move in with me."" and telling me he was only doing it for me \(I never asked for it\) to 2 months later kissing his ex in public.

I've called a lot of therapists.

I'm not really okay though. My last boyfriend before this was *very* emotionally abusive. I thought I was past it \(it had been six years between him and this one\), but this brought up a lot of the same feelings. My self confidence is less than zero right now.

I think I took a lot of my own self respect for myself away in all this.... and I hate it.

**tl/dr: we broke up. I need therapy.**"
72,"Daughter [33F] wants to make family photo albums as a special gift, but all the pictures we have of my wife [58F] are terrible


My oldest daughter, over-planner extraordinaire, told me recently that she wants to make special family photo albums to give to her mother and I and her siblings for Christmas. My job was to dig up the pictures we have here at our house so she can pick some of the old ones to use.

I spent a couple of nice afternoons looking through old photos of family vacations, holidays, weddings, first days of school, graduations. It got me excited about my daughter's project and I really think her mom will love it, except for one thing.

My wife has always hated having her picture taken. She says she looks like a ghoul in photos, so she would only ever pose for one or two pictures, and only at the most important events. I turned up around 40 pictures of her, out of boxes of hundreds of pictures each. And for the first time, I realized that she's right... she does not photograph well at ALL. She's a very good-looking woman, always has been, but for some reason, she looks sort of washed-out and doughy in the pictures.The 'best' photos were all taken at weddings by professional photographers, four of them in total. If I'm being honest, even these ones aren't very flattering, but they're much better than the rest.

I can already foresee this causing problems. My daughter's plan is to go in chronological order in the albums, and she's planning to make them fairly long. I don't think these four photos of her mom are going to be enough for what she's trying to do.

My thought was to suggest to my daughter that she makes the album for her mother and I a little different- she can put whatever pictures she wants in the ones for her siblings, but leave out the ones of her mom in our copy. I mentioned this idea to one of our friends who brought over some more photos for my daughter to look through, and she said she thought that might hurt my daughter's feelings, that her mom wouldn't want to be included in her special project.

I can see her point, but on the other hand, I know my wife will not appreciate being immortalized for future generations of our family as a dumpy-looking woman who seemed to attend weddings and graduations for a living (I'm being serious, the only picture I can find that wasn't taken at some kind of formal event is her from the back, trying to make the cat wear a St. Patrick's day hat). She'll love the gift and effort that went into it no matter what, but I think she'll be more reluctant to show it to people if there's a bunch of bad pictures of herself in it.

So, what does the internet think? Should I suggest my daughter make a different album for my wife, or let her go ahead and do it her way?

73,"Me [27 F] with my co-workers [20s/30s F] feel terrible, but I'm totally going to have to screw them over


Any advice here would be appreciated! I feel like this is just a crappy situation in which I know what I need to do, but I dread having to do it.


I work as an admin at a large research institute. In my specific department, there are 4 (including myself) admins. In another department, one of the admins-- Amy-- is going on maternity leave in mid-July. Long story short, she works for a horrible group. The leadership there is uncommunicative, snide, unsupportive, and--quite frankly, they've made her job miserable these past few months. And she's 7 months pregnant.


That particular leadership (4-5 people I think) have decided that they will not hire another admin to temporarily replace Amy while she's out. Nor will they use one of our 'floater' admins to help cover. Instead, they will split her responsibilities among the 4 admins in my department (as well as 1-2 in a different department). The reasoning is that all of our bosses participate to some extent in one of the main projects which Amy supports.


To this end, Amy sent out an email yesterday, letting us know that we will be covering her tasks while she is away. We're having a meeting next week to divvy up the responsibilities. To be clear, Amy did not want to send this email. It's also worth pointing out that her managers were not included on this email, nor are they attending the meeting. Basically, they're making her do the footwork for their horrible idea.


I really like Amy. She's a great person and a fantastic admin. She's had my back several times when I needed someone to cover catering or escort a guest. And  I've done the same for her. I also really like and respect the other admins who will be at this meeting. They're all wonderful women who are amazing at what they do. We're all insanely busy 100% of the time, but we help each other when we can. 


Here's my issue (sorry for the ramble!). I CANNOT take on anymore work. I'm at 110% capacity with my own group. I'm happy to pick up a catering order once in a while, but that's about it. Not to mention, I'm pregnant and-- by the time Amy is out, I'll be almost 8 months pregnant. I really don't have the bandwidth for any more projects now and especially not 2 months from now.


My plan is to go to the meeting, but basically state firmly that I cannot take on any new projects. The management who arranged this whole situation is completely separate from my department, so I don't feel guilty saying no to them. BUT I do feel bad saying no to the other admins who got roped into this. If I push back and refuse to do this, I'm basically putting more work on the plate of someone else. I mean, I wasn't the one who made this decision, but I feel like it ultimately comes down on me and these other women.


What would you do here? I don't want to be resented by the other admins for pushing back, but I feel like I need to protect myself here (and, by extension, look out for the health of my baby). How should I navigate this in a professional and nice way, while still standing up for myself?


Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any tips/ suggestions!

74,"Lost my manhood 5 months ago, wondering how many ladies would date a man with no penis.


Already did a casual ama so i will keep it brief.
About 5 months ago i lost my penis to cancer after discovering a lump about a year ago. 

Obviously this has been extremely devastating and i am still recovering mentally from this incident. 

I have not spoken to many women with the intention of anything sexual since the penectomy, and am wondering how many straight women would want to be with me now that i dont have a penis and how to approach it.

75,"My [23f] boyfriend [23m] broke up with me over the phone on my birthday after revealing that he had been cheating on me


We had been together for 4 years. He's really smart, introverted, unique and artistic and very feminist so this is all surprising. The thing is, he's terrible at communication and very passive-aggressive (not defending him, just giving you an idea of what he's like). We had been drifting apart for a while and then he moved away for a couple of months where he met this girl who's in a band and is really cool. They're both really into music and art and so am I but i'm not really in the scene like they are. I've provided for him for years, he had no job and i paid every bill for our shared apartment, paid for food etc while he focused on his art. Anyway, he became obsessed with this girl pretty much instantly and on my birthday (last week) he dumped me over the phone. Yeah.

We've both stopped talking and I'm trying to just move on with my life. But this is really f-cked up isn't it? My friends are just saying ""oh no, that's awful"" but they don't seem that phased because they all really like him and think he's really cool.  I mean, everybody loves him because he's very talented and sensitive and kind, but he cheated, right? Ugh

tl;dr my (now ex) boyfriend cheated on me then dumped me over the phone, but i don't know how to feel because everybody loves him and won't hold him accountable for this one thing"
76,"My brother [M18] and I [F21] are so sick of the noise from my stepbrother [M5] at home and I'm not sure what to do about it


I can't deal with it, it's literally driving me insane. 

So the story is that my dad married my stepmother 9 months ago and through her we inherited a 5 yr old I'll nickname Henry. Now my brother [M18] and I both love both of them very dearly, for the most part they are gorgeous and we all get along well. However, after a little while of them moving in it became clear that there's a big issue with noise and clutter in the house because of, primarily, my stepbrother. 

He has an amount of behavioural problems but as far as I can tell, he's just kind of a noisy kid (no diagnosed issues). He is constantly making noise. If it's not him yelling it's him running through the house or making random animal noises or complaining at TOP VOLUME. He will also try to climb on people and bang himself about on the furniture. At meal times he constantly interrupts people and it really feels like no one can have a conversation when he's there a lot of the time because he will interrupt with a loud complaint or some random bullshit. He fake cries to his mother to get attention and to get out of doing things. The works.

My stepmother's been somewhat good about it and steps have been taken - for instance, he can only use noisy toys in his room and he has to use headphones when he's watching TV on his ipad, etc. However, he is pretty badly behaved around his mother as she has a softer, attachment parenting style of discipline with him. She basically won't lay down the law with him until he's gone absolutely batshit. She can parent him as she pleases and I'm not here to criticise it but it affects the rest of us because he just goes untethered until me my brother or my dad snap and tell him to stop. Being calm and reasonable with him does not seem to work. In addition to that, when she does discipline him her method is to VERY LOUDLY TELL HIM IT WAS NOT OK. So more yelling, yay. I'd estimate that there's someone raising their voice in one way or another at least every 2 minutes, usually more. All day.

As neither my brother nor I are able to move out for various, valid reasons, we need to figure out a way to cope with this. Before you suggest it, yes there's been sit down family meetings, multiple times in fact. We've been honest, and we've been mostly heard, but nothing has changed. My brother hides in his room after he gets home from school and I use noise cancelling headphones basically constantly. I've noticed it's affecting both of our relationships with our dad particularly as we've withdrawn from family life as a whole to get some peace. We've also been criticised by both my dad and stepmum for this, as they don't understand. 

I feel like I come home every day in a pretty good mood but by the time dinner time comes around I'm on edge and cranky - I'm usually pretty sound sensitive as it is and it seriously affects my mood. This in turn causes fights with other family members yada yada yada. 

I want to be able to participate in family life and sit in my living room without having to literally block my ears the whole time. Has anyone got any tips that we're missing? I'm kind of at my wit's end.

**TLDR: Inherited a 5yr old step brother who we love but who screams, yells, complains, and invades personal space almost constantly. I and my brother are being made out to be the bad guys because this annoys us, and it makes me not want to be home. How can we fix this?**"
77,"My [22F] parents [50sMF] want to buy me a huge present that I have a really good reason for not accepting. Now they are mad at me.


My parents really are good people and mean well, but they are very clueless sometimes. One thing they have been very clueless about is how to celebrate my ""heritage."" I was adopted when I was a baby, and they wanted me to be connected to my birth family's heritage and culture. This sounds great, except I was born in the US, and my biological mother also was. Her parents were born in another country, but they came to the US as young kids. So I don't think my connection to that country was really that strong to begin with. My parents never had me take any special interest in my biological fathers ancestry even though we know he's of Italian descent. My parents also never showed much interest in their own ancestry, it was only my brown half that got attention. My parents said I should be proud, but it really only made me feel singled out.

They also went about this in the wrong way. Everything they had me do felt like homework. They didn't even do it right, my biological mother had to call them up and tell them they were having me learn the wrong things. My ancestors were part of an ethnic minority, and my parents were having me learn things that didn't apply to me. I had actually tried to tell them this already, but they didn't believe me until my biological mother told them.

They backed off this a lot in recent years and I figured they decided they did what they could, and if I wasn't interested in any of this it was my choice. I thought they were over this.

I just graduated from college, and my parents said they had a huge gift for me. They handed me something small and said it wasn't the real gift, but it was something I would need. I opened it upside down and saw it was a travel guide, and I got really excited that my parents bought me a trip somewhere. I've wanted to visit the Netherlands for years, and I thought that could maybe be the gift.

I turned the book over, and guess what, it was for the country my maternal biological grandparents came from. I was shocked and didn't say anything, and my mom excitedly said they were paying for me to go on a three week trip there. I started crying, I didn't want to go there at all. My parents didn't understand why I was upset, and I reminded them that I wasn't interested in this, and I thought we had an understanding. They were completely confused and upset that I didn't want to go, like we had never had all these arguments before. 

It also turned out that the gift was just for me to go alone. It's not a family trip and I can't bring a friend. So I'd have to wander around alone in a place I don't want to be for three weeks. I talked to my biological mother, and she said that based on my personality and the things I liked to do, I probably wouldn't enjoy the trip. She said that if I did go, I should join an official group tour, because being an obviously foreign woman alone is not very safe. She also told me that doing the same trip length in Amsterdam could probably be done for cheaper, because the flight costs less and I wouldn't have to stay in a known name brand hotel for safety reasons.

My parents haven't actually put any money down for the trip because they wanted to make sure it worked with my schedule, so I told my parents this, hoping I could convince them to change the trip to somewhere else. They said it's not about the money and they wouldn't get me a different trip. The purpose is to explore my heritage and either I go on this trip, or nowhere. Whatever, I know they didn't have to get me anything at all, but it's the principle of the thing. After years of arguing, they just assumed I'd be okay with this and are still upset a week later that I turned it down. And they ignored my biological mother's advice. I think they got so wrapped up in the gesture of it that they didn't think at all.

This is the only serious issue I've had with my parents, but I feel like it's going to come back again if I don't end it once and for all. I don't want them trying to force language lessons on my own kids because my parents thing they're helping. How do I get through to them?

Tldr: parents want me to go on a terrible trip to experience my biological family's heritage and are upset that I won't go.

78,"Wife [40F] and I [39M] are burning out.


3 kids in (7,3,1) and we are toast. I've come to realize my partner is a hoarder, and might be depressed.. But it's impossible to address these issues because she will just fight with me relentlessly no matter how diplomatic i am. We have about 55 cloth shopping bags hanging behind our doors off of hooks, a storage unit filled with garbage, and more children's clothing than a family or 25 could use. Our entire space is stuffed to the brim with things we NEVER touch or use. 

She will spend the bulk of her time out shopping or going to return things to the store because she got the wrong size or there's a microscopic blemish or a pulled thread. She also doesn't drive so I am her personal taxi. This wouldn't be so bad if she didn't take forever to do things, I have spent probably over. 1000 hours sitting in our car with the kids crying or screaming waiting for her to do things. 

I have also trashed my masters degree and my career to make more time just to provide basic care for our children.

We have boxes and boxes of receipts and papers and recycling that she refuses to let me sort through saying it's something only she can handle. If I try to throw things our she will take them out and hide them in the house.

There is no reasoning with her. Any time issues are brought up she immediately flips it on me and says i need to budget my time better or take on more responsibility or what she's doing isn't so much and I should be able to handle it. 

I feel like I'm living in an asylum, I've started drinking heavily in the evenings and even during the day now when kids are at school while I'm trying to clean the house.

She also buys random objects constantly and then puts them away, large toys and junk mainly, or sets of dining chairs that we don't need. Recently it was a large inflatable floating dolphin raft for the kids, we live in the city and this thing is literally 20 feet square and uses a compressor to fill it.

She racked up $80,000.00 in purchases on our credit card since January. Now while we're not financially troubled I could definitely have seen that money put to better use... When confronted with this she will tell me it's not true and it was only $5k.. I show her the balance and she will yell at me and tell me it's because I'm over spending or she will change the subject and try to find something to point out that in doing wrong...

At this point I see no other option but to split, I'm honestly only staying together for our kids right now for i fear her unable to provide basic care for them if we were to separate. She has said that she would never allow me to have custody if we separated.

I'm crying while I write this, I love her and we have so much fun.... Sometimes. It used to be all the time.. Things have changed.

TL;dr  wife and i's relationship has slowly been degrading over the past few years, manifesting in bizarre behaviours (hoarding, avoidance, procrastination) leading to me now considering separation."
