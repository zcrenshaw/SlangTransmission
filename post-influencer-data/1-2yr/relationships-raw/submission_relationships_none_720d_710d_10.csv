1,"(Update) How do I (28/F) get my bf (29/M) to understand that I don't want to be her (26?/F) friend?


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6zbzyz/how_do_i_28f_get_my_bf_29m_to_understand_that_i/?st=j7v9ivrs&amp;sh=922926a8)

So it wasn't really popular and I didn't really respond in the thread but I did read all the responses. I appreciate the time people took to reply and give their advice, as well as the people who DM'd me and really help me figure out the situation.

So, to start off, I talked to Lee to really get down to whether or not he did sleep with Kim. He swore, again, that it never happened and he would have no reason to hide it if it did. I asked him if maybe Kim had a thing for him that he didn't know about and he thought about it and figured it could be true.

I told him again why I didn't want to be her friend and how I didn't like the way she treated me. He wasn't aware of how bad it was so I asked him to make a conscious effort to try and be more aware when we're hanging out together. (He's very aloof about a lot of things, makes me glad I made the first move in the relationship.)

So a week goes by and a couple of his buddies from work want to go out to dinner. We agree and when we show up Kim is there. She hugs Lee but then ignores me. I thought Lee missed it until he looked at me and gave me a raised eyebrow.

Dinner goes on and Kim is doing her usual thing of ignoring me, rolling her eyes when I talk or just rudely interrupting me. When she went to the bathroom Lee turned to me and said ""I definitely see it and I'm so sorry."" So that was really nice to hear.

As dinner was winding down one of Lee's coworkers gets up to make a toast. He goes on and on about Lee being such a hardworker and how they're going to miss him when he moves to the new branch. I was shocked so I just said ""what?!"" without realizing I said it aloud. Lee was just as shocked and told them that he hadn't taken the job and he didn't want the job. That's when Kim said that he was one of the top 3 picked to go down.

Lee. Was. Pissed. He got up to go get another drink and I went with him. When he found out that Kim put his name in the running he went to the higher ups and told them it was a mistake and that he was not interested. Which means Kim must have found out and talked the bosses into putting his name back in the running. We ended up leaving early and going home. I told him I'd support him if he wanted to go but he is very much against going. He now sees why I didn't want to be friends with her and why my assumptions about her were completely true.

He went back to work on Monday and asked to be moved to a new department that's not under Kim, he went to HR about Kim overstepping her boundaries and he's even thinking about finding a new job where he doesn't have to interact with her.

I'm so glad he finally saw what I saw and he's completely done with Kim. I'm excited to see how losing her will help improve our relationship in the future and he promises to be more aware of how his friends treat me and to respect my wishes/not force a friendship on me if I don't want it. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Had a serious sit down talk with Lee, he promised to be more aware/alert when Kim was around, went to dinner with coworkers and Kim, he saw how rude she was and he saw how she's manipulative on a different level. Lee is cutting Kim out and trying to find a new position/job so he doesn't have to see her again."

6,"Me (31F) with acquaintance (72M) is it appropriate to go to his funeral?


I've been taking the same train to work for 6 years. There was an older Hispanic man I always saw on my route to work, he speaks nearly no English, and my Spanish is awful but for whatever reason we began saying hi to each other.

Because I was always on my way to work I never really got to know him too well. But 5 days a week for 6 years he would try his best English and I would do my best Spanish and we'd say hi, how are you, talk about the weather or recent holiday etc.

Obviously we weren't super close and I didn't even know his name until recently. But he always got my day off to a good start and I always missed him on the days he wasn't there. One time it was very hot and I collapsed coming out of the station and he bought me a water and called me a cab. I will really miss our morning greetings.

Well he wasn't around for 2 weeks, which is the longest he's ever been gone so I went inside the coffee shop he's always in front of and asked about him and they told me he passed away. Apparently he had been very sick and just passed over the weekend. They're holding his funeral tomorrow and I think I'd like to go. 

None of his friends and family are going to know who the fuck I am, so I'm not sure if it's appropriate. I don't want to be a distraction on their day of remembrance. I also worry because the service is in a Spanish language church in the Hispanic neighborhood and It's very likely **someone** will speak English, but I worry I won't be able to explain who I am and what this old man meant to me. 

I guess I selfishly want to say goodbye too, but I would also love to be able to tell them what a kind and sweet man he was to me so if anyone knows a relatively good translation site I could use, I though if I go I'd maybe bring a card? 

I guess I just want to know if any of this is okay or if I'm intruding?

**Tl;dr - acquaintance passed away, none of his friends and family know me, is it appropriate to go to the funeral or is it intruding?**"

10,"Me [30 F] with my fiance [34 M] , 3 years together, having problems with his best friend (29 F) because she screwed me and made a mess


All in I have a great and caring fiance. I was also very close friend to his best friend, who is female (which never bothered me). I am not jealous of her and as innocent as it seems - I know there is no romantic stuff going on between two of them, I feel the need to clarify this, to avoid confusion. Since we were close, few months ago I've asked her to go to a trip with me that was supposed to be recently ago, just two girls,  I would pay for everything and she agreed. I bought plane tickets and all. Then, less than a week from a trip, she wanted to talk to me alone and told me that she cannot be a good friend with me, because it is awkward to be friends with both me and my fiance.  

I was surprised, because for all these years it worked pretty well, I knew the two of them are closer friends than her and me, and it didn't bother me at all. And she sad some nasty stuff about me, how I've changed since I've gotten a nice job and I'm all being posh so that she doesn't feel connected to me (she's unemployed, and I have a job I like and studies but very low salary that makes me rent a room in shared premises and share bathroom and kitchen with bunch of people,  so there is no chance this could be even close to truth , me being posh I mean.) 

But I struggled for months to save money for that trip... And when she told me all that, she told me she doesn't want to go with me. I was shocked and had no idea what to do. I couldn't sell the ticket, I tried giving it away (person would have to pay the ""passenger change"" fee), but no one was interested as it was short time until flight. I was hurt as hell, to lose a really good friend in just one day, for no reason I can think of and of course the tension that was now created in my relationship - because my fiance is still best friends with her and she is not willing to be good with me. 

My biggest problem is, that my fiance is telling me to get over it and be ok with her, and ok with him being good with her, but I believe it's a little disrespectful. I mean, she did made a huge mess, other friends of mine who respect her more than me since they know her for years also stopped talking to me, who knows what they heard,  I lost money that I can't afford to loose and she made me feel like a fool. How can I get over that so easily? She never even apologized for canceling her trip and doing that to me. She doesn't feel bad about it, she told it herself to my fiance. 

And I got in a fight with my fiance because he is mad at me for not getting over it and me not pretending that all is fine and be in her company when she is hanging around with him. I wished he would at least tell her how unfair she was to me, or I have no idea, but at least do something so she doesn't think she can do what she wants and get away with it. I don't want him to loose her as a friend, to be clear, I want a bit respect and for him not to put the blame on me, which he does now. He even stopped talking to me yesterday because I  ""can't get over it"". Now I'm distressed, I don't want to ""forgive"" and play cool with her since she doesn't feel bad (her words) and didn't apologize, that is really not cool. If she showed me that she is sorry and apologized  I would get over it, but I don't want to be a fool and let people walk over me. I don't know how my fiance doesn't understand that  and how to make it clear, because words didn't work. He is mad as hell at me for not letting it go and being cool with her. Any advice?:/

Im a SAHM. My partner is FIFO and is home about 5 days a month. I have a boy who is eight, he is on the spectrum and has adhd. 
I would LOVE to work but school hours (they are like hens teeth) as my DS hates after school care as its too long a day for him!

Soooo that being said. I have a friend sarah. Who works part time. Who asks me to have her kids all the time. She regularly drops them to my home in the mornings so she doesnt have to pay for before school care. 

Great example this thursday i have go pick up her two children.  Feed them dinner. Take one to sport. And she will pick them up at 8pm. 
I dont mind doing this. 

BUT i just called sarah to ask if she could pick up DS on Friday as i have a government appointment and im not sure id get to school pickup on time and she told me - to change the appointment!
She said. Im flabbergasted - you dont work. You can make the appointment at another time! 

All im asking is that she pick up my son and drop him home on her way home (its on the way) as im sure ill be home by that stage. 

Im hurt. I feel like everything i do alot for her and her children and she kinda insulted me and wont help me out this one time ive asked. And i actually 

Im over reacting right????

We've been together less than two months. Three days ago we talked about some really emotionally charged stuff. Afterwards I was still feeling really jumpy and I was crying, so as I was leaving I stopped to clear my head. I didn't notice that my boyfriend followed me out, and when he grabbed my waist to hug me from behind it startled me really badly and I panicked. I stomped on his foot and kicked him in the shin before I registered that it wasn't a stranger grabbing me. 

He was surprised, but he's not the type of person who'll show that they're hurting or lose their head when they're attacked. I apologized a lot, and he said it was fine  and don't worry about it. I  felt awful but I had to go home. When I got home I realized I was wearing my steel-toe work boots and I felt even worse, but he'd said not to worry so I tried to put it out of my head.

The next morning when I was at his house I noticed a dried bloody splotch on the floor. I asked him about it and he tried to brush it off, but eventually I got him to tell me the truth. He'd been barefoot, and the treads on my boot scratched his foot up really badly, on top of the bruising, and he actually had to go to a clinic after I'd left to get a couple stitches put in. He'd cleaned up most of the mess but missed a spot. I was horrified, and I promised him I'd pay for the bill, but he again told me not to worry about it and that it was fine and his fault for startling me anyway.

His last relationship ended a few years ago, with a woman who was really abusive. I don't know many details, but I know she used to hurt him a lot, and that he felt it was ""right"" for him to get hurt like that. I keep thinking I'm just like her, even though I know that's stupid to think. He's also very stoic and tough, and protective. He'd never admit he was hurting because he wouldn't want me to feel bad. Since the incident, I've caught him wincing and limping when he thinks I'm not looking, but every time I mention it he says it doesn't hurt or that it's fine. Even though he's healing and there was no permanent damage, I just feel worse and worse.

31,"My [21f] roommate [21f] complains when I bring a girl back but doesn't mind when I bring a guy back. I'm bisexual so this is a huge problem.


I've been sharing a room with Bella since the start of my new school year. I moved into her place. She was looking for a Roomie, and I was looking for a new place close to classes. 

We went through 'boundaries' and 'rules' when I first came here. We discussed bringing people back. She said it's fine to bring someone back every other weekend. So one weekend she wanted no one over, the next weekend she didn't mind who came over and she would also bring back guys and friends. I agreed that this was a good deal, because it would be nice to have every other weekend just to be quiet and chill.

I didn't tell her my sexuality because I didn't think it mattered. But maybe it did because of the problem I'm having now.

At first, I was seeing and sleeping with men, as I was dating this dude. We broke up not long after I moved in and after i did have casual sex with this one guy I met in class. Bella was fine with this. She too, would bring people back. Had loud sex, and whatever...

But two months ago, I met a girl and we hit it off immediately. I brought her to my place, Bella was in her room with someone too. I didn't see Bella that night but me and this girl Molly came out of the room the next morning, and I could instantly tell Bella was tense and kind of cold towards us. 

This happened every time I had molly over. Bella then confronted me and told me that she ""has had enough of all the people I'm bringing over"" I asked her why? And that she brings more people than I bring over. She didn't say anything and walked away.

I brought a guy who was just a friend around and BELLA was fine with me and him. So I kind of noticed it was just towards a girl that I brought over. 

I questioned whether or not Bella might have knew ""Molly"" and that could be the reason she didn't like her. But they don't know each other.

I confronted Bella and she said she's just ""uncomfortable"" and it makes her feel weird when she sees me with a girl. I have given Bella the silent treatment since she told me this yesterday. I do not want to see her. She's just disrespectful of who I am and I'm quite upset.

What do I do? I can't find a new place because all rooms are booked up now (I had a look) and I can't live far away from classes because they start early and there's no way I can be late for them. Also I don't want to just leave my place because of who I am. I could stop bringing people over but that makes me angry as it's my place too and Bella gets to bring who she wants back. 

Any ideas?

Tldr : roommate doesn't like me bringing girls over. I don't know what to do. "
32,"My girlfriend[27F] cheated on me, so I[25M] kicked her out, and now she won't stop bothering me or our group of friends.


Title should be pretty straight forward, but let me expand on some stuff.  

I met my girlfriend, now ex-girlfriend obviously, Briana through mutual friends around four years ago.  She moved to town and almost immediately ingratiated herself with the group, and everyone got along and things were peachy-keen.  I was dating someone at the time of meeting her, so I didn't see her as anything other than a potential friend, and everyone in the group got along swimmingly.  She dated another person from the group(Joan[28F]) after she got settled into town and when they split up, there was no drama or any bad vibes with them, so everyone kept hanging out.  We're all pretty relaxed, and she was just a cool chick who fit together with all of us so well.  

So, a couple years go by, and Joan and I've moved in with one another(still living together).  It's nothing romantic, I simply got a job where I traveled a lot, so it seemed better than having an empty apartment I overpay for.  I was still dating the girl I mentioned before, but we break up due to me travelling a lot, so I'm now single and Briana and I start talking more and more.  Finally, a year ago, after I'm back in town with a more stable non-travelling position, we start hooking up and eventually start dating.  Things are awesome, and everyone in the group are still great friends, Joan didn't mind which was cool.  Like I said before, we're all pretty relaxed people.  

Now before I go any further, I'd like to mention something I bring up with anyone I'm about to date.  I tell them that I don't deal with cheating or any type of drama when it comes to relationships.  So if they end up crushing on someone or anything similar where they might stray, I'm fine if they just tell me about it and I'd be cool with taking a break or break-up altogether so they can figure things out.  This is just how I've been since I started dating, never said anything out loud to anyone until during college, and before you ask, no I don't do this because I've been cheated on or hurt before.  It's just who I am is why I do this, it simplifies things for me. I told all that to Bri and she understood where I was coming from and was cool with my way of thinking. 

Anyways, about seven months go by and Bri needs a place to stay. Her apartment building was sold and they paid their tenants to move out by a certain date.  We're doing great by the way, so she asks Joan and I if it would be cool to move in until she can find an affordable place.  Joan was cool with it so I agreed and got her all moved into my room of the apartment.  She only brought the stuff she used on a daily basis, putting the majority of her things into storage, I had plenty of room for all of her things so it wasn't a bother for me, and she hung out with Joan and I ton before all this so her being around more wasn't all that different. The only thing that changed was that I started paying 2/3's while Joan paid a 1/3, it wasn't a big deal, plus it kept Bri from having to be put on the lease, and keeping things simple.  She paid me back by buying groceries or paying for dinner more than usual.  I never asked her to, she just did, like I said she was just a cool ass chick so we never really had any problems with one another.  

It's been about five months since Bri moved in with Joan and I, and we're all still getting along together.  I've been working long ass hours/late nights for about a month, but Bri and I still got to hang out a ton since our schedules just seemed to align together.  She would usually come meet me at work if I had to work after midnight, and we'd go walk to the pub and get a drink and some food before walking home.  So two Saturdays ago around 11, I get a text from Joan to come home right away, all in caps, with like a bajillion exclamation points.  So I was pretty freaked thinking her or Bri was hurt or in trouble so I started calling them with both going straight to voicemail freaking me out even more.  

I get the apartment building and see Joan outside looking pissed off, just telling me to go inside.  So I do and when I stepped inside I could hear my bed creaking, which right away told me what was going on.  I wasn't pissed, sad, or anything really, so I took my time and got a drink to figure out how to handle things.  I see her purse on the couch, so I figured it would go smoother if I did things while she was ""distracted.""  I opened her purse and got back my spare set of car keys, and the house key we gave her when she moved in.  I also took out some other things she had of mine in there just to make sure she didn't mistakenly take it as hers.  So after going through her purse(I never do this btw, it felt weird going through a girls purse when not asked) I get up the nerve to go in.  When I open the door I see both of their shocked faces and then them trying to get their clothes back on, with Bri already trying to apologize and tell me an excuse.  It's really strange remembering it all now, anyways I raise my voice just to make sure they can both hear me.  I tell the guy to grab his clothes and whatever else he brought and just leave so I can talk with my girl, he scurries out pretty quick as Joan comes back into the apartment.  Joan is still fuming, so she just goes into her room and locks the door to steer clear of us.  Once Bri gets her clothes on I asked her to come have a walk with me as we talk so we don't bother Joan.  

When we get to the street she seemed to have calmed down a bit, so I asked her when it all started.  She said it was going on for a month, with that being the only time in the apartment, usually going to see him while I was at work.  Asked her why she didn't tell me, she told me it just happened and didn't have time to tell me beforehand so she just kept it all a secret.  After her trying to make some excuses I told her she can stay at a hotel for the night since I didn't wanna see her, my mind was already made up, but I felt it would go better if I waited until the daylight to break up and spare me the hassle of bugging people late at night.  Anyways, I saw her to a hotel and waited for her to get a room to make sure she had a place to sleep.  We part ways and when I get back I literally pack up everything of hers, even the groceries she just bought.  I meet up with her for breakfast at the hotel, I gave the front desk her stuff to hold for her before meeting up.  We had some small talk as we get coffee, with the occasional apology and excuse from her here and there.  I finally get to the point and break up, reiterating my stand on not wanting to deal with drama, and that all her stuff was waiting for her at the front desk.  She flashed this face of pure anger and crazy before she started angrily whispering at me all the reasons why I can't do this to her.  After about five minutes I've had enough and it's getting to the point where she's asking simple questions and self answering them to seem in the right in what she did.  I excuse myself and tell her I don't mind still being friends so as to not ruin the group dynamic we all have, and just get out of there before a scene ensues.  

We're getting close to the end, so just hang on a bit longer, sorry for the book. :/  Later that night is where the real problems start.  I get back from work and Joan tells me that Bri came by trying to get in, screaming outside the door to let her in because she was on the lease and this and that. Basically it's all bullshit and empty threats to call the police and have us arrested.  It all sounds so silly now, but it freaked Joan out.  She's a quiet shy girl, so she just didn't respond to the knocking or anything and refused to associate with Bri since.  Then we both get a text from the married couple of the group asking us what was going on with Bri.  They had apparently agreed to let her crash with them so she didn't have to stay in a hotel until she finds a new place, but the kicker is she told them I just flat out kicked her out, not even mentioning her cheating on me and such.  So we tell them everything and they're shocked she would even do something like that, but I explained to them I had no hard feelings and didn't mind us all still staying friends.  A few days go by and Bri has been killing my phone with constant texts and calls trying to get me let her move back in and date, so on and so forth, Joan blocked her after day one.  I just keep telling her the same thing I told her before, all of it through text, as I wouldn't answer her calls.  Another day goes by and Joan tells me our married friends found out some interesting things about Bri.  

Bri told them she had a mound of credit card debt before she moved in with Joan and I.  We asked what happened to the money her apartment building gave her when they sold the place, apparently she didn't get as much as she said she did, and used the little she got to pay for only half of one of her cards.  So she had a fair amount of debt and no savings when she moved in.  They also said she quit her job a few months back rather than letting them fire her, they don't know why, but guessed that it was due to her calling off too much.  So for around three months she's been without a job not mentioning anything to Joan or I, racking up more and more credit card debt trying to act like she had a job.  They found all this out after a night of heavy drinking, and when they woke up Joan had apparently left to go and try to stay with some other friends of the group.  Another few days go by and that friend asked her to leave since she wouldn't stop complaining about everyone.  She's apparently back to living in a hotel, supposedly with her credit card(facepalm), but she's been hounding every last one of us even going to all of our places of work and homes to try to talk things through and get them to get me to forgive her and what not.  

It's been about a week of her nonstop harassing all of us, so we all finally decided to just give up trying to stay her friend and started that gray rock thing people do to deal with psychopaths.  However, it's not working and she keeps upping the crazy.  I checked my dash cam yesterday and it has some video of her periodically checking my car to see if it's open and some of it turning on as she stands outside my building.  I'm basically wanting to know if anyone has a better way to deal with this situation?  We're all very reluctant to get the authorities involved until it's the absolute last option left.  So please don't suggest any solution that relies upon their intervention just yet, if it does come to that we all know how to handle it, it's just too troublesome to consider at the moment.  

Sorry again for the book.  I figured I'd try to get all the information out now rather than just reply to a bunch of people.  Thanks for reading if you took the time.  Cheers!!  

EDIT1: I realize most of this information isn't relevant, but it helped me to type it all out and clear my head a bit.  

EDIT2: Thanks for all the response, I'll take a little of everything and our group'll figure something out.  Might make an update post later on in the week if something changes or we can reach a resolution.  

TL;DR -- My girlfriend cheated on me after telling her I wouldn't deal with drama in relationships, so I kicked her out of the apartment and now she won't stop harassing me and our friends trying to let me to move back and date her again.  We tried the gray rock technique and it didn't work, so we're looking for solutions to deal with her that don't involve the police.  Please and thank you for any suggestions that could work."

35,"UPDATE:My sister [18.5/F] is lying to our parents [50/F/53/M] about why she wants to drop out of college, but I [16/F] know the truth


[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72ovby/my_sister_185f_is_lying_to_our_parents_50f53m/)

I decided to post an update, sort of as a thank you to everyone who offered up their help and personal stories. I went through every comment, and every PM you guys sent, and while I couldn’t reply to them all, I wish I could’ve. Really and truly, thank you. Special shoutouts to u/pugtickler , /u/thet0pbanana , /u/hairlikemerida , /u/agender_agenda , /u/fantomah , /u/StarFaerie and /u/MIT_Junior. You guys had some really insightful and wonderful comments, and it made me feel a lot more sure. I even shared them with my sister.


As for the update, I figured I’d start with something kind of related but not really- my sister’s boyfriend, since there were questions and comments about him. They’ve been together since their freshman year of high school, and have been best friends since kindergarten. He’s a fashion and textile studies major at FIT, and has made all of her pageant, prom, and homecoming dresses for the last few years. They’re like those rabbits and dogs that become best friends- very unlikely, but so perfect together.


Also, about my sister’s need to be successful. When she was in first grade, she was in a serious car accident, and had bad anxiety afterwards. Her therapist suggested she have a little less time to think, just so she wouldn’t have so much time to brew up anxiety attacks. She was always a really bright kid, so our parents got her started with workbooks, then just built a curriculum to supplement her schoolwork. Around middle school, she started to mellow out and decided to get medicated, and ever since then has done really well, but just got a lot of satisfaction from doing extra work, and working hard. Her last anxiety attack was about two years ago, when we were cut off on an interstate. Other than that, she’s done very well, and has kept everything managed incredibly well.


Now, the heart of the update. Yesterday, I told my sister what I knew, and she was a little pissed off at me. I was called a snoop, then told I had “no right” to know the stuff I know. Finally, she chilled out a little, and I told her that I didn’t care if she dropped out, I just wanted her to stop being a prick. I got a sibling punch for that one, but I convinced my sister to read the comments of the post. She felt a little shitty reading some of them, but others were actually really helpful. We had a little chat, wrestled a little bit, and she asked if I had any weed (answer: no.) At that point, she was done with the conversation, and I went off to talk to my parents.


I was fairly vague about it, and just asked them to talk to my sister, because she had things to say. My mom told me that unless my sister was going to level with them and be respectful, then she could go to hell. That was a little harsh, and I told her so, then said that my sister was probably a little more mellow, and actually wanted to talk to them. My dad said they’d have a talk, and I decided to go for a walk until they were done (caught some sick Pokemon by my house, if anyone was curious.)


When I got home, my mom made Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for dinner (she’s a nutritionist, so this was kind of wild), and we said grace for the first time in years. My mom said that my sister won’t be going back for the rest of the semester, and when they get closer to spring, they’ll think about sending her back. Until then, she’s going to be staying home and working as  a receptionist at my dad’s office. In more recent plans, I’m taking the rest of the week off from school, and we’re going to do “family things.” On Sunday, she’s going up to New York to visit her boyfriend. After this, she might go abroad for a few weeks, maybe switch and go to community college. We’re not sure yet. It’s going to get figured out.


Today, we played laser tag and went rafting down a river nearby our house. I won at laser tag, and my sister rowed the entire time as a punishment. My parents mellowed out, and agreed to put everything back in her room, but not yet in her account. I asked my sister if she had anything to say, and this was her response: “I’m going to smoke, then I’m going to sleep, then I’m going to do something really cool- even though I’m not sure if I know what it is yet.”


TL;DR: My sister is chill, my parents are chill, and my sister is dropping out until further notice. "

37,"Me [30M] with my girlfriend[44F] of 7 years. I want to break-up because of compatibility issues, she's not 'allowing' me to.


It's always been an unconventional relationship. We met while I was working at the same place as her. We started having sex because we were both single and horny and were in the right place at the right time. For about two years we were what would be called FWBs. 
  
Feelings came really late. And when they did come we moved at lightning speed- I love yous, moving in together, joint accounts, the whole shebang. All of that happened in like an 8 month period. 

It's been almost 5 years since then, and though it's a fulfilling and fantastic relationship in most aspects, we've been struggling with one fundamental problem. Kids.

When we first formalised our relationship, we talked about marriage and kids. She was indifferent towards marriage and didn't want kids. I agreed with her 100%. I didn't have a lot of respect for marriage and was more than happy to not have kids. 

But now, she still has the same views and unfortunately I don't feel the same way anymore. Like I can see some benefits of marriage both as an institution/tradition and as a practical thing. But most importantly I want kids. I really really do. 

I tried talking to her about it a couple of months back and she was dumbfounded and then angry, she started shouting at me about how I was being an idiot and trying to destroy a stable life and relationship by thinking the way I was thinking. Part of it was because I admitted that seeing most of my close friends getting married and having kids made me think about it a lot more. SHe thought I was being a naive child who was getting peer-pressured like a teenager. It's not that. I don't feel any sort of pressure seeing my friends becoming husbands/wives/fathers/mothers, but what I do see are the changes in their personalities and the way they live life. Every single change has been for the better. They've all become better people, yes they're more tired and busy and stressed with responsibilities. But they are less cynical, they are kinder, more empathetic, and really 'fulfilled'.

She told me that she had the same phase in her 30s and that I'll get over it soon enough and I shouldn't fuck up a good thing. But I don't know. I hate that I don't even have the option if I stay with her. 

I really do love my life with her, it's got it's ups and downs but there have been way more ups than downs. So leaving her over the kids thing may not be the smartest thing to do. 

But... I feel like there is this major hole in the heart of our relationship now. Leaving her would really hurt, emotionally and practically. But since there is no compromise to be had, if I want to be a father I have to leave her. 

She told me that if I leave over this, then she'll hound me until I have my head screwed back on and we can go back to normal. So basically she isn't allowing me to break up with her over this.

What do you folks think? Am I being naive/peer-pressured? Is this desire for kids just a phase? Should I destroy this relationship over something like this?

P.S.- The fantasy future kids can be adopted/fostered/IVF/Don't care. All I'm seeking is a parental relationship with a child I can call my own. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I want to have kids, she doesn't. She thinks I'm in a phase that I'll get over and if I try to break up she won't let me. Am I being an Idiot?"

39,"My [23M] parents are divorced. Dad [52M] wants to leave Mom [63F] to fend for herself this Christmas, alone and with no one to spend it with.


After more than two decades together, my parents split up a few years ago. It wasn't mutual, but it was a long time coming and I totally support my dad's decision. 

For backstory, my mom's seriously mentally ill, and old age is compounding her problems. She's been in and out of facilities for years and doesn't do well at all on her own. Her side of the family is extremely toxic and abusive (the reason for some of her issues) and she's rightfully estranged from them so, despite the split, Mom still spends Christmas at my grandmother's (on my dad's side) house with the rest of us - her, my siblings, all of my immediate family. Grandma says she's still family, and still welcome. 

The problem is that my dad's got himself a serious girlfriend and he wants to bring HER to our usual family Christmas this year, leaving my mom to fend for herself. :(

I get his reasoning, in a way - Mom's still not over him, and has no real filter. Says what she thinks, even if it's inflammatory or inappropriate. Seeing them together romantically might even be more than she's able to handle emotionally, and nobody wants family drama. 

But what is the alternative? She's just moved in to a group home with three other people, is she supposed to spend Christmas alone with strangers? She lives a good three hours away from my grandma's house by car and I don't drive, so there's no way for me to spend the day with both her and the rest of my family.

My mom's been through hell this year, and I can't stand the thought of her alone on Christmas. What can I even do in this situation? If I decide to give up family Christmas to spend it with her instead, I know I'll be the only one doing so.

41,"Am I wrong to be offended he's using getting fit as a condition if proposing? [25M/28F]


I need a second opinion, because I'm not sure if my pride is getting in the way of me seeing the situation clearly. 


We've been together almost 5 years, living together almost the majority of that. Joint finance, own a house/vehicles. Have a pretty solid life built together. Have our minor arguments here and there but nothing too serious. 


I've been wondering about the next step of our relationship and I brought it up to my SO to talk about. He's not a big talker about the future and avoids the talk typically. However I brought up that I'm late 20’s and almost 5 years into this relationship. I don't want to be led on if we don't want the same things (ie. Marriage and children)


He replied that while yes, he wants both those things with me, he doesn't see himself proposing until I've become more fit. My weight is something I've struggled with over the years since I was pretty much a teenager. I'm now at more of a “normal” weight, although a bit bigger than when we first started dating. I've recently put on about 10 pounds because of a bad injury and I'm now able to start working out again. As a side note, he's put on some weight as well. Not fat, but more filled out. He's been attempting to work out so that he will be more fit and I'll join. However I think he looks fine. He's a good size for his height. 


I'm not upset that he wants me to be more fit, because I agree and it's something that I want as well. What I'm upset about is that he is using being fit as a condition of marriage. That if I stay the same, we will simply continue dating. He says that he wants to spend his life with me and that he isn't going to break up with me but he really wants to see me more fit.  Marriage is more important to me than him, he would be okay with staying common law for the rest of our lives. 


I'm confused about how to feel because I know I need to get into better shape, however, when (and if) he proposes I'll just forever be wondering if I've met his “standard*. What if I gain a few pounds back, what if I don't lose the weight right away post child birth? There is so many what if’s. He doesn't see the issue in using being fit as a condition of marriage. 


I don't want to make a bad decision by breaking up with him if I'm simply over reacting. He's my best friend and I really enjoy our life together.

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6xy8lv/my_16f_brother_18m_stole_700_from_me/)

Summary of my original post: My brother stole $700 from me to buy a new phone, and told my parents my secret for ""ratting him out."" My parents got mad at me as well.

I'd like to start by thanking everyone who gave me advice. I really appreciate all the help I received. Although I'm writing this update a little later than I expected to, things turned out okay. I decided not to press charges and just wait for my brother to get his paycheck. He has already given me his birthday money and part of the paycheck he got yesterday, which sums up to $100. I don't know what happened to the new phone, but I assume it's still coming. There's nothing my parents and I can do about the order, so I just have to wait for his paychecks to arrive.

As for my secret, my mom gave me ""the talk,"" and said she was just worried about me. I assured her that I am not doing anything that is of concern. I also realized that my brother can't ""expose"" me to everyone at school, because what he had done is much, much worse.

Anyway, thank you all for taking your time to offer me advice in my last post and for reading this as well! I'm glad I came here instead of doing anything rash. Have an amazing day!!

50,"Me [25 M] with my fiancee [24 F] of almost 2 years, She told me she has doubts of whether I'm the one and whether she wants to marry me so I broke up with her. Did I screw up?


My fiancee and I have been together for almost 3.5 years and we've been engaged for almost 2 years. Six months ago she went on a business trip for one week and everything has gone downhill since then.


After she came back she informed me that she was having doubts about getting married because she didn't miss me enough while on her trip. She wanted a break and I grudgingly gave it to her. While on this break she had sex with another guy in her building. She told me shortly after it happened and she seemed really upset that it happened. All of my gut was telling me to break up, but I stayed with her to give her one more chance. 


Over the past few months she has repeatedly told me that she's having doubts and is unsure about marriage (we have a date set for next July). She's even told me that she doesn't know if I'm the one and worries there is somebody else out there. 


These things really hurt me along with the cheating on me (she was the one who wanted the break after all). She then told me that she would like to go back to ""dating"". We've already been living in the same house since May. So since Sunday I've been living back with my parents and we were supposed to go on a date on Thursday (yesterday). On Tuesday she texted me and let me know that she can't do the date anymore because her friends are having a get together so we have to reschedule to Friday (today). I was really angry at this point as she specifically told me that we are having these dates so she can remember why she loves me. But the first chance she got to cancel she took it. 


So today came and I had had enough so I went to her house in the afternoon (took the time off work) and told her I couldn't take it anymore and I was breaking up with her. She cried and I cried but I had made up my mind and stuck to my guns and left after she tried to repeatedly ask for another chance. I told her I couldn't trust that her decision is final even if she does change her mind. She's been going back and forth over the past six months since her trip.


Did I mess up? I feel incredibly bad for hurting her feelings but I couldn't put up with the uncertainty anymore. This is both of our first relationships so we're both inexperienced.

51,"Update: My [24F] friend [25F] says she got messages from someone pretending to be a suicidal version of me. Very confused.


[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6yxj2d/my_24f_friend_25f_says_she_got_messages_from/)


Old tldr: My friend called me yesterday freaking out because she got messages saying that I was going to kill myself. I am not suicidal.I have no idea what's going on or how to proceed.


Ok, so it's been a little bit since I posted and I finally have some updates. I did not talk to Kate for a few weeks. When she'd last called me I asked her for proof and suggested she talk to a doctor. I was freaked out so I figured I'd just not contact her until she provided me with proof or a solid explanation. We live thousands of miles away from each other so this really didn't effect my day to day life.


She called me a couple days ago and explained everything. There was no phishing scam. There was no virus. Apparently her computer was acting up and that triggered some delusions that centered on me. She was also massively sleep deprived(unclear on how many days she was awake). I am a programmer and she believed that I had the ability to remotely wipe her computer. She truly believed that we had communicated about it and I had said this was how I would inform her of my suicide. She brought her computer to Best Buy. She talked to her friends nearby about how worried she was. She was likely aware on some level that this wasn't real because she did not take many of the steps one should take in the event that their friend has threatened suicide and remotely attacked their computer (she is a social worker and knows the proper response). I don't know the details of what happened but eventually she ended up back in her doctor's office and realized that none of what she thought had happened had actually happened.


I was aware of mental health issues in the past, but not of any details(just vague knowledge of ptsd and adderall abuse). She did stay in a hospital for three days a few years ago but that was when I was studying abroad and we weren't really talking. I thought she was there for depression but it turns out she was having similar symptoms then. I don't know the details or if she has an official diagnosis. I do know that her doctor has adjusted her medication and she has started sleeping regularly. I'm not sure what else to do.


I'm relieved there is no one pretending to be me and I am glad she is seeking professional help. Thanks to all who gave advice.

Hello Reddit. I think there may be something wrong with my arm. This is not an unfounded theory or idea for me to come up with. When I was 13 I had to have surgery on my elbow for a injury I received swimming of all things. It was just regular practice after school and happened as I was finishing. I was hoisting myself out of the pull and I heard what I could only describe as a pop. It was by far the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. The injury or damage to my elbow needed surgery to repair. I have been getting these pains in my arm around my elbow. It's really bad and they come at random. I woke up in the middle of the night and it's the first thing I felt. 

I don't know how to bring this up to my mom. We have had some very bad luck this year. We live in a very good neighbourhood. Rarely any crime. Back in January our house was robbed.  We were not home. We stayed a weekend away with my aunt. They took most of our stuff. Found the guys but not the stuff. We had to replace all of that as well as get a better security. That's just one incident. My moms car was hit in the parking area at her work. The guy just wrecked the side of her car and drove away. It was obviously a mistake that he hit her car but still. My mom has had to deal with this weirdo that had a crush on her. Other dudes for whatever reason find my mom attractive. When my friends mess with me they tell me that she's a milf or whatever. It's so annoying. My mom had this guy follow her from her work to this gas station before she had to call the cops. He's been sorted with a restraining order and other legal consequences. Not the first time she's had to deal with some idiot who can't take a hint either, it had been a while since it happened last. 

I guess what I'm saying is money is tight this year. Between the robbery, car, school, bills and still paying off my hospital that the insurance wouldn't cover some off. I don't know how to bring up my arm. She has a good job as a PR person but still.

61,"My husband (26) choked me (f26) in a play fight. Please help!


This just happened like an hour ago and my neck is still throbbing, so I'll try to be as succinct as possible. 

Earlier tonight my husband and I were joking around, and had been for about 20 minutes or so. We were joking about something stupid (it was about a monster from a horror movie) and I said I was more afraid of the monster than of him (my husband). He grabbed me and tickled me and we started play fighting, but then he wrapped his arm around my neck and yanked. I felt my neck pop (like it does when you crack your fingers) and I went right to the ground because I thought he could see that he was hurting me. I went to the ground and he wrapped his hands around my neck and squeezed HARD. It hurt and I couldn't breathe, and he was completely expressionless while choking me. He then stopped and put me in what he later called an ""arm bar"", but he basically put his leg across my neck and was pushing it down. Some sort of instinct/panic took over me and I started trying to scratch him, and I was able to choke out that I would bite him if he didn't stop, and then started trying to bite him. He finally did stop and he acted like nothing was wrong. I told him how scary that was, and he helped me up. 

I told him that it freaked me out that he choked me and that he didn't have an expression on his face when he did it. He said that he was honestly just playing and that in his head he was thinking that ""oh I'll show you"" (because I started it by saying I wasn't afraid of him). I asked him if he was trying to make me afraid and he said no. He also said it was kind of because of us joking around earlier and that he had been frustrated with me, but i didn't know that because he didn't say anything. I told him that I don't ever try to hurt him when we play fight, so I don't know why he went right to the scary, heavy type of playing. It didn't feel like playing to me. He kept saying that ""well that's what we both do"" and ""we've played around with light choking during sex before, so I thought I would just lightly choke you"". He started getting upset with me for not letting it go, and I'm getting more upset because my neck still hurts from where his hands were. We've play fought before and I've sometimes been hurt, but I always thought it was because he didn't know his own strength. Tonight I am actually afraid of him. I locked myself in the bathroom because we weren't getting anywhere. 

I'm really scared and shaken up, my husband is NOT like this normally. We have our faults but we're respectful even when disagreeing, he doesn't call me names or act controlling. He might be acting defensive because he feels bad, but I'm having a hard time figuring out if this is a red flag or a genuine accident. I'm scared I'm going to have bruised on my neck. Idk what to do, guys. We've been together almost 3 years, married for 1, and he's never done anything like this. I can't talk to my sister or my friends about this without them assuming the worst.  Please help me get a grip!

Throwaway as said brother created my reddit account for me and I know he occasionally snoops on there to see what I am up to.

---

Reddit, I am so stupidly stuck in this situation with no way out. I have always been close to my brother, Kieran. I am more boyish so he always showed me how to do stuff because my dad is not around much (He too cheated on my mom several times) so my brother picked up his slack. I love him to death and beyond, but I don't want to help him any longer.

His fiancé, Sam, is a wonderful person. Very loving, never made me feel weird for being so close to my much older brother and much rather embraced it. I have been doing more girly stuff with her and I like it, I see her as a friend and she has actively been letting me help with the wedding. She and my mom get along as well and we often go for lunches together. Everything seems perfect.

It isn't really though. I began to suspect that my brother cheated when he said that him and I had hung out together when we clearly hadn't. At first I thought he must be planning a surprise for her or whatever, but if he had, he would have included me or at least gave me a warning I was going to be his alibi, right? He kind of stared at me really odd when he said we had spent the evening together so I kind of agreed, again, thinking nothing of it at that moment.

It began happening more and more and I began to grow anxious. It took me some time to ask him what was going on and he basically said that it was fine, there is nothing to worry about. Guess what, that made me even worry more!

Reddit, I know privacy is important, I would NEVER go through my brother's belonging and I have never done it before, but I was hanging out with him and he left his phone while he went to get us Chinese food and I only really noticed it when a message came in. I looked at it and it was from someone named ""Mandy"" and it said something along the lines of when they were going to meet up tonight and that she missed him.

I blew up at him when he came back, demanding to know who Mandy was. He tried to hide it at first, acting like she was just a friend, but I had never heard of her before! After some prodding, he told me she was a coworker and it had only been happening for the last month. Ever since I became his alibi, basically. He tried to reason with me that he wasn't sure Sam was the one and he wanted to try being with other women to be sure of his feelings (WTF?). I don't know why I did not call Sam right there and then, but he begged me to not tell her and that he would end it right away.

It has not stopped and the wedding is in spring next year. While he does not use me as an alibi anymore in my presence, when my mom, Sam and me went out for a movie, Sam asked me if I had fun with my brother that evening. I had not met him, meaning he's still at it.

Reddit, please help me, I have no one to turn to! I want to tell Sam the truth, but it would tear our lives apart. My brother will hate me, for sure, and I cannot lose him. My mom will be so hurt as well after everything dad did to her and I cannot even imagine how Sam will feel, she is so in love with him and won't stop gushing over their perfect spring wedding!

What do I do? Tell the truth or just continue this stupid lie?

65,"Girlfriends parents won't give me [25 M] blessing because of my poor vision, GF [25 F] opts to end for time being


I [25 M] had a [25 F] girlfriend. We had a 5 year relationship. I have never had a good relationship with her parents*, yet still wanted to ask their blessing for her hand. Needless to say, they said no. She opted to end the 5 year relationship to figure out what to do.

My poor relationship with her parents stems from the fact that I am not able to see well. I had cancer in both of my eyes as an infant, lost my left eye, and lost vision in my right eye. With all that said, my only real obstacle is my inability to drive.

I work full time as a personal trainer. I'll be making 60k this year with company benefits, etc. I am a pretty straight-laced guy, working hard and looking at home ownership at end of year.

Since the break up, I keep some contact with my ex (I hate thinking of it that way). She has recent developed some self-destructive decision making skills. I worry for her. I still love her.

66,"I [27m] found out my [25f] fiancee has been ""cheating"".


So I use quotations with the word cheating because many people have different definitions of cheating. To me cheating is deception. Purposely deceiving someone in such a manner I guess.

ANYWAYS, just found out my fiancee of almost 4 years has been talking to another guy. First off we have two kids together, 1yr old and 2 yr old. 

It started with her just being unhappy. My line of work has some funky hours, basically 8am till don't know. Several times a month I don't get home until 8-9pm. She's a stay at home mom, fortunately I make enough so we can wing that. I understand the struggle of staying at home with two babies and the stress it brings on so I try and look at it from both sides. 

Apparently she's been really unhappy just the last year but I couldn't tell. Hell the last couple months have been really good. I mean better than it has been. But it all started a couple weeks ago when she friended some dude on Facebook. They started talking and apparently hit it off.

 Fast forward a couple weeks, she wants to go out with her friends friday. I'm cool with it, I'll stay home watch the kids and you go have fun. After helping her get ready and telling her what looked good, etc she left at about 7pm. We text a few times throughout the night but I wasn't trying to bug her. I was cool, at home playing PlayStation and just hanging out. Kids were asleep, whatever. I wake up at about 5am and she's not in the bed. Call her, no answer. Go downstairs and she's on the couch. I ask her if she wants me to rub her back, hold her hair or whatever I could do to ease the hangover. She says she's fine and she didn't drink that much. I had a dirtbike race that had been scheduled for a couple weeks so after her telling me she was okay several times I left her alone and her mom came and got the kids. Got home that evening and she was still laying around, hungover.

Sunday.

I don't know why but for some reason I just wanted to see her phone. I had a suspicion but it wasn't anything I thought would amount to anything. I seriously never thought she would try anything. ) 

I was wrong. 

I seen where she had been talking to her friend about a guy she met and how he was cute and funny and they liked each other. How she wanted to bang him, how they hung out till 4am Friday night and she's got these butterfly feelings, etc. 

Sooo I'm livid, I mean we have a family. She knows I have some trust issues and yeah. I'm pissed. I immediately confront her and all hell breaks loose. We argued and yelled and it was bad. (Kids were still gone we were actually gonna get them when she got ready) but it turned into a shit show.

So after all the drama and shit we started talking about it and why it happened. Apparently she misses that exciting feeling. The new relationship feel. The way she feels when someone compliments her, etc. 

Tuesday rolls around. I'm at work. We start texting. She's telling me how she needs a couple days to think things out about what she really wants and I'm like yeah fuck that. I'm just ready to move on. Chalk it up. But see, we have two Kids! Not easy, friends. 

She asks how I would feel about an open relationship. I immediately disregard it and I'm not for it. Well after a couple hours I'm talking to a friend of mine back home (moved across country when i was 18 and never looked back but stayed in contact with friends from HS) and she's telling me about how her and her husband have an open relationship. After her explaining it to me and breaking it down for me I don't feel so negative about it but I'm still not 100 on board. So I talk to her about what my friend was saying and she immediately changes her tune like she really wants this so she's doing whatever to get me to say yes.


Now, my problem is I may think other women are attractive but I don't think I could sleep with someone and come home to her. I just don't think it's right and can't get over that. Maybe if the trust was there it would be different but well it's not soo..

After reading about open relationships on here and how it worked out it seemed pretty clear it won't work without trust. I bring it back up to her and she immediately blows it off like well if you have doubts the  we shouldn't do it. She doesn't give me time to even explain why I feel like it won't work. So after some more arguing and name calling I decide I'm gonna leave for a couple days and give her the space she wants. So I took the kids and drive 8 hours north to my family. I got here last night and this whole situation is just eating me up. 


Tldr;
Fiancee of 4 years mother of our two kids emotionally cheated on me and now demands open relationship. Wants time apart because im not gung-ho about it. 

Edit 1) 

Forgot to mention, upon me leaving I told her I wasn't okay with her talking to other people or acting on anything until i.grt back and we figure out what's going on. I told her I'd be gone for about a week or so but I think I'm going to go back over the weekend and just unexpectedly show up. One of two things can happen. Dudes there or she's still talking to him or I get thete, she's asleep and has nothing incriminating on her phone. 

Edit 2) 

So I appreciate everybody's input. I knew this was pretty cut and dry from the beginning but part of me just wished I could make it work. I guess it's human nature to make something you want so bad to work. I don't want my kids growing up in an unstable environment and I damn sure don't want them growing up thinking this abnormal relationship is normal. Feel free to keep the comments coming, I'm reading all of them but I just can't sit down and think about what to say with all this going on around me. (Kids playing, family visiting everyone asking where she is, etc.) "

68,"My (30f) boss (30s f) is asking for a personal request that I can't deliver on. How to say no and not make things awkward at work?


A few months ago, my (30f) boss (30-something f) found out that my spouse is a contractor and asked for his contact info for her mom who needed things done on her house.


My spouse agreed, I told him it was for my boss, so her mom even got the ""friend"" discount. However, she was a nightmare to work with. Cheap, tried to haggle lower on the friend discount, was never home and then demanded work done at odd hours at a moment's notice, etc. My spouse almost did the work at cost just to be rid of her.


The problem is now my boss has asked me to tell my spouse her mom wants her whole basement redone -- and great news! She wants go hire my SO!


He has told me no fucking way. I've told my boss he's super busy with other contracts, but she insists she wants him and will wait until he's available.

How do I deal with this without offending her/causing friction for me at work?

69,"Me [37 F] with my husband [37 M] of 10 years, found a dick pick on our iCloud and when I asked to see his phone a bunch of texts (but no dick pick) with a girl from Crossfit.


Ok, so I'll try to type this fast before my husband gets home. I have been reading this sub forever, but never thought I would have to post.

Last night I was going through pics of our 3 kids on our computer to put together a photo album and I was confronted by 4 pics of his erect dick. Now this immediately struck me as out of the norm because we never sext each other pics. I freaked out for a minute and wasn't going to confront him right away, but he asked me what I was doing, so I told him and asked to see his phone.

He handed it over with no complaint and hadn't changed the password or anything. Nothing suspicious in his email. But I did see a TON of texts back and forth with a 28 year old female he knows from Crossfit. There is history here because several months ago he was texting a lot in the evening and I found out for the first time that he was texting her. In theory, I think some men and women can be ""just friends,"" but right or wrong I feel threatened by him having a lot of texts with a pretty girl (I looked her up - she's definitely pretty) from the gym.

So I asked him not to text her, but he said he sometimes has to about Crossfit (eyeroll). I guess I didn't want to come off as a total hag, so I asked him to limit his texts to during the day and only about Crossfit. I haven't checked up on him since until now. 

In truth, most of the texts between them (hundreds) were about working out and pretty innocuous. But there were several that caused me concern. The oldest texts mentioned that he had deleted texts upon her recommendation and he joked about ""having no conscience"". Then a lot of workout stuff. Then him joking about being old and chubby and her joking about being a grown up and he's not chubby. Then more work out stuff. Finally last weekend he was out of state with a male friend (I'm sure) and that is when the dick pick took place...not sex with the male friend (I'm sure). Before he left on the trip he texted the girl to ask what he should pack. She basically said not to bring many clothes, then joked that could be misconstrued. And apologized. He joked it would have made his night if she hadn't apologized. I don't have any evidence that he sent her the dick pick.

Upon confrontation he claimed that he was horny while he was gone and took the picks and considered sending them to me but then didn't really like the way he turned out and decided against it. Honestly, the idea of my husband sending me an out-of-the-blue dick pick after 10 years just seems laughably false. Although we have (HAD) been ramping things up and having sex more in recent weeks, mostly at my urging.

His claim is that he knew that continuing to text her was against my wishes but that he just didn't think it was a big deal and that he definitely wasn't sexting her. 

I have no idea what to believe. I feel like the obvious answer is like ""of course he's having at minimum an emotional affair,"" but I do have reason to disbelieve that. He's always been a good husband and excellent father. He is always either at work, gym or home, never any unexplained times away at all. I've had no other signs of cheating and he's generally a pretty trustworthy guy. I'm hurt and scared and don't know what to do next.

Edit: Husband saw me typing a bunch on here and thought I was like texting a friend about this issue and felt offended that I was spreading rumors/our issues. I told him I don't think he deserves to see what I'm doing because he has violated my trust that way, but I ended up handing him my phone and he read the whole description and all the responses so far. 

He said he appreciated that I told it from my perspective without exaggerating despite my hurt feelings. He does seem contrite and has apologized and said he will cut off all contact with her via texting and in person. He said he will say they were flirting inappropriately and so they can't be in contact at all anymore. And he said he thinks she will likely be mortified that what she/they may have thought was innocent has caused marital disruption. Of course he agreed with the two people who stated he might be innocent and pretty much ignored all the people who are sure he's guilty of a big affair. 

Just trying to make it through the day acting normal for the kids right now. 

Edit 2: Upon further questioning and examination of the texts, he had this explanation for the deleted texts: She asked where he was at the Crossfit workout, he said wherever he had been instead, she texted him a picture of her face with her tounge sticking out like ""you suck"". He said whatever back. Later he texted the picture back to her in a different conversation and she was like ""You should probably delete that photo"" (because it looks damn suspicious to have a photo of another woman on your phone). 

Also, just to be clear, she is not an innocent in this duo. She often texts to invite him to group outings (he usually - always in the texts I actually saw - declines or responds after the fact). Once he missed a crossfit party and she sent a pic of herself and 4 other girls dressed to the nines for an evening out. No reason for that.

70,"My [28m] girlfriend [26f] uses the silent treatment for EVERY fight and small mistakes of mine ruin entire days


We live together in an apartment. Most of my days are spent working (she's between jobs) very long hours so I've always been one to try my hardest to enjoy the weekends.

Recently though the last several of them have left me begging to get back to work. Me and her will make plans, get ready, then something small will happen to start a fight. Examples were:

- I left a hanger in the bathroom

- I went out for coffee and ended up staying ten minutes to send an email from their wifi

- she got one of those Instagram follow suggestions(?) for an ex-gf of mine

These are fine and all and I'm good at talking things out but what she does is explodes with anger then is dead silent and ignoring me for the whole day. She refuses to talk to me or go with me anywhere when she's like this. If I ask what's wrong she says ""nothing"". One time I DID convince her to go and hang out with my friends and she didn't speak to me for the rest of the day.

She has made me stay home begging for forgiveness every weekend for almost two months now. This included my birthday, which was the first birthday I got off from work for in years.

What can I do? How do you end the silent treatment? I feel like I'm looking FORWARD to going back to work because my own home is either me begging for her to forgive me over something small or being paranoid while she's happy knowing that tiny mistakes have huge consequences.

------------------------------

**TL;DR** - Girlfriend uses a lengthy (several hours) silent treatment for even the smallest fights. It has ruined almost every weekend plan two months and my bday. What do I do?

**update** - you guys are right. She went for a walk after silent treating me all day and I'm gonna be wasted when she gets back and fall asleep to either her silence or screaming but I'll have a big dopey grin on my face either way."
