0,"UPDATE Me [16F] with my boyfriend [17M] 1 month, I️ knit him a scarf as a 1 month anniversary present. Is it too much to give him? A friend told me it is!


First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t28at/me_16f_with_my_boyfriend_17m_1_month_i_knit_him_a/

First TLDR: TLDR: knit boyfriend a scarf. Was going to give it to him tomorrow (same day meeting his family) as a 1 month anniversary gift. Best friend says it is way too soon and ill scare him off. Is it too much? Should I️ get a smaller gift? Should I️ give it to him? How should I️ give it? What do I️ do???

First off, sorry if my “I️” formats weiddly, I️ updated my phone but it keeps happening.

Now onto the update:

I️ wrapped the scarf up and gave it to my boyfriend. I️ also gave him a card with the care instructions and some extra yarn so it can be repaired if it ever breaks.

He loved it! And he got me a yarn bowl (if you knit you know what it is) so we actually both got eachother gifts! 

He hasn’t taken it off since and was bragging about it al night to his family. I️ got to have a really awesome talk with his grandmother and aunts because of it since they all knit! And they invited me to come knit with them anytime :)

I️ loved his family and they seemed to really like me.

Super happy I️ gave it to him and super happy I’m with him. 

I️ already have his Valentine’s Day gift, an engraved leather wallet with his name that comes in a woodburn box with his monogram  :). We agreed to exchange gifts with a budget of $40 so it worked out! Thank you Etsy!!!

Thanks for all the advice.

  **tl;dr**: Gave boyfriend scarf And he had a knitting related gift for me as well. Super happy together and communicated more clearly about gifts in the future :)!"
1,"[Update] My [M/19] friend/roommate [M/19] kissed me when we were drunk. Our relationship has been extremely awkward ever since.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t8jxw/my_m19_friendroommate_m19_kissed_me_when_we_were/

A few of you asked for an update, so here it is.

I was eating dinner alone, feeling awfully sad because the last time we ate together was before the kiss, but he sat down beside me and asked how I felt about it. I told him I liked it a lot, and he agreed. We stared at each other awkwardly until he asked if we were gay. I said “dunno” and gave him a kiss, we started making out and eventually we had sex. Both of us were clueless on what to do, but it still felt amazing. There was just something about him that turned me on so much.

Afterwards we cuddled in bed for half an hour, he asked if I wanted to date him, and of course I said yes. Since then we've gone on a few dates, and had a lot of sex. Our relationship is also back to normal, except he's my boyfriend now.

**TL;DR:** We talked about it, kissed again, and had sex. He's my boyfriend now :)

2,"[UPDATE] my [ 25 f] bf [29m]'s birthday is coming up. i feel increasingly more stressed and miserable that i can't afford to buy him anything.


[link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7snee3/my_25_f_bf_29ms_birthday_is_coming_up_i_feel/)

Well today is his birthday and I think i got it down. I work in a pretty fancy resturaunt and the chef was in today. I asked him if i could buy a nice cut of steak off of him. He did so much more, he gave me 2 filet cuts, the seasoning they make, and showed me how to cook a perfect mid rare. I was also able to buy a bottle of reserve wine at wholesale cost, so 1 tables worth of tip money got me a $130 bottle of my boyfriend's favorite kind of wine.

I got off work about 20 minutes ago amd started baking him a carrot cake. It's the first thing i ever made for him, so its kind of sentimental.

I also swung by the dollar tree and grabbed some brown and gray baloons and I'm currently printing put a banner that says ""IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.""

lastly, over the week when he hasnt been around Ive been working on a drawing of one of his favorite Its Always Sunny scenes. He always says he wants a good painting/drawing of Frank, so i hope he wasnt joking!

anyway, my previous post didnt get a lot of attention, but everyone who commented made me feel way better. Im happy that without any money i am still able to give him a special night.

he really deserves the world, but this is the best i can do right now. I hope he knows how special he is.

thanks everyone!

**tl;dr** awesome chef at work gave me some filets and taught me how to prepare them, got a bottle of wine at wholesale price from work, made him a
 carrot cake, drew a picture of Danny Devito, and decorated the living room like The Office. he deserves way more, but hopefully Ill have many more years to make him feel as loved and special as he is :)

**EDIT** HOLY COW GUYS!! 

i cant keep up with the messages anymore, but thank you all so much! hes on his way home now. Kitten destroyed half of the balloons, ill conceived plan. i forgot i have a ninja demon for a pet. ill post an update tomorrow, along with the picture i drew (on another subreddit, its illegal here.) as requested &lt;3"
3,"[Update] My [34/M] sister [39/F] is terminally ill. I wasn't going to see her before the end, but now I'm having second thoughts.


[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7tm4cb/my_34m_sister_39f_is_terminally_ill_i_wasnt_going/) to Original. 

Welp, I did it. Got back like an hour ago. Had to update all of you. First.... thank you for all of your advice. 

Almost immediately after consulting ya'll, I called my sister's husband to do what some of you had recommended and to ask what it is she wanted to talk about. I called and my sister answered (It was a land-line. Who has a landline anymore??). I didn't realize I would be thrust into talking to her straight away. She was very quiet, really weak and asked that we meet. I agreed and went this morning (I took the day off and brought breakfast foods). 

I hadn't seen her, in person, in years, so in my mind she was about 8 feet tall and mean. She's about 4'11 now and a tiny wisp. She was mostly bald, very, very pale and had been placed in a chair in the living room. She doesn't look anything like I remember, much older but also very different. She looks a lot like our grandmother, which was interesting to see. 

We had a really, really awkward conversation for the first 10 minutes, that sort of conversation where you know you need to discuss something, but one, or both, people are trying to avoid the subject. She sipped some juice and we ate pastries I had brought. Her daughter came out and introduced herself, she knew who I was almost instantly and was very polite. She helped me eat the pastries and enjoyed the juice. 

My sister made a full, unreserved, apology. She outlined that she had been abused by a distant relative (something I had pieced together/my mother let me know) and had a lot of problems. She apologized for what she did and how it impacted the rest of my life. She blames herself for things that I did in the wake of 
the attack - I gave up a lot of interests I deemed ""nerdy"" and wound-up in the military for a spell, which I probably wouldn't have done - and wanted me to know she was sorry. I accepted her apology in a sort of ""no need to apologize"" kind of way. I'm not sure why I said that, but it seemed only right at the time. 

I met her husband who gave me a picture frame he made from wood, it's very beautiful and I'll use it to frame a family picture. Her husband isn't what I expected at all - very meek, quiet, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy going through what I imagine is a horrific time. 

My mother called during our meeting and had no idea I was going to see her, so she was a bit overcome emotionally. That I guess is what really kind of bugged me. I was really caught-up in how mad I was at my sister that I forgot that my parents have to bury a child and that a child is going to lose her mother - no matter what I thought of her mom. I felt a bit guilty about the whole thing after the fact. 

My wife was really concerned for our niece and has suggested that we arrange a dinner on Saturday so that our kids can meet their cousin and hopefully forge something so that she has a bigger network of people for when the inevitable happens. 

All-in-all, it was positive. I can know she was apologetic and that I won't have the nagging question when she passes. My wife wants to do right by our niece and my mother seems to be incredibly happy that we hashed things out. She called my wife and told her she had been hoping and praying there would be a happy resolution. So that's a positive turn. 


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wound up seeing my sister. She's not doing well. We had an awkward conversation and she apologized where I said she didn't need to. I met my niece and her husband. Our meeting has made her, my parents and sister really happy. It's made my wife want to get to know her niece. I got an unreserved apology and feel good knowing I got closure and didn't let this linger until it was too late. Feel bad for those around me, especially my niece. "
4,"(UPDATE) Girlfriend [26F] has effectively given me [26M] an ultimatum about children. Where to go from here.


My prior post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t5dtp/girlfriend_26f_has_effectively_given_me_26m_an/

The night I posted that we didn’t talk much at all. I wanted to have a night of normalcy as best I could since my last three days had been filled with crying overflowing emotions. 

I watched the game, listened to a podcast, and went to sleep in our guest room - she had been sick and I just didn’t want to circle the same topic again which I knew would happen if I slept with her.

The next morning we spoke a little before I left for work, and I still said ‘I love you’ on the way out - I didn’t hear if she said it back this time.

Fast forward to the end of my shift that day, I knew I wouldn’t see her because she was at a planned party for her friend. Not only did I not see her, I didn’t hear from her all day and all night. She knows it’s a major thing to not at least say “hey, I’m safe” even if we are fighting I have always done that for her. When I woke up in the morning she still wasn’t home.

I had to get ready to leave town for work so I did - packed my bags and left to work a half day before leaving. Once my coworkers and I were prepping to leave I had to run home to drop my car off and be picked up.

I pulled into my driveway and saw a couple of guys I hadn’t seen before walking upstairs. Adrenaline starts. I get out of my car and walk up the stairs, as soon as I open the door there she is - surrounded by boxes with her family packing her up. I won’t forget the look on her face when she saw me.

The rest is a bit of a blur but we did talk outside on the steps and she tried to make what she was doing into her doing me a favor, as in moving out without telling me was somehow justified. I could never “ghost” someone like that, permitting the relationship was a non-abusive one.

I let her know that her logic didn’t make sense but that it didn’t matter. That this definitely was over because she has never respected me or my role in this relationship and that it has and always will be her way or the highway. She tried to argue, as always, but I just stopped her saying it doesn’t matter - the house is being packed up. The time for discourse is over.

I left with coworkers for the work trip and when I returned the next day they were still packing so I came back after work and then they were gone. Despite her owing me money still she took a ton of stuff - including petty things like cutting boards and trash cans. I’m coming to terms with the fact that my money might not ever come back.

I saw the night I was out of town for work that she had put on a skimpy dress and gone out to the bar, posting it on social media saying “too much for the bar tonight?” I know seeing things like this only slows down the healing process, so I’m closing those connections down.

The main point I’ve come to when discussing this with friends is that even though it hurts like hell, I did dodge the larger bullet. She showed her true colors, and they weren’t pretty. However she chooses to rationalize in her own head is one thing: but it’s obvious there was deception. I may never know the full extent, and wondering about it will only terrorize me.

Anyway r/relationships, thanks for listening. If I could offer one piece of advice to those reading this: don’t ignore the small things. Pay attention to behaviors that your partner has and don’t assume you can “fix” the bad ones. People are who they are, not who they say they are.

TL;DR: Caught now ex-girlfriend moving out without telling me, now am beginning the process of figuring out who I am again.

EDIT: she kept the cat."
5,"Me [14 F] with my mother [40s F] , she found out I use tampons and banned me from swim practice


so I took up swimming in september and really love it. for my third practice though, it looked like I would probably be having my monthly. when my mom was going shopping, I asked her if she could pick up some tampax for me.  She told me tampax was only for married women and young girls use pads. I told her the other girls always wear tampax when they're swimming. She said I could just skip practice when I was in that way, and that other girls weren't raised right like me. 

I know it was wrong for me to lie to her but I just pretended to go along with it. I bought tampons myself and started lying that I was staying with my friend Becca when I was actually at practice. I got away with this until yesterday. My mom wasn't going to be at home and she rang Becca's mom to check if I had my housekey with me. This is how she found out about everything.

Last night she told me that because I lied to her she was going to forbid me from going to practice. I don't know how to convince her. I told her I'd stop using tampons and skip a practice every month but she says the damage is already done down below and that she can't trust me anymore. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I wore tampons for swim practice against my mother's rules and now she's making me quit swimming. "

Hey, So this post didn't get a lot of attention but I did resolve things and you all seem to like update posts so here it goes.


So I had gotten a pretty mixed bag of advice, but ultimately I decided to message the girl about her boyfriend. I put together a thoughtful message with screenshots of our texts, photos he posted on instagram which were taken in my apartment, and snapchat screenshots i had. I figured worst case scenario, I have to block this girl on instagram.


The girl messaged me back and we ended up talking for a while. I feel bad because I think I resented her just a little, but when I talked to her I realized that she's just a nice girl who was being taken advantage of. 


She told me she had been with this guy for nine years and he had explained away all of the strange instagram posts, the weekends where he would disappear and all that. Another woman had reached out to her in the past with the same story but her boyfriend was able to convince her that it was just some crazy girl who followed him on instagram (He's kind of wannabe instagram famous). She talked to me about how stupid she felt but thanked me for telling her the truth.


After nine years I can't imagine what this girl is going through. 


On the bright side I feel much better about everything. I felt very used and taken advantage of by this guy and now I feel like he is being held accountable for his actions.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I told her. They had been in a relationship for nine years and he had cheated before. That guy was a major asshole. I'm feeling better."
9,"Partner and I [33F] have an empty swimming pool in the backyard. [7M] rode his skateboard in the pool despite being told not to and broke his leg 2 am in the morning. We're split on whether punishment is needed or not.


My partner and I have been together for 10 years, and are both 33F. We have a seven year old son, Micheal. We finally got around to actually buying a house together that we can actually own and no longer have to rent. We moved in just last weekend and in our backyard we have an empty pool.  The previous owner let it fester and never bothered to clean it or anything of the sort. The real-estate agent have the pool drained and cleaned before she tried to sell the house. It's remained empty to this day. 

Our son is huge into skateboarding. He loves learning new tricks and watching extreme sports. When he laid his eyes on the empty pool he wanted to ride his skateboard in it. We both said no because it looked dangerous for a kid. We saw no way it could end well. He begged and pleaded with us going as far as to promise to wear 3 helmets on top of each other. We still refused and he pouted for a while until we thought he got over it. 

Yesterday morning at 2 in the morning we were both woken up to him screaming for us. We couldn't find him in his room and that brief panic took over. My partner found him lying in the pool crying his eyes out telling us his leg hurts. We had to go to the ER and have him seen to. He has a nasty break in his leg, and now he is in a cast. He let himself out of the house when we were sleeping because he thought we would never know he went skateboarding in the pool. He promised he'd never done this before, and I know he hasn't because our last place had an alarm he didn't know the combination to. 

He was crying at the ER telling us he'd never do it again. He continued to cry at home because he knew he was in trouble. I've called to have new locks placed he can't open without a key, and an alarm system placed in our house. They're coming later this week. 

My partner and I are split on whether or not he should be grounded to some extent. I think he should because what he did was stupid, and I thought we taught him better than that. I know he's a kid, but to me it's a very scary situation. She thinks that his broken leg is enough punishment. Please help me/us come a stance to take on this.

10,"My [M 22] ""friend"" [F 23] just falsely told my girlfriend of two years [F 22] that I cheated with her. I have no idea why she would do this or what to do about it.


Throwaway, names changed etc.

I'd like to preface this by saying I don't feel my relationship with my girlfriend is in immediate danger as we have a lot of trust and honesty between us. However this is still a very sticky situation and I'm completely lost.

About midway through last year I traveled to Europe to meet some family in Italy, and left a few weeks early to travel around by myself for the first time. My girlfriend (Anna) stayed home as she was in her final year of college. While in Frankfurt I saw pictures of our friend (Molly) on Facebook in a nearby city visiting friends, so I messaged her asking if she wanted travel together for a bit. So we met up, traveled around, saw the sites and went out partying with her friends a few times. We then parted ways to continue our itineraries. We Skyped home multiple times and Anna had no problem with us travelling together, not that I expected there to be any issue since we're all friends. Since then, I've had very little contact with Molly, running into her occasionally at parties.

Yesterday, Anna called me, very distressed, to say that Molly messaged her a very detailed ""confession"", explaining that we slept together in Germany and that she's so sorry for keeping it a secret for so long but she couldn't stand the guilt. As you can imagine I was pretty taken aback by this claim. I assured Anna that it was absolutely not true and went to see her that night, deciding not to contact Molly until I knew what was going on. When I saw Anna she had obviously been in tears but was not hysterical or accusing. I gave her a big hug and assured her that it wasn't true and I'd get to the bottom of this.

Anna showed me the message she'd received and it blew my mind. Molly had fabricated an incredibly detailed story of a drunken night out (she even specified the date) which ended with me supposedly coming onto her while she was wasted, then making her promise not to tell. I cross checked the date with my calendar and my photos; that night I didn't even leave the Airbnb, let alone have anything to drink. Not only that, but at no point over the entire week (or trip for that matter) had I had enough alcohol to forget anything.

I immediately called Molly but she didn't pick up, so I messaged her demanding she explain herself. To my utter disbelief, she stuck to her story and called me a horrible cheater and said that she's so ashamed to be the ""other woman"", which was completely surreal for her to sound so convinced when she and I both knew she was lying. This made Anna very visibly upset, and I don't blame her. I can only imagine she knew I'd be showing Anna the conversation, but still couldn't figure out why she was lying in the first place. I tried to call her again but to no avail. I eventually gave up and sent her a message to the tune of ""you're a crazy bitch, how dare you try to sabotage my relationship"" and blocked her. Anna and I stayed up late that night talking the whole situation through. I told her that I love her and would never even dream of being unfaithful. I know that Anna is on my side, but that hasn't stopped things from being incredibly uncomfortable since.

Things we still tense this morning. We talked a bit more and I promised her I'd get to the bottom of it, but even though I unblocked her, Molly won't answer any of my calls or texts. I'm completely at a loss for what to do. As glad as I am that Anna believes me, I still feel like the trust in our relationship has taken a massive hit and I am still completely in the dark as to why this whole thing happened. Molly and I had no sexual history, no issues that would make her lash out, and as far as I know she's never had any kind of mental problems, or any reason to want to sabotage my relationship.

I am at an absolute loss. I love Anna with all my heart and I'm shattered by everything that has happened. I want everything to be ok again, but don't know how to fix this. It's especially hard since I can't prove with 100% certainty that Molly is lying, and the only legitimate explaination I can possibly conjure is ""our perfectly sane mutual friend is all of a sudden a lying psycho"".

TL;DR My friend accused me of cheating on my girlfriend with her out of the blue. I have no idea why, nor do I have any way of proving her wrong.  We're still together, but things are tense and I want to get to the bottom of this. What do I do?"
11,"I [19F] have been given an amazing opportunity to travel, but if I leave, my boyfriend [20M] will likely leave me.


I have been given the opportunity to travel halfway across the world to stay with extended family with my parents paying for all of the travel expenses. Opportunity of a lifetime, right?

The catch is, I have a boyfriend of 2 years that would likely break up with me if I leave. I know that I'm young, and I need these experiences, but I love him very much and I already left him for university last year. If I leave again, he will more than definitely remove me from his life, and we'll never be in contact again, because that's how he deals with break ups. 

It breaks my heart knowing I will likely have to choose between travel and him and I'm honestly not sure what to do. 

TL;DR: I have to choose between travel and the person I love, and the decision is killing me.

Edit: I would be going overseas for 3-9 months. 
I have already completed 1 year of university, quite far from home, and decided to take this year off to pursue other ventures, and figure out my degree as I changed it mid way through my first year. My parents said that it wouldn't be a worthwhile year unless I did something like travel with it, which is definitely true. "

**I AM NOT BREAKING UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND OVER THIS. I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THANK YOU.**

I've known my buddy [21/M] since I started going to university 4 years ago. My girlfriend [22/F] is my best friend of 16 years and we've been dating for two months. 

She asked to borrow his laptop to do homework when the three of us were hanging out at his home. While carrying it she slipped on a water spill, she didn't get hurt, but the laptop was damaged pretty badly, albeit still repairable. 

He started losing his shit at my girlfriend, even though she apologized and offered to pay for the cost of the repair. I pulled him aside and asked why the hell he was freaking out. He said I needed to break up with my girlfriend because of how careless she was, or else we couldn't be friends anymore. Then he went on a weird rant about how I shouldn't have dated her in the first place because I deserve better, but I think he was projecting hard about something.

It boggles my mind that he wants me to break up with her because she accidentally damaged his laptop, over his negligence in not cleaning up the spilled water. I'm not breaking up with my girlfriend, so I assume my friendship with him is over. 

The thing is, he's a member of our team [5 people including myself] for the video game [League of Legends] we play, and he's irreplaceable. There's no one that we know of who is equal in skill level to him, that also plays his role. We take the game very seriously by meeting up and practicing every weekend, going over our replays to see how we can get better, improve our communication, etc. 

But I don't want to play with him anymore, or have him on the team, because of the way he handled everything. I don't know how to bring up what happened between him and I with the rest of our teammates, or if I should in the first place.

14,"UPDATE - Me [29M] and fiancee [23F]—been engaged 1 month, she wants a ""better"" engagement ring


Old thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t9493/me_29m_and_fiancee_23fbeen_engaged_1_month_she/

So I really took you guys' advice to heart and resolved to get my fiancee a better engagement ring. I realize that I really dropped the ball by spending less than $100 on the first ring, and that she deserves something that she loves and a ring that will last for a lifetime.

I took her to a couple of jewelry store to look at rings with a 3.5k budget in mind. She ended up going cheaper than the max budget and picked out a 3.3 carat moissanite solitaire that she is absolutely in love with. I feel like every time I look over at her I catch her staring at her hand with a goofy smile. Admittedly it was hard to spend over a thousand dollars on a cosmetic item, but it gets easier when I see how happy she is and how excited she is about getting married.

I apologized about dropping the ball on the first ring and we ended up having a 2 hour conversation about our values. She said she was hurt that I cheaped out so much and proposed with a fashion ring, but she also felt a lot of pressure to not come off as materialistic so she didn't want to complain. I opened up a bit about my family's money troubles growing up and how it's informed a lot of my current spending habits. We talked a lot about our upcoming marriage and what we want our lives together to be like.

...Then we got around to addressing the elephant in the room. Rachel told me that she thinks I think she is a burden, and that I wish she would quit her job (911 dispatcher) and get something that makes more money and has better hours. I honestly don't mind at all that she has a crazy schedule, and I think her job is very important and should be payed more, but I will admit that I have had thoughts about her developing some new skills and moving into something that makes more money. I have been feeling a small bit of resentment lately for paying a much bigger percentage of rent and bills, but I also really wouldn't want to live in a place that fits in Rachel's budget. She wants me to see that there is more to a career than the money, and that her job gives her a great deal of personal fulfillment. I'd like her to be open to the possibility of moving up the career ladder in her field, whatever that may be.

Basically there has been some resentment and differing expectations built up on both sides. Day to day we are very happy—she is the light of my life and I can say with 100% certainty that I want to be with her no matter what. But we also have some things to sort out, so I am looking into pre-marital counseling.

tl;dr: I bought my fiancee a real engagement ring that she loves, and we had a long conversation that unearthed some resentment from both of us. We are going to see a counselor to help us talk through our problem, but we are also very much in love and excited for the future."
15,"I [F21] was playing drinking games with my friends [M/F21-26] and when the question of ranking the appearance of every girl came up, I was placed last. Feeling down and upset tonight


I was at a party with my friends and there were 25 people or so ranging from 21 to 26 yo, we’re all in the same college. We were playing drinking game and there was a question like ”rank the appearance of every girl in the room” as well as ”rank the appearance of every guy in the room. My friends who are all very attractive occupied the highest spots while I was the last one.

People were trying not to be mean about it and one friend comforted me but the damage was still done. 

I’ve always been insecure about my looks because I know that I’m not the most pretty one, but I think tonights experience might have permanted that insecurity. Knowing that 25 people think you aren’t that attractive is devastating. 

I’m so upset right now and drunk, I feel like I want isolate myself and never go out so people don’t have to see how ugly I am. I’m just a waste of space. Who wants to be around an ugly girl anyway?

Uuuugh this fucking sucks, I wish I was born with a pretty face and not the ugly one I have now :(

Here’s the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7tkz5s/my_21f_parents_50sfm_took_down_all_the_trophies/?st=JD7BW7NO&amp;sh=da29defd)

So, I spoke to Bebe the night I wrote my post. I pointed out that it was only her trophies on the shelf, and it wasn’t my favorite interaction. I think being away from her for so long definitely changed my perception of her, and I didn’t really notice that she *had* changed, especially her ego. I showed her each trophy and name plate, and she went, “Well, of course they’re my trophies. When was the last time you got better than bronze?” I asked her if it didn’t upset her that the rest of ours were basically hidden even though we’ve had a lot of dedication to our activities, and she said, “No. Dedication doesn’t make you a winner.” Bebe told me I was wasting her time, told me to “grow up and get over myself.” Then, she went to go hang out with our parents and I think I finally got it.

She was the golden child, and we were the scapegoats. The entire time I’d been there, they’d just been hanging out with Bebe and I was there too. I felt so upset, and admittedly, I self-imploded. Having my own sister that I looked up to and admired treat me like that was just a slap in the face. Our older siblings were so far in age from us that we really got close and relied on each other. Later, I got my parents separated from Bebe, and asked. They pretty much echoed her, telling me I hadn’t earned my spot on the shelf, and that my trophies had gone in the garbage because they didn’t impress anybody the way that Bebe’s did, and said that I was an adult, and I should basically just suck it up. I’ve never been more hurt by anything.

I don’t think I fully realized the scope of it when I was younger, but it clicks now. My game was on the same day as Bebe’s, and they went to hers. They brought snacks to Bebe’s competition, but not mine. Everything for Bebe was hosted at our house, but nothing for the rest of us. I pushed so much of it aside and called all of my suspicions jealousy because my relationship with my sister was more important. But it didn’t matter half as much to her. Her ego has gotten stroked for years on years, and they finally let it all come out and rear its ugly head. I was just flat out offended, especially that they through everything out as though we didn’t matter as much as Bebe. They’d thrown everything out. I was just so mad that I ended up leaving, and my parents yelled at me for “causing drama.”

I told my siblings about what had happened because I thought they had a right to know that their trophies got removed, and I did try to sound unbiased. It didn’t really work, because my whole family is in a dramatic sinkhole. My younger brother called our parents sobbing, my older sister has been playing passive aggressive and just flat out aggressive phone tag with Bebe, and my little sister was so upset she just called me bawling. I’ve been trying to do damage control, but everyone else is just mad for what’s happened. We all got a text from Bebe that basically read like “I’m sorry I’m better than you, but I deserve our parents’ love more than you” which naturally got everybody riled up again and just caused more problems. This has been basically the worst week of my life and I hate it so... Yeah. There’s my update. My family won’t speak to one another and we’re all in a big dramatic mess.

TL;DR: I figured out that my parents had thrown out all my trophies in favor of my sister’s, and now my family is melting down into a heap of drama and it’s mostly my fault."

The situation is basically the title, but it goes a little bit deeper than that. 

My boyfriend [23M] and I just had our baby girl last month. My parents are a 20 hour drive from us and as such we haven't seen them since I was about 34 weeks. They wanted to come visit for a week in a couple of weeks to see how we're getting on and were going to bring the gifts that they got for my baby shower that they were unfortunately unable to attend. We were super excited to see them and for them to meet their grand baby, but as it's flu season I made sure to tell them to get shots and also to make sure their tDap was updated. 

Now, my boyfriend is white. My parents are from Melanesia, and have this belief that just by being Melanesian they're basically immune to everything. My dad is like this especially. He's of the opinion that they don't need shots because my baby isn't some ""weak"" white kid and won't get sick. They refuse to be vaccinated because apparently my daughter's immune system will just automatically be the best ever because she's not fully white. I told my parents that until they get shots they're going to have to stay home. This has caused a massive argument and my dad isn't speaking to me at all. My mom only talks to me to tell me how upset they are at me. What do I do? 

Tl;dr:I My parents are not talking to me because I said they needed vaccines to visit my newborn. What do I do?"

My sister was murdered by our neighbor when she was 12. Our father has never been in the picture so ever since then it's been me and my mom.

When mom was dying of pancreatic cancer in 2010, she made me promise I'd always go to the parole hearings of my sister's killer to try and make sure he doesn't get out. I did promise her at the time I'd always go. 

I had to go to another parole hearing alone this morning and I just *can't* anymore. I can't keep going back there every two years and begging these people to understand what we've gone through and why he shouldn't be out here with the rest of us. I kind of want to just let it go and let fate take over. 

I have to drive five hours each way for these hearings and I spend the whole ride there wanting to vomit. Even when he gets denied parole I spend the entire drive back wanting to break down sobbing because of having to relive the whole thing.

My question is: Am I a terrible person for even thinking about breaking my promise? I have a feeling if I did stop going and he was paroled, I'd just... I know I'd blame myself. But to keep going there every two years is also gd awful. 

I've been going to therapy and my therapist said I need to protect my mental health, but I don't know. I feel shitty for even thinking about it.

TL;DR - Promised Mom I'd oppose parole for my sister's killer every time he came up for it. I'm considering not going anymore, feel awful.

25,"My wife [44/F] yelled at our autistic daughter [16/F] while she was experiencing sensory overload, I [45/M] don’t know how to feel


My wife and I have been married for 18 years. We had a lot of plans when we were younger- big house, big family. Instead, we had our daughter and my wife had gone through a fairly traumatic labor so Noelle is our only. Both of us have agreed we wouldn’t have it any other way. Noelle is autistic, but we’ve made sure that she has all the tools to succeed. She’s becoming more independent as time goes on, because I don’t want her to feel like she can’t achieve. She’s got resources through schools and is incredibly smart, planning on going to an out of state school once she’s graduated. At her last school, she had a good group of friends that she was comfortable with, but we moved to a new area over winter break for a variety of reasons. Noelle has a lot of trouble with sensory overload, which we can’t really control. Usually when she gets overloaded, she just curls up in a ball and we wait for her to calm down. She also hates to be touched, something that’s been difficult for our new neighbors and her peers to really understand. We get a lot of complaints from the school saying she’s had a meltdown because of boundary issues. That reaction can be more varied. Sometimes, it’s just a quick shaking them off. If she’s already having a rough day, it can be a full on meltdown. It’s a bit of a learning curve. The move has also put some stress on her, but Noelle is handling it like a champ, and I’m really happy.

We moved to a more affluent neighborhood, and my wife has been desperate to impress. Last night, she invited some of the neighbors over for a dinner party, and we sort of expressed the expectations for what would happen to Noelle, since she likes to be prepared before doing new things. Noelle did really well at the start, but things started getting loud and food was coming out, and it was a little too much. She’d also been complaining of a stomachache earlier in the day, so it probably contributed to the stress. Noelle started wandering into the kitchen, and my wife followed her. I hadn’t been paying attention, this has all been relayed to me by my daughter, backed up by my wife (with different phrasing.) Noelle was starting to really shut down because the kitchen was louder, so she went into her ball, and my wife started shouting for her to get up, which Noelle didn’t do. My wife grabbed Noelle, and she started to scream because she doesn’t like being touched when she’s melting down. My wife was trying to pull Noelle up, and Noelle was screaming and kicking. My wife started screaming at Noelle, and by that point, everyone could hear it. I came into the kitchen, got my wife off Noelle, and she went back out like nothing had happened. It took Noelle about 5 hours to calm down and get off the floor. I just sat with her because it was important for me to just to watch her, especially being in the kitchen with unfamiliar caterers. Everything settled down, I got Noelle to bed, and started talking to my wife.

My wife said Noelle had ruined everything, including her life, and that she was the reason we’d never had anymore kids. I didn’t want to argue, just said that she needed to respect Noelle’s boundaries. She said that she didn’t need to, Noelle needed to start acting more “normal”, otherwise she didn’t get to go to college. My wife said she never gets to feel proud of our daughter because everything she does is always “undercut by weirdness.” I pointed out that she’s autistic, not weird, and my wife started talking about kids that you can’t even tell they’re autistic. At that point, I figured she was just tired and stressed, so I said we should both go to bed. Noelle woke up early feeling sick, and I stayed home with her. My wife and I haven’t spoken, even though we usually talk before she goes into work. When I said Noelle wasn’t feeling well, my wife just turned over in bed. I feel like something snapped, and I don’t know where I’m at. How should I talk to her about this? Is she justified? I mean, where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My wife screamed at our autistic daughter while she was having a shutdown."

Link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7u0x0y/my_18m_friendcrush_24f_asked_me_out_and_i_really/

I felt like I owed an update to everyone who responded. I came to the conclusion that I’d have nothing to lose by going on one date with her. 

We went to a nice restaurant. It didn't feel like there was a big maturity difference between us because I made her laugh, she made me laugh, and our chemistry was good. Some people gave us stares, but we didn't care and we even made a few jokes about it. Afterwards she kissed me, and thanked me for giving her a good time. She asked if I wanted to come over to her apartment and I said sure.

We talked about our interests for an hour and watched a few episodes of Black Mirror (the new season is great). I was getting deeply invested in the episode we were watching until she made an obvious sexual advance towards me. I felt uncomfortable because I didn't expect to have sex on a first date (OKAY maybe I should've) and the episode we watched set the mood way off for having sex.

She asked if her advance came off too strong and I told her that I wasn't comfortable having sex on a first date. Instead we made out and snuggled in bed until we fell asleep, but the next morning I kept thinking about this one reply I wrote: 

&gt; I'm afraid that she wants to date me for the wrong reasons, and maybe she'll unintentionally hurt me in some way because of the age gap.

Despite having a great time and spending the last 16 hours with this gorgeous woman whom I've had a crush on for ages, I still couldn't shake that feeling out of my head. I told her everything regarding my worry about the age gap, and I even showed her the post I made. She listened to everything I said, and told me it was okay to feel this way. She told me I was acting mature for bringing up the age gap, because usually when she dated younger guys she'd have to be the one to do it. She offered to stay as friends and maybe in the future when I'm older we could revisit a relationship. I accepted her offer.

**tl;dr:** I went on a date with my friend, and I had a lot of fun. She invited me over to her place, and she made an obvious sexual advance towards me while we were watching a Black Mirror episode. I felt uncomfortable and declined. Instead we made out and snuggled in bed together until we fell asleep. I still had concerns about our age gap in the morning despite having a good time with her. I told her my concerns, she offered to stay as friends and maybe in the future we could revisit a relationship. I agreed. We're still good friends."

30,"Boyfriend (26m) after one year of being with me (26f) tells me he has never loved me and states he is a sociopath that has never loved, even his parents. How can someone be with someone else if they don't like them? And how can I cope because I feel like I'm losing my reality.


The start of our relationship was a lot like fireworks. I was sort of seeing his friend so we got to know each other while hanging out. He was cute, charming, witty and thoughtful. We liked the same things and had the same sense of humor. As soon as I stopped seeing his friend, we hung out and ended up sleeping together. He immediately said I was his girlfriend which I didn't think much of since I was head over heels into this guy, and asked me to move in. I wasn't ready for that so I said no and he replied whenever you're ready. The next year was the greatest I ever had. We did so many things together (paid to take me to see the snow, visited his sister in another state) and our families met and got along. Our lives were super intertwined. He bought me a new laptop since I didn't have a computer and always took me out to eat (trying to show he wasn't using me for money). He would do little things that I thought was cute and we had a billion catch phrases. He never said anything about not being happy.

I knew his emotional limitations. He didn't show strong emotions and I was okay with that. As someone who is all emotions, it was refreshing to me and we equaled each other out. He was very blunt and direct but that was also attractive since honesty is very important to me. 

A few days ago we agreed to talk about moving in together and he said he was interested in the idea. So when the talk started he said he didn't want to move in right now. When I asked why he said it's because he doesn't feel strongly for me. He said since we started dating. He thought he would eventually like me more but it didn't happen. He knew what he was going to do that day and he still slept with me the night before and went out with my friends. He called himself a sociopath, said he's never felt love even towards his parents and couldn't say much more. I asked him, ""are you breaking up with me?"" and with a short pause he replied, ""yes.""

What was real? Why would he do all these things with me and for me if he didn't feel it? I feel like my whole relationship was a lie and I'm an idiot for not seeing it.

TL;DR: boyfriend out of nowhere says he doesn't love me or feel strongly for me. Was it a lie?

31,"My (25F) younger sister (19F) is the golden child and she’s going through a rough time. My Dad (48M) is pissed because I refuse to give her anymore help.


My younger sister is(was?) the golden child. I CONSTANTLY got compared to her. 

She always had amazing grades, while mine were average. She’s the logical thinking one, while I was the artist and my dad could never understand what the big deal behind me taking a picture was. Even when I sold an entire photo series I took for $500 a pop, still wasn’t impressive. 

I was the emotional basket case, that was going to end up knocked up out of high school and become a total mess, while she was emotionally strong was going to be successful, she was always great at saving money, while I went shopping for things I wanted...you get the gist. 

When I was diagnosed with depression, my Dad never failed to remind me that I was a huge emotional and financial burden taking away attention from his other children because of my “temper tantrums” (suicide attempts, break downs)

Nothing I did was ever good enough compared to what my sister did. My dad was *SUPER* shitty to me growing up. On my 13th birthday I got banned from my cake ceremony for leaving a book in the middle of the floor. My family ate my birthday cake without me.  I got grounded for an entire summer for bringing home C’s. I didn’t get a graduation party. The list goes on. 

I will say that she was compared to me by all our teachers when she went through school after me. But my Dad quickly shut that down. 

After graduation from HS, I cut off all ties with my Dad. Didn’t talk to him until last year and it’d been 5 years. The only reason why was because my younger sister had a kid. Her BD is a TOTAL SHITBAG! 

I’ve helped her out a few times in the past, but I’ve since stopped because she always takes advantage of me helping her out and I’m tired of being walked all over. 

Well now my Dad is pissed at me for not being more willing to help her out. I really want to tell him to screw off, because I’m not a bank or a charity that can just give me my resources whenever she needs them.  At the same time, she’s my younger sister and I feel guilty for not wanting to help. Like I said, I can’t finance her life and mine, and I don’t really want to. 

Part of me wants to cut ties with my sister as well and just keep it pushing. She’s my sister and I don’t want to sever my relationship with her, because my dad is a douche. But I’m tired of her playing the victim and running to him every time I can’t give her gas money or pay for her to take an Uber to work. Or I don’t want to give her money for diapers and formula. I didn’t have this kid, so it’s not my responsibility to provide for her. 

\*TL:DR My sister is the golden child who keeps taking advantage of me helping her out. Now my Dad is pissed because I refused to continue to help her. "

33,"Me [29F] with my husband [30M] struggling with cultural differences in my extended family especially regarding our baby [9months]. How to peacefully resolve?


I am a Latina woman, married to a white man. I hope this is the right place for this.

Technically, I am half-Latina. While my father is American, I have a proud Venezuelan mother. She grew up in the slums (for lack of a better English word) of Caracas and brought herself, and many of our extended family members over the years, to the United States - teaching herself English, getting her Master's degree, and starting a whole new life from literally nothing. I admire her and her struggle, as well as those of my family, more than I admire anything in this world. 

I ended up with a relatively privileged childhood and college experience. I got a full ride at a small elite undergraduate program and ended up in one of the top 3 MBA programs in the country/the world. This has caused some minor tension with my family, who sometimes thinks my pedigree makes me act like I'm ""better than them."" Generally it's been resolved, but they are a prideful group and this lurks under the surface.

Along the way, I met my brilliant husband. He is kind, passionate, and has been my partner in every way imaginable. He is also extremely progressive socially, which is something I greatly admire and agree with him on. 

The issue is that my mom's side of the family is definitely not progressive in the way you picture it. They are warm, fiercely loving, and would give you the shirt off their back without a second thought. They are fun as hell and in many ways more accepting of differences than the majority of white people that I know.

But they are... Venezuelan, and socioeconomically poor Venezuelan at that (no *sifrinos* here - this is the worst thing someone in my family could call you). They make crude jokes. They strongly believe in gender roles. They aren't particularly LGBTQ friendly. They are big proponents of superstitions, old wives tales, and they will come close to physically fighting you if you're dismissive about the validity of astrology (for instance). They are fierce defenders of a domestic matriarchal hierarchy. Etc., etc., etc.

In the beginning, my husband sort of took the bad with the good in stride and kept his opinions to himself, even when he disagreed with the topic or manner at hand. 


But now we have a child, and he's becoming more and more wary of my family's beliefs and practices. He doesn't want her around people who will make her feel like her female sex makes her more delicate. He *hates* when my cousins call her ""princess"" when she's sweet or ""diva"" when she cries (again, I'm translating, but essentially). He barked angrily at my grandmother about bodily autonomy when she suggested that we pierce her ears. He sneered when an auntie offered to do our daughter's astrology chart. 

And he has been butting heads with my mom nonstop, hating that my mom feels like she has any position of authority simply because she is abuela. He feels disrespected as a father and my mom feels disrespected as a grandmother (she gave her mother and MIL lots more leeway than my husband is willing to give her - I assume she feels cheated out of the traditional experience and it's causing some serious strife.).

It kind of came to a head this weekend when a cousin of mine made a crass joke that was pretty homophobic in nature. I am not defending the joke in any way, but it is one that is extremely common and also relatively mild compared to some of what you can hear. I think they thought it wasn't one that would upset my husband, and it was actually at effort at trying to censor himself, even though the overall content was still unacceptable. My husband slammed his hand on the table, told my cousin in no uncertain terms that he can never speak that way around his daughter, and put my daughter in her stroller and left. I went with him because I believe in the united front. But I am dealing with considerable fall-out from my family, who feel alienated and shunned for things that are very commonplace in their culture and like my husband suddenly hates them. They also are bringing back up the whole, ""educated white people who think they're better than us"" narrative again in subtle ways.

To be very clear, **I do not disagree with my husband on these matters.** I do believe there are ways to incorporate my mom's culture in my daughter's upbringing without supporting the negative aspects. A lot of the bigotry, machismo, and sexism can and should be phased out with new generations, and I recognize that this kind of macro shift has to start at the micro level. 

But at the same time, I love my family. They are imperfect, but I don't think my husband quite grasps how much of this is truly cultural, rather than them just being hateful people and bad influences on our daughter. 

I am also scared that eventually my daughter will see Latin culture as less-than - that my husband's response will make her hyper focused on the negative, rather than an imperfect part of a rich cultural background that means a lot to me and I hope will someday mean a lot to her. She is only 25% Latina, so it will already be a struggle to get her to connect to this part of her heritage. My family is rougher around the edges than my husband's family; they are liberal, wealthy, and mild-mannered. My family is loud and often crass and they fight like the stereotypes, to be honest. I'm realistic about the fact that it will already be ""foreign"" to my daughter and I admit I feel protective about ensuring that she has affection for Latin culture, even if it's not as comfortable compared to what she will always be surrounded by. There are obviously issues in white culture as well, but because white culture is considered the default, I worry she won't see those issues as inherent in the same way that it can be applied to Latin culture.

My husband says he doesn't disagree with me, but presses me for practical solutions for how to handle my family when they do things that go against our shared values. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I come up short.

So I wonder if anyone on Reddit has any suggestions? Have you been through this on either side? Or just have wisdom to share? Anything would be appreciated. I worry I'm too close to the situation to see the bigger picture and objective pathways forward, and would appreciate the thoughts of others.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My family is an imperfect, very culturally Latin family from a rough socioeconomic background. They say and do things that go against my husband and my shared progressive values, but I feel like my husband is being too adversarial in dealing with it especially in regard to our daughter. I worry about how to balance the good and the bad with my mom's culture for her, so that she loves and respects it even if she can acknowledge that there are some deep-seated issues. Any advice on how to navigate this without my husband and extended family becoming completely opposed to each other would be appreciated."

35,"I [30M] can't stand the 100s of pictures and other annoying things my wife [29F] does now that we have a baby. She is driving me crazy.


We've been married for 3 years come June. Never really had any problems. This is the first time I can ever remember being so annoyed and frustrated by her. 

We had our first child a couple of months ago, and since then she has become one of those moms that takes dozens if not hundreds of pictures of our son each day and tried to document or save every tiny thing he does - real or imagined - even though a lot of it just isn't significant in my opinion. It is ridiculous. I know she is crazy about him and I am too, but it's not like at this point he is even doing anything worth obsessing over that much. Sure, take a couple a day for FB and Instagram if you need to and for our family, but there is no need for so many. 

I wouldn't even care if not for the fact that whenever we go somewhere she makes us take tons of photos - photos before we leave, tons when we get there and then more when we get home to reflect and ""capture the day"". I can't enjoy spending time with my family because she bothers me so much with pictures. It's like having a photography session every day where you have to do different poses and so on.

Even if we are home, she ""needs"" me to take tons of pictures with me and our son. I just don't get why you need tons of photos of me holding him. He's not even awake or doing anything most of the time!

It's gotten to the point where I am seriously concerned that this will be the rest of my life, and the strange thing is before we had our son she was not like this at all.  

She is like this with other things too. 

The constant need to talk about him to strangers is embarrassing. She can meet someone in the grocery store she doesn't even know and spend 30 minutes telling them everything in the world about our son. 

How perfect she needs everything to be and her obsession with the idea that she is always failing, which is part of the reason I think we make no progress with the other problems. 

I have tried to talk her out of some of this, but I feel like my words fall on death ears. Either I am met with a ""you just don't understand"" or a ""why don't you think this is important"". It just feels hopeless. 
 
 I don't know what to do, but she is driving me crazy. I love her dearly, but I find it so hard to be around her like this so lately I have been staying later at work to avoid a bit of the craziness and even though I feel bad for doing that I am glad to have the peace. 

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

We also have our own bathrooms so we don't use each others. 


This week I was working longer hours than usual and I had to travel interstate for couple of days for an important conference so I hadn't had a chance to clean up a lot. Though I had cleaned my bathroom a bit (took the rubbish out, cleaned the toilet bowl etc) I hadn't mopped the floors or any thorough cleaning but it wasn't like rubbish was everywhere. 



Anyway while I was away, she sends me a longgggg passive aggressive text. Apearantly she saw a cockroach in front of my door, and she had to get in to my room to get the cockroach (which I call complete bs on). Then she goes on a long rant how I need to make sure my room is clean and heavily implies that my room attracted the bugs. She then talks about how I need to scrub my toilet bowl more to keep it in ""top notch condition"" and that she left cleaning products so that I can clean the bathroom floor and miror. She would have had to enter my room and go through into my bathroom and inspected the toilet bowl - in order to make such a comment. Must have been a hell of a cockroach chase. 



I feel like she invaded my private space and I feel incredibly uncomfortable about the situation. Furthermore, few weeks back, I noticed my mail had been torn open and left on the table. She had gone through my mail!. At the sake of avoiding confrontation I had kept quite but now I just feel unsafe in my own home. 



 I pay my rent on the dot, I pay the bills. I have a right to my privacy. Ive even paid 2 months deposit so if she thinks anything is ruined she can take out of that later on.


 She has a dog that sheds hair like crazy onto everything, I never complain, heck I look after her dog most nights while shes out and on my off days when shes not around. Ive been trying to be nice to her and to my face she acts nice but then goes behind my back and does this.   
 
 
I havent responded to her text so shes been texting me in a row telling me that she didn't want to come across wrong or that she didnt want to invade my privacy but that she ""had to"" enter my room. 


I'm definitely moving out but I'm just wondering how or if I should respond to her texts. I don't want to respond to her at all but she seems to be annoyed that I havent responded asap already. I'm returning from my trip soon and I don't want to argue with her but at the same time, i don't want her to think this behaviour is okay. I tried avoiding saying anything before with the mail and it just escalated. 


Any tips on how to approach this in the most professional manner ?

39,"Brother (26M) ended up in jail after I let him use my 2nd car. His Gf (49F) has the car and is dragging her feet to return it and wants me to sign the title over to her. I (24F) don't want to give her the car.


So back story of how all this started, I was a driving a 20 yr old station wagon that frequently stopped working. My father decided to purchase me a used Prius, on the condition that I let my brother use the wagon. Hes addicted to Meth, was supposedly getting clean (surprise, he wasn't) and this was on the long list of things my dad has done to enable him. Hes dating a woman almost twice his age who also has drug problems. 

I agreed to let him use the car, not realizing the car was still technically in my name. He did something, cops showed up at my house at 12:30 AM hunting for him, scaring the life out of my Fiance and me. They finally find him and he was arrested. The cops left the car with his girlfriend, despite the car not being insured and her not having a license.

She now fully expects me to sign the car over to her. Shes basically holding the keys hostage until I do. I do not want to do this. I don't like her, I never have. I would rather sell it, as I'm in a bit of a financial situation being a full time student without a steady job and I could really use the few hundred the car may be worth.

How do I get the car back? Am I a terrible person for wanting to take it back? Should I just cave and sign it over? 

TLDR: Brother got arrested, GF holding my lended car hostage so I'll sign over the title to her and I hate confrontation. 
"
40,"My [24F] sister-in-law [35F] has finally crossed the line with her hatred for my father.


My brother [36M] has been married to my sister in law for 3 years, they have a 10 year old daughter together and have been in a relationship for about 15 years. Before she got pregnant, my sister in law was not allowed in our family home because of some rude comments she made to family friends and for poking around at my parents mail and my mother’s jewelry box. My parents finally agreed to let her in the house and put their differences aside when she got pregnant and we realized she’d probably be sticking around for a while. My SIL and my parents still do not like each other but at least now they complain about each other behind closed doors. 

 It is important to note that 12 years ago my father had an accident that resulted in him discovering he has a mystery disease. The current hypothesis is that it’s something he caught that has been dormant since he was in an earthquake in Guatemala in the 70s when he was there as an exchange student and stayed to bury bodies and help with disaster relief. The disease has  caused him to have half his leg amputated and next week he is going in to get the rest of his leg amputated due to more complications from the disease. Because of this he has not walked in 12 years and cannot wear a prosthetic leg due to his weakening bones. This has caused a lot of strain for the family along with a lot of mental health issues as everyone has a hard time dealing with this because the disease seems to be incurable and we just don’t know at what point they will have to stop cutting off limbs. 

  While visiting my brother, my SIL starts talking about karma. I tell her I don’t believe in karma in the typical sense. SIL continues to say that karma is definitely real and she knows this because now my father is being punished by karma with his disease because he used to “be not so nice” to my SIL. My brother immediately told her to stop talking because her comment was uncalled for and insensitive. I tried to ignore it but it has been on my mind ever since. I left shortly after this happened and cried in my car on the way home. I think it’s unbelievable that she could be so insensitive and uncaring towards my father at such a hard time for him and our family. She didn’t even show any compassion for me and my brother who are clearly upset about our father. How do I handle this? Do I say something? Do I tell my father (I would want to know)? Or should I ignore it and let her deal with her feelings the way she seems fit as long as she keeps her mouth shut around my father?

Tl;dr:  SIL has said something incredibly rude about my sick father. I’m unsure how to proceed with my relationship with her."
41,"Friend (25M) of ours got diagnosed with HIV. I (23F) know that my other friend (24F) cheated on her boyfriend with him. She doesn't know that I know. Both parties refuse to admit that they had sex, and my friend refuses to get tested and is in complete denial.


I know this guy michael, hes my friend sort of on the outside of my main friend group. Anyways, one day, he hung out with my friend group and we all got pretty wasted at my apartment. I told him he could sleep on the couch because there was a blizzard. He slept in only his boxers, nothing else, which was weird but whatever. 

I was awake most of the night (I did adderall that night) and I heard him talking to my roommate, cheryl. I specifically heard cheryl say ""oh god sorry, im in my underwear, i didnt even know you were there"". Cheryl was really drunk that night, she went to the kitchen to make food in the middle of the night, and michael must have been flirting with her. I heard him say ""its okay, im in my underwear too"" in a sort of seductive accent, and I already knew what was going on. I heard giggling and whispering, couldnt make out what they were saying behind the door. Then some more talking, then I heard moaning and thumping noises against the wall, then eventually I heard michael do a loud moan after like 5-6 minutes, presumably ending their encounter. I also heard ""its too big"" from cheryl, so I know that they actually had sex, not just foreplay. Judging from where they were, I didn't hear michael go to his jeans or jacket, which were hung up in the closet nearby. Unless one of them had a condom in their underwear, they didnt use one. Both of them were drunk, like slurring words, giggling drunk. I think its because we all did adderall that night and adderall makes you drink more, and when it wears off all the alcohol hits you at once. Then like 2 minutes later, cheryl went to the bathroom and vomited, a lot. 

Cheryl has been dating this guy Emilio for the past 5 years. I know its a shitty thing to do to Emilio, I am not gonna defend her actions. I didn't tell a soul, including cheryl, about what I knew happened that night. She thought I was asleep. She was drunk, really hot half naked guy is on the couch, shes already in her underwear... whatever. I decided it wasn't the biggest deal in the world and brushed it off my mind. Emilio and cheryl spend a ton of time away from each other, often months at a time. 

Fast forward 3-4 months, Michael tells me, secretly, that he was diagnosed with HIV, and that he is moving back to california with his friend and that I cannot tell a single soul. Why? He told me he had been doing heroin. That is how he got the HIV. He said this absolutely cannot spread, because he will be shunned from his family if anyone finds out. He said for a straight man to get diagnosed with HIV it can mean one of two things, you are secretly gay, or you're doing heroin. I was obviously shocked beyond comprehension, and I told him, right then and there, ""I know you fucked cheryl, please let her know or I will"" and he just looked at me like a deer in the headlights, and denied the whole thing, then said he needs to go. 

I was really confused. And I decided I have to tell cheryl if he is not going to. So I met her at the apartment, told her that she has to get tested, because I know she had sex with emilio that night. At first, I wanted to JUST tell her to get tested, not tell her its HIV, because if its nothing at all and she didn't get it, then that is keeping michaels secret. She, as with michael, looked at me confused and got mad at me for accusing her of cheating on emilio. She got really mad and told me to drop it, and that she doesnt need to get tested because that never happened. 

I have been bugging her on and off for 4 days now. She gets more and more mad. She says shes not getting tested, that's ridiculous. I realized that she is quite a bit in denial about this. 

What am I supposed to do? Tell emilio? She isn't seeing him for another 2 months. There is time to wait, for now. How do I get to her? This is HIV we're talking about. I know she hasn't gone, I work from home, and she hasn't had work at all this week. We both have been in the apartment. Unless she snuck out and did it, then maybe, but I doubt it.

42,"Me [15F] with my mom [50F] we used to crochet together and she died and my brother [27M] donated the supplies to goodwill. He’s sorry but I’m so upset


My mom died on Christmas Eve last year from a brain aneurysm. I️ miss her very much. My mom taught me how to crochet when I️ was 6. We used to watch TV together and crochet.  

My dad has never been around and my brother took me in when she died. He’s awesome. We donated some stuff to goodwill last week. I️ told him he could donate a dark red box in my room which had old books. The bright red box next to it contained all the yarn my mom left behind and her crochet needles. It was mostly cheap stuff but had some nice materials mixed in.

I️ realized the next day that we still had the dark red box but the bright red one was gone. I️ promptly freaked out and my brother realized what happened.

He’s been trying to track it down and went to the goodwill store to try to get back the supplies. But they refused to help and said they can’t return donations.

Today he finally gave up. I️ haven’t been able to stop crying since. I️ miss my mom so much. When I️ used her hooks I️ felt like she was there. I️ could imagine her picking out the yarn..

My brother feels awful. I️ just don’t know how to move on. I️ don’t have any mom figures in my life and I️ miss it and now I️ feel like I️ lost my link to my mommy.

I’ve forgiven my brother but my heart hurts and I️ can’t stop crying. I️ want to know how to make this into a positive event or make it less bad.

45,"UPDATE: I [25F] found out my Dad [50M] is behaving inappropriately (sexual) at his job


My first post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69nwi2/i_25f_found_out_my_dad_50m_is_behaving/

Hi, I know I posted this months in the past. Things are very different now. I remembered the post and thought I should tell the forum what happened.

This month my parents will finalize their divorce. My dad has lied to my mom a lot about the matters of the first post. I took the advice to tell my mom about the pictures I found on my dad's laptop. (Summary: While removing a virus I discovered he had photos and video of women's feet inside the shoe store he runs. The opinion of the forum was he has foot fetish and should not be practicing it at work with unknowing people. Many people said I should tell my mother.)

So I told her, and I remember when I told her she had weird reaction, she said ""Oh God he still does it?"" It turns out she caught him having these pictures in the past.

She told me, that 2 years ago when she caught him trying to cheat through emails, it was asking for pictures of feet. After that she searched the rest of his phone and found feet pictures from the store. There were some pictures of shoes there that he masturbated on. When she saw these, she only told me and my sister that he tried to cheat, not the whole story. So until now that was all I knew.

She continued to tell me more. After she caught him 2 years ago, she told him to stop cheating online, taking creepy pictures of customers, and masturbating with shoes he sold. She started to look at his phone sometimes since then to check and hadn't seen anything bad. But I realised it's because he uploads photos to the cloud, deletes from phone, then saves to his laptop. She doesn't have access to the laptop so she never finds it. 

That was the first part of my mother's story. She was very upset to realise he kept doing it and hides it. 

I asked should we warn his business partner because maybe he can make him stop. From your advice I also told her about legal problems are possible. But she started to cry and said if he still does it, then his partner does too. His partner has the same fetish. That's the second part of her story.

What happened was, when she discovered all the stuff 2 years ago, she asked why he does it and he denied doing anything a lot at first but then said it's a 'side' business. They both take these pictures of people's feet who don't know and then sell them on the internet. I guess guys on the internet with this fetish buy 'candid' photos of feet. In his shop is easy place to take those pictures together and make a lot of money. 

He got angry at her and said he knew she wouldn't like it, but we need the money (if you remember, my family was poor immigrants) and she should thank him. He believed he didn't hurt anyone. My mom told him it was the wrong way to make extra money and thought they, or at least he, stopped it. Because after that she didn't see more pictures. 

She never told anyone about this. Only me because I brought it up after my last post. She feels a lot of shame and disgust. She blames herself for not noticing and not being more strict at the time. She also blames herself for not paying attention to his fetish in the past, and seeing the 'red flag.' They were arranged marriage at a young age, and in our home country it was hard life. Sometimes we were in danger so with these things his fetish was not the big problem and she didn't notice it often. Then when we came here and he took work at the shoe shop, and then became co-owner, and she found the pictures, then she saw signs in the past that he had foot fetish problem. It was too late because he had the job and supported our family. 

After we talked she realised what has been going on the whole time. He and his partner never stopped. The next month, we tried to convince him to stop and suggested therapy (this was another advice my first post got.) He refused therapy, and kept hiding pictures.

Because of the dishonesty and shame, my mother was led to divorce. She can't trust him. She told her lawyer what he does. I don't know what will happen but there is a investigation.

Financially I think we will be ok. My older brother, who lived in another state, transferred here to help support Mom. His company employs him here now. My older sister also got another job. We will all support eachother.

I have to face the fact I never truly knew my dad. He was a good father and always wanted to protect us. I didn't know he did this too. He was strict, but good to me and my siblings, but not to my mother or other women. We still say he should try professional help; he denies. He pretends this never happened, he thinks my mom is going crazy. I can't change that but I hope he'll get better one day.

Thank everyone for reading and advising my first post. Sorry for any bad English.

Tl;dr: I learned from my mom that my dad took foot fetish pictures with his business partner for years, to sell online. She told him years ago to stop but he hid it. He also tried to cheat on her. He doesn't believe he did wrong. Now they're divorcing because she doesn't trust him."
46,"My [15f] step-mom [45f] told my new boyfriend [16m] that I’m the result of my dad’s [57m] affair. I feel absolutely humiliated!


School was let out esrly yesterday because our water wasn’t working. It was kind of a mess because there weren’t enough busses and everyone was trying to pack into the ones that were there.

My new boyfriend (been dating like a month) saw me waiting to get on a bus and asked if I would like to just get a ride home in his car. I agreed and he took me home.

We got to my house and we were having a really good conversation so I just sat in his car in the driveway for a few minutes talking to him.

I think I need to explain here, I’m not originally from around here. I lived with my mom about an hour away up until she died a couple years ago. Also, my dad had an affair with my mom. You know, just about 15 years plus nine months ago. I moved here to live with my dad and his wife after mom died. Dad is alright, but my stepmom I dont think likes me very much. She doesnt really talk to me or pay attention to me, and she points out that Im the result of an affair alot.

So anyway, we were sitting in my bf’s car and my stepmom came out, I guess because she saw a strange car in the driveway.

We got out, and my boyfriend said he was sorry for sitting in the driveway and he was trying to be polite to her. My stepmom was (weirdly, for her) being pretty nice back to him. Then my bf said something about the family moving from the place I used to live. Like, he assumed we had all moved from there as a family, I think.

And my stepmom told him “Oh, *we* didnt move from there, she just moved from there after her mom died.” My bf was just standing there kind of wideeyed and I didnt know what to say so we were just quiet. And then my stepmom continued “Did she tell you she came from my husband’s affair? We didn’t have a choice but to take her.”

My boyfriend was looking back and forth like he had no idea what to say and I was getting tears in my eyes. My stepmom then just said she was glad to have met my bf and then went inside smiling. Like, she had a really mean smile, and its really upsetting me to think about it. Why did she have to smile??

My boyfriend just turned to me and gave me a long hug until I stopped crying and he said he thought it was a really mean thing to say and he was sorry it happened. He had to go to work after that so he didnt stay around.

I wound up crying in bed last night because I was so humiliated. Like, this is the first boy I’ve ever dated and I think I’ve really fallen in love with him, I don’t know why she had to say that and now I get super humiliated when I remember that he knows about how I’m the result of an affair now.

He found me before school today and basically said he felt like I was still really embarassed and he promised me that he wouldn’t tell anyone about it and that it doesn’t change what he thinks of me. I was really glad to hear that but I still want to go crawl in a hole when I remember her saying that. My bf offered me another ride home together when school lets out today, so I think he really meant what he said, but I’m still gonna be really embarassed around him for a long time and I dont want to ruin our relationship!


Help me, please??

47,"My [19M] friend [22F] of 2 years started a rumour that we had sex with each other, and convinced our friend group to pressure me into dating her. I'm questioning our friendship now.


I slept at her house a few days ago, and she sent a picture to our friends about it. The next morning I received congratulations from every male member of our group. I asked one of them what they were applauding me for, and he said ""Congratulations on losing your virginity, you two would make a great couple.""

I only learned who started this rumour after my best friend said it was her, because she wanted to date me. 

I can't hang out with our friends without someone bringing it up. Everyone is pressuring me into dating her, even the female portion of our group has started doing it. I've told them to stop but none of them have listened to me and say I should give her a chance. I'm extremely annoyed at this. 

I'm not surprised she was the one that did this. She's ambitious, shrewd and the definition of gregarious. She's always been the leader of our group, and plans almost every event. It wouldn't have been hard for her to convince everyone of her plan because of her excellent people skills.

But I don't like her in that way, and even if I did the way she went about it concerns me. Perhaps if she just told me about her feelings like a normal non-manipulative person would, I might've given her a chance, but at this rate it's not happening. 

If she's able to go through this much effort and I turn her down, how will she react to that, and what will she do? I'm genuinely concerned because I feel like she'll turn our whole friend group against me if I reject her. Help.

49,"My [32F] wife is a SAHM [30F] and has a major shopping addiction. After 3 years of this I want to leave.


May be errors since I'm using mobile. 

So I've been with my wife for 7 years, married for 4. We have one daughter age 2. 

Three years ago, before our daughter was born, my wife wanted to quit working and focus on having a family. I agreed and she was a stay at home wife for a while. She got pregnant not long after that and things were ok at first. Maybe halfway through her pregnancy she started shopping online. Every day. At first she said it was because she was bored and she liked finding deals for the home/baby. Then it got worse. The baby came and her shopping only intensified. She started buying clothes for herself, the baby, the house, me, her sisters, her mom, her neighbor, etc. Literally just to shop. 

Obviously I was angry and we had fights over this multiple times. We've tried to set a budget for her dozens of times, nothing ever stuck. I even helped her find a professional therapist specializing in shopping addictions, and that didn't work either. More therapists, no progress, rinse and repeat. We are up to our 10th professional therapist now

At this point I am worn out. I make good money but not nearly enough for her to spend like this. She spends roughly $800 every week on crap we don't need, mostly clothes for herself at this point because she's gotten addicted to buying designer clothes online again. I am so sick of it. I can't keep trying to fix this problem myself without her wanting to lift a finger. But then every time I talk to someone about separating and filing for divorce, I get called a monster for wanting to leave my jobless wife and young daughter. I don't want to leave my daughter, I just want my wife gone. 

Am I really so horrible to be considering divorce at this point? I know my wife is sick somehow but after 3 years of me trying everything I can and seeing no progress, I realize I don't care what happens to her anymore. I just want my old life back. What should I do?

Edit: Title should have [32M]. I'm a man.

**tldr**: Wife has had a terrible shopping addiction for the past 3 years. No progress. I am worn out and I want to leave with my daughter. Everyone tells me I'd be a monster to do so. What do I do?"

51,"My friends (28/30F) lied to me (28M) about the way my girlfriend (29F) died


My girlfriend and I were together for 3 years. We met when I was 23, and were great friends before we dated. To me, our relationship was great. We got along incredibly, had common interests, truly loved each other, were in tune to the other's feelings. She had issues with depression and PTSD due to childhood abuse. Her brother had severed his relationship with his family a long time ago, but because my girlfriend wouldn't let go, it meant he left her behind. It really hurt her. I talked to her about going to therapy, but she didn't want to, and she was a grown woman, I couldn't force her. And I couldn't force her to cut off her family. Honestly, I just tried to provide comfort and solace where I could. Sometimes I wonder if I didn't do enough, but I did what I could. Some days, I just felt out of options. But I loved her, and I just wanted her to be her best self.

I went on a trip a few months ago. The third day I was there, a mutual friend called and said they had gone to check on my girlfriend, found the door unlocked, and when they went into the bedroom, she was dead. I couldn't believe it. Tickets back home were too expensive, so I had to wait for my scheduled return trip. While I was waiting, another friend that had apparently been there called me up and asked if I wanted to talk about it. I said I wanted to know if she had been in pain, and they said they had found her curled up in bed, cuddling with a stuffed dog I had gotten her for Christmas a few years ago. They said it looked like she hadn't been in any pain. It made me feel so much better. Once I was home, the original friend that informed me told me the same account. It was easier to heal knowing she hadn't suffered. Part of me was glad she had gone peacefully. Her parents barred me from the funeral, and I don't know where she's buried. I knew she had committed suicide, but the idea that she had done so in a relatively... I don't know, peaceful manner. It made me feel like there was something OK about the whole situation. I never went back to our apartment, even when it was cleaned up. It scared me. Instead, I stayed with a friend and started house hunting. It never felt right to even get to the same block. My friend ended up moving me out.

Her brother came to visit me this past weekend to talk about what happened, because my girlfriend's family has withheld a lot of information and it's been too painful yet to access records. I trusted my friends' information. When we met up, I told her brother that I was glad she had died peacefully. Sorry for the gory details here. You can just skip to the end of the paragraph. Her brother asked what I was talking about, and I said she had died in bed. He said that according to the timeline provided, it was likely my girlfriend had overdosed in the bathroom. At that point, they figured she must've had second thoughts, because she had gone into the bedroom. They guessed she'd been reaching for the phone, and in the process, brought down the dresser it had been sitting on. It fell on top of her, and she likely died in agony.

They lied to me for *months.* They let me believe that my girlfriend had died curled up in bed like she had been sleeping. I have to go through the grieving process all over again, now with knowledge that likely could've been articulated to me immediately. Even if they didn't have the awful details, they would've seen her dead under the dresser and could've said that instead of lying to me and weaving this web of lies. They even coordinated it. They told other people it. People believed what they were saying. I don't even know what to say to them. Is it worth confronting them? What do I even say? Please give me some advice. Is this friendship something to recover?

TL;DR: Two of my friends lied to me and said my girlfriend had died peacefully. She died in extreme agony."

She left a note specifically for me and my sister, saying to please not tell anyone about her habits and her addiction, that she wanted to leave the world with at least a shred of honor. Our family is heavily against addiction. 

Right away, my sister was blamed. Not like she killed her, but they said the stress of my sister being an addict made her kill herself. My sister got hateful voicemails, she was told to leave at her own moms funeral, with my aunt saying ""you fucking killed her!"" and all this stuff. I am supposed to have thanksgiving dinner, and everyone is saying they wont come if my sister isnt there. They aren't letting this go, at all, they are continuing to harass her. 

My sister has been clean for 3 months now. And I just cant imagine this is doing good for her esteem. 

I am honest to god debating betraying my mothers wishes and just telling them MY MOM WAS AN ADDICT TO YOU ASSHOLES. But... idk. My sister doesn't want me to. She came over 3 days ago and just burst into tears at all the abuse shes getting from our family. She had a close relationship with her cousins, which is now done for. They seemingly hate her. 

I just don't know what to do. My family is from central asia and they tend to not let these things go. What should I do? 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Family is abusing my sister because they think she indirectly caused her moms death, but our mom was actually an addict herself. "

58,"My [25M] GF [23F] and her friends keep referencing and insulting my height and it's annoying me.


For context I'm a 5'4"" tall guy while she's 5'2"". 

I've been single till now, tried dating in college but didn't have any success there from a combination of low self-esteem and engineering work. After college I started working and I first met my GF at a friend's party a few months back and we seemed to hit it off well. Everything was going good between us two but she'd always make some comment about me not being able to reach the shelves or how small my clothes were. I'm aware of how tall I am and just banter back whenever this happened. What has me a little annoyed is that whenever we are together in public with her close friends they don't hesitate bringing my height into about any conversation. Usually it's tiny things like ""didn't know small guys could eat cinnabon buns"" with giggles but every once in a while (especially when she and her friends are plastered drunk) I'll encounter bigoted nastiness about short people, Asians, unattractiveness, and how she's lowering her standards too much for someone like me. The last time this happened I straight up told her we were leaving the group for the night but she refused saying that I was just being too serious and that everyone's just having fun and it's just girl talk amongst her friends. I ended up leaving because she just agreed with them several times just to get the night flowing and wouldn't shut the topic down. After she came back she was ticked off that I didn't want to be there and when I mentioned that I was uncomfortable from the insults she said ""well they do have a point about you, can't be tall like their BFs anyways"" which led to our first fight.

I've been the target of pointed remarks like these many times which adds some difficulty as to how much of a dealbreaker this type of situation is. I'm not going to go all /r/short or whatever on the people who tell me these things, but it's been happening many times with her friends to where I'm starting to doubt compatibility, not withstanding that she doesn't really stand up against them but joins in if these comments come up. She either thinks it's nothing important, something I should ignore because ""well they're just curious,"" or doesn't believe that I should be annoyed over those remarks because deal with it. There doesn't really seem to be anything wrong elsewhere in the relationship but she refuses to entertain the idea that it's annoying and causing friction between me and her friends. It's going into problem territory because it really does feel like her friend's don't want me around or that she doesn't want me around her friends, both significant problems. Don't really know what to do.

TL;DR GF friends keep making fun of height and they won't shut up about it even if I mention the casual insults are getting old."

60,"Me (28F) with my husband (30M) - he never puts effort into doing things unless I ask, and is king of ""I bought this for you for me.""


Together three years, married six months. I figured we'd still be in the honeymoon phase.


My husband is bad at gift giving. But before everyone piles on - this isn't about receiving gifts. This is me asking how I can get him to put in EFFORT to make me feel valued.


I mention the gift thing because it's the most recent issue that makes me feel undervalued. 


Examples:

* For my birthday, my husband got me a football jersey from his favorite team. I openly dislike football.

* For Christmas, my husband got me a t-shirt from a videogame I don't even play, but he does. I play plenty of games, he just chose one that I literally cannot play. (Overwatch gives me a massive headache due to an eye issue and all the jumping around)

* When he says he doesn't know what to give me or do for me, I give him lots of low budget ideas. Oh! I need a new travel mug! Here's a cute one for under ten dollars. Oh, I'd love a new pair of gloves! Mine have holes in them. It'd be so sweet if you picked out a pair, I love purple! Oh man, there's this movie I really really want to see, maybe you could take me some time for a date! I'll buy drinks after!

* Lately I've been working extra hours at work, and my husband is always home before I am. I've asked him several times to ""pick a few things up"" around the house before I'm home, letting him know that I've been super stressed and it would be so nice to not have to take care of extras when I'm done. I always come home to him on the computer and nothing touched.


I've even texted him in the middle of the day to ask what he's up to and he'll say something like ""Cleaning like you asked between bouts of Heroes of the Storm!"" But it's clear nothing has been picked up. He has different days off than me so he's literally home for a minimum of 8 hours without me around, and never gets things done because it's his day off.


On the flip side, I always take my day off to tidy up, meal prep and just generally make things nice. When he's stressed I try to do something a little extra, like pick up a donut on my way home from work. He always tells me how great it makes him feel and how he appreciates it.


I sit and watch football without playing on my phone because I know it's important to him. I'm a book nerd, but I play videogames with him for HOURS because I know that's what he likes best. 


So Valentine's Day is coming up. I have openly communicated to him that I don't care if he spends zero dollars on me. It's our first Valentine's day as a married couple, and I want to at least do something. I've told him DIRECTLY TO HIS FACE that all I want is **for him to pick an activity.** I will pay, drive, do whatever if he just makes a PLAN. 


This has come up in advance because I'm working on a cute gift for him. He and I used to be high school sweethearts, and I kept all the notes we passed and am turning them into a little book. I'm also getting him an Overwatch wallet. He saw me being secretive about a project and I told him it was his V-Day gift.


He went on to say how good I am at giving gifts (I knocked Christmas out of the park) and how bad he is. I doubled down on saying I don't care about a store bought gift, it just makes me feel so good when he puts in effort. And then I repeated all the things he could do: Make any sort of plan! Take me to this exact movie that I want to see! We've been talking about a day trip to City, let's go! Pick a place to go to dinner and I'll pay for it! Take me on a walk in some area that YOU choose! Clean the apartment without me having to ask you! 


He tells me those are all good ideas, ""But it's hard."" I ask what is hard, and he says ""buying gifts and picking stuff to do.""


I don't know what else I can do, since I'm literally spelling it all out for him. I just want him to pick something and do it without me needing to take the wheel for the whole thing. Any advice on getting him to understand that I need to feel some sort of effort from him in this? I don't know how I can be more direct. I've LITERALLY said, ""It would mean the absolute world to me if you just put some effort towards these things without me needing to ask you.""


Also I'm not knocking playing videogames for 8 hours on your day off. Just, can't you do laundry or dishes in between? And he DOES get a lot of time to play during the week, at least 2-3 hours a night. No exaggeration. 


**EDIT:** Since I caught some flack, let me highlight that I watch football every weekend with my husband, and play videogames with him each and every night. It's not that I'm refusing to enjoy the things he does. 


**EDIT 2:** We did the whole ""love languages"" test in pre-marital counselling and found out we're both touchy people. We used to cuddle and watch shows, or just sit and talk. But now that he wants to game 90% of the time, I can't cuddle up to him while he's in a computer chair. Or hold hands while he's busy with the mouse and keyboard. Also the sex has dropped off, because if I say ""come snuggle with me in the bedroom"" he says it's really unsexy and that he wants foreplay, not me to flat out ask for sex. But I can't make out with him and cuddle when he's in a computer chair. I've tried sitting in his lap before and he'll usually say, ""Babe I'm in the middle of Hearthstone.""


**EDIT 3:** I do have my own hobbies and am out of the house at least three days a week either seeing friends or babysitting my nieces, etc. So when I'm home it hurts more to be like, ""Oh, I was gone all day yesterday and you were on the computer. I'm home all day today and you're still on the computer.""


**TL;DR:** I put in a lot of effort to make husband happy, especially for holidays and stressful times. I ask husband to do the same and instead he plays videogames or watches football for 10 hours a day. How do I get through?"
61,"I [25F] am a bridesmaid in a good friend's [24F] wedding. Everyone was given a ""plus 1"" except for me. Bride says it's because she ""forgot"" but now it's too late. Am I right to be upset/drop out?


Ok so I've known Allison for 7 years, since university. She's getting married in March. I've been asked to be a bridesmaid and it's a destination wedding (Bahamas). 

So I was told that plus ones for the bridesmaids were a certain, especially since all of us are using plenty vacation days and flying out ourselves. However the invitations recently went out and I noticed I was not given a plus 1 for my fiance of 5 years (recently engaged). I asked the bride and she feigned ignorance and ultimately admitted that she ""forgot."" No apology or anything, just that she must've forgotten but now the guest books are full and they literally cannot accommodate one more person. 

I was really annoyed. The wedding takes over 3 days and my fiance and I were going to fly out for 5 days in total. Since neither of us get many paid vacations, this was going to be our big one this year, however, I really don't want to go just to have him wander around the hotel (the wedding location is really far from the main cities, we were told to book at the hotel they found). So if I go to this wedding then we would have to wait til next year to have another international vacation. I'm just really mad I was given basically no explanation. All of the other bridesmaids/guests were given their plus-1s even if they weren't in serious relationships. 

Am I right to be upset over this? I've done so much for this wedding. I literally handMADE the bridesmaid dresses and helped her organize the venue, etc. The least she could do is remember my fiance, but she couldn't. She also said that someone else can't give me their ""plus one"" for some reason. It's like she just doesn't want my fiance to come but won't say it. I feel really disrespected and pushed aside and I'm just expected to take it? I've been voicing unhappiness and everyone has tole me that I'm being selfish because it's her big day, but I just feel like she's really crossed a line. I told my sister that at this point I'm completely reconsidering going, and she told me I'd be a horrible person if I dropped out now. What do I do?

------

**tldr** I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's wedding. She forgot to give me a ""plus 1"" but everyone else has one. She hasn't apologized and I'm really upset, considering dropping out. Should I?"
62,"I (26f) am on my road trip honeymoon with my husband (26m) of two weeks. HeKeeps making annoying noises and now thinks it’s a joke and won’t stop even though I’ve asked him nicely several times. Is it appropriate to just get a plane ticket and fly home?


I realize that I may get some crap in this thread for appearing Patty or inpatient or even a silly over this issue. I’m prepared to except that but I think this situation has gone so far beyond anything that’s reasonable I’m about to lose my mind.


So my husband and I were married two weeks ago And since we certainly aren’t flush with cash or anything we agreed to a 2 Week Rd. trip across the southerb parts of the United States. I’ve never seen this part of the country and have always wanted to do something like this drive from the Florida Keys to San Diego. We are currently at about day five of the trip.

  On the first day I was driving and I noticed my husband was clicking a pen over and over again and I thought he just sort of had nervous energy so I kind of joked,  can you stop clicking that pencil much? And he said oh it’s just to habit  basically. So he stopped and then like a few minutes later he started humming really loud along with the music on the radio. We were in bad traffic and I was really trying To concentrate so I said hey please stop you’re being very distracting.  He did that day. 

 But the next day he certain started clicking the pin again as he was driving and he said hey Little Miss sensitive you can’t do anything about it now because I’m the one that’s driving. I try to enjoy it as long as I could but I finally got frustrated and said please stop clicking the goddamn pen.  And he said some joke about oh I made you angry how cute or something along those lines. We put into our camp spot and basically I just avoided him for the rest of the night. The next is driving wasn’t bad as it seem like he forgot but then today has just been orderly miserable. He started off the day by saying a I bet you I can’t can’t click this pen 10,000 times and kiss you lose your mind. And sure enough I bet he’s clicked it 10,000 times or more. We are currently pulled over at a rest stop and I am seriously considering just going to the next town, buying a ticket  and flying home because I can’t stand to be in the car with him as he’s just being annoying and making fun of me while doing it. I’m not saying I’m splitting up with him or anything I just don’t know how else to make him know that I’m serious. Am I overreacting or is this response appropriate? 

I type this into Siri so I hope it makes sense I’ll try and edit if possible

64,"my [25m] brother [28m] is a professional victim and sees abuse in everything. Yesterday he made our sister [16f] break down over a school project. Parents evicting him. drama ensuing


sorry for any formatting or spelling issues, I'm writing this while furious
  
I grew up in a big family with our dad always putting an emphasis on hard work and saving for the future he and our mom grew up with nothing and came and had to support themselves to get to where they are today. My parents own a landscaping/ maintenance business and even tough we were never rich my siblings and I never ad to do without. When we were sixteen we were allowed to get part time jobs as long as it didn't get in the way of school or social lived and the rule was half our paychecks had to go into savings and could not be touched. When we were kids it seemed like torture that we couldn't touch our own money but it helped all of us out in the long run and we were grateful for having even a small safety net.

my brother, Tim, has always been entitled and any time he feels like he has been crossed it's abuse. He can never keep a job and has either been fired or quit from fast food or retail jobs because he fought with management and said he wasn't being respected (he got fired from Target when he took long breaks and got caught and then tried to file a complaint that went nowhere). My parents have tried helping him and he lived with them rent free to get on his feet while he tried attending community college and trade school (neither worked out). Our dad even tried to get him to work with him, myself, and our older brother and it didn't work out after Tim would show up late to jobs and almost damaged some of te equipment due to carelessness.

Tim is pretty much a disaster and it is **never** his fault. He sorta had his life on track last year and had a decent retail job and moved in with his gf at the time. She was level headed and seemed to be good for him but took advantage of her. Apparently he leeched off her, tried to get her to take care of him, and ended up losing his job when he missed too many shifts and blamed her for not giving him a ride since his car was in bad shape. They broke up and he moved back in with our parents.

**current** Myself and the rest of our sibling have no respect left but now we're the enemy. He has called us our parents ""golden children"" and acts like he's the poor blacksheep. He had a seasonal job over the holidays and was pissed that our dad asked for rent/ made him buy his own groceries (he says our parents are abusing him financially now). When our parents got our youngest sibling an Xbox as a reward for getting good grades he threw a fit and acted passive talking about our parents being narcissists that play favorites.

yesterday our sister was showing us her school project for an art class, it was a cute selfie a day for a year thing and she's been working hard on it. For no fucking reason Tim voiced his opinion and told her how the video made her look vain, was a sign of narcissism, and began comparing her to different people. She ended up breaking down and left for school, I lost it and told our parents what happened.

We were on a job site all day and when we came back our parents took Tim out to talk with him alone and when they got back they broke the news that Tim has 60 days to move out and they won't support him financially anymore. They tried to get him on his feet and he always takes advantage of them and everyone else. Since then he has locked himself in his room doing god knows what and keeps sends angry texts to me and even my BF too blaming me for what happened. 

Nobody in the family is taking his side and he will most likely move in with our Grandma and leech off of her. I feel horrible that it came to this as we are a really close knit family and I really don't want us to fall apart because of him! 

Right now I'm just asking for advice on how to negotiate around him and try to support my parents and younger siblings through this time (my sister is taking this really hard and feels like it's her fault if he becomes homeless).  

**update** So my brother as decided to move in with his gf (of only 4 months) and her family. He took is computer and clothes and made a big show about how e could not live with people like our parents anymore. Called me a faggot, yelled at our mom, and left. After this I can never see myself having any type of relationship with him unless he pulls himself together but I doubt it. Thanks for all the kind messages and the advice.

65,"I'm ( 28F) concerned about a guy (30s M) who plays Pathfinder with our group.


So some background about our group it's mostly a group of friends who my husband (32 M) has been playing with since High school. We recently grew our group by adding another long time friend of my husband's (30s known each other for 10+ years) and his daughter (8F). 


So this guy (Let's call him Jim) is the only single Childfree person in our group. Not all of us have children, but he is staunchly childfree. He has recently (2 weeks) had a serious change in attitude which is causing me to reconsider our friend ship. Recently Jim has taken to sending me texts about feminist movements and coplainging about it to me/blaming me. Last night Jim sent me a link to an article about Iceland making it illegal to pay men more than women and  ""I bet men are going to be taking a pay cut. I hope this makes you happy. Femistist ruin everything.""  A little later he sent me an article about population growth in the US, and he went on a rant about how he wishes all the kids in the world were dead or just disappeared. How they ruin everything and the world would be better without them. 


My concern is that there will be a little girl joining us and I don't want these views to negatively impact her. I am the only other girl in the group and I don't want her to think this is okay. 


Tldr: Guy (30sM) in our pathfinder group has recently started ranting about how women hurt men and how he wishes all the children were gone, just as we are about to have a little girl(8F) join us for her first game.

*update* My husband just texted me and said he had been thinking about what I said about Jim and suggest he drop our game. He is also going to ask if something is going on because this isn't his usual behavior. If he can't get to the bottom of it then he won't allow him past the door because ""anyone who can't respect you isn't welcome."""
66,"Me [20F] &amp; my roommate [22M]. He keeps eating all of mine &amp; my other roommates' [22F &amp; 22M] food.


So we've all got some issues with our roommate Dan. I could write a novel on those, but I'll cut to the chase &amp; talk about the issue at hand. 

I live with my boyfriend Jack [22M], his friend Dan [22M] &amp; our friend Lily [22F].

I'm really close to Lily--used to be with Dan, but not so much anymore. Recently I bought she &amp; I a 12 pack of poptarts (that's 24 poptarts in total) to share. This was about 5 days ago. I've eaten three packs. I started noticing the poptarts diminishing, but assumed it was Lily eating them. Last night we wanted to split a pack. She grabbed the box and commented ""wow there's like nothing in here."" I laughed and said ""yeah how many have you eaten??"" And she was like ""...none? I forgot about them until tonight actually.""

To do some quick math-- there were 12 packs. I've had 3. Lily and I split one, meaning we've only eaten 4 packs between the two of us. That means 8 packs of poptarts have mysteriously gone missing. I know my boyfriend didn't take them--he has his own pack of 12, a different flavor, and besides, he &amp; I share all of our groceries. Neither he nor Lily have any reason to lie. 

Lily knocked and asked if he's been eating our poptarts--she was quite friendly about it. He outright lied to her and said ""nope, haven't been.""

We have an apartment policy that things like eggs, spices, seasonings, sauces &amp; milk are shared--to a reasonable degree, of course. Anything else that isn't yours, don't eat it, or ask to borrow some. 

Dan is routinely violating this policy. Lily bought 5 apples for herself--he ate 3 without asking. Lily made a gigantic shepherds pie--she had about two slices and then he hate half of it. Lily and I made a gigantic bowl of guacamole (cost us $20+) for a party, Dan helped himself to some without asking us. 

He does a lot of other things like this. Letting his food get so moldy that spores grow, and get on our food (like he did this with oranges &amp; my garlic got molded). He's had a stick of butter sitting on the counter for 2 months, it's gotten disgustingly smelly. But he'll never throw it out. He lets food expire &amp; leaves it in the fridge for months. Etc etc. 

The poptart thing was my last straw. He's been coming home insanely high lately so honestly I think he got the munchies and ate them all.

I want to have an apartment meeting to talk about all of our issues with him. Unfortunately no one else wants to do this, &amp; I understand it may seem we're ganging on up on him. 

I want to confront him one on one abt the poptart thing, but frankly, he's kind of scary. He can be really nasty and belittling and I hate the tension in the house when we're arguing. 

Is there anyway I can breach the poptart thing? Should I even bother talking about the other things?? I was thinking of sending a text but that seems passive aggressive and gives him the opportunity to ignore me or think up a lie. 

I just don't know what to do. He's so rude but I can't let this continue to happen. Because no one but me wants to confront him, he gets away with shit, and if I DO confront him, I'm the bad guy. 

TL;DR: my roommate is stealing our food. It's driving me nuts but idk what to do about it. "
67,"My [30F] husband [34M] and my family are having a huge argument about fire alarms


I am using a throwaway, also on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.

John and I have been dating for 11 years. He has always been very very afraid of fire. With fire I mean a house fire, and us not being able to escape. I will give you some examples to illustrate this:


When we started dating, he noticed my dorm did not have any fire alarms. One day he gave me 3 fire alarms, one for my room, one for the hallway and one near the kitchen. He did the same thing with a friend who lived on the 10th floor.


I remember him being a bit pissed if I or someone else turned the alarms off cause we wanted to smoke.

When it comes to housing, his rule is: ´You have to be able to jump out of the window without being seriously injured. ´ Having an appartement on the 10th or the 11th floor was never an option with him.

He is not a big fan of boilers.  In our city the are mostly not in very good condition and he is afraid of carbon monoxide poisoning. 

He checks out fire alarms every month when I am at work and the kids are at daycare.

At first it was a bit weird, to live with someone who is so cautious about things. But now I am actually happy about it: we have kids (3M and 1F) and I want our house to be safe.


THE ISSUE: My parents (both 60 years old) and my sister (28F) and BIL (28M) are staying at our place for a week. My family does not care about the danger of fire. My dad always says´ When you are dead, you are dead’ meaning he does not care cause he won’t have to deal with the aftermath anyways. We never had fire alarms or anything.


The first issue happend 2 days ago, I was at work, the kids were with my parents and husband was working. When husband came home, nobody was home but there were candles that were still lit in the house. When my parents came back, they said sister had decided to lit some candles and that they were only gone for 10 minutes so it did not matter if they were lit or not.


Husband got pissed. But I calmed him down. When we woke up today, the whole house smelled like cigarettes, which was unpleasent but husband got even more mad When he saw that EVERY firealarm we have was turned off. He asked my family who had done that and my dad said that it would make a sound if they smoked indoors, so he turned them off. My husband got mad and my dad told him that he is crazy. That he has ruined a lot of things with his ‘stupid fear’,  that he has been spending useless money on fire alarms and that no normal person would be so focused on it.



So here I am, husband is at work and my family keeps telling me that he is an idiot and crazy. First of all: How do I solve this? And second, is my husband overreacting? 


Tl;dr: Family is visiting, they had a huge fallout with husband. What do I do now?
"
68,"My [25M] boyfriend and I [23F] work together, won't apply for a job that is a great opportunity for him, so I want to apply for it. Am I wrong?


Hi reddit. So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about three years, and we've worked together at the same place for four. Right now at my work, one manager is leaving in about a month, and two more will likely be leaving in the next four to six and they will be looking to replace them. He has been (imo, unfairly) passed up for the opportunity before for other people who have been better at... ""selling"" themselves, regardless of him being a more dedicated, harder working employee by most everyone's standards. At this point though, there is genuinely no one else that could even be considered to be better for the promotion. The opportunity is beneficial for him in so many ways. However, he has been saying that he has no interest in working there for much longer for the last six months. He has talked about feeling disrespected and unappreciated, that he should have been promoted despite the fact that he never expressed interest explicitly (the norm has been to just be asked, but that doesn't mean that he can't indicate interest). I think it's true, some of the managers have devalued his efforts and made insensitive comments, but it's less personal and more them being thoughtless and a bit stupid. In fact all of the ones who have said shitty things have also spoken about how he's an excellent employee. He wants to leave to find a job somewhere else, which is fine, but he hasn't started looking yet.

Now, with my recent rejection from graduate school, I have had to begin thinking about what I would like my life to look like for the next year and a half until I reapply and (hopefully) get in. That being said, I think this job would also be a good opportunity for me. I never showed interest in this job previously, and in fact I was thinking of quitting soon since there's not really much more I can learn at the position I'm in. Now I will be off for another year before I go to graduate school, so I think this would be a great opportunity for me to increase my savings over the next year and get managerial experience that I could add to a CV. However, I would NEVER want to step on his toes. I truly believe he is the best person for the job. I mean, since multiple managers are leaving there's even a possibility we could both get it, but I didn't want him to think I was going behind his back. So I called him and told him what I was thinking, suggested that he would be the obvious first choice for the position within the company and that I think he should consider applying. He said halfheartedly that he wasn't sure, but he would think about it. I then said that if he was absolutely set on leaving, I would support him, but I wanted him to know because I might apply for the position since I think I would be the second best choice. He got very upset and said that ""he thought we were on the same page."" He did say he knew it was his problem to work out, but he just sounded so hurt.

I can't get a managerial job (or any other job that isn't only slightly above entry-level, basically) with no experience. My degree is damn near useless in the job field without work experience, which I don't have a lot of because I've been working on school. This would be a great opportunity for me or for him. I want him to have it first, though, but if he doesn't want that, I'm not gonna throw away a good opportunity. I've still been trying to talk him into applying for the job. I think his main concerns are that it would be insulting to his integrity to apply for the position (his words), and the notion of rejection would probably hurt his ego a bit. All I can see though is that a job with higher pay and more authority would give him more integrity that he has now, not less. And it's not like he has a contract where he'll have to stay. He could get promoted, hate it with all his might, and quit three months from now when he finds a different job, like he was going to do anyway. There are literally no downsides for him. The only way they would reject him is if they decide to hire externally for all three of these positions. It's flat-out not going to happen, I just think he is afraid of if it does - but shouldn't that give him more motivation to leave in the event that it does?

How he sees it is - it's demeaning to work for them at a higher position. How I see it is - I'm not going to let a couple of people's stupid decisions and comments over time have control over what I do with my life. Instead I am going to use them to my benefit, as a stepping stone, and do what is best for me. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. It's like he's cutting off his nose to spite his face. I think it comes down to the fact that I cannot understand why he will not apply for the job, and if he won't, I really don't think it's fair for him to get upset if I want to do something that is objectively the best call for me for the next year.

tldr; boyfriend is the best person for the job, doesn't want to apply for it, I might instead, worried he will resent me. What do?

69,"I (20F) found out that my best guy friend (25M) only hung out with me and my friends because he wanted to have sex with us. Now he's being a creep


Hello, I'm really saddened by this and need advice. I've known this guy Luke for 4 years and he has hung out with me and my friends several times. I introduced him to my best girl friends about 6 months ago and they all got along well. I'm trying to be nice about this but he always acted feminine and like a good guy, sensitive and sweet so it was more like he was a ""girl friend"" to everyone. Plus he had a girlfriend the majority of the time so all was well. 

I noticed recently that he started hitting up all of my friends and asking them to hang out alone with him. A few of them told me that he would text them multiply times a day and if they didn't respond, he would keep texting. They said he was pushy and would get upset if they didn't want to meet up with him. One of these girls is 18 years old!! She's just a baby and he's making her feel bad for not wanting to see him. 

This has been frustrating to me, and when I asked him wtf was going on, he said that they're his friends too and he can hang out with whoever he wants. he started withdrawing from me and would only bug my friends to hang out, never me. They never did though because they found him pushy and weird. It all came to a head because one of my other guy friends who is friends with him told me that the only reason luke ever hung out with us was because he was trying to ""fuck us"". Luke even accused me of cockblocking him and being jealous because I didn't let him harass my friends!! At one point during a party he had even planned to fuck one of us while we were drunk but his plan didn't work out so he was angry about it, which is a reason he started coming off super strong to my girl friends. 

I've cut him off and so have my friends, but he keeps messaging other people from my group asking what he did wrong. He's tried to hang out with the younger people in the group, suggesting group nights and he's been so weird. None of them have responded but it bugs me that he's still trying.  What do I do? Do I confront him? 

Tldr: guy friend only hung out with me and my friends because he wanted to have sex with us. We cut him off but he's being so persistent and trying to hang out with other people I've introduced him to. Idk what to do."
70,"[UPDATE] I (23F) am having trouble trusting boyfriend (25M) after infidelity at the start of the relationship.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t9c6s/i_23f_having_trouble_trusting_boyfriend_25m_after/?st=JD29T8VJ&amp;sh=804ba06f

I just thought I’d do a quick update because I need to share the news I guess.

I took the comments I got into consideration and although I love him so much I decided to end the relationship. 

I tried to discuss with him how we could build my trust back up but he was unwilling to talk it over again, saying we’d been over it plenty of times and I was trying to cause an argument, and that I must not want it to work. He was so manipulative and tried to make me the bad guy. I finally realised that I am the victim here, he cheated on me, and he’s making me the bad guy. He owes me the effort to rebuild the relationship but he wanted me to just forget it. 

He didn’t take any of my feelings into consideration, and I finally saw how selfish a person he was that after years of our relationship, he didn’t feel it was worth the effort.

He said he would be continuing to party with friends and everything (even though this is where he cheated) and I had no right to ask him to change anything and that if I couldn’t trust him then what was the point?

I agreed and were now in the process of separating our things and I’m gonna move back with my parents for a while. I feel numb and so sad because I loved this guy so much but I know it’s for the best. I deserve so much more.

I wouldn’t have been able to come to the decision without reddit so I thank you very much! I hope moving on gets easier cause I feel like I’ve been shot in the stomach. 

Tl;dr confronted boyfriend about trust issues, he was unwilling to talk and I ended the relationship "

72,"Sometimes it makes me [45 M] sad that I can never hug or be physically close to my daughter [15 F].


Since she was about 9 she hasn't let me or her mother touch her in pretty much any way.

Touch and her schedule for the day are the two things she's very rigid about (she has high functioning Asperger's syndrome), she copes better with most of her other symptoms.

The schedule is generally no problem but it's really hard to not be able to be close in any way. A few months ago I told her she looked pretty and by pure instinct I tried to brush her hair and she reacted very strongly. She swiped my hand away and told me ""Please, no"" and seemed to be very rigid for a few minutes. It made me feel really bad because my first reacting to upsetting her was to hug her and apologize but I stopped myself because she clearly would not be happy with it.

I guess I just want to know if other people experience this with their children (obviously no need for them to be neurodivergent) and how they cope with it. How could I cope with this? It's been 6 years and it hasn't gotten any easier.

**tl;dr:** Daughter with Asperger's has a hard boundary with any form of touch and it's been hard for me to cope with not being close physically. How do you cope with and under expressive child?"
