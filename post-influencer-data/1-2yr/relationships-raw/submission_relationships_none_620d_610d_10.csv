0,"[Update] My boyfriend [24/M] treats me harshly [18/F] and I can’t handle it anymore. I need to leave him, but I’m scared and I feel like I have no way out.


[removed]"
1,"My BF (28M) of 6yrs was going to propose on NYE, didn’t, and is now ghosting me (29F)


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 6 years now. We had talked about getting married, and I always said I wanted a proposal in front of a few close friends/family members. He agreed, and thought the sentiment was nice. Our anniversary is New Year’s Eve and a friend was hosting a party with a handful of our other mutual friends. I kind of knew what was coming up. He was jittery and nervous, acting super awkward the whole night. Right at 11:59, he gets down on one knee, but he didn’t say anything. He just stared at me, and kept opening and closing his mouth like he was trying to say something. I knew it was happening, and I was just so excited. I was crying, our friends were gasping. At midnight, the ball dropped on the TV, and we all heard the cheering, and my boyfriend shook his head and got up, and told me, “I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I just can’t do this.” And he left.

I’ve never felt more embarrassed in my life. That was supposed to be the happiest moment of our lives, shared with our friends. If he hadn’t wanted to propose, I wouldn’t care if he just didn’t. I wouldn’t care if he told me. I wouldn’t care. I want to spend my life with him, and if that meant not getting engaged and married, I wouldn’t care. What I care about is him getting on one knee, watching me cry and look so excited, then tell me he “can’t do this.” I feel like it’s almost my fault. I mean, did I ask for too much?

He never came back to our house. A friend suggested I use the map on Snapchat to find him, and sure enough, he forgot to turn off his location. I didn’t recognize the intersection, so I sent it to a friend, who said they were sworn to secrecy by my BF. Nobody else knew. I’m feeling really paranoid. Is it an ex’s place? Just a buddy’s house? I don’t want to sound like a stalker, but I’ve been watching him on the map, just feeling endlessly betrayed by him. He hasn’t called, hasn’t texted, hasn’t emailed, hasn’t even snail mailed. I miss him. I went into 2018 alone and confused and scared, and it’s just stayed that way ever since. I feel like he owes me at least half an apology. I’ve texted him, called him, done my part- and he always reads it (he has read receipts on) or declines the call. I’m so worn out. He’s trying to ghost me, it feels like. And I don’t think I can do that with the man I’ve lived with for 4 years now, or the man that I’ve dedicated my life to for 6 years.

What should I do? Should I try to find him? What’s a good way to start this... Whatever it is?

TL;DR: My boyfriend was going to propose on NYE, didn’t, and has been ghosting me since. 

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, there were 8 people there. We have known all of them since before we started dating. I never asked him to propose on NYE. We had been talking in November about marriage, and I said if I was proposed to, I’d want it with some of our friends around. Nothing too big, but with some intimacy. He said he did like bigger proposals, but he thought a group of friends would be a good way to go.

**EDIT #2:** Sorry to not be able to reply to comments. I was at work when this blew up, and now that I’m back, replying to individual comments is kind of overwhelming. But, I did read each one, and I appreciate the sentiment. Thank you to everyone for commenting and sharing stories, and taking a little time out of their day to help. It means so much.

A lot of people are saying I gave him too many expectations or I told him what to do or I pressured him. I have never done anything of the sort. We’ve been talking about getting married for the past 3 years. At first, he said he was worried about money- so I said there’s no rush. Every time we talk about it, I tell him the same, there’s no rush. When we happened to be talking about it more recently, I expressed the same sentiment- there’s no rush, I’m happy with you. He just asked me what my preferences were, and I told him, an intimate proposal with friends/family. At no point did I say, “NYE, at midnight, at this specific party, with a certain ring.” He asked what I wanted, and I told him. He is a fan of public proposals. He watches those videos on Youtube of baby announcements or proposal videos or soldiers coming home from war. He said he liked the idea of an intimate gathering. I never, at any point, said “you have to do this, at this time, at this place.” If I did, I’d not be a good girlfriend and I wouldn’t at all be surprised or upset at a reaction like this. But I didn’t, so I am.

Thank you again, for all the comments. "

3,"Update: I [20s F] got an amazing job opportunity, my entire family [20-80 M/F] are putting a lot of pressure on me not to take it.


Hi, this sub! It's been well over a year since my [last post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ey7nb/i_20s_f_got_an_amazing_job_opportunity_my_entire/) but I got a lot of really helpful advice so I just wanted to update. 


The nuts and bolts of my post was that I'd been offered a job in an active war zone and wasn't sure whether to take it due to lots of pressure form my family. After much talking to people who'd been (and of course this sub's helpful advice), and also some number crunching (turns out the death rate for foreign contractors wasn't much higher than the murder rate in Detroit), I took the job and went. My family was pretty upset about it and my sister didn't talk to me for months, but for the most part they were pretty supportive. They never came around, but they at least realized they couldn't stop me.


So I went, I learned a lot, I made a lot of money, and I traveled a lot, and yes, my sister did eventually start talking to me again. The first couple weeks I was there, I had free rein to explore the city and I really enjoyed myself--it was a really interesting, weird, cool place to live with beautiful scenery and really lovely people. Definitely an eye opener, seeing how much the reality on the ground of the conflict zone differed from what's reported in the media! Mostly I was surprised by how ""normal"" things felt, despite the dangers. I also had fantastic coworkers and staff, which helped a lot!


Unfortunately, some pretty tragic things (terror-related) occurred at my job not long after I started, at which point my family resumed flipping shit and insisted that I come home. I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, because I was needed where I was. After those issues though, things at my job got a lot tighter security-wise and we no longer enjoyed any freedom of movement--we were locked down 24/7 and were only allowed to leave under very specific circumstances. Ultimately I decided it wasn't what I signed up for, and had our living situation been that way when I was hired, I wouldn't have taken the job in the first place. After a year, I found another job and moved back to Europe. 


Overall, I'm glad that I went and had those experiences--even with the not-so-great bits, I know I would have regretted it if I hadn't gone. I learned some pretty useful shit (basic language skills) and some things that are distinctly less useful for my life right now (how to tie a tourniquet, how to determine which explosions are worth worrying about), but that's fine. I also adopted a pet that is now happily adjusting to European life. 


Thanks to everyone in this sub who reached out to me with their own personal stories about working in conflict zones--and to the everyone who reached out to me after the bad stuff went down. You all are wonderful!

5,"UPDATE: My boyfriend (22M) of 1 year doesn't want me (21F) dancing with other guys


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77hg48/my_boyfriend_22m_of_1_year_doesnt_want_me_21f/

I first came here a couple of months ago asking for advice regarding my boyfriend who hated the fact that I dance ballroom competitively with a male partner (who is not him). 

I ended up sitting him down for a long conversation where we talked about why he felt uncomfortable with my dancing and discussed potential compromises. I apologized for not being clearer about dancing together socially rather than competitively and as a compromise, brought up a mixed-proficiency competition where we could dance together competitively (and made it clear that it was in ADDITION to continuing to compete with my partner until my boyfriend reached the level I compete at, which would take a few years). He was upset by this at first, but  agreed if he could meet my partner and get to know him better. All in all, the conversation seemed promising enough that I decided to give my boyfriend one last chance.

I talked to my dance partner, and we set up a double-date (with my partner's fiancee) at a coffee shop. At the date, my partner's fiancee mentioned how she got much more comfortable with the idea of her fiance dancing with another women by watching them practice a few times (this was while my dance partner was dancing with someone else). My boyfriend thought this was a great idea and asked me if it was okay if he drove me to practice a few times on the weekends and watched. I agreed, but on the condition that he worked with my practice schedule and that he did not interfere in any way during our practice.

During the third weekend of this arrangement, he was in bed with a hangover Saturday morning at 9:30am when I had to head out for practice. I had reminded him the night before about my practice plans and had woken him up at 9am to remind him again, but he had refused to get up. So I told him it was okay and drove myself to practice. When I got back for lunch at 1:30pm, he was absolutely pissed. He accused me of sneaking around behind his back with my dance partner (even though I explicitly told him multiple times where I was going...?) and went on a rant about how it's so obvious that I am trying to cheat on him. He brought up how I held the door open for my dance partner during our double date and how my dance partner and I were ""smiling too much"" during our practices.

I was so sick of constantly feeling like I was doing something wrong that I finally snapped and broke up with him. That evening, my (now ex-) boyfriend blew up my phone about how he didn't think I was serious and that I was being unfair to him. He said I had to come back because I had agreed to compete with him. I responded that because I had given my word, I was still willing to compete with him at the one competition I had suggested earlier, but that's it. He got even angrier and said not to bother because ballroom dancing is stupid, I was a cheating whore for choosing dancing over him, and I would never find a guy like him (lol I really hope I don't...).

Breaking our lease cost a fair bit and moving was a hassle, but honestly it's been so refreshing not having to deal with constant arguments. It's a little lonely living by myself now sometimes, but it is so worth it to be able to live and dance on my own terms. Hopefully someday I will meet a guy who supports my dancing but only time will tell I guess.

6,"My (29F) mother-in-law (60F) intentionally fed my daughter (4F) food that she is allergic to. Am I being too harsh in cutting off contact?


[removed]"
7,"UPDATE: I [22F] am thinking about cutting my brother [31M], sister in law [27F], and niece [1.5F] out of my life.


Hi everyone, I just figure since my last post got quite a bit of attention, and I recived some messages requesting an update that I would post what I could. I also would like to thank everyone that was kind enough to respond and you all gave some great advice! 

Here's a link from last time: (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mfwqr/i_22f_am_thinking_about_cutting_my_brother_31m/)


So, basically the first thing I did was take the advice that most of you gave me. I placed an anonymous call into CPS. I gave them as much information that I could (mother is a hoarder, goes off her medication, etc). They basically said they appreciated my call, and that they would add it to her file. When they said ""add it to her file"" I started questioning whether or not this was the first time CPS had been reported to. Of course the person I spoke to couldn't confirm that, but I found that quite interesting.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I stopped by their house over the weekend for ""brunch"" and to exchange gifts. To no surprise, the house was absolutely disgusting, but it looks like they had re-arranged some of their stuff (garbage) so it was slightly more presentable than usual. 

Now, they moved a while back and actually live on the third floor of a building where there are only stairs, no elevator, so I had an excuse to ask my brother to help me grab some things from the car. Lindsey was preoccupied with the baby, and my poor boyfriend was left alone with her.  (Sorry!!)

As we made our way out to the parking lot we just made some small talk, I asked him how work was going, how the baby was, etc. Eventually I asked him about how things were going with Lindsey. 

The answer I got was unfortunately what I expected. She was going through some tough times, struggling to take her medication, having a baby was just adding to the stress, and so on. I said I understood, but asked about how that was all affecting him. He said he's ""fine"" with it, that he's used to it by now and maybe as the baby gets older things will improve. 

I asked him if he really thought things would get better eventually. He said no. 

I asked him if he was happy right now, or if he's ever been really happy with the relationship. He said no. 

I asked him why he stays in a relationship that makes him unhappy. He said he didn't want their daughter to come from a home without two parents and that he was afraid of what Lindsey might do if he ever said he wanted to separate. He said that the second item scared him the most.

I asked him if he felt like she was abusive. He said that she is emotionally abusive to him sometimes, but never to their daughter, and never physically to either of them. 

By this point we both realized we had been gone a lot longer than we should've been so we started heading back inside. I told him that our family would always be there for him if he ever needed anything, and that we should try and schedule a lunch together soon. He agreed to that and said while he appreciated my support, he wasn't going to leave Lindsey. He didn't want to leave Lindsey. He loves her too much.

We get back inside and I excused myself to the bathroom (to secretly take some pictures of the apartment), when I hear Lindsey yelling. Lindsey is interrogating my brother about why we've been gone so long, what we were doing, etc. Now, I'm not really sure what she thought was going on, but basically I was already sick of being there at that point. (We were gone maybe 20 minutes when it should've taken around 10).

I started to rush things along, said we should exchange gifts, etc. Lindsey was of course mad my boyfriend and I only got my niece gifts, and them a gift card to a grocery store (I returned all their actual presents). I didn't really care. Lindsey and Jack did not get my boyfriend anything (awkward but oh well I guess-what was I expecting). Lindsey got me a paternity test set thing to see if I'm actually related to my father. *

*Now, this whole paternity thing is a joke in my family. I don't look like either one of my parents, so we joke about who my ""real"" father is, that I was switched at the hospital, etc. There is absolutely no doubt my dad is my dad, we have the same fairly rare medical condition, along with several other things. It's basically just at first glance I don't look like my mom or dad. 

Anyways, I thought she was trying to join in on the joke so my boyfriend and I both laugh about it, but then she hits us with it. ""Well your mom is a crazy whore so I figured you'd want to know the truth"". (Ok, so definitely not joining in on the joke). I give my brother the test, and told Lindsey that maybe he should be the one to use it (quite mean I know), and my boyfriend and I got our stuff and left without saying anything else.

So, basically that's our wonderful Christmas story.

We swung by my parents house on the way home and told them what happened, as well as that I spoke with CPS. My dad said he's called CPS twice on them because of their disgusting life style. My mom was quite upset by everything that's happened, but was supportive in our decision to leave. 

I was able to get pictures to the social worker on Tuesday. They said that they were very helpful, but left it at that. I haven't heard anything about a visit so far, I don't even know if I would hear about it, but I'm really hoping that one happens soon.

Lindsey texted me a couple days ago calling me a bitch and said that ""I can't take a joke"". I haven't responded and I haven't heard from her since.


TL;DR: Called CPS, had a heart to heart with my brother, Lindsey is still unstable and extremely mean."
8,"I'm a 40M and have met a woman I like. I feel like it is a betrayal to my wife.


My story starts in college. I've always been shy around women. Debilitatingly shy. My stutter gets a lot worse and I'm a total wreck. Not attractive at all. Then one day I met this great girl who I would marry six months after our first date. She asked me out, she asked me to move in, she asked me to marry her. She took all the steps I was too shy to take. We had 5 wonderful years together. She was there when I got my first book published. When the check cleared the bank we splurged and got two appetizers at Applebee's.

Then one day she was late getting home from work. I had made chicken fried steak. She wouldn't answer her cell phone. Then there was a knock at the door. A State Trooper informed me that there had been an accident. He told me my wife was dead.

Fast forward 12 years to today. I still wear my wedding ring and go visit her grave almost everyday. I bring her Valentines, birthday, anniversary, and Christmas gifts. Fresh flowers at least twice a week. 

A couple of months ago a woman started coming to a writer's workshop I teach Thursday afternoon in the library. She drives 120 miles (one way) to attend this class. She's not interested in being a writer, she's a fan. She's read all my books, all my blog entries, bought issues of every magazine I've ever been published in, downloaded every podcast I've been interviewed on. It's fair to say she's into me.

I like her too. She's attractive. She makes my stutter go up to 11. Every week I psych myself up to say ""Want to get some gyros after class?"" Every week I disappoint myself. The words stick in my throat. It's a physical sensation, like choking.

My wife has been gone for 12 years. Have I grieved enough? When is it ok to move on? I took my wedding ring off for an hour yesterday, it didn't feel right. 

I've had private after class time with the woman who drives 240 miles every week to see me. We chat as best we can with my stuttering. There is an attraction there. It is mutual. Now, whether she's attracted to me the person or me the writer, I can't say. Hopefully me as a person.

There's a lost and lonely feeling in me. Like I'm living in the past. My wife's clothes still hang in the closet. Her unread novels sit on her nightstand. Pictures of us are everywhere. I just don't know what to do.

It feels like a betrayal to the memory of the 5 good years we had to move on.

Help.

9,"[Update] My [19/F] best friend since childhood [18/F] told me that she loves me. I love her as a friend, but not romantically. I’m terrified of losing our friendship.


We talked the day after I made the [original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mjb8x/my_19f_best_friend_since_childhood_18f_told_me/) The advice I received helped me a lot on how to handle this, many thanks to y’all. 

I told her that I still saw her as my best friend, no matter what her sexuality was. I said I loved her, but only as a sister. I apologized for misleading her into thinking I had romantic feelings for her. My friend thanked me for being supportive of her coming out of the closet. She said I was the first one she told about her sexuality. I told her I was honoured that she came out to me first, and that it really meant a lot for our friendship. She told me the things we did together didn’t cause her to think that I had feelings for her, and that really close girl friends do stuff like that with each other all the time. Hearing her say that relieved a lot of guilt from me.

My friend was okay with me not liking her in the same way, and that she expected it. She explained to me that our friendship was one of a kind, and that she wouldn’t let anything get in the way of that. I told her if she needed time away from me that I'd be completely fine with it, but she said she was okay and that she’d already dealt with her feelings for me before telling me.

Our friendship has not changed. She’s still the same person that I’ve known since grade 2. I don’t feel at all awkward being around her knowing that she’s a lesbian. She said coming out to me made her feel a sense of freedom, she told me it was hard to keep such a big lie from me when we tell each other everything.

We’ve been through so much together. This is another bump in our journey that we’ll overcome. In the end, I feel like her coming out to me has brought us closer together. I’ll always be her best friend no matter what, and I’ll be fully supporting her when she starts telling everyone about her sexuality. 

 ---   

  **tl;dr**: We talked about it. I said I didn’t like her romantically but that I still saw her as my sister and best friend. She thanked me for being supportive of her and told me she wanted to keep our friendship the same. Our friendship has not changed in anyway. She’s still the same kind and caring person I grew up with and have always known to be my best friend.

10,"[UPDATE] My [17F] mom [47F] went to visit my half-sister's [30F] ex husband [??M] who has custody of her five kids, and told me about the conditions my nieces/nephew [3F, 4F, 6M, 8F 10F) are living in.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7m38cz/my_17f_mom_47f_went_to_visit_my_halfsisters_30f/

I actually held off on calling until two days ago, to which I tipped CPS on their location, because I got to visit them after loads of begging and reasoning. I played with those kids so much and hugged them so tight before I left. I kind of felt bad for dropping a bomb like that near New Year's, but it's more of a gift towards the kids than anything. They've started an investigation, and that's all I know so far. The ex-boyfriend/religious husband was in for a treat that day, and being the gossip he is, told everybody the moment after CPS left. My mom yelled at me. I expected a scolding, but I never imagined she dish out anything this bad. If she didn't ask, I wouldn't have said anything, but she marched into my room full-well knowing who it was. It's really hard to lie to her face, so I told her. She told me she won't book my mental health evaluation, because the only thing wrong with me is my hero-complex. She actually called my half-sister over, telling her it was me, and they both did a weird tag-team yelling match at me for what felt like forever. Apparently I tore apart a family. My little sister sneered at me when it was over for being a ""tattletale."" I'm going to leave the house in the middle of the night to call the suicide prevention line, something I probably should have done a long time ago. I hate this place. People are terrible.

**TL;DR - Called CPS, investigation started. Kids will most likely be taken away after investigation is over. Mom and half-sister slapped me around with words because I squealed after being accused. I'm exhausted. Kids will probably get their justice.**

Edit: That's it for this post. It's reached the point of complete silence because it's really late here, so I'm going to call and go to sleep. Thanks for pushing me to call in the first thread. I'll still read posts here, but if you want a reply to something or have a question or just want updates, I'm open to PMs. Good night, reddit. You're very encouraging."
11,"My dad [almost 50] is dating someone [19 F] younger than me [21 F].


Okay so first of all, this the first time I use Reddit so... I hope I am doing this properly, lol.

I'll tell you guys everything because I can't afford to not care anymore.

First of all, my dad met my mom back in 1995 and they had me the next year. They had my sister in 2000. Everything was fine until mid 2013 when she got very ill and unfortunately died to cancer on March 2014.

Both my dad, my sister and I were devastated for that whole year, but that isn't the main topic. Here comes the good stuff.

First my dad started dating women again in late 2014 to early 2015. He met a woman [31] but it didn't work out after she tried to hit me at one point. 

Then the fun began at late 2016: he started dating a 18 year old girl. The funny part about this is that she lied to him for almost a year saying she had 29 years old, and since she did have an ID my dad didn't question it. 

The point is, he first claimed she was only going to help him work (my dad is a lawyer) and that I would barely notice her. And heck, I didn't give a fuck about him dating her because they're adults and I'm over 18 too, so that shouldn't be my business right?

Well now here we are, she's now living at my house. I didn't care at first since again, it shouldn't be my business. But now I literally fight with my dad EVERY SINGLE DAY because she keeps talking to him about how ""I'm not mature enough"" (because I'm so immature that I am still a straight A student now that I'm studying medicine and I was a mom figure to my little sister until now), how ""I might even be a fucking lesbian"" (yes, those exact words. They're both homophobic as hell) and my favorite: how ""I want to see my dad miserable and alone for the rest of his life"".

I really don't know how to approach this situation. It's so messed up to me. She has proven herself to be a gold digger too, as expected.


TL;DR: my dad is dating a 19 year old girl (I'm 21 and my sister is 17) that talks shit about me, and she's a gold digger too. What should I do?"

13,"Me [16F] with my brother [23M] he ruined a lot of my very expensive yarn and is not taking any responsibility and no one seems to understand why I’m mad!


Hi all,

I’m a really avid knitter. I’ve been knitting since I was 6. I’ve always used the cheap stuff from Michaels, and although t worked just fine color has always been my favorite part of knitting. So, I got a job to help pay for my hobby.

I worked my BUTT OFF over the summer and earned $1200 (child labour laws cut into how long I could work because I was 15 at the time) and I spent about $700 of it on yarn and supplies. Which sounds absurd- but I sell a lot of what I make. Also, one scarf can easily cost $50 in yarn. The average price of a ball of yarn I buy is $20. I used up all my old yarn making hats for premies so my only stock is the luxury yarn.

My brother recently stayed in my room while I was at my dads for a week. I told my brother to please, for the love of god, not touch any of my knitting supplies. They were in a few storage tubs in my closet, completely out of his way.

Well, my brother decided to do a DIY project for his girlfriend. He took my yarn and made pom poms out of it. Yup. He made her a stupid pom pom Christmas tree. (It was floating around Pinterest)  I came home, and almost fainted when I saw it. He seemed to realize his mistake and gave it back to me but it’s ruined because it’s cut into pom poms. If you’re a knitter, you’ll understand the absolute horror of seeing Malabrigo and zen garden CUT INTO PIECES.

He managed to use up about 3/4 of basically every skein I had. He also didn’t wind them so they’re tangled messes because he used them in hank form.

I was shocked and he left to go back to where he lives before we could discuss it really because I went to bed and he left early the next morning.

I called my brother today (he flew back yesterday) and told him it really bothered me that he disrespected me like that. He was apologetic and offered to pay, but when I informed him the cost would be $700 he became really angry and told me that was absurd and that I should “stop wasting my money on stupid yarn” and told me he’d send me a gift certificate to michaels (which he did- - $20 one).

I went to my parents and they told me he’s an adult and they can’t force him to abou me back. I asked if they would pay then and they told me that I should take it as a lesson to be more careful with my stuff. Which I was- it was in the closet, hidden in opaque storage tubs! He had to have been looking for it!

I don’t know what to do. I recently lost my job because the store closed and I can’t afford to replace it all. Am I just screwed here?

TLDR: brother cut up my expensive yarn for pom poms to make Christmas tree. He ruined about $700 worth Of yarn by cutting and tangling it. He flew back home before I could confront him, and refused to pay over the phone once I informed him of the cost and sent me $20 to make up for it. Parents are unwilling to intervene and I can’t afford to buy more anymore. What should I do??? How do I get over this and continue my relationship with him? Should I just drop it?"

Hello reddit, I have a problem that I can use advice on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and we don't really have any problems. He treats me well and any problem we have we resolve it with respect. He never swears at me or even raises his voice when we're having an argument. Throwaway because friends know my reddit account. 

Recently I've been having some problems with my blood pressure and I made an appointment to go to my doctor. I was skyping with my boyfriend while I was changing to go to the doctor. He commented on the underwear that I was wearing. He asked me ""are you really going to the doctor in those underwear? I don't want them to see you like that."" I was kind of surprised, so I said: ""It's not about you, it's about my health. and who even cares."" He ended the call and won't talk to me. We trust each other a lot so I feel like this isn't a trust issue. I don't mean to invalidate his feelings I just don't understand. The doctor is there to help me, not check me out. I explained this to him, but he still insists he is uncomfortable with the idea. I wasn't wearing a thong, it was just regular lace underwear from the store. It's not anywhere near lingerie. Anyone have any suggestions on what to do here? Thanks in advance.  


 tl;dr : My boyfriend is uncomfortable with the underwear I'm wearing to the doctor. 

EDIT: Wow, thank you to everyone for the comments and advice. I read a good amount of the comments and I agree, that what he said was immature and controlling.

I went to my doctor's appointment after posting this, and after he texted me asking how the doctors' appointment went. I told him we needed to talk. I got home, and called him over skype. I explained that what he said was controlling and it hurt, and most importantly that I was gonna wear whatever I damn well please and my health is the priority in the situation. He apologized for hanging up on me, and he wasn't angry with what I said, but he said ""You shouldn't wear lace underwear because they're going to be uncomfortable to do a physical in and I don't want people to see you like that if it isn't necessary."" I was confused and said I didn't get a physical, that it was concerning my blood pressure and that only. He for some reason thought that I would also get a physical because I haven't been to the doctor in a long time. He told me that every time he goes to the doctor he has to do a physical and that he needs to choose the right underwear because he doesn't want the doctor to see his penis/balls. So then I realized that he is basically insecure or nervous about going to the doctor and getting examined and he's putting it on me. I asked him if that was the case and he said it's possible. I explained to him that in the U.S., you usually do not need to get undressed during a physical, and said he wasn't aware of that. I also told him that regardless, my health comes first and it doesn't matter how he feels about what I'm wearing. If the doctor needs to see me undressed to help me, they're going to and he can't do a thing about it. He agreed and apologized for sounding like underwear was more important than my health. I feel like there are some deep insecurities with my boyfriend, so those of you who pointed that out you definitely aren't wrong. As far as I can tell, we're clear on both sides at the moment. I will, however, continue to be cautious moving forward with him. "
15,"Wife [23F] wants me [25M] to apologize to her best friend [23F] because I yelled at her after she repeatedly grabbed my butt at a party. Wife thinks I went too far. What do I do?


This is long so apologies if some things sound haphazard. 

Friday night I went to a house party with my wife and some friends. Her best friend Laura was wasted within the first couple of hours. She was stumbling around giggling and falling into people's laps ""accidentally."" I usually tolerate this and humor her because she's my wife's oldest and best friend, but honestly I find her pretty annoying most times. 

After Laura gets pretty drunk, she starts grabbing my butt every time she passes me, never stops or anything, just a drive-by butt grab when she's walking into another room. I ignore it maybe the first 3-4 times despite being grossed out internally, but she gets bolder and starts REALLY grabbing it. Like holding on for 5+ seconds and laughing and spilling her drink around. I tell her to stop pretty firmly several times, but nothing went through to her. 

Around the 10th butt grab I loudly say to her ""LAURA STOP IT"" and everyone stopped and glared. Someone in the group I was chatting with tells her the same thing, that enough is enough and she needs to go sit down somewhere and drink some water. She laughs and tells us to lighten up...

Finally (at roughly butt grab #15) I was standing in the backyard with some friends when she runs up and grabs my butt with both hands, spilling an entire beer down the back of my pants in the process. I quickly whip around and yell in her face ""what the FUCK is wrong with you? Get the fuck away from me!"" Everyone stares. Laura's face immediately crumples and it looks like she's just about to cry. She slips back into the house and some people come up to me and ask what happened. Thankfully my friends who had seen this whole thing unfold all night defended me and told them Laura grabbed my butt nonstop all night. 

Apparently right after this Laura ran back inside to my wife and a bunch of her girlfriends who were watching a film in the basement and completely unaware of this entire ordeal. She told her that she was just playing around with me, just joking around, when I ""grabbed"" her and screamed in her face to ""fuck off."" She was inconsolable and kept asking my wife why I hated her so much, etc. etc. 

Well wife and I have been fighting over this ever since. My wife is convinced I'm completely in the wrong because Laura was ""just playing"" and I overreacted. I told her I was honestly so sick of Laura's grabbing and didn't know what else to do. My wife thinks I should've just ignored it like everyone else, and yelling in her face was me trying to be intentionally hurtful. She said I should know by now that Laura means well and she gets troublesome when she drinks but that's no excuse to humiliate and verbally reprimand her in public. She also says she ""doesn't know what to believe"" when I tell her I NEVER touched Laura, because she said there's two sides to every story. I tell her to ask the friends that were there for confirmation of my story. She ignores me.

I feel sick thinking of apologizing to that friend of hers and I know I'm not going to do it. However, how do I talk it through with my wife? She's convinced I need to apologize first to smooth this over, but how can I? What do I do now?

18,"I (30M) messed up with my son (3 months) and my wife (28F) says she’ll never forgive me. It’s been almost two weeks of the silent treatment. How do I fix this?


My wife and I have been together for a decade and our son is our second child; our first son was three hours old when he died. That’s probably enough identifying information if she sees this, but then again I am desperate here so maybe that’s not such a bad thing. 

The day after Christmas, my wife was napping in our bedroom and I had our son out on the couch playing. He fell asleep on my chest and I must have dozed off. I woke up to my wife screaming at me and hitting me; my son had rolled into the crook of my arm and was face down with his nose and mouth being blocked. I don’t know how long he was like that.

When she picked him up he took a deep breath and woke up, but we called 911 all the same; he ended up being fine and the EMTs reassured us but did give me a lecture about never letting him fall asleep not on his back if someone’s not watching him. I deserved to be screamed at and hit and lectured by the EMTs 100%. I am not debating that at all, please don’t say that my wife is abusive or anything because she was just trying to wake me up and she didn’t hurt me. 

I should also mention that I am not sleep deprived in the slightest; my son mostly sleeps through the night and when he does wake up, my wife doesn’t usually need me to help, she just breastfeeds him and he falls back asleep. So I have no excuse at all for falling asleep holding my son. 

Later that night I apologized to my wife in tears. She just looked at me and said, word for word, “You almost killed my baby. I hate you. I will never forgive you.” And pointed at the door. I was so ashamed. I went to the guest bedroom and spent the night there lying awake. I tried to go help her with our son when I heard him wake up in the night but she had locked our bedroom door. 

The next morning she packed up her things and my son's things and went to stay with her parents for a few days. I even helped her load the car; I knew I needed to give her space. As she was leaving I told her I loved her and my son and I was so sorry, and if she needed anything to call me and I’d be there in a heartbeat. She didn’t answer.

She texted me a few times while she was with her parents to ask for me to bring over my son’s tummy time mat and her breast pump, and when I got to her parents house she said to just leave them on the porch because she didn’t want to see me. But since she got home, she literally hasn’t spoken a single word to me and won’t let me hold our son. I only get to see him briefly in the afternoon when I get home from work, before she picks up all his things and retreats into our bedroom. 

Again I don’t deny at all that I fucked up majorly. I am wracked with guilt every day thinking of what could have happened. But I want a chance to show her that I will never let something like that happen again. at first i thought she was saying she hated me out of anger and she didn’t really believe that, but now I’m beginning to think she did mean it. She can’t possibly hate me more than I hate myself. 

It’s been 11 days and I have hardly gotten to see my son even though he lives under the same roof, and my wife won’t even look me in the eye. I don’t know what I can do to fix things because I want to give her space. I am thinking of writing her a letter and sliding it under the door, but I’m not sure she’d read it. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thank you. 

Tl;dr I fell asleep while holding my son and he got stuck with his face blocked and could have suffocated, my wife hasn’t spoken to me in almost two weeks because of it. "

I attended my cousin’s wedding 2 weeks ago. The wedding and reception was held at a fancy hotel and I thought I should dress appropriately. The dress I wore was a red, ankle length, lace dress. I thought it was formal, elegant, and it does not look like a wedding dress at all. My cousin didn’t have any specific dress code for me. Although I am not in her bridal party officially, we are pretty close and I helped out with the wedding preparations and logistics. Everything went smoothly, the bride looked amazing, the decorations were beautiful, the food was good. 


After the wedding, her mom came up to me and said my cousin was pretty upset at me because she thought I was dressed too nicely and I overshadowed her at her own wedding. Apparently, I made her cry. I feel terrible, but at the same time I also don’t think it’s true at all. My cousin looked stunning during the wedding and my dress didn’t look like a wedding dress. 


The next day my cousin posted a passive aggressive FB status about arrogant people who try to upstage the bride and how you can’t trust people. I’m pretty hurt because I did not intend to do that. I privately messaged her saying that I never intended to do that and she didn’t reply. This whole situation is turning into a family feud. My aunt (cousin’s mom) is no longer speaking to mom and cancelled the trip that they planned together to visit my elderly grandmother who lives in another country. She told my mom that she didn’t raise her daughters right. They both cancelled on my nephew’s 1st birthday party when they initially rsvped yes. Should I reach out and apologize again? What can I do to resolve this situation? I feel awful.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7njmyf/am_i_f_almost_22_being_too_clingy_or_is_my/

I couldn't wait until Saturday. On Tuesday, I asked him when he was flying back in from vacation and he told me he was flying in around 12:30 AM on Thursday, so I told him I wanted to come over to his house after work that day (today) to talk. He apparently had plans with another coworker of ours (which I was salty about because I figured that he would want to see his girlfriend, of all people, after being gone for two weeks) but he blew them off because it sounded important.

So I went over to his house tonight with a box of his things and gave him the spiel. I said pretty much everything I said in my post then basically laid it down to, ""If you're not into me anymore, I'd understand, but please just break up with me so we can find people who are better suited to us, and if you are into me still, then you need to show it."" The entire time he nodded his head and looked very understanding.

Once I was done talking, he admitted that he had indeed been distant for the past month and a half, particularly the past three weeks. He then explained that the reason for this is because he realized that we have very different aspirations for the future and he has been racking his brain and talking to everyone trying to find a way to make it work. I asked him what he wanted that I didn't and he said.....kids. 

He wants kids within the next couple of years. He said he thinks he'd make a really great dad, and he knows that I'm young and that's not something that I want, and even if it is, it wouldn't be something that I would want within the next couple of years. He told me that it was killing him inside that he couldn't think of a compromise that could work for us to be together because he loves me (first time he's every told me that, and the last). He said he didn't want to continue on in our relationship hanging onto 'maybes' only for us to end up resenting each other or pressuring each other into things we don't want. I let him know that I'm still growing and my thoughts on it could still change, and that right now, my main reservation with children is actual pregnancy and I could possibly see myself adopting. He shook his head and said he wanted children of his own.

He's right. 

We cried in each others arms, collected my things, and discussed our boundaries at the office. I let him know that I didn't regret our relationship and that I'm so thankful for all of the good that we had together. I thanked him for being so good to me and for showing me the way that I deserve to be treated in a relationship (before the emotional distancing, of course). He then told me that he was honored to be my first boyfriend as he understood how big of a step that was for me to take and said that I'm the best girlfriend he's ever had and I've showed him love more than anyone he has ever dated before, including his ex-fiancee. He said that he felt for a long time that he didn't deserve love and I showed him that he did. We agreed that we were going to keep all of the gifts that we'd given to each other and that we needed some time apart to grieve but that we would still be friends and that we wished the best for each other in finding people who have the same aspirations for the future. He then walked me to my car for the last time.

Fuck, this sucks. 
  
  ---   
TLDR: Boyfriend was suddenly being distant, turns out it's because he realized that he wants kids within the next couple of years and that's not something I want or am able to commit to; he was trying to find a way to make it work but realized it was a non-negotiable for him. Even though he loves me, we broke up. "
27,"My wife [30/F] laughed when she saw me [30/M] naked, and is so awkward about sex it makes me uncomfortable


I dated my wife for 3 years before we got engaged, and our engagement lasted a year. She very much is a “no sex before marriage” person, where I’m not really, but I care about her, and it wasn’t like I was going to quit on our awesome relationship. Marriage was always the end goal for me, anyways. She’s an awesome person, and we have great chemistry. I knew from probably our second date that she was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I love her more than anything in the world. We had our ceremony last night, and after the reception, we went home to our brand new house, and she said she was ready. We were going to have sex.

She was kind of awkward about it, and stripped in the bathroom because she didn’t know what to do. When she came out, I was completely naked and she started laughing. Like uncontrollable laughter. I felt really weird and uncomfortable, so I asked what was wrong and she couldn’t get it out she was laughing too hard! I asked if she still wanted to have sex, and she nodded, got in bed, and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she started laughing again. The only time she stopped was when her eyes were closed. I kept asking if we should stop, and she said no, she was really enjoying it. Then she’d open her eyes, and burst into more laughter. When we were done, I had to go get dressed again because she wouldn’t stop laughing at me and couldn’t go to sleep. 

Admittedly, I’m kind of a lanky guy. Pretty skinny, tall, but I don’t think my figure is laughable. I’d chalk it up to a first time thing, except when I changed for a shower this morning, she was standing in the doorway laughing! I told her to shut the door, and she did, and that stopped her laughing. She’s been kind of dancing around the subject, too! We’re leaving for our honeymoon tonight, and while we were packing, I said, “So, about last night.” And she went, instantly, “Oh! That was really good!”

I didn’t marry her for sex. I didn’t. I married her because I love her, and because I care for her and she cares for me. But we both walked into this with the expectation that we’d have comfortable, enjoyable sex. And this isn’t comfortable or enjoyable for me. I just don’t know what to say, though! She’s so awkward about it, too, it feels almost predatory. We both wanted at least one biological child (we plan to adopt after), and she came up to me this morning and said in a weird voice, “Let’s try and make you a daddy again sometime.” Like there’s something so *wrong* about that statement! And she’s excited to have more sex- she was asking whether we should pack 3 or 4 boxes of condoms. I just don’t want to do it without the assurance that she isn’t going to laugh at me, or make me feel otherwise uncomfortable. But I don’t want to spend our honeymoon Dr. Phil’ing it out. What should I do? Any tips? Anyone been in this weird situation before?

TL;DR: My wife laughed at me when I was naked, and is super awkward about sex. Advice?

**This is kind of an update.** My wife and I were driving to the store, because she realized she wanted to put her shampoo and stuff into a travel kit and I wanted to go with her because I love her and I want to spend time with her. She drove us there, and I was kind of going through the comments, and I was sort of psyching myself up. So, I asked her, “Why did you laugh when I was naked?” And she responded with, almost instantly, “I didn’t expect it.”

So, I was a little confused, and I asked her to clarify. My wife explained that for the year we were engaged, she had been Googling naked men to prepare, and my body was “more like a birch, than an oak.” It was a really silent car ride after that. When we pulled into the parking lot, she asked if I was mad, and I said I was a little bit embarrassed. I think she was trying to make it better, because she said, “You have the body of a chopstick, but that’s OK because I like sushi.” And that’s not even an analogy that makes sense. I decided to stay in the car, and that’s where I am right now. And I feel insanely awkward. And I kind of want to crawl into a hole and die instead of get on a flight in 5 hours. So. Looking forward to the car ride home."

So, nothing has happened. Yes, I said I’d confront him, but I didn’t. Because all is “forgiven.” I put that in quotes because there’s nothing to forgive. 

More than anything, I just want to thank those who responded. You were so kind, thoughtful, and helpful. And right.

I felt so exposed and vulnerable that I forgot a few things: my husband has *never* done something he knew would hurt me. More importantly, when I am not ok, he isn’t either, even though it doesn’t show. 

I don’t have a family of my own that I can trust, and it sucks. He has parents that I’ve never had, and they’ve welcomed me with open arms, always. They could tell I wasn’t ok, and like you all pointed out, my husband turned to them. I *cannot* hold that against him.

I would have a huge problem if they asked me directly about my issues because it just **hurts** too much to talk about. I feel safest talking about it with my best friend and therapist. The in-laws have never mentioned it, and like you all said, his gets from them what I get from my BFF and therapist. So I say no harm, no foul. 


Again, thank you all for showing me the way back to reality when I couldn’t see it through my fear and all those other shitty feelings. You’ve spared my husband and me some grief.

**tl:Dr** I felt disregarded and betrayed, but turns out I was neither of those things. Reality is better than my inner world. Also, you guys rock. "
29,"My boyfriend [28M] thinks I [30F] am too “high maintenance”


My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 1.5 years. Since my early 20s, I developed a thorough skin care routine that I use everyday. I enjoy doing it and it’s good for my skin. After I shower at night, I wash my face, moisture and occasionally use a face mask. I also fully moisturize my body, hands and feet. Three times a week, I will use a leave in hair conditioner or hair mask. This routine takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour. I do this in the living room sofa or in the bathroom so that I won’t disturb my SO if he chooses to go to bed early. I’ve been doing this routine for many years, since before we got together and my boyfriend has never had a problem with it until recently. I spend about $200 every few months on skin care products, but I don’t think it’s a lot as I earn enough to be able to afford this and still be able to live comfortably and save 10-15% of my net income every month. 


Lately my SO has been very irritated whenever I leave to do my skincare routine. For example, after we had sex, we cuddled and talked for a while and then I got up to do my skincare routine and he got visibly annoyed and said “Must you do that shit everyday?”. The next day I came home to find some of my skincare products missing and I found them hidden in the closet in his sock drawer. He said he just wanted to see how I would react when I confronted him about it. 


We went to visit his parents for the holidays + vacation and I packed my skin care products with my toiletries. I found out that he took it out and left it at home. I was super upset and had to go out and buy them and he didn’t talk to me unless necessary over the holidays when he found out that I went to buy them. Things have been tense and awkward since we returned. I finally asked him why he was so upset about this and he said that I’m too high maintenance and that is not an attractive quality in a partner. I asked him why he had an issue with it now when he never said anything over the past 3 years. He said that he didn’t think it was an issue in the beginning but he did now. I asked him if he wants to break up with me for being too high maintenance and he said he will leave it up to me to choose.

Is my relationship over? Is this a dealbreaker for men?

30,"Sister [24F] is demanding my parents [50s] and I [22M] owe her years of private school tuition, because I attended but she couldn't. What do I do?


So this is a really thorny issue right now. My sister is demanding my parents and I start a fund for her with all the money she's ""owed"" throughout her life. I don't know what to say. 

Some background. My parents had sent both of us to private school starting in elementary school. After two years I had done well but my sister started acting up in middle school and got kicked out. The private school pretty much blacklisted her and told my parents they will no longer consider re-enrolling my sister ever. I even remember being dragged to some of these meetings last minute because my parents couldn't find a babysitter. That school _hated_ her.

My parents looked at the remaining private schools and they weren't great. The second best school was a public charter school which is where they sent my sister. She did okayish here, got into some trouble, but never kicked out although she was always on the cusp of failing out because her grades got progressively terrible.

For university I got into a great private university and took out a bunch of loans to pay for myself. My sister got into a state college and my parents paid for all 4 years. I'd have thought this was enough to balance things out in her mind, but no.

We've both graduated now and my sister is suddenly demanding after so many years that my parents ""repay"" her for the years of public school that she had to endure while I went to private. She calculates almost 100k of school tuition that she's ""owed."" I think she's being absolutely ridiculous but she'll swear up and down to anyone that'll listen that my parents ruined her life because they favored me and only sent me to the exclusive, expensive schools. She never mentions that the schools THEMSELVES kicked her out, and my parents tried their best to get her into the second best school. 

The issue is my mom has been fighting late-stage breast cancer for the past 2 years and mentally she's not all there anymore. She gets confused a lot and very emotional, so my sister's angry tantrums has had a huge toll on her. She now wants to dig into her and my dad's life savings to give sister this 100k to appease her. My dad is giving a firm ""no"" but he's also concerned about my mom who simply can't stand this much turmoil in the family or finger-pointing from my sister. 

I hate my sister so much for being this entitled and deluded, but I don't know what I should do. She constantly posts on facebook about how all her friends are buying houses right now and she can't because of my parents (no effing idea how my parents keep her from buying a house...) and everyone believes her sob stories. She even told me that if my parents can't find the money, then it's my responsibility to find her this money. It's so ridiculously insane I don't know what to do anymore. 

She knows my mom is weak and suggestible and I think what she's doing is cruel and selfish, but what can I do? How can I protect myself? Is there anyway I can still get through to my sister, or is she just a lost cause by now?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Older sister went to several years of public school while I went to private, only because she was kicked out of the only good private school in our area. Now as adults she wants my parents to pay her 100k for the years of school she didn't have. My mom is sick and wants to go along with sister, but dad and I don't. How do we resolve this issue? Is my sister beyond reason?"
31,"My adult girlfriend’s mother wants to track her phone


My girlfriend is 28 years old. We’ve been together for 3 years and are living together. She is perfect, but her parents are obsessed with her. They call her multiple times a day, constant texting etc. I do understand in a way. Her only sibling passed away a couple years before we started dating and they live about 3 hours away. But every day she comes in the door talking with her mom, I’m always seeing her phone light up with her mom’s name calling or texting. They always want to know where she is, that she’s safe. I think it’s a combination of the tragic passing of her sibling and their own boredom. While somewhat understandable, I still find it selfish, and she has referred to their behavior as selfish as well. From what I understand they’ve always been overbearing even before the event. For instance, when she went to another state for college her parents moved to that state to stay close, and this was before her sibling, who had special needs, passed.

Today, after I woke up to her speaking with her mom over the speaker phone for an hour, pretty much about every detail of our night last night, her mom texted her during breakfast tellling her about this “safety” app where she can track my girlfriend and receive updates on locations and possible incidents (Not sure how it can track if she may be in danger, but that’s what her mom said). My girlfriend told me about this request and did say she told her mom no. I still got annoyed that her mom seems to keep overstepping theses boundaries. My girlfriend is a full grown adult woman and has been functioning independently for years.

We’re at a point now where we’re seriously discussing marriage. Privacy is a huge priority to me, and I fear once we get married they are going to move close to us. She actually told me they would definitely move close if we had kids. So I’m worried that once we had kids I’d feel like I was in a total strangle hold. This dynamic of our relationship is my number one reason I’m hesitating on heading in the direction of marriage.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? It seems like whenever I bring it up she gets emotional about how they lost their child and starts to cry. I don’t want to appear like I’m trying to pull her apart from her parents, but I’m concerned that I’ll be miserable if things play out like I worry they will if we tie the knot and have kids.

32,"My boyfriend [35M] and I [31F] of 2.5 years are having differing opinions on an engagement ring.


[removed]"
33,"I (17f) have recently become aware that my mom (46f) is an awful jealous step mom


My older sister, Emily, (22f) is from my dad's first marriage. My parents got together when my sister was 6 and I was 1 or 2. They married a few years later. My dad is technically my step dad, but he adopted me when I was a baby and has always cared for me equally. I adore him. Anyway, my sister recently visited us for Christmas and the visit has left me thinking. 

Up until Emily was 12 she lived with her mom, when her mom was killed in a car accident. She had to come live with us. My parents had had two more kids by this time, my brothers. We all had our own rooms. When Emily came to live with us, my dad decided she needed her own room. As she was older, had just lost her mom, and was an only child back with her mom. My brothers now had to share. My mom went pretty ballistic over it but my dad didn't budge. But I definitely remember all the snide comments my mom would make to her while we'd be eating dinner or whatever. Always when my dad wasn't there. In retrospect, Emily was always nice and would play and share her PlayStation and game boy with us. My room was next to hers, and I could hear her crying in her room at night almost every night. I never said anything. 

I got off track, but I felt the need to explain Emily's situation. The summer Emily turned 16 she stayed with her grandma for the vacation. When she came home, it's like she had got pretty overnight. She was pretty before but now everyone noticed. Including my mom. I'm not gonna lie, even I was a little jealous of her. Anyway my sister had a few friends. Some of them were boys. One of her best friends was a dude named Tyler. She would come home from the movies or being out with her friends and my mom would grill her. She'd also ask really pointed questions that Emily hanging around so many boys would give her a reputation.

Also at this time, my mom was constantly complaining to my dad that he was spending too much time with Emily and not the rest of us. (He was teaching her to drive) She got herself a job at Starbucks and after a few months finally earned enough to buy herself a car. My mom bitched about this too, that Emily was so spoiled and how she always got everything she wanted whenever she wanted. 

I've named a few instances, but stuff like this went on for years until my sister graduated from high school and left for college out of state. She has never come back home to live, not even for summer after her first year. I think she had two jobs to support herself at this time. She comes back about once a year to visit with us. Only ever for like a week though. While she was here, her and my mom got into a fight about how she never comes to visit and why she (my sister) doesn't love her siblings enough to visit more. My sister quietly said she'd visit more when my mom was dead. Everything went really quiet in the house after this and my mom started crying and my sister just went to her room and packed her bags. She left a few hours later. I don't know if she'll come back. 

I've always known that they don't get along but I've just kind of given a blind eye to how my mom treated her through all the years. My brothers and I just feel so bad and were so scared she's never gonna come home again, we love her. I feel scared and ashamed to reach out to her but I really want to call her and tell her how much I love her. What can I do? How can I reach out to her?


**tldr**; my mom is an evil step mom and I think she's finally pushed my sister over the edge to never come home again


**UPDATE**


*I posted a new post but deleted it after someone told me it would get removed because it's only been 10 hours. Am posting it here instead.*


I texted my sister a few hours ago. I told her I loved her and if she wanted she could call me. Originally I was going to call her but I got really nervous and didn't want to force her to talk to me if she didn't want to. Emily called me a few minutes later. She told me she was sorry for leaving the way she did but that she had to get out of here (our house). I told her I was sorry for what happened and that my mom has been terrible towards her. She told me she was trying to ignore my mom this visit but she couldn't and she doesn't think she can come back here after she fought for years for control of her life. She told me every time she comes back she feels like she just gives it right back up again. I let her know that I understood and told her I loved her again. She sounded really tired and sad. I feel bad for forcing it in there but I told her if she ever wanted to and it was okay if she didn't that I would still like to have a relationship with her and maybe I could visit sometimes. She just laughed and told me I could visit whenever I wanted but convincing my mom was another story. I laughed and agreed too. Overall the call consisted of me and her mostly telling each other we loved each other throughout the call. 


I know things still aren't fixed and may never be but I feel a lot better knowing Emily doesn't hate me too and that she's willing to have a relationship with me now or later. It's a big weight off my chest that I'm not sure I deserved. That's all I got for now Reddit. I still need to talk to my dad about my mom but I'm still working up the nerve. Thanks to every single person who gave advice and helped me get in touch with my sister.

34,"I [23M] just proposed to my gf [22F]. She agreed to say yes as long as I promise to buy her a nicer ring years later. Is this normal?


Sorry if I sound clueless. I've been with my gf since high school and am the first of my friends to get engaged. I don't really understand what's normal or not when it comes to this. 

Gf and I have been together for 7 years now and we've been talking about marriage a lot. We've been waiting for college graduation and now that she's finally graduated I decided to propose. We both come from a really small town but now live in a larger city. We share 99% the same friends back home, and she's my best and closest friend where we live right now. 

Needless to say we're not swimming in cash right now. I'm still getting my masters and doing some part-time work after classes. I could only afford a $1300 ring which I suppose is on the lower end of diamond engagement rings. However, it really was the best I could afford without dipping into money reserved for essentials like bills/food/etc. 

I planned out an elaborate date night and proposed to my gf during the last event. She seemed overwhelmed and happy and I thought all was good. Maybe two days later she approaches me and tells me with teary eyes that she needs me to promise that I'll buy her a bigger ring when I start making decent money. She says she's been thinking it over and she feels like I'd be ""getting her for cheap"" and taking her for granted basically if I don't buy her a substantial engagement ring at some point. She tells me she doesn't expect it immediately, but if she says yes to my proposal then it means I must buy her a big ring the moment I can afford it. 

I was really hurt and taken aback by this. I certainly wasn't trying to swindle her or whatever, just give her the best of what I could afford right now. Of course when I make more money I'd be more than happy to buy her nice things of my own free will, but I don't know how to feel about being made to promise I'll buy it. She asks me to promise her that the next ring will be at least 10k or above because that's how much any decent ring costs. She thinks that will be no problem because what I'm studying and the field I'm going into should get me more than enough money to afford that. I guess she's not wrong but it does feel very cold and calculated.

Tbh I don't know that much about engagement rings or diamonds so I don't know if she has a point. If I really did just give her a shoddy ring that anyone would be embarrassed to have, then I sort of get where she's coming from. But I had asked a bunch of her girlfriends before and they all said it looked beautiful and tasteful, so I don't know. 

Anyways is this a normal thing for her to ask? Is this a common part of engagements when you're a broke student trying to propose? Should I wait and take some time to think about this? I don't know what to do.

**edit**: Lots of people asking if someone else put these ideas into her head. That's what I thought too at first but she confessed she was unhappy with the ring the moment she saw it but didn't want to spoil the moment. She said she's been looking at diamond rings since she was a little girl, so she knows everything about quality/style/price of rings which is why she decided 10k for 1.5 carats was the base type she wants (in the future). So I think she really thinks this without anyone needing to convince her.

36,"Me [19F] with my family [52F/28M/25F] are not speaking to me because of my ""cheap"" gifts at christmas.


Throwaway because my older brother knows my reddit account.

---

Hello Reddit, I really have no one to speak with about this so I hope you people can a girl out.

I am a college student living on my own away from family with barely any financial support. Only my phone bill is paid by my parents and I live at home for free a couple a times a year during holidays.

I really, really am tight on money. I work a job and sell art online on the side for money while going to college at the sane time. Living isn't especially cheap here even in a shared apartment with four other people, but I make it work by putting some money aside from time to time.

Now comes the holiday season and I am trying to give all my family plus my extended family (Multiple uncles, aunts, grandparents and cousins) gifts. Because of this, I try to spread money evenly to of course get my immediate family some nicer gifts.

I mostly wrapped the presents nicely and wrote almost everyone a short thoughtful little message. I got a nice tie for my dad [52M] because he LOVES wearing his special suits on special occasions and a couple of books for my mother [52F] because she enjoys reading in bed. A very nice scarf for my sister [25F] with some of her favorite chocolate and I got my brother [28M] some really sweet new dice sets because he plays D&amp;D like thrice a week with his friends. Most of my other family got smaller gifts like candles, a heatable pillow or a gift card. I mostly survived on instant noodles for three months.

When my family unwrapped presents Christmas morning, I quickly realized most people got expensive gifts. My family is pretty well off in that regard. Perfumes, Video Games or Consoles, expensive clothing and even concert tickets! When my sister opened her gift she audibly sighed and put it aside without saying anything but ""How usual!"". My brother even took me aside to talk about the price of his dice set!

It hurt a lot! I put a lot of thought and effort into these gifts and only my dad was happy and gave me a hug. I know they aren't the most extreme gifts but I tried where I could.

My sister said she never got me anything so cheap! I know because my parents paid for her university while I have to loan to get through college because I didn't become a lawyer but wanted to study art which isn't ""real"" instead.

For the rest of my stay they were really mean and were ignoring me for the most part. I mostly hung out with my dad or outside of the house or in my own room. I even went home early and didn't spend New Years with them because I felt like crying every time we were in the same room together because my mom and my siblings were super nice to each other and then they went cold and dismissive when they spoke to me. My dad was super sad and almost cried but then again it hurt me that he didn't put his foot down and spoke to my family about how this isn't okay and we should talk about this but he didn't which isn't how a father should treat his daughter.

I spent New Years alone drunk and when I texted them to wish them a Happy New Year only my dad and brother replied. I don't know what to do anymore, this situation sucks so much. Do I even want to see my mom and my siblings again? Heck, even my dad? I can live on my own in that regard but I love them so much and this shouldn't even be happening.

We're fighting after she she got caught naked in front of my roommates and their friends. She does this thing where she dashes down the hall when she thinks they're asleep or out to use the bathroom because it's better than mine. This was about a week and half back.

She misjudged this time obviously because they were getting high in the front room and had her stuck in the hallway when they saw.

Now she's doing that regularly, not as a show off but going around like it's normal when she needs to ""because they've seen it."" I'm not okay with it though I trust everyone and they're good guys until this. 

I just feel embarrassed and also like they're getting something that should just be for me. She disagrees and they're giving me shit. Advice for me?

Well, we ended up talking about it a second time. He just insisted on continuing on like nothing was different and I just couldn't do that. 

I explained to him that:

1. If he didn't want roommates/an SO/anyone living with him *that is 100% within his rights* but then DON'T OFFER.

2. The fact that he did offer, we had lengthy conversation about it and we're making plans and THEN he changed his mind is why I was upset. I would have been able to understand if he knee-jerk over promised and then later or a day or two even decided ""OMG that's not actually going to work, oh shit"". I could have gotten past that eventually. Weeks of planning and THEN going back on it was something I wasn't ok with. 

3. That I understood he has the right to put his wants and needs first, but if they come before my well being and personal safety then I obviously wasn't a priority.

He backpedaled and explained that he had money issues himself, to which I reminded him that I could contribute. I have unemployment, I drive Lyft, I had never planned on asking him to support me, I just *can't afford rent*.

He said he didn't want to slowly drag into ""living together"" and he could see where it could lead that way. I reminded him again that *I* had wanted to put a time limit on it because if we ever did live together as a couple I wanted it to be because we both truly and consciously wanted that, and not ""it just ended up that way"". 

He then said I would take my resentment over my situation out on him and he didn't want that. So I was like ""So.... I'll help you but actually nah, go die on the street"" isn't supposed to make me resent you?

I said I was just done. That he wanted what he wanted which was absolutely ok. But then I didn't want to be with someone who jerked me around and didn't care about my safety because we might have an argument or two. 

I told him I wished him well, gave him a hug and left.

Three days later he texted me that I could stay. I was like ""Nah, I'm good. I don't want to be someplace I'm not truly wanted. Take care."" 

As far as my situation, I did pick up a couple off jobs and managed to pay rent another month, but after this? IDK. I've applied to anything I can think of and have had no luck.

But at least I'm not dealing with all this stress with someone who ""loves"" me not giving a damn if that happens.

Thank you all for giving me perspective that no, I was not being unreasonable and it wasn't that he decided who lives in his home (which I NEVER disagreed with) but that it was messed up of him to offer, plan, go back on it, and then want to act like that never happened.

And for the people who implied I have no ""market value"" to him, my divorce was because my ex cheated. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, cool. But then he should have divorced FIRST and THEN started a new relationship and my being out of work was due to my company going out of business entirely. Neither one at all my fault but thanks for thinking it is. :) I have plenty of value regardless of my relationship status or if something shitty has befallen me or not.

  tl;dr We broke up. If dude is so in love with his solitude he can have it, if he's so worried about resentment and arguments he doesn't have to worry about those either. Maybe next time he'll think about what he wants and is willing to do before he opens his mouth."
40,"I [31m] agreed to get a cat [1f] with my girlfriend [30f] and the cat loves me more than she loves my girlfriend.


I am quite aware that this is a silly question.

My girlfriend moved into my apartment back in March. One of her preconditions for moving in was for us to get a cat from the shelter - she's wanted one for a long time, her last place didn't allow pets, and it would help the home feel more like ""ours"". Fine by me.

We went to get the cat and they so happened to have the exact breed she's wanted since she was a kid. It was made to be! She'd been abandoned a town over. We took her home and set her up.

This cat fucking *adores* me. Loves me deeply. Follows me from room to room, sleeps in my lap, wakes me up with snuggles and purrs. And I love her too! I am glad we got her. 

My girlfriend? The cat is perfectly friendly around her, but this breed is known for picking a favorite human, and I'm clearly the favorite human. My girlfriend doesn't get laptime or anything like that. And complicating the problem is that our apartment is fairly small, so we probably can't get another cat to be ""hers"". 

Is there any way to deal with this besides ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ??

41,"Me [36M] with my Wife [34F] married 12 years, 4 kids (have girls and a boy). Wife wants 1 more, I really don't. I am interested in getting Vasectomy, but she ""won't allow it"". How to best navigate?


Generally good marriage.  We can both be stubborn, so compromise doesn't come easy (especially for DW, who is very religious - I am not).  

We are at an uncomfortable stalemate.  She comes from a family with 5 kids, I have only one other sibling.  She feels there is a ""hole"" in our family and that 5 kids is the perfect number.  I do not want any more and feel 4 is already a large family.  

Her reasons for wanting another:

* She feels there is a ""hole"" still in our family

* Being a mother is her most rewarding life experience (she doesn't work full-time)

* She loved having several siblings and feels the more the better

* I believe she loves the baby/toddler phase, which has been present in our house for the majority of our marriage.


My reasons for not wanting more children:

* I am completely satisfied with our 4 children and don't want to dilute my time and attention any more than it is with them

* I would like to retire early and more kids means I'm working more years

* DW has expressed interest in going back to work, but only after all kids are in full-day school, having another would reset the clock

* DW is very religious and insists on raising the children in mormonism.  I have left the church and it pains me to see my children indoctrinated so young.


Aside from having more kids, her libido impacted by birth control.  I'm supportive of her going off birth control, but I mentioned that this may mean I don't ejaculate inside of her, even with a condom.  She would never consider an abortion, so if she accidentally gets pregnant we would essentially have another kid.  For some reason she doesn't like me not finishing inside her.  I mentioned I could look into a vasectomy and it was a hard no for her (she feels like that's me making a final decision for her since she still holds out hope that I may reconsider sometime in the future).  


I feel sort of stuck.  In a way, I should be able to get a vasectomy with or without her approval, but don't want to upset her.  I am now concerned that the birth control issue will negatively impact our reasonably good sex life.  Any thoughts?

42,"UPDATE: My (29F) friend from college (40sM) is currently staying with my mom (60sF) and me. He is inconsiderate and is stressing us out, but I don't know how to get him out of our hair.


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mhkff/my_29f_friend_from_college_40sm_is_currently/


My last post didn't get a lot of attention, but I wanted to post an update for the people who gave me some good advice, and for the couple of friends who know the situation. The tl;dr was that an old friend was visiting for way too long, and acting way too rude and entitled, and it was stressing my mom and me out.



When I last updated, he was planning to go for an overnight trip in a city about 100 miles away. There were no rental cars available, so we let him use the van after we fixed it. I had suggested he get a hotel, however, they were all booked up. My mom suggested Airbnb, but he claimed not to know what it is, which I find hard to believe, but whatever.


He ended up going on THREE SEPARATE DAY TRIPS to this city. We were both pretty annoyed that he had no qualms about putting that many miles on our cars, but at the same time, it was worth it to get him out of the house.


Today is his last day, but his flight is late tonight. This morning, he announced his intention to take my car to another place, about 50 miles away. I expressed concern about him driving so far, and me having to take another long trip to take him to the airport, and he said, ""So what, I'll gas up your car."" I told him we needed to talk and asked him to come outside with me. 


As a few of you suggested, I told him that since he has said he appreciates my blunt feedback, I was going to give it to him right now. I told him that this was not intended to attack or berate him, but I needed to let him know how his behavior made my mom and feel. I told him that it wasn't cool that he extended his trip by two days and just assumed I'd be available to take him around. I told him it was taking advantage to take those three super long trips in our car, and that perhaps if he'd planned in advance, he could have arranged for accommodations instead of expecting me to be his personal tour guide. I told him that every single other person who has stayed with us has offered to rent a car, and that my mom was offended when she told him we had to do maintenance on the van, and instead of offering to stay near our house or get an uber, he only asked if he would have a car to drive. I told him that messing with the heater in the car without asking says ""the only thing that matters is my comfort, and I don't care about the rest of you."" I told him that, despite the fact that he has made it a habit to leave lights on and not recycle, he needs to break that habit because it is unacceptable to not follow the rules when someone opens their home to you. I also told him that the thing that made me feel the most taken advantage of was when he belittled me for ""having so many rules.""



I went on to tell him that the reason for me telling him this was not only for my own sanity, but to make him aware of a problem that was going to prevent him from ever forming a meaningful and healthy relationship (I mentioned in the OP that he desperately wants to get married). I told him that if I didn't care about him, I would have kicked him out long ago and never talked to him again, but that I decided it was worth it to tell him, because I thought he would reflect on what I was telling him and figure out a way to change his behavior.


He listened, and didn't make excuses. He apologized and said he would think about what I had told him. He apologized to my mom after we went back inside, and they had a little chat about how certain things he says rub people the wrong way. My mom advised him to consider how things he says might be interpreted. He called an uber and left several hours before the flight. He offered to leave money for his use of the cars, but we told him not to. After we left, we found it in his room anyway.


Overall I have learned to set boundaries when I have someone come and stay. My new rules are:

*No one stays longer than a week

*Guests have to rent a car

*If I have to question whether I can handle a person for a few days, that person is not invited

*I will clearly communicate to guests ahead of time that they will be expected to make their own plans, and that if I am able to I will join them, but I will not be their personal tour guide.

tl;dr Our rude guest took advantage a little longer, I confronted him on the last day, hopefully he learned something from this because I sure did."

My wife completed a three-year grad program this year at a local university. She received a full ride scholarship which was a great opportunity for us since my income covers our living expenses. We took out loans to cover the additional $8000 a year in child care expenses, and another $8000 to cover school expenses we weren't able to pay from my income. It was a bit of a sacrifice, but our plan was to complete her grad degree for about $32,000.   

The twist came a few weeks ago when her loan statements came through. My heart sunk when I discovered she had taken out two additional loans bringing the total to just over $65,000. Then I found out she maxed out two credit cards for another $10,000. She also earned $12,000 or so in summer internships that was supposed to go towards school expenses. Overall we are looking at about $75k-$85k+ of which as much as $50k is unaccounted for.   

We haven't talked about it in depth yet, and honestly I need a sanity check. I feel like I cannot trust her as a financial partner. Is it out of line to ask for her bank statements to see where the $40,000+ went? I feel like complete transparency about our mutual finances is an acceptable request if we are going to be financially successful. Or am I being a controlling ass who needs to chill out? Where do we even begin to address this?

However, I started to delay what I wanted to do. I guess I really am I coward. I started walking around even though currently, its hot as satan's asshole.

Things that I had previously blocked out are all flooding in at once and i just want this to be over. I went out and bought some UMAT preparation materials from this girl on facebook.

UPDATE from:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nx3ne/my16f_aunt45f_who_is_also_my_boss_who_is_also_my/

So last night while my parents were visiting for god knows what reason, I basically broke down in tears. When questioned with 'with the fuck are you doing' I told them i couldn't work for her anymore and if I were to, I need 2 conditions met:

1) double how much i'm working now. I thought that was a good compromise since the aunt and the co-owner believe that I'm not good enough despite me filling the role of an actual employee and hence probably the closest i'm going to get to minimum wage.

2)The co-owner was not to speak to me unless it was appropriate in context of boss-employee relations. I didn't care that he was 'basically part of the family' and 'because he thinks you're family, he gets you special treatment'. No- special treatment is not screaming at me in front of customers so loud that they come to my defense and tell him to 'stop yelling at her'. Special treatment is not slapping my back anytime he doesn't like my posture. Special treatment is not telling me in front of my face how 'pissed off' every other server is at me and how they are going'blame me for everything' regardless of how true that statement is.

My father put his hands up and said he didn't want to get involved-he bought me a camping bed to sleep on so i'm no longer sleeping on the floor and thats it.

My mother sighed at me and began to reorganize the shit on the table. So ignoring me because to her, i'm just a moaning petulant child. After I continued, she basically just said 'you ruin everything'.

After a while of me just crying, my dad finally admitted that how i'm living, despite me not sleeping on the floor anymore, was a little unfair. He told me he'd match whatever she gave me and put it towards my college fund. However, he still thinks that i'm not being paid enough even after his contribution.

After my aunt got home, we started talking.

So after this: she paused and looked at me. 'You think you're good enough to be a server?'

Something honestly broke when I heard that. I have put around 200 hours into this store- was literally on my hands and knees trying to clean the bathroom as there were stains that WOULD not come out, i've been cut by indifferent chefs who just throw shit in the dishwashing water, i've come to work while I had a flu and it apparently showed since the other servers kept telling me to please sit down and take a break which i refused because there would be no way they could handle it with only 3 people. There are so many other things I don't care to get into right now because after she said that maybe i really don't care anymore.

I don't have much self worth after living 10 years with my parents, however, there is one thing I have pride on: my work ethic. Thats the only thing I've ever been praised on- even by my shit stains of parents. When I was working at her store, I was literally going to work at 6:30 ( usually rounded to 7) working until close 4-5 and then helping her out buying and carrying things to the store because her co owner can't be fucked and believes his job as a boss is a 8-3 job and he just leaves whenever he feels like it.

Oh and by the way: my mother and this guy are close. Right after he cussed me out another time a few days before, she told me i definitely did something to him and was back chatting to him on the phone and sending him pictures of good deals that he missed. She doesn't care about me.

My aunt begins to say how shitty my attitude on my face(? I literally have no idea) was. How she hated how I looked when I was just looking and asked me why I couldn't smile at all times- even when there weren't any customers? And oh, when i did smile at the customers, she still hated my smile too and how fake it is

I looked to my parents who were sitting next to her and nodding and also adding to how shitty my attitude was, how i should just take it because i'll find myself in a worse situation- they can guarantee it.

My dad took things too far and said I just didn't want to work anymore period. My aunt said thats fine because she found someone who was quicker, smarter and easier to train today anyway. I've met her- she is smarter than me.

They then question why i have to follow every one if their accusations up. How shitty of a teenager i'm being. How i'm not as great of a worker as I think i am. Oh and how they hope neither of my siblings follow in my footsteps. There's another girl there who is the same age as me and she's been working since she was 13- has she ever complained as much as i have? How that old man that left, and how i failed everyone because of that old man up and walking, nevermind how I was trying to finish something else because the other servers could not be bothered.

so I guess the main part of this update is that i'm free. I'm not sleeping on the floor anymore but i'm being shunned by the whole family, fucking 8 year old sister included. All that supposed ' 200 hours of hard work'- gone. Down the drain. My parents hoped this trip would end well since then if i were to go to a university that is in this city, i'd have a family member to rely on. Thats gone.

Sunk ship fallacy in play, I started freaking out. I told her to put me on as a regular employee for a day- i don't give a shit about the pay. I am a good worker. I guess its a good thing that they don't give a single fuck about what I have to say since she just looked at me, sighed and asked if she ever questioned whether I was a good one? and then in literally 5 seconds, starts to discuss a new app with my mother.

I'm honestly done. I have no more family after my aunt and my parents told me I was good as dead to them after I turned 18 and I get into university. Thanks for reading reddit, however I don't think I can do this anymore. Thank you for the replies on my other post, it was nice being listened to for once.

48,"How do I [28M] talk to my girlfriend [29F] about a personal hygiene problem?


[removed]"
49,"Me [55 M] kicked out my son (29 M) and his girfriend (27 F).


TLDR : Was I wrong to kick out my son and his girlfriend after a very nasty fight?

My (55 M divorced) son (29 M) and his girlfriend (27 F) has been living with me, rent free, for two years. He works part time, she is unemployed. They have been a couple for about six years.

I allowed them to live with me as they were seemingly trying to get their act together and no one else would let them move in. They have had drug issues in the past. They also have a history of nasty fights where he beats up on her while she screams and kicks. They will fight one day and the next day they are the picture perfect loving couple.

In mid August 2017 I asked them to move out. I gave them over four and half months to move out by December 31. The girlfriend made more of an effort to research apartments to move into. My son, hardly lifted a finger.

They didn't move out on December 31. Had not even packed any of their stuff. Seemed to me they (my son especially) didn't even intend to move out.

Since I didn't want to send them into the cold winter, I said they could stay for the short term as long as they pay rent. My son agreed.

However, last night, they had a very, very nasty fight. He was shoving her around, throwing stuff, breaking stuff. She threatened him with a taser and a knife. 

I stopped the fight. Then, I said to them both, ""Get Out ... now"". 

She called a friend right away and left. She was upset she had to leave but seemed to understand. She seemed relieved to get out and away from my son.

My son, on the other hand, didn't understand why he had to go, as being my blood son, he has 'rights' to live in the house, whereas the girlfriend doesn't.

It breaks my heart that I felt pushed to the limit and kicked them out. 

I was tired of the fighting, the bickering, the screaming, the hitting, the black eyes, on and off drug use, coming and going at all hours, the part time work and unemployment, the smoking, the lack of help around the house, breaking doors.

I feel they, my son especially, took advantage on my compassion and love by not moving out by December 31.

Was I wrong to kick both of them out after that nasty nasty fight?
"
50,"My [25F] girlfriend [24F] recently upset my aunt/uncle because she said they should adopt instead of conceive and openly judged them for their choices. I'm tired of her extreme views on things. How do I talk to her about this? Is our relationship doomed?


I've been with my gf for 1.5 years. We met through mutual friends and hit it off in terms of humor and interests. There's one thing that has always bothered me tho. She LOVES playing devil's advocate to roughly every viewpoint in the world. Even when it contradicts her own, she loves being a contrarian. This is usually not a problem and some people love friendly debates but there have been increasing numbers of times where she has really pissed off or upset innocent people who didn't ask for her views or judgment. 

Latest example: last night we went to a family friend's NYE party and my aunt and uncle were there. They're in their late 30s and have been trying to conceive for the past decade pretty much. 

It's been a huge deal in our family because my aunt has miscarried several times and it was quite tragic. I introduced my gf to them and we were making small talk. There were a bunch of kids running around so my uncle made a self-deprecating joke about how childless couples usually have a lot of money at their age but they don't because they spent it all on IVF just to get one of those tiny loud things running around. 

My gf hears that and immediately launches a million questions about them having a kid. My uncle says they've decided to take a break from it all and just live life without worries. My gf asks if they've considered adoption and suddenly launches into a monologue on her views of adoption vs birth. Like how she thinks adoption should be just as popular of a method as artificial conception and how she feels people are selfish for not adopting while spending 10s of thousands on IVF. I don't think she was trying to be intentionally rude but it was SO JUDGMENTAL and she went on a huge tangent on how people that refuse to adopt are too selfish to be real parents anyways so maybe it's better they're sterile. My aunt finally speaks up and quietly says they have tried adoption years ago, but the process stopped moving forward for them at a point and it became even harder/costlier than what they've been trying. I sort of see my gf recalibrating at this new info. Then she goes off questioning if they've truly done EVERYTHING to adopt because there's no way adoption can be that difficult if they actually tried (so she's implying my aunt/uncle didn't really try). I'm really angry now and I keep trying to distract her and end the conversation but it's a lost cause. My uncle is visibly annoyed and gf is now on roll. My uncle ultimately asks her if she knows what if feels like to go through losing 3 pregnancies and if she feels ok with herself judging them at age 24. This shut her up but she didn't apologize or anything. Then I had to hear her gripe for the rest of the night about how just because they have a sob story doesn't mean they were right.

So yeah. I have no idea what to do when these things happen. The really nuclear-level ones have only happened 2-3 times in our relationship (past episodes include when she argued to a friend that it was selfish of her family to keep her newly comatose grandma on life support because the medical resources could be better used elsewhere) but it is SO FUCKING MORTIFYING when it does. 

Don't get me wrong. I love my gf but stuff likes this makes it so hard for me to see her like I want to. At the very least, I'd like her to start actually hearing the things that come out of her own mouth and filtering. What can I say to her that will make her listen? I've tried to approach this issue with her but she says there's nothing wrong with challenging people's beliefs and helping them be more openminded. I get that but she goes overboard in my opinion. 

Anyways, is this a bigger red flag then I want to believe? Has anyone had a partner like this but ultimately solved the issue? I don't want to lose anymore friends but I have noticed people wanting to hang out with us and by extension me less and less. What would you all do in my position? Thanks.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Gf likes to play devils advocate but to the extreme. Greatly offends people like my aunt and uncle and she doesn't see what she's doing is wrong. I don't know how to get through to her? Is this a bigger red flag than what I've thought?"
51,"Fiance of 10 years slept with uncle for drugs


I feel like my entire world has been turned upside down and i don't know what to do anymore.  I can't talk  about what happened to anyone and i feel that i need to have a healthy discussion about my options. 

I will try not to ramble while also giving enough background info as to have said Discussion. 

So my (30m) fiance of 10 years (27f) and i have been in a fairly healthy relationship since we met.  She and i have more in common than any other person I've yet to meet.  She had a pretty severe drug habit which formed during the early years of our relationship.  We do have 2 beautiful daughters together and have lived together for about 8 years.  

Her drug of choice is Xanax (a horrible drug). We used to before the kids where born spend entire days driving around trying to find any opiates or benzos possible to feed our addiction.  During these years we had many nights that turned out very fucked up ending in various sexual encounters with men and women. Neither of us regret these choices because they have formed us into the people we are today.  

once we found out that she was pregnant, about 7 years ago, we both made attempts to get clean so as to ensure a safe,  healthy environment to raise a child.  Both of us struggled through our own demons and after a long 2 or so year period of being clean for a while, with an occasional relapse.  We managed to kick the habit and live a somewhat normal life.  

 obviously over the years there have been times when we both have made a bad decision.  But for the most part life was going well.  Fast forward to this year. She had gone 5 years without driving due to an aggravated dui she had gotten before we sobered up.  This made life extremely difficult for both of us as it limited the things that she was able to do with the kids while i was at work.  So finally in the spring time this past year we saved the money to get her license back.  This should have been a joyous time for both of us.  However after a couple months i began to notice signs of her using Xanax again.   

So i had noticed she had been spending considerably more time at her aunts house, which i didn't think much of because, well, it's family and we needn't usually think twice about a SO going to their families house for the day.  Her aunt and husband have lived together yet separated for the past 5 years or so.  I'm going to call him her uncle because that was the family dynamic i had been introduced to when we first met,  and my fiance has a female cousin who is only a few years younger than she is.  My fiance had grown up knowing this man as her uncle from about the age of 5.  I should mention that the uncle has been known to be very sexually open as far as being bisexual and having an open relationship with the aunt for the last 5 or so years of their marriage. (And being open about the whole situation, at times almost too open... )

So about 6 weeks ago i came home to find my fiance passed out on the floor with her phone still in her hand.  I clearly could tell she was intoxicated so i picked her up and carried her into the bedroom and put her in bed. This is when my life got turned upside down btw... 

I had made the mistake of taking her phone and placing it on the nightstand when i noticed her text message app was open because she had been in the middle of a conversation. I looked at the screen to see a conversation between her and her uncle making plans to trade Xanax for sex depending on whether her time of the month was over in time for the weekend. This wasn't like hundreds of dollars worth of drugs,  more like 10 dollars or so depending on the market.... TEN DOLLARS.  

I'm shook to the core.  I don't know what to do or how to process this.  As anyone ever in a relationship will know we have had ups and downs but i never in a million years would have guessed that this was going on. I mean this, to me,  is way way worse than any other flirting or cheating even that i have ever dealt with.  We have both made mistakes.  I'm very forgiving.  But lately i feel as though things haven't been right.. And obviously i was right.  I've talked to both her and the uncle about what happened.  I basically got two different versions of ""I'm a horrible person and i hate myself and blah blah blah"" i feel like any amount of trust that we were grasping just slipped through my fingers.  I don't understand.  Why not just buy the drugs... Why does sex have to be transactional. This isn't the first time she has broken my trust... i just feel like if i can't trust her to go to her families house for the day without finding not only a means to get high but also a way to factor in sex WITH A FAMILY MEMBER AT THAT. 

I know what i should do.  But i also know that this isn't just my girlfriend but my best friend and the mother of my 2 little girls.  I would be utterly devastated to break up, but i don't see our relationship ever being the same again.  I don't think I'll be able to trust anyone for a long time.  

Tl;dr fiance of ten years was trading sex for Xanax from her uncle.  Cant talk to anyone irl due to stigma... need advice

53,"I [30 F] recently got engaged to my boyfriend [26 M] of 2.5 years, found out about his past today and I'm crushed


I recently got engaged to my boyfriend of 2.5years, and I spent some part of the holiday with his family. During one of the dinners at his parent's place, his mother casually mentions how this girl named Audrey was so into him and how much time they had spent together. From what he has told me in the past, Audrey was just a friend and there was nothing more. He had told multiple times to me when I noted of all the photos they had together in his Instagram and Facebook. 

Today, I stumbled across her Instagram account for the first time. As I go through her page, it becomes apparent to me that they did in fact date and had an intimate relationship. They had traveled together extensively. They did the whole ""dating"" thing, like visiting wineries, going to concerts together, checking out hip joints, and etc. All the stuff he refused to do with me because those ""weren't his things"". As I confronted him, he also acknowledged that he had gifted her lavish jewelries out of volition - which of course he never did for me. 

I'm crushed because I don't know why he lied to me about Audrey . He repeatedly lied to me for 2.5 years about her. I'm also crushed because he never tried so hard to take me out on ""real dates"" citing that he wasn't into dining out/ going to places/etc, but he in fact did all those in the past with Audrey . I really thought he wasn't into doing those activities - turns out that wasn't the case. I don't know if I want to be with him anymore. He had potential to treat me so much nicely, but I guess he chose not to. I had accepted his lower standards of treating ... me. Thoughts?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I found out today that my fiance's friend was in fact an ex. He had lied to me about her. He treated her nicely, taking her out on dates, spoiling her with lavish gift, etc. I can't help but feel violated by the fact he (1) lied to me and (2) has not treated me as well as he treated Audrey, the ex. Should I even stay with him?"
54,"I [22F] learned that my grandfather [65M] killed his first-born about 30 years ago and got away with it.


As far as I know, my father is the eldest of three boys in the family, and he had a shitty childhood thanks to my abusive shithead grandfather. When I say abusive, I mean licking dust of window sills because my father didn't dust them properly (at 6 years old) or making my father run up and down 10 flights of stairs for the lols. As a result, my father is extremely bitter towards my grandfather. They have a horrible relationship, but my father still visits them and hangs out with them because he feels that it is his duty as a son. (Especially now that the shithead is diagnosed with diabetes.)


So a few days ago, my uncle [36M] had an argument with my grandfather over his wife (she is a foreigner and my grandfather is also a racist shithead. She has since ran back home, and my poor cousin doesn't have a mom to raise him now but this is a separate issue). Afterwards, my father and my uncle were talking and I overhead my uncle make a comment, something about ""having a sister"". 


CONTEXT: So the thing is my father likes to have conversations with my former stepmother in the car. These conversations typically involve adult issues, and they think I cannot understand as they speak in dialect. Once, when I was six, I vaguely remember my father talking about a sister that is dead. But I have always brushed it off as my overactive imagination and never thought much about it. 


This comment by my uncle reminded me about this conversation I have eavesdropped on when I was six. So I decided to confront my father about it last night in the car to confirm my suspicions. 


Long story short, my grandfather had a daughter a year before my father was born. She, too, was abused. It was so bad that she actually died from it. As my father was very young, he cannot remember why the case was dropped or what had happened, only that he had a sister one day and then he didn't. My grandfather never did jail time for this incident. 

I am disgusted and I can't talk to my grandfather anymore. This is not the only incident. I once stood up for my sister against my grandfather and he accused me of not respecting him. However, my father insists that I have to do my duty as a granddaughter and give him the necessary respect as he is older (Asian values blah blah). How do I deal with this situation? 

I apologise in advance if this situation seems to confusing. I will be happy to clarify the details in the comments.

55,"My [18F] mother [52F] keeps attacking me about my short hair. I'm a former cancer patient.


On January 25, 2017, I was diagnosed with Stage 3B Hodgkin lymphoma. After 4 months of chemo and a month of radiation, ya boi has been in remission for 6 months! In that time, my little bald head is now just a little head with a little Afro. My hair is barely longer than two inches and I'm black so it is literally a little Afro.

I left for college in August after pleading with my parents to let me move out, so I've been more or less living my best life since then. Given that I no longer live at home, when my hair reached a length beyond ""newborn baby,"" I decided to stop wearing a wig.

My mom did not like that. At. All.

As soon as I came home for thanksgiving break, she took to unconventional methods to convince me to continue wearing a wig: insulting me.

It started off passive aggressive and then became full on aggressive.

At first, she was forcing me to wear a wig when I left the house while I was at home because ""Don't you want to look presentable when you go out?"" I decided to appease her because I had to acknowledge that seeing me with short hair may have been bringing up unpleasant cancer memories for her. 

Then it became only complimenting my appearance when I was wearing a wig with long hair by saying ""Oh, that looks so good on you. Long hair slims your face."" I gained 30 pounds in chemo weight b/c steroids and being forced to eat all the time. I brought it up to her that it bothered me how she only complimented me when I was wearing a wig and not when I wore my hair. Her response?

""You know I hate short hair.""

Later that night, she sat me down on the living room to tell me that no man would ever be interested in me with short hair because they'd think I was into women. How no one would hire me because I don't look presentable. How I couldn't be successful in this life with short hair. And how short hair would ultimately lead to me being single and homeless if I decided to keep it this length (I'm over exaggerating in this sentence but the rest is 100% true).

Just now, we were sitting around the dining room table for family game night since all of her kids are home, (my sister who is 26 and getting her masters in medical physiology and my brother who just got his bachelors in meteorology) and while my dad is dozing off, she goes in for the attack:

""I hope you never cut your hair [my sister] because, when you show up to the medical school interview, they wouldn't accept you with your hair looking like that.""

I want to go to medical school, just like my sister. She knew what she was doing.

I'm so incredibly hurt by how awful she's being towards me about this, as if it was my choice to have my hair this short. I really need your help and advice (and maybe some kind words), Reddit. I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR: my mother is attacking me about my short hair, even I'm a former cancer patient. I'm tired of being beat down and need some help on how to handle this. What do I do?**"

58,"Me [36F] with my husband [37M] of 10 years, he's upset that I want to start using birth control after having recently given birth to our 4th child.


I gave birth to our fourth (and what I hope is final) child back in June, and I feel like I am absolutely done with pregnancy and child bearing. I love being a mom, but I would be lying if I said I felt like I could handle another. All of our kids are under 10 (6, almost 4, 2, and 6 months) and I have three under the age of four, so they require a lot of attention. Plus since my husband works a lot, the majority of child care falls on me even when he is home.

For these reasons, I mentioned to my husband the idea of looking into some sort of birth control to make sure I don't get pregnant again. We have always used rhythm or pull out, but since that didn't prevent number four, I want us to look into something more reliable and possibly even permanent rather than risk getting pregnant with number five.

I approached my husband and he told me that he didn't want us to start using non-natural birth control. This is partially because he thinks he may want one more and he would like us to try soon if so given our ages. He also said he doesn't think sex would be as enjoyable for us if we go on birth control. He has some sort of idea that it would interfere with our natural desires or feelings and might make our sex life less passionate, which I don't buy. He also doesn't think it's necessary since so far natural methods have only failed once. He thinks we should just be more careful.

I did suggest condoms as an alternative if he is concerned about using a natural method but something more effective than pull out, but he was against this as well since he doesn't like the feel...

I can understand some of his points, but I would feel much better and enjoy sex more if I wasn't so worried about getting pregnant again. I really don't want to deal with this anxiety for the next 4-7 years. It seems like he just doesn't get that concern or isn't taking it serious.

I've tried talking to him several times about this, but he keeps shutting my conversations down. I'm not sure what else to say to him. I want us to both agree on this because I think it's important that we be on the same page since it affects both of us, but right now he isn't giving me much of an option since he won't engage. I've thought about looking into something on my end - possibly an IUD if I can have it done at my age - but I know he'll feel hurt if I unilaterally make a decision.

I would really like to get him to understand my concerns and fears and agree to help me do more to prevent a pregnancy. I don't know how else to communicate these things with him, so I am open to any advice or suggestions on how I can get him to take this seriously.

**tl;dr:** Husband and I had a surprise baby earlier this year. This was our 4th child and what I hope is our last. I want to use a more reliable form of birth control so we don't have another oopsie, but my husband is against it and isn't taking my concerns seriously. How do I change that?"

I'll (28M) start out by saying that I love my girlfriend (28F) no matter the length of her hair. I have had crushes and dated girls will both long hair and short hair in the past. My issue is not with the length of the hair, it is how she is acting now.

We have been together for 3.5 years now. We have been seriously talking about moving in together in 6 months because both of our current leases will be up at the same time. We have talked about the future and marriage and I know she feels the same way about me as I do her.

About a month ago my girlfriend told me that the next day she was going to get a haircut. Since I have known her, her hair has been down to her bellybutton and is one single length. She loves her long hair. As I said above, hair length is not an issue for me so whatever she does with it is fine by me and she knows this. She said it was time for a change. She got it cut from her bellybutton to the bottom of her breasts, still all one length. 

The issue is that she hates it. She does not like the shorter length. I don't even understand why because in the entire time I have known her and in all the photos I have seen of her dating back 10 years to when she was 18 her hair is up in a bun or some kind of updo besides a ponytail 99 percent of the time. Even with the shorter length she can still do her hair the exact same way and it looks the exact same. She admits the styles are the exact same and not any different to do.

Ever since she got the cut she will not stop crying. She goes on and on and on about how much she hates her ""short hair"" even though he hair is longer than anyone I know. She wears it up so much that no one know she cut her hair unless she tells them. She says she regrets deciding to cut it. She doesn't dye it or anything so there was no damage or reason for her to cut it other than that she wanted to.

I have been with her for 3.5 years and known her/her family for even longer than this and she has never acted irrational like this before. There is nothing else going on that would upset her. She doesn't have any recent or past trauma. No deaths or illnesses in the family, her job is stable and she likes it, she has no debt, she hasn't had any fights or problems with people in her life. She isn't on any kind of birth control or other medication that would explain a change in moods. Other than the odd single glass of wine at some social occasions she doesn't drink. She doesn't use illegal or legal drugs and is not taking any medication, over the counter or prescribed. She has no mental health issues and no history in her family. She is still eating, isn't talking about death or anything like that and she still goes to work and out with her friends and family. Her hygiene is fine. She is still social and isn't hiding away. Other than the crying all the time she is acting normal. She's had her annual physical in the time since she cut it and everything came back normal and her bloodwork and all that was fine. She has been well-adjusted the entire time I have known her even before we were dating.

I have no idea why is so upset. No matter what I say or do she cries. She cries and is upset multiple times a day, every day. She keeps talking about how much she hates her ""short hair."" I don't want to sound like a jerk but I am tired of her crying all time. No matter what I say or do, she cries and complains. Sometimes she will get sad that I did not stop her from getting her hair cut. I don't think it is my place to stop her from changing something on her body and before this hair incident she never would say anything like this to me.

Her family and friends are miffed by the crying and complaining too. I am getting sick of it. I have known people who have cried over someone's death less than this. It has gotten to the point where I don't even want to be around her and all thoughts of living with her or proposing to her when we move in together are out the window. Now every time I see a call or text from her when we are not together I get a knot in my stomach because I know it will be about the hair. We can't even go out because she cries in public. I was embarassed when we out to dinner last time because she cried at one point during the meal and complained the whole time about her ""short hair"".

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm hoping someone here has some advice or words of wisdom for me. I never would have thought hair would cause this much of an issue in our relationship. I have tried talking to her about it and she just goes back to the complaining and crying and blame. Same with her family and friends. No one wants to be around her. Her family and friends are confused and sick of it. I am sick of the crying, hearing about her hair and being blamed for not stopping her like this whole thing is my fault.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I appreciate it.

62,"My [24F] parents [40’s MF] threw out the birthday gift my boyfriend [25M] got my sister [17F] without even telling her about it?


Hey! My boyfriend and I have known each other for nine years, been a couple for most of that, with a four year gap in the middle.

My parents have never expressed much of an opinion on him one way or the other, really. He’s just been “That Guy [OP] is with”. They don’t really go out of their way to make him welcome when he’s around, but they aren’t cold to him either.

I figured that’s just how my family is. We all get along and all, but we’re not really tight-knit. 

Anyway, my sister and I, likewise, weren’t especially close growing up. I have nothing against her, it’s just the age-gap made her feel more like a cousin or something than a sibling. Since I’ve moved out and she is getting close herself, I’m trying to be a better sister to her. We actually get along really well nowadays.

So, yesterday was my sisters birthday. My boyfriend has met her a few times here and there, and he’ll usually come to birthday parties and holidays when he can. He’s always sent some type of gift even when he can’t make it, and my parents never raised and issue about that.

Then, this year. There is a theme park close to where we live that my sister has always loved going to, since she was a kid. It’s no Disney, but it’s well-known locally and a lot of fun. For her birthday this year, my boyfriend got her three VIP tickets to this place when it opens back up in the spring.

It’s a pretty nice deal, and wasn’t cheap. She and two friends would get to spend all day in the park, with a lunch and dinner included, and gets priority access to the rides, etc. It was a really nice gift I think.

Boyfriend had to be at work during her actual party, so I just brought his gift in an envelope with me. I was helping my mom and dad get stuff ready and I told them what my boyfriend had got her. My dad wound up asking me to give it to him to take care of, so I did.

At the party she opened her gifts, including my own, but I realized she never opened the one from my boyfriend. I didn’t want to ruin the surprise so I quietly asked my dad about it, he said he wanted the party to be just about “family”.

That seemed kinda weird since it has never been an issue before, but he promised she’d get the gift, so I let it go.

Then this morning I ran by my parents place again for unrelated reasons. I asked my sister if she had gotten anything else. She listed off a couple things when got from friends, but no tickets. I assumed my parents had to gotten around to giving them to her for whatever reason, and I still didn’t want to ruin the surprise, so I didn’t say anything.

Shortly after I was throwing something away in the kitchen and I spotted a familiar looking envelope in the trash. I pulled it out, and the tickets my boyfriend bought were Still in there. I asked my dad why my boyfriend’s gift was in the garbage, and he said it’s because my sister “doesn’t need it”.

I was confused and pretty hurt but dad made it clear he wasn’t going to talk about it. I wasn’t sure if it would be appropriate to give it to her when he clearly didn’t want her to have it, so I didn’t tell my sis about it and just left.

I’m weirded out. My boyfriend and I are supposed to go over tonight for New Years, and I’m sure he’ll ask my sister about her gift. I haven’t told him about the situation yet, because I’m not sure what exactly to tell him, and I’d hate for his feelings to be hurt.

I did rescue the tickets from the trash and I’ll be hanging on to them, I don’t know if I should give them to my sister and pretend I forgot about my convo with dad, or if that would be a terrible idea.

63,"My wife of 2 years has become very morbid and it's starting to disturb me. I think it's because of her job. Am I worrying for nothing? [M and F, both 28]


My wife was in HR when we started dating but she hated it and eventually transitioned to her new career in the criminal justice system. She loves it and I'm proud of her. Obviously it can be stressful but she's never bored and loves helping people. 

That's one of the things I love about her. She loves helping people and she has a lot of empathy. Sometimes she cries about the cases she has because she hates the terrible things people go through. But I feel like she communicates very well when these things bother her and she also has a therapist.

Over the past year or so I've noticed she's become very morbid in her sense of humor and just in general. I've always loved that we have the same sense of humor and we can both be very darkly humorous but not cruel. But lately I just feel unsettled with some of the things she says or does. We'll be watching something and something bloody happens and she'll make a joke. Or she'll just outright laugh. She wants to watch more violent things. If something doesn't have violence, she's less interested.

Is this a coping mechanism? I've tried to talk to her about it to let her know I'm here for her and to see if anything's changed for her in her mind, but she says she's good.

As an example (and the thing that made me want to post)... Yesterday she was telling me about some hockey player who nearly died on the ice and how afterwards he suffered from PTSD and depression anxiety and became suicidal, but now years later he's better and uses the experience to help men with the same mental health issues. I agreed with her that it's awesome he was able to turn it around and help people. 

Then she said, ""Wait til you see the video!"" She wanted to show me the video of him nearly dying. I was uncomfortable, it was from the 80s or 90s so there wasn't really a closeup or replay, but it was still hard to watch this guy getting his throat slit. Then near the end, the camera pulls back and the audio for a car ad starts playing. My wife CRACKS UP laughing. Like just doubled over with laughter. I was like, ""What???"" and she said the upbeat car ad music was hilarious and inappropriate and she kept laughing for like 3 minutes. It was the first time I've ever been unsettled by something she did. 

I've read that people in law enforcement use dark humor with each other. Is this the same thing? Does anyone have experience with this? My real question is just, should I be worried about her state of mind?

TL;DR - Wife has become increasingly morbid. I'm worried her job in the justice system is stressing her out too much and this is how she's coping. Am I worrying for no reason?"

66,"I [22f] am sick of competing with boyfriends [22m] sister [24f] for his attention.


I’ve been with my boyfriend for just over a year.


We do not live together but we both go to the same college. I live through college accommodation but he lives with his sister in a two bed apartment about 15 minutes away. We met at a college open day. We’ve moved things pretty fast but it’s been a good ride. Except for one thing.

I see a lot of problems/issues surrounding a SO and their sibling and it’s gave me the courage to post about my situation.

I met Harry’s sister when we were only two months in.  He invited me around their apartment. I could tell she was putting on a proper show about how excited and how she’s so honoured to finally meet me. It was a bit cringe because she was acting just too over the top. 

But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character. However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in. 

It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ) I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look. He just smiled and looked at his sister and said “whatever you want boo” I remember feeling sick and just totally weirded out.

Harry and I did argue about this because I told him we had plans and he just told me that his sister wants to do something with us and that stop taking it so personally.


We got past that obviously but the sister is still a major problem. Me and Harry have only ended up going on one date alone every month because all the other times we have arranged something, guess who invites herself or who harry invites along?
 

They. share. a. bed. Harry claims it’s because they watch tv and they just fall asleep. He never would have told me they share it’s only that the sister brings it up. ‘Surprisingly’ “boo Im pretty sure I left my phone on your bed didn’t I? I know I went sleep with it but I couldn’t see it this morning.” So she wasn’t joking about Netflix and chill with her own brother. 

He buys her stuff all the time. He’s not too well off because we are students who work pay check to pay check. But if she wants money or something, he will give her his last penny.

I invited Harry to come to my family dinner. Sister kicked off because she wanted to come to. It was a couple type thing and all of us were bringing a SO or a friend (if one of us didn’t have a partner) even if it wasn’t, I would have just wanted it to be Harry. As I don’t want his sister clinging on to us every single time. Harry asked me if she could come too because “it so unfair that you are isolating her like this.” I stood my ground and said that please can he just come. He said no. So they both ended up coming as I didn’t want to go without Harry but he wouldn’t go without sister.

Mine and his sisters birthday fall within a week of each other. His sisters is 5 days before mine. He didn’t get me a present but that’s because he left himself short as he brought a really expensive purse and earrings she’s always wanted and what he saved up for. 

For Christmas, he brought her this smart tv for her room. He brought me a box of chocolates and vase Which I’m appreciative but the fact her presents cost a few hundred more than mine was a bit of a blow. Again, he left himself with no money and he asked me if he can burrow some money while he waits for his pay.

I’m tired of this. It’s a game with his sister, I know it is.
There’s no way someone is this clingy to their brother when they are adults. Surely? 

Edit : Also before this comes up. I do communicate my feelings with harry. But he told me that if I am seeing anything more than just a brother-sister relationship then I’m the weirdo who just has some messed up thoughts. He said “Just because you aren’t close with your family!’ When in fact I am, just not at this level I suppose

TLDR : should I just break up with my boyfriend who is too close for comfort with his sister?

67,"I[35F] caught my son [16M] smoking pot last night and I feel my bf[39M] reacted terribly.


**FINAL EDIT**

Just wanted to say a few words to everyone who commented and offered me advice today, and then I'm going to delete this post because it's getting huge and some folks are getting a little mean. 

In case you missed it, I caught my son smoking pot last night and when I told my bf of 10 years about it he reacted much more emotional and angry than I anticipated. We ended up in a huge fight over how to handle it. He was ready to go raid his room and mete punishment and I was the opposite, voting to talk and offer a chance to educate my son differently. We slept in separate rooms and I was really distraught and terrified about how things were going to go down today.

1. I talked to my kid. I doled out some chores and explained to him that, although I wasn't angry, I cannot condone my 16 year old struggling student to smoke pot in my basement. I told him I understand he wants to try it and I can't stop him, but we talked about school a bit and I made it known that I feel it would make things harder for him. We live in Canada and a year and 2 months from now he'll be 18 and it'll be legal, so I hope he will take my advice and focus on school and work (he's not working at the moment but that could change), and made good choices now and when he leaves home. 

2. My bf and I are okay. I still don't like how he reacted or what he wanted to do about the situation, but he let me deal with my son on my own. I think his own past experiences contributed greatly to what happened last night, and he will have to deal with that. At some point we will be talking more in depth about this, and future things that could happen, but tonight everyone is a bit exhausted and emotional so it's enough to just be ok at this moment. He's letting me deal, and I appreciate that, in spite of what happened last night.

3. I really can't thank all of you enough for sharing your personal experiences with me and bringing to light so many things I hadn't thought about. You've been really supportive and great, and I feel a lot better about sticking to my beliefs and feelings about this. I will try my best to continue to do what I feel is right for my son.


**TL;DR** I feel my bf of ten years reacted terribly to my son smoking pot and I don't know how to handle it.

**Edit** I handled it just fine and everyone is ok. We're probably going to have some big talks in the future but for today, we are doing much better and I have such thanks for all of you who were so informative and supporting."
68,"I [28 F] can't support my husband [40 M] while he's making awful decisions


My husband [40M] and I [28F] have been together for five years, married for almost two. 

To make a very long story short, four years ago my husband turned to self-employment after losing two good jobs - one he was laid off of to no fault of his own, and one he was fired from due to the inability to work well with others. To pay the bills, he began purchasing items at auction and re-selling them online, buying more expensive items and larger lots as his operation grew. This spiraled out of control, as he started making bigger and bigger investments that just weren't paying off. His storage space grew from a 10x10 unit to a 1000 sf+ warehouse, the majority of the product collecting dust for months because he apparently doesn't have time to list everything. Really, he overwhelmed himself with too much stuff to effectively sell, yet he kept buying more. There have been periods where he was making quite a bit of money, but the majority of the time has been just enough to keep afloat.

This spring, he confessed to me that his sales have consistently dropped off to the point where he's going to have to dip into our small, but decent savings just to pay the rent next month. This happened around the same time that our lease was up, so after much discussion we decided to move to my family's property out in the middle of nowhere so that we could save up money. Our goal is to move cross-country to a much cheaper state, so eliminating rent would expedite that. So I gave up my job that I adored, got a remote position within the same corporation, and we moved this summer. 

It's been incredibly hard considering the house is old and in serious need of renovation. We had to spend a good portion of our savings just making it livable, yet two of the most important things have not happened yet because my husband is just too busy. He has not installed a fence, despite having three small dogs and often seeing coyotes and loose dogs wander onto the property. He also has not installed out washer/dryer yet, but he seems content without this as he sends his laundry off for his mom to do. 

He's working 12-16 hour days, spending nearly every waking moment either on his computer/phone or out at his storage area on the property shipping/organizing/whatever else he does out there. He works at least half of the weekend selling at the swap meet, spending the other half doing nothing because he's so tired. I could accept this should he be making enough money to contribute back into savings, but he's not. He's averaging $5 per hour, which is just not acceptable - especially when minimum wage in our state is $10.50. He says he's looking for work, but that he never hears back after submitting applications. My opinion is that he's set his sights too high and is only applying for high-paying jobs that have much more experienced competition - he insists this isn't the case, but I find it hard to believe he can't find *anything* at a reasonable wage after years of looking.

Our bills are $1600/month less and he *still* has had to stop paying his student loan (he was ahead by 6 months, so no missed payments yet), he's only making the minimum payment on his $10k credit card debt, and hasn't even spent money on new stock in quite a while. There is no money going out, yet bills still aren't being paid. Just last night, he asked me to pay the electric bill because he doesn't have the money in any of his accounts combined. He comes to me with his worries of paying the bills, and his exasperation in not knowing how to fix any of this. None of my suggestions are apparently valid, so I tend to just shut my mouth and listen to him fret. He is absolutely floundering, and it makes my heart hurt to see him so desperate.

I want to support him. I want to be that wife that selflessly sets her life aside to support her husband getting back on his feet. But I just can't. I see all the mistakes he's making and continuing to make, and he won't listen to reason. We're living here because he spent $10k on a truck load that turned out to be absolute shit, and now he's talking about needing to spend $1k on another load that ""could turn things around."" When I tell him not to do it, I'm the bad guy because I apparently can't possibly understand. He makes chronically bad decisions, and I feel utterly helpless to change any of it because my opinion is usually only valid if it supports his. I feel like he's ruining our lives and all I can do it stand back and watch it all burn. I know he looks back on the good sale times, but I honestly believe those days are over. This is not sustainable, but he doesn't see that. He keeps sinking more and more money in, bailing out water instead of fixing the hole. 

I've been SO patient because I know he's working so hard... but I've reached a breaking point, and it's all I can do not to chew his ass out every chance I get. I've tried to be gentle in expressing my frustration without finger pointing, and he has apologized for putting us here, but it's **so** hard not to be resentful. I've already thrown away a job I loved, moved to the middle of nowhere (closest grocery store is 40 minutes away via windy mountain roads), I do ALL the housework, I cook or pay for us to eat out when I can't/don't want to cook, I take care of the dogs, etc. I am alone all the time; even if he's in the room, he hardly acknowledges a word I say or he makes it clear that I'm annoying him. There have been so many sacrifices made and it feels like it's all for nothing. 

How do I need to broach this situation? I have no idea how to support my husband, or if I even should. I don't know how I can do this, or what to do to make it any better. It's hard to tell which way is up anymore, and I feel lost in how to handle my life.
