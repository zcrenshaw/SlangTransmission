1,"[Update] I (28F) found condoms in my boyfriend's (32M) jacket, but we don't use condoms.


Hi Reddit

So here’s my sad little update [to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7olaa4/i_28f_found_condoms_in_my_boyfriends_32m_jacket/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit). I asked my boyfriend why he had taken condoms away with him. He looked panicked and said What condoms, which then trickle-truthed into having forgotten about them/ he put them there ages ago/ he put them there to put them back/ he didn’t know they were there/ he’d taken them for his own use: ie, none of it made sense and he was clearly making it up as he was going along. 

Anyway, I didn’t get a straight answer out of the conversation but thanks to those of you who told me to focus on his reaction because it basically proved to me that something was definitely up (like the condoms hadn’t already...)

So last night I looked at his phone and yup, you all said it, he had been messaging several women to hook up. He woke up and saw me looking at his phone and amazingly even tried to keep the story going even then (‘What messages? I didn’t send ANY messages. Ok just that one message. I SWEAR it was just one message… one day where I sent those messages… etc’). 

Looking back on the first thread so many people were saying it was for hook ups or escorts and I feel like I didn’t even see those comments properly til today, it’s crazy what you don’t see until you’re forced to. :( Thanks to everyone who commented on the first post, you helped me feel like I wasn’t imagining stuff. I told him it's over, I'm just waiting for it to sink in for him that I'm not changing my mind and then he will have to move out.

2,"[update] I [22F] just found out my late half-sister [40F] is still alive


[Original post here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nd7wk/i_22f_just_found_out_my_late_halfsister_40f_is) 

My sister, who I was told passed after a battle with cancer, added me on social media. After going through her profile it was clear that it was definitely her. You guys encouraged me to talk to her to find out what happened. It took me a bit to come up with the will to do so, but I finally did. 

I sent her a very short but polite message saying that I was glad that she seemed to be doing well but I was very confused because I had been told she died.

Apparently, our father told her that I was a huge source of negativity and that it was unhealthy for her to have me in her life while she was going through the cancer. She told me she didn't believe that, but that he offered to pay for her treatments and such in full if she just cut contact with me forever, and they came to the conclusion together that it would be better for me if I thought she was just dead. She told me that she was reaching out now because he had given her permission to as he felt I was in a better place now. 

I was pretty furious when I read that, especially since I had been helping her out financially and in pretty significant amounts. I know how stressful medical bills and how much of a relief it would be if someone offered to completely take care of mine, but at the same time I hate that our relationship had a price tag. We grew pretty close, at least I thought so, even commiserating about how awful that man had made our lives but he was able to just swoop in so easily and manipulate us again.

I didn't know what to say at first so I let myself cool down, talked about it with my partner, and then ultimately decided to let her know that I appreciated her telling me the truth and that I'm glad she's well but that I'd prefer if we didn't talk much going forward as I was really hurt by what she did and that I didn't want any avenue for our father to have any contact much less control over my life. 


Tl;dr shitty father offered to take care of her financially if she faked her death with me to cut contact. He changed his mind and gave her permission to talk to me again, but I decided I'm better off without her in my life anyway."
3,"[UPDATE] Me [40M] with my gf [31F] 3 years. On vacation and she seems to have snapped


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n113s/me_40m_with_my_gf_31f_3_years_on_vacation_and_she/)


My post didn't get much attention but just updating to show that if your partner is suddenly acting out of character, there's probably an underlying reason that needs to be worked on.

I asked her what was wrong and to my surprise she let it all out. This is what she said:  there were teenagers playing volleyball in bikinis. It threw her back to when she was in school and her friends would be in pretty bikinis and could jump around and run without their breasts wobbling whereas she would be a 'fat lump' whose boobs wobbled when she ran and the boys would make fun of her. And because she was large chested by the time she was 13 (she hit puberty at 9), she couldn't wear any cute bikinis and was stuck in 'ugly swimsuits'. She said it just took her back to that time when she felt like an outsider. I asked her what she meant by this because by all accounts she was always popular and she reminded me that she was the only non-white person in her boarding school, and that hitting puberty at 9 meant she was way ahead of everyone else in her year who hit puberty around 12-13. She said seeing that just took her back to the headspace of, ""I'm large chested, wobbly, fat."" She said she was a 32E back then. She's now a 30D so she is happy and she knows that she's not that person anymore but she still sometimes feel it.

She still hates her breasts and I've offered to pay for whatever surgery she wants (this is something she's been wanting ever since I met her and I offered even before this. I would prefer she stayed the same obviously as I love her just the way she is but I know this is something she desperately wants). 

She acknowledged that she has unhealthy body image issues and will on her own accord said she will start therapy because she doesn't want to pass on any of these issues to future children and also because she says she sometimes feels so burnt out and debilitated by constantly having to be militant about food and working out. She asked me if therapy works an she becomes less militant and she puts on a bit of weight would I still love her and I said of course.

Firstly, thank you for your overwhelming support in my last post. And thank you for sharing your stories. 
Everyone's advice was so so helpful. Thank you again.

I'm writing this update because a few of you asked for it. So, I told Erin everything. It took longer than I would have liked to admit, but I started second-guessing myself and asking myself if I really even knew what had happened. Like what if I had somehow imagined it all? (Hint: I didn't) I was just so truly scared that she would hate me. So, we met and I told her everything. She listened quietly and responded by telling me of course she believed me, and she would talk to Ryan about it. We hugged, she reiterated that she would always believe me, and we parted ways. It went over better than I expected.


She texted me later that night, pretty devastated and kind of hysterical. She had confronted him and he admitted to it immediately. She told me she was sorry that I felt violated in her home and that he was wrong for doing it, etc. She was really upset, naturally. She couldn't even go to work for a few days. 


Ryan said that everything I told her was true, aside from taking the picture. He said it was just the flash from his flashlight. He said he was curious, and that he didn't know why he did it. He told her it was like an adrenaline rush.


He also wrote me a long message telling me that he knows it was wrong, and he was so sorry, and he wanted to say something but didn't want Erin to break up with him. He said he hated himself for doing it, and he acted on temptation instead of ignoring it. He said he was sorry I felt unsafe in his home, and that he hurt both me and Erin. He said he was going to work hard to gain back my trust. I told him to focus on Erin right now. 


Erin told me he spent days crying to the point of throwing up. He also told her it wasn't sexual in nature, it was more of an adrenaline rush. I'm not really convinced by this, but Erin is. She also texted all the girls who have slept their house, asking if they had a similar experience. They all reacted with complete disbelief and said absolutely not. 


Anyway, Erin is devastated but I don't think they will be separating. She doesn't want him around me, or any of her female friends for that matter. 


If I forgot anything, I'll add it in. 

**tl;dr** I told Erin everything. She believed me right away and Ryan admitted to everything. He apologized to me via a long message. She is still extremely hurt and devasted, but they will not be breaking up. Things are fine between Erin and I, but I will most likely not be seeing Ryan again. "
6,"I'm getting divorced [34F]. My son's [11M] teacher [30's? F] is friends with my ex husbands sister. She went behind my back and talked to my son about his dad and said she would be a go between messenger for him. Son was upset and uncomfortable and I am furious. What do I do?


Just a heads up I may come across as over emotional and a bit ranty. I'm just very tired and stressed and angry. So I apologize in advance if this seems like a vent. I don't have a big support system.

So, my husband and I are getting a divorce because I've caught him cheating on me multiple times. We have two kids, ""Caleb"" who is 11 and in 5th grade and ""Belle"" who is 8 and in 2nd.

They're doing ok considering although Caleb is definitely taking it harder. I plan on getting them into counseling of some sort when I can.

I should mention now that Caleb's teacher, ""Mrs.A"" is BFF's with my ex husbands sister. This is relevant.

So yesterday I pick the kids up from school and I notice that Caleb is in a worse mood than usual. But I say nothing. He doesn't like being called out on his feelings. I always let my son approach me. It works better this way. 

After dinner he asked if he could talk to me. He said at lunch recess dismissal Mrs. A pulled him aside and said she wanted him to know that his dad loves him, misses him and if he ever wants to talk to him, he can talk to her and she will relay the message to him.

I hate to sound like the bitter ex wife but my ex already has back owed child support. Hasn't paid me a dime of it. And he constantly bounces on the kids and makes last minute cancellations when it's time for his visitation with them. There's always an excuse. He even ditches on scheduled phone and face time calls with them.

I WANT my ex to spend time with our children, I feel they deserve to have a dad even though he treated me like crap but is just AWOL all the time. But that's another story.

 I calmly thanked my son for telling me. He said he just wanted to tell me because he felt funny and uncomfortable with his teacher saying and doing what she did. I said I would handle it.

Reddit I am STEAMING ANGRY. I am PISSED. How DARE my son's teacher insert herself into our personal lives like this?!? I don't care if she is BFF's with my ex sister-in-law, I feel what she did was completely over stepping her boundaries and grossly unprofessional. Is this allowed? And to think I wouldn't have known about it if my son hadn't said anything! It makes me wonder if she has said anything to my younger more impressionable daughter (although I casually asked Belle today if Mrs. A had ever talked to her or asked her any questions and she said not really. Hopefully that's the truth).

I don't have much family and hardly any friends out here and I've just been stewing all day on this. I'm taking today and tomorrow to cool down and plan to do something on Monday. I don't know who else to turn to.

I want Mrs. A fired although I highly doubt this is a fireable offense. Was what she did legal or ok? I've just got a ton of stress on my plate so maybe I'm not the most rational person at the moment. Usually I cool down after a day or so but not this time. I'm still just as angry as I was last night, if not more so. I'm so mad I'm making a post about it on Reddit.

What are my options here? What should I do? If there are any teachers out there I could get an opinion from too, that would be extra helpful.

**TL;DR. Getting divorced. Son's teacher, who is friends with ex husbands sister, pulled my son aside yesterday to tell him how much his father loves him and misses him and said she will act as a go between if he wants to communicate with him. The only reason I found out is because this upset my son and he told me. So angry I can't think straight. This wasn't ok right? What are my options?**"

Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7on7ca/should_i_18f_tell_my_brothers_14m_therapist_about/?st=JC6MRL1J&amp;sh=b0bac8d7

I talked to my brothers therapist today. I went in with my aunt and we talked for about half an hour and she told me she legally has to report physical abuse to CPS. She knows I am still reliant on my mother for many things and thought it would be a good idea to bring my brother in and see if he would say it himself so that she has a primary explanation. 

We talked about the abuse we've suffered and eventually said ""there are some things I haven't told you because I know you have to report it..."" and then backed my story up to a T. It broke my heart, we haven't talked about it in years but he said the exact same thing I did, about the wooden spoons and then the ones with holes in them... and the belts. He said the same thing I did, and we never even talked about it. So he made the decision to say it and knew it would be reported. 

I talked to her about the possibility of him living with me, and I have an extra room available. His child support would be transferred over to me and I could take care of him but my parents haven't been reported yet and he can't even get out of this place until March, and I don't even know if my mom would allow him to live with me. I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row if it becomes a possibility. Whatever happens, I can't let him go back there. 

I'm bringing him some food now and we're going to visit again, just us, and spend some time together. I never intended to get CPS involved but I suppose I have no choice now, hopefully this will help me help him. 

TL;DR - talked to therapist, my parents are going to be reported to CPS, I don't quite know what the future holds. "

I'm 14 and my sister and her boyfriend are 20. They are visiting for a few weeks before the go back home. It's just little things I've noticed him do that has me kind of weirded out. 2 nights ago I was watching a movie and he came and sat on the floor next to my legs (I was sitting on the couch). 

He just started talking to me about his life growing up and it was cool. Then he out of nowhere mentions that he wished girls looked as gorgeous as me when he was my age and that I'm a prettier version of my sister.

Then he tried to lift himself up off of the floor and he used my leg for support. When he was about to sit down all the way he put his hand between my thigh and held it there for about 5 seconds before he took it off and laughed then said ""my bad."" He just stared at me and I asked him what he was looking at and he asked about the ring I was wearing and I told him that it's my purity ring. He said that he found me 10x more amazing that I respect myself enough to wait. We talked for like 15 minutes about boys, school and stuff like that. 

Then I decided to go to bed. But I was just thinking about it afterwards about how awkward and just wrong some of the conversations we had was.

This morning when I was leaving for school I hugged my sister and Mom and waved him goodbye. When I got on the bus he texted me ""I wanted a hug too :("" I replied ""I'll give you one next time lol.""

He actually just picked me up from school about an hour ago. He texted and asked me if I would like for him to pick me up and I agreed. We just talked some more in the car about school and my sister. Now I'm back home. 

I was just thinking and I don't know I just feel weird about this. Or I could just watch a lot of Lifetime movies and he's being normal and I'm just super paranoid.

TL;Dr: Sister's boyfriend makes me feel creeped out

UPDATE: I've talked to my mom about it. She's told me that I'm probably just not used to the way he interacts with others but if he shows any more signs of being creepy then I should tell her. She told me to not say anything to my sister yet. So, I guess we just have to wait and see 🙄

I really do appreciate each and every one of you who gave me really good advice and words of encouragement ❤️ Thank you :)"

17,"My (27F) bf’s (27M) new female friend (23F) did something awful to me.


I tried to find my previous post about this but I think I must have deleted it. My boyfriend and I have been having problems lately because of a new female friend that he made, Katherine. In my first post I mentioned how we have been together for 10 years and live together.


 His new friend from school quickly became his best friend from the program he is in. I was feeling really uncomfortable about their friendship because my bf told me how she was very touchy with him. She'd put her hand on his leg in the car, rest her head on his shoulder in class, link arms with him while walking, touch his face to show how cold her hands were. She also sent him hearts a lot in her texts. She also has a boyfriend who lives a few hours away that she sees on weekends. 


My boyfriend told me about all of it because he was unsure of how to feel about it. I told him that it sounded like she just enjoyed getting attention from him. I asked him to set a boundary with her. I understand some people are touchy. I don't think I should have to be uncomfortable with their relationship because ""that's how she is"". And a good friend should be able to respect a boundary. At this point they had only known each other for six months but the touchiness started very shortly after they met. He told me that that would make things awkward between them to bring it up to her, and that he didn't want to do that and kept accusing me of wanting him to stop being her friend. I never asked him to do that and told him many times that's not what I wanted. 


So obviously that caused a lot of strain in our relationship. I felt misunderstood and disrespected, and he felt that I was being jealous and controlling. Ithink what started happening was that Me focusing on their relationship so much was pushing him away, and he was getting closer to her at the same time. 


We were on the verge of breaking up, neither of us were really sure if that was the right decision because we both love each other very much, and the good qualities that he has are things that I know are rare to find in people. So we decided to keep trying to work on us. 


I had met Katherine once before and tried extremely hard to be open minded and give her a fair chance, regardless of feeling like she didn't respect our relationship. She seemed very outgoing and I got a vibe from her that she seemed fake in the way that she liked to people please, if that makes sense. Like she tried to act a certain way depending on who she was with.(we were in a group of like 8 people that night). I didn't tell my bf that and I told him that she seemed nice enough. Which was true, and I was trying to give her a chance. 


After that, the flirtiness and the touchiness continued. My bf and I went through another cycle of the same thing, almost breaking up, deciding to stay together. 


He invited me to come to his friend's apartment about 3 weeks ago. It was another friend from school that I had met and liked very much. She lives with her bf and we had been on double dates a few times and I really liked hanging out with them. So we were supposed to go to their apartment and Katherine would be there too. It was supposed to be a way for her and I to get to know each other more and hopefully become friends so that she could stop being a problem for me. She knew this because my bf had told her before that we have problems because of her. (And to that she told him that he shouldn't have to deal with that kind of jealousy). 


Anyway that night we were all drinking. I ended up telling Katherine how I didn't like that she was so touchy with my bf. Then she spent the whole night talking to me, really trying to convince me that My bf is ""like a brother"" to her. She just kept telling me that all night. That I had nothing to worry about and that he loves me. (Not that I needed to hear that from her). She seemed pretty convincing. I was actually having a pretty good time and thought that maybe I had misread her. I ended up going to sleep first. As soon as I fell asleep Katherine came on to my bf. She got up close to him and tried to kiss him multiple times. He asked what she was doing and kept physically pushing her away, she said ""you know what I'm doing"". 

She said she's liked him for a very long time. She told him how smart and handsome she thought he was and how she wanted to be there for him because his mom passed away when he was younger and he has problems with his dad. She kept insisting that she knew he liked her too. He said he had confusing feelings about her. He tried to rationalize with her even though he was really drunk. And she even admitted to giving Him the most alcohol, like she was trying to get him to cheat on me. He told her that she had a boyfriend and he's with me and that what she was doing was wrong. 

Then she physically got on her knees and kept saying ""let me suck your dick"" and kept trying to grab at his belt. All this time I was laying on the air mattress 2 feet away from them, passed out. The ONLY reason nothing physical happened is because my bf wouldn't let it. The friend whose house we were at was sleeping, but her bf happened to see and hear a lot of their conversation and when he saw Katherine on her knees he called My bf over to take him out of that situation. At that point Katherine was crying and saying she felt really rejected. She went and threw up and then cried herself to sleep. 


I only know about this because my bf wanted to be honest with me. The next morning, I had no idea that this had all happened. Katherine was acting completely normal and so was my bf. They were talking normally and joking around and I had no reason to think anything. Katherine ended up driving us home because we both felt sick and on the ride home she was touching his face and I remember thinking they were being a little flirty while I was right in the backseat, but basically shut down the feeling because I didn't want to get myself jealous when that night was supposed to have the opposite effect. We got home and I took like a 3 hour nap then got up to go to work. My bf was acting extremely weird and wouldn't tell me what was wrong until I got off work and he told me everything. He said he's always been attracted to her but swears that he never had feelings for her while they were friends. But that when an attractive girl that he liked as a friend threw herself at him, he said he felt his feelings change in that moment, but didn't let anything physical happen. I believe him. 


I need to vent to someone because I have so many emotions that I don't even know what to do with them. 
I'm hurt that he had (has?) feelings for someone else. Especially someone who did something so fucked up to me. I understand being attracted to other people. And I don't take it lightly that even though he was drunk he didn't let anything physical happen. 


I'm angry and humiliated that he didn't get us both out of the situation and shut it down the moment it occurred, but instead let me be friendly towArds her the next morning. He even still rode to class with her the next day because he wanted to ""talk to her"" about what happened. I went the whole day assuming he probably at least kissed her. He said nothing physical happened and 
I do believe him. But I'm angry that once again he didn't seem to care that I was being disrespected. 

I feel upset that Katherine is such an evil person and I have no one to talk to about it. After their talk on the car ride to school my bf told her they couldn't be friends anymore. She didn't understand why. She ended up just going back home to her bf for Christmas break and probably told him nothing of what happened. She even told the friend whose house we were at that the only thing that happened was that my bf told her that he liked her. Which, sure, isn't a lie but that's not exactly what happened. She's a liar. She's malicious and manipulative. I'm so shocked that there are actually people like that in the world. To be so insistent on spending the whole night trying to convince me that nothing was going on between them only to throw herself at him thhat same night just seems fucking evil.


I feel extremely confused about what to do next. My bf has been very honest with me. I know that he would never physically cheat on me. I do think though, that this whole situation spiraled because of their closeness and also that he confided in her about our relationship. I think that she probably enjoyed knowing our relationship was struggling and felt powerful knowing her was attracted to her and close to her emotionally. (Not because he told her but because she is just a very pretty girl. Apparently she's never been rejected before).
I can't help but think that if I had been more willing to get to know her before, and made my presence known to her, and was less jealous of a person, this might not have happened. And I also feel that if my boyfriend had set a clear boundary, she wouldn't have even considered coming onto him because he would have let it be known early on that there was absolutely no way that he would ever even consider doing anything with her. She shouldn't have ever thought it might have been a possibility. 


I want to move past this and I want to be with my bf still. But he still stands by his opinion that nothing about their friendship before this was inappropriate. That scares me. 
I've wrote a letter to her. I'm big on writing out my feelings. I debated on sending it to her, but she seems to have no remorse or even embarrassment for what she did so I really think it would be pointless to talk to someone who lies and says whatever she thinks people want to hear. It made me feel a little better just to write it out anyway. 

I wrote a letter to her boyfriend that I also decided not to send. I've met him once. I really think he deserves to know what a cunt he's dating but I'm not trying to give her any reason to somehow be involved in my life anymore. She'll fuck up her own relationship eventually. 

I guess I’m wondering how to process all of these emotions I’m dealing with, and move past this. I know it’s not fair to my bf to be angry with him when we’ve decided to stay together, but  I’m just having a hard time. 

TL;DR: I felt that my bf’s new female friend was being flirty with him, but he didn’t want to make things awkward by setting a boundary with her. She threw herself at him one night when we were all drinking and I want to be able to move past my anger about the situation. 
	
	


"
18,"gf [30F] of 2 years gave me [33m] a choice, her or the cats. I chose the cats, was I wrong?


FML I was with my GF for 2 years.  The first year she was a med-student and travelled all over, so we rarely stayed at each others places.  She did stay with me for 2 months last summer in between trips.

I have 2 cats, 1 rescue and 1 domestic litter.  They're 5 and 7 years old and came well before this relationship.  When she stayed with me there was NO problem at all, she petted them and loved them just as I had hoped.

She moved out in to her own apartment just down the road from me as she felt we were moving in together too fast, which was ok as it had only been 6 months of dating.

Fast forward to August this year.  Her lease is a month from expiring and she decided she wanted to buy a house.  As a new doctor with some good early career savings she was able to get it figured out and bam, bought a nice townhouse across town from me, but still close enough.

The plan when she was looking was that we would actually move in to her place after she was settled, and I'd rent out my condo for some extra cashflow.

3 months go by, and nothing.  She doesn't bring it up.  I ask her last week if she is ready to move forward and I get a bomb dropped on me.  ""Sorry, but the cats get hair everywhere and one of them pukes too often, I don't want them in my place"".

I told her I can't just get rid of them, they're my family.  She however was pretty adamant that they couldn't come.  If I was able to find homes for them I could move in right away.

I called BS and said I wasn't dumping my cats, and in turn we broke up.  I think I just need validation that it was the right decision.  I lost a relationship with a future doctor wife over some cats.

And yes, I also believe this might have just been a catalyst for a break-up that was a long time coming.

I'm so enraged I don't know what to do. My ex has never done anything to my boyfriend at all. My boyfriend just doesn't like him because he used to date me. The reason my ex and I broke up is because he has a lot of issues to deal with that I just can't help him with. We didn't end on bad terms.

I found out through my sister's boyfriend that my boyfriend just walked up to him and started beating the crap out of him and no one thought to help. I know my ex and I know that he isn't a fighter. He keeps to himself most of the time, he's never had to defend himself in his life and the thought of someone just beating on him for no reason pisses me off.

When my boyfriend came to my house earlier, I went off on him! Now he's angry at me for ""defending"" my ex and is claiming that I don't love him. I don't know if I should break up with him or try and fix things. 

I need some advice. This is too much.

TL;Dr boyfriend beat up my ex and is upset at me for ""defending"" him"
21,"[Update] My [20/M] girlfriend [24/F] of 10 months got upset at me last night for masturbating instead of having sex with her. She cried about it, and now I'm really confused on what to do.


**I wanted to clarify something because I've seen this mentioned a lot in the comments. I didn't agree to never masturbate without my girlfriend present. That was never the compromise. We agreed on letting her help me masturbate if she was in the house while I was doing it, but only if I felt like it. She doesn't get upset if I choose to masturbate alone, and for the most part I've been happily letting her get me off.**

I got slammed for being insensitive and lacking empathy in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mi7gj/my_20m_girlfriend_24f_of_10_months_got_upset_at/), because I called my girlfriend a toddler and said she was emotionally immature. I completely agree with what was said about me. I sounded like an asshole to my girlfriend, but I'd never call her any of the things I said in my post to her. I was frustrated while writing it, and I thought that since my girlfriend is older than me that she should’ve been able to handle my rejection better. 

I was able to talk to her shortly after submitting the original post. My girlfriend went into detail about why she felt so upset when I rejected her. She told me that sex held a lot of meaning to her, and when I chose to masturbate over having sex she felt like I didn't love her, or find her attractive anymore. I've never viewed sex as an extension of love, so her explanation helped me understand why she felt so hurt. I apologized for making her feel upset. I told her that I didn't know sex was that important for her and I reassured my girlfriend that I loved her and still found her to be attractive &amp; sexy.

We came to a compromise. She said that if I didn't want to have sex with her but wanted to masturbate instead, she would help me get off. I thought that was a great idea (and I think one of the replies I received recommended that). I guess my girlfriend and I had different views on sex, but sitting down and having an honest conversation about it has allowed us to be on the same page. 

**tl;dr:** Talked to my girlfriend. She explained why my rejection made her feel so upset. I apologized for not understanding her feelings and told her that I didn't know how much importance she placed on sex. We made a compromise, she offered to help me masturbate as a way to share my pleasure with her. Things have been great ever since.

I just want to make quick update and thank anyone who took few minutes to read my op.



Turns out, my wife is pregnant again. We definitely didn't plan another baby, but mini yay. I'm on board with everything, but as we all know I won't be pregnant, or give birth etc...



Our first kid was also unplanned and my wife had to sacrifices a lot so I understand why she was and still is, lets say, not thrilled with news. It turned out it wasn't completely about Mia or me or Mia's husband. I guess it was mix of everything + hormones. She is mostly worried now how pregnancy will ruin her body, but I will give my best to reassure her and love her.

Edit: first baby was our no condoms, but lets do it. This time she has nexplanon in her arm which is only 1.5 year old (they say it should be replaced every 3 years) so I don't know what went wrong.

Tl;dr: wife pregnant."

27,"My [28F] friend [37M] has a secret Instagram account that his wife [36F] of 12 years doesn't know about


My friend has an Instagram account that his wife doesn't know about. He has had it for at least 3 years. 

Looking at his posts, you'd have no idea that he was even married with kids (10F and 1M). He looks totally single (doesn't even wear his ring in any pics) and acts single too. 

I was confused and curious, so I looked at his follows/followers to see if this was just an account we weren't friends on (we are friends on his real account), but his wife isn't there and neither are family and friends. It's all just women who wear a lot of makeup and take a ton of selfies. Some local, some not.

There must be something with the way Instagram's algorithm works, because now I see a few of the women he follows on my Explore section. He frequently comments things like ""looking sexy"" or emojis like heart eyes, tongue/licking, etc. Basically looking thirsty. 

I also noticed a few comments that suggests maybe he has been seeing or at least talking to some of these women, either in DMs or in real life. 

I feel compelled to tell his wife because I'm a woman too and I'm sure she'd want to know. I am not overreacting, right? This is a legit concern?

Frankly it creeps me out a bit and makes me see him differently. His latest post is also his wife's latest post of him and the kids at an amusement park... only he cropped the kids out. That's just wrong to me and tells me he's deliberately trying to look single. Why would he do this? Is this just some sort of online fantasy thing? Or is this a form of cheating on his wife?

30,"My [18F] boyfriends [19M] parents [40s] threatening divorce because of my family trip with boyfriend


*We have been together for 2 years now*
To make a verrrrryyy long and irritating story somewhat short, my boyfriends immediate family (3 sisters, grandparents, and parents) started hating me about a year into our relationship. They always have a different excuse as to why. His youngest sister [22F] has a burning hatred for me and never fails to voice it to my boyfriend. His mother would text me often saying my boyfriends life is declining because of me until I changed my phone number. 

On the other hand, my family LOVES my boyfriend. He comes to my house after work and basically lives there. He just goes to his house to sleep. My mom invited him to come travel with us in Feb, boyfriend said yes, Mom bought our tickets. Last night, his mother texted him “your father is threatening me with divorce if you go on that trip”

Some backstory, his parents were divorced but remarried. His parents always lived together for the sake of their kids. My boyfriend is, in his fathers words, “his mothers responsibility” so whenever my boyfriend needs permission or needs anything, he goes to his mom. 

My boyfriend did move out with us last year for about a month. His youngest sister actually kicked him out because she didn’t want him to live with her if he was still with me.  After a month, his parents begged him to come back promising that they’d pay for his school, let him be independent, and they wouldn’t complain about me or disrespect my family. He felt bad and moved back in with them and then told me that he prefers living at my house because his home is always filled with bad vibes and fights. Slowly after he moved in, his parents took back everything they said and went back to how they were before (restricting him, harassing him, and picking random fights with JUST him and never his sisters)

TLDR: boyfriends father is threatening mother with divorce if boyfriend goes on a three day trip with my family, what should we do? What can I️ do to help? "

Link to the previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7j23cd/so_it_turns_out_its_not_that_my_father_36_m_didnt/

I found out why she told me the lie that my biological father didn't want me. It's maddeningly simple and stupid. She was basically getting to know my dad (her now ex-husband) and he wanted to know about my father's involvement in our lives. Put on the spot, she made out this ridiculous story about how he didn't really care for having a child, they didn't keep in touch and over the years it evolved into a fucking theater play (which is what I got years down the line when I asked about my father). My dad, I guess, didn't want to put salt on wound, so he just avoided that subject in the future, until I asked about it. 

That's it. That's the whole reason why I didn't know my father for my whole life up until recently. No, really. Because she didn't want to look like some spiteful, crazy woman who neglected to tell someone they're a father, she made this up. Which is some bitter irony for her, because she does look like a crazy and spiteful woman with the lies she told about my father. 

I am so mad at her. I can still barely control my anger around her. All I want to do is hurt her until she feels really hurt like I was when I found I missed out on knowing my father all along and him getting to know me as well. I restrain myself more often than not, but God damn, this isn't something that's going to be just pushed to the side. I don't know what we'll do, and I know that sometime in the future I'll probably reestablish having a good relationship with my mother, but right now, it's just not happening. 

But on the brighter side of things, I met my father! Some people mentioned in the last thread that I should be careful how, when and where I met him (someone thought I would be flying out of our country to meet him, I think?), but given how everyone that knew him back then and now had nothing but good to say about him (I connected with my father's side of the family, have plenty of cousins, aunts, uncles and so on to talk with and meet, and it's a bit overwhelming just how many of them are there and how overjoyed they were to find about me), I gave him a few dates when we could meet and he picked this last weekend. He flew back on the Friday, visited his parents (my grandparents, and man, that's so weird, how I have another set of grandparents to the whole mix) and then we met up. 

I really don't know what I was expecting. I mean, yes, we talked and he seemed very understanding and kind and good and so very interested in meeting me, but I guess there was just that fucked up fear of him not liking what he actually saw and leaving (no, really, thanks for this shit, mom). It didn't matter in the least. As soon as we met, there was just this moment, I don't know how to describe it, I don't really think I ever had anything like that before and he just hugged me and I could feel him shaking (I think he was holding himself back from crying) and I started crying for no real reason and then we talked and just spent the rest of the day together. 

We pretty much spent the whole weekend together, from the moment I got up we talked and by the time he was boarding his flight I didn't want him to leave ever again (and he won't, not really). He wanted to know everything about me, and I literally mean everything. And I guess what really made me actually love him is him asking to meet my dad, asking me if that was okay with me, and then thanking him for his part in raising me. They talked some more with each other while I was busy with something else, and I think they became sort of friends (I don't really know what to call their relationship).

So to all of you who helped me deal with my fucked up situation, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Even if it seemed like I was just venting outloud on the internet, thank you. Thank you all! Except those one or two people who thought my father is a rapist and an abuser, seriously wtf?! 

  ---   
  **tl;dr: Mom told me the reason behind her lies: so she wouldn't look bad when she was dating my dad and when they got serious. Still mad like hell, but eventually I think I'll get past it. Met my father in person, had a great time, got to know about a ton of family, and best of all, both him and my dad seem to get along! Thank you everyone for your support and help!**"

35,"My [25F] boyfriend [26M] cheated on me while on we're on vacation with friends. I don't know what to do.


I need to lay out the relationships. 

* Me (Emily) and my ex boyfriend (Paul)

* Kara &amp; Tyler are boyfriend and girlfriend. 

* Ethan and Olivia are boyfriend and girlfriend 

* Jaymee and Hank are boyfriend and girlfriend. 

* Kenny, Samantha and other Emily are all single. 

My friends and I all decided to go up to a cabin Kenny owns. He works at the ski lodge not too far here teaching people how to Ski among other things. There's 11 of us staying in this cabin he owns. 2 of us share a room and he has the sofa. He invited us all up here to have a nice time before we all go back to work. 

A couple of days ago most of us went to have lunch at a restaurant. Kara stayed back claiming she was coming down with a cold. My boyfriend claimed he was still tired from the day before and didn't sleep well. He wanted to see if he could catch a few extra hours. When we all returned from lunch there was some sort of fight going on between Ethan and Paul. It was a screaming match of some kind. Kenny and Tyler got between them trying to get them to calm down. It came out that Ethan walked in on Kara and my boyfriend having sex. It turned out to be true because Kara broke down trying to explain it to Tyler. Tyler, Ethan and Paul all started to fight again. Kenny was trying to get them to not get physical with each other. God knows where Hank was because he's the biggest guy in our group and no one would really mess with him. He would have come in handy to stop the guys punching each other. Kenny really didn't hit anyone. He was more trying to get them to stop it. Hank almost got into a fight with Paul when he arrived because he did give Kenny a split lip. Kenny and Hank are best friends. You get the point. The guys were going at each other. 

When the dust settled Paul was trying to explain to me what happened. Kara was trying to explain to Tyler. They've apparently been fucking each other for over 3 months. It all started the night I went home sick from a party. They apparently had feelings for each other and was scared it would emplode the friend group. They were damn fucking right it did. 

Ethan &amp; Olivia. Paul and Kara, Tyler and other Emily all left the cabin. There's 5 of us here and no one really knows what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm heart broken. My boyfriend was cheating on me with my friend. Most of my friends imploded over the whole situation. The vacation is pretty much ruined. My relationship is over. My boyfriend was screwing a close friend of mine. I don't know what to do when I get home. Paul told me he's be gone, but I dunno.

My wife and I are together for 11 years. Got married 5 years ago and we have 2 kids (5 and 2). We are both in STEM and we have a good life and we kind of did everything by the book and she was always proud of that.


Her friend Mia (there are 4 of them in the group) was always little different, content on her own and she never took life too seriously. She didn't care what we think, what random acquaintances do... She quit Uni, worked low paying jobs, then got back to Uni... while people around her were getting married and having kids. My wife always thought it must be hard for her, but I personally never got that impression. She could always have any guy she wanted, she always had enough money for day to day life and travel and she always seemed content and easy-going. We tried to hook her up with some of our collegues but she didn't like them. She said she is good on her own and if she is going to get married it will be with someone amazing. (I think her parents had bad marriage so she wasn't much into that) 



2 years ago she met great and very handsome guy and they seem happy. My wife didn't really care at first and she was happy and supportive. They got married and they are going strong, living in another country so we don't see them often. A week ago we went on a group holiday (4 couples) and my wife had snarky comment on anything Mia did. Mia is still the same person, she is 'just' much richer now. 



She thinks that Mia didn't deserve to meet such a great guy because she had many guys before. That people have to compromise and that she didn't compromise nothing. That she got anything she ever wanted. She even asked me if he cheated when we were on a guys night out...



I'm just confused and don't know how to react. I feel like my wife is unhappy and everything I do isn't good enough. Now she isn't happy with her body. With our life. Food we eat. She is annoyed with bunch of little things. I think she now regrets playing by the book and wishes she did more interesting things in her youth. Reddit, what is going on? Is this normal?



Tl;dr: after a holidays with our friend my wife became unhappy with our life.

42,"One of my (40F) best friends of over 20 years (42M) just visited me and my family. My husband (41) got insanely jealous.


Hi all. So like the title says, I’ve had a very dear male friend for over 1/2 my life. We live on opposite sides of the country and only get to see each other every few years. We have NEVER been involved romantically, he is truly the brother I never had. We’ve been through marriages (both of us), divorce (him), births of our children, custody issues and so forth. Just someone I know I can always talk to and get brutally honest opinions.  

My husband has also known him for a very long time (we’ve been together for 17 years and I introduced them about a year after we started dating). The two of them even occasionally text and stay in touch without me involved. We’ve visited him together a couple of times and he has stayed with us a bunch of times over the years. At first all was fine, no issues whatsoever. The last two times he has visited us have been very different. 

The last time he was here my husband became very clingy...constantly grabbing at me and wanting all of my attention. He even made a lewd comment about us (my friend and I) having sex. I was highly offended. It has never and will never happen. We talked after he left and I thought all was well. He told me that he got insecure because we were having so much fun together. Duh...why do you think we’ve been friends for so long? Plus, I thought all 3 of us we were having fun TOGETHER. 

Which brings me to this latest visit. My friend came and stayed with us for 4 days over the holidays. We had plans for 3 out of the 4 nights to party like rock stars. It was the three of us, plus 8-10 other friends we met up with. Set up babysitters and off we went. Had been looking forward to it for months. By night two I was mortified by my husband’s behavior. 

To say he acted like a child would be an understatement. He was mad about every move I made. Here’s a few examples. 

1. One night we grabbed food before our destination at a food court type of place. My friend and I are both vegetarian so obviously we got vegetarian food. There were at least 20 other places there my husband could have grabbed something. No, he was mad it was crowded, mad we chose the vegetarian place, refused to eat anywhere else. Did not eat the entire evening and was mad the whole night. 

2. Was mad we didn’t have sex while he was here. Two reasons for that...we were up until about 3AM every night knowing our kids would be up at 8. Whatever, I can deal with a little sleep deprivation. The main reason though, was because our teenage daughter graciously gave up her room for my friend and was bunking in our room on an air mattress. I’m sorry, but I really didn’t want to have sex with our kid in the room, sleeping or not. He chose to jerk off next to me in protest. We usually have sex like every other day...the man is not deprived . I didn’t think 4 days would kill him.

3. One night we went out to dinner. There were 8 of us, most of whom were my husband’s friends. He said I didn’t pay him enough attention. Seriously? We were all talking and having a great time (or so I thought). I certainly didn’t ignore him. I had no idea I had to babysit him. We were with 3 people (including my friend) that we’re from out of town. I was super excited to be spending time with these people I hardly ever get to see. 

So the whole time I was pretty uncomfortable and so was my friend. It was embarrassing to say the least. He even asked me at one point “is he always like this?”

Anyway, sorry this got so long. The trip ended with my husband driving him to the airport and making future plans with him! Said we’re going to fly out West in the next few months and meet up. I don’t know if I want to do that. Of course, I’d love to see my dude, but I do not want a repeat of what went down. I told my husband this. His only excuse for his behavior was...I love you so much and I can’t stand to see other guys make you so happy. Gross. This isn’t an “other” guy kind of situation. He’s like my family. 

Don’t really know where to go from here. 

TL;DR Very old, dear friend visited and my husband turned into a possessive, whiny child. "
43,"My [27F] MIL [60F] walked in on my husband [32M] and I during a private moment, posted about it on Facebook.


I'm not sure where to begin so I'll start with relevant background about my MIL. She's a nice person and we get along well but she's *very* open about pretty much everything, while I'm more reserved and shy, especially when it comes to personal matters. She finds it funny to talk about things I would consider inappropriate in mixed company and often ""reminds"" people she has ""no filter."" It's never her intention to hurt or embarrass anyone but if someone objects to her language or the subject of conversation she will act like they're being too sensitive and continue on.

She retired early due to back problems (she was a nurse) and now spends most of her time at home. She relies on Facebook for most of her socialization and maintaining a connection to her friends. In my opinion she frequently overshares but until now it never affected me so I haven't said anything. 

This brings me to the current problem. Last night she and FIL let themselves into our house while I was going down on my husband. She screamed, then laughed, and turned to FIL (who had asked what was wrong) and said ""[husband's name] is getting a blowjob!"" followed by more laughter and then ""sorry, we'll go."" I heard FIL say something like ""Jesus Christ, [MIL's name]."" I was frozen and completely mortified. My husband got up and followed them outside. 

He was amused when he returned and seemed unaffected. They had gone to the movie theater near our house and wanted to stop by afterward. FIL had sent a text but he didn't hear the notification. I was still embarrassed but it was a mistake (and they left right away). I decided it was best for everyone to try to get over it.

So, I logged on to Facebook this morning and the second post I saw was from MIL referencing the incident from Saturday night. It read: 

&gt;""learned the hard way to always KNOCK first... but at least [FIL] and I know our son is VERY well taken care of..  (laughing-crying emoji)"" 

I showed my husband immediately and he started laughing. I realize he's used to her attitude and openness about this stuff but it's highly embarrassing to me. He said she was trying to be funny but agreed it was inappropriate and sent her a text asking she take it down. It was deleted a few hours later but I'm sure most of their family saw it. There weren't any comments but the last time I checked 20-something people had 'reacted' to the post.

I'm not sure what to do. I haven't said anything to MIL. My husband says it's settled (because she took it down) and wants me to let it be. I'm inclined to follow his wishes but I also want to be assured this will never happen again. My parents and a handful of my relatives are friends with her on Facebook. There's also the fact that this is just really embarrassing for me. 

Should I ask my husband to talk to her in more detail? 

Do you think I should reach out to her? If so, how should I approach the conversation to ensure she takes me seriously without being rude or disrespectful?

**Thank you for taking the time to reply and for all of your helpful suggestions.**

**For those who have asked, we were in the formal living room, which is the first room you see from the front door/entry. The door was not locked (but she does have a key). We won't be repeating that mistake again.**

TL;DR at bottom. 

Backstory for context: A couple years ago, my mother in law surprised us all by getting a quick divorce (31 year marriage to a pastor) and moving 15 hours away to, as she put it, “where God was calling her pursue her dream job with a fresh start.” 

Four months later, she informed us she was dating someone she had known from her original hometown, who also just happened to live in her “Fresh Start Town.” Through the internet, we quickly discovered has a past conviction for molesting one of his own children. My husband and I did our homework and managed to secure a couple notarized copies of the records, including his guilty plea and confession. 

We confronted MIL, she gave some sob story about how it was all a big misunderstanding. We presented her with the court document, and she went off on us, yelling about “invasions of privacy,” etc. We continued speaking to her so we could express our concerns about what this relationship could mean for her future. 

Three months after that, she eloped with him. Six months after that, I had our daughter — my MIL has never met her, and we don’t plan to allowing her to, not in her current state of mind/action. She refuses to acknowledge that she was deceitful, and doesn’t agree that allowing him to be around our daughter is risky. The last time we tried talking to her about this (8 months), she told us to “get over it” and “love her anyway.” She seems to be of the opinion that she made the right decision, that we should go along with it, and be one big happy family. We haven’t spoken to her since, although family members (her mother) have tried to intervene and appeal to us by trying to make us feel guilty. 

MIL has made no attempts at this point to surprise us with visits or do anything legal (like suing for visitation). 

The issue: Assuming nothing drastic changes over the next several years, how do we prepare for eventually addressing this with our daughter and future children? I realize it’s too complex for a small child to grasp, and I imagine we’ll need to reveal more as she gets older. Where do we start? How do we progress? 

TL;DR: Mother in law unapologetically deceived us and married a convicted child sex offender; wants everyone to be a happy family (not happening). We have a baby girl, with plans to have more. We cut MIL out from our lives. How can we prepare for eventual conversations with our daughter about this?

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nx8xl/i_39f_was_the_other_woman_nearly_four_years_ago/


First of all I’d like to thank everyone for your comments. I read each and every one of them and there  it seemed like the community was pretty divided on my issue, so my wife and I had lots to think about.


A few things:
1) I’m bi and married to a woman. I realized it was ambiguous in the original post though I mentioned it in the comments later. I didn’t think the gender of my current spouse would matter, but a few people were really concerned about my “husband”. I guess generally men would be more opposed to raising a child that isn’t biologically theirs... but in relationship like ours, we know and accept that even in the best possible situation, only one of us will be biologically related to our child. If my wife carries our next baby through sperm donor it won’t be related to me either.


2) I have to admit I did get somewhat worried about the possibility of Mark retaliating legally by suing us for custody if I told his wife about the affair. But the chances of this happening are very slim as we live in a state where parental rights can’t be reinstated once terminated and his time to appeal has long passed. Plus we truly did everything by the book — he was given ample time to appear in court after being served, he acknowledged receipt of the papers in a text message, etc. I know nothing is truly certain but I really don’t wanna live in fear over the very slim possibility of him successfully suing for his parental rights, considering our case is quite standard as far as custody/adoption cases go.


Having said that my wife was still not comfortable with me directly contacting Mark’s wife. She didn’t want me to bear the brunt of Mark’s anger and risk him retaliating on our family in some way. That’s why we agreed to compromise by emailing her anonymously. My wife wrote most of the message from the point of view of a concerned third party. She told her my first name and included general details about our affair that a friend might know, but nothing to implicate me directly. She encouraged Mark’s wife to ask him about my daughter but emphasized that she was being cared for by two parents. My wife’s email was far less emotional and convoluted than the message I would’ve written, which is probably better... we gave enough information so that she can ask Mark about it and/or pursue her own investigation if he refuses to confess. It’s been a few days and so far she hasn’t responded. I am not holding my breath for a response but at least now she knows and it’s not gonna be surprise years down the line when/if my daughter seeks out her biological father.


**tldr:** my wife wrote an anonymous message to Mark’s wife as a concerned third party. We told her about the affair and the child that resulted from it.

**Edit:** just to be clear, we gave Mark’s wife enough details about ourselves (mine and my daughter’s first names, how I met Mark through my job at the time, our city of residence, etc) and told her that we can provide more information if she wants. It wasn’t just “FYI your husband fathered a child with a mystery woman, okay, bye!” The email was sent anonymously but I am fully prepared to face her; we just decided that me directly telling her was not the best move. The way I saw it, the truth was gonna come out eventually as I have no intention of denying my daughter her right to seek out her biological dad. I read another post on here where the woman was blindsided after finding out her partner had fathered a child a decade ago. So it was either tell her now or tell her at some unspecified date years in the future. That was how I weighed my choices. ‘Do nothing and just never tell her’ was not an option considering we live in the same city and it is extremely likely my daughter may wish to seek Mark out, if only to get some answers.

**Edit 2:** I broke off the affair when I found out they were not separated. At the time I was pretty messed up emotionally and was able to rationalize not telling her but I definitely agree that I should have informed her sooner.

Also, yes they are still together and I’m almost sure she doesn’t know because during the adoption process Mark insisted on communicating with us solely through his work phone, he even received the legal documents at work. That was early 2017 so he could’ve told her since, but I doubt it."
47,"Me [30 /F] with my neighbor [50 /F], agreed to one too many favors and am learning my lesson


Our extremely needy, but very friendly, neighbors have physical limitations due to obesity and ask a lot of favors. Hard, physical favors, medical help, childcare, building them things from scratch, you name it, we've done. The favors are often inconvenient and/or time consuming. They have a 13 year old son who comes over often and knocks on the door. We don't mind because we like kids. I have 2 year old and am pregnant.




Recently, the neighbors asked us to watch the 13 yo while they went on a 2 week trip. I am a stay at home mom so I said yes. While I definitely did not really look forward to it, I figured he would be in school during most of the day and has other activities to keep him busy. Also, I've known him since he was a little kid so I'm comfortable around him.





Well, lo and behold, since he has been here, he has only been to school 1 day. The rest of his time has been spent playing sick on my couch, on his phone playing games and watching tv, asking me for food and snacks constantly. To be fair, there have been 2 snow days and a holiday also. On the other days he claims to be sick, like clock work.








Today, I am at my wits end. He woke me up at fucking 6 am to whine that he has a fever. I told him to get the thermometer and show me. My husband is in the medical field and we have an accurate thermometer. 13 yo then claims that the fever won't show up on our thermometer, only on the onefrom his house. Ok. I ask him to go get that one then. 









He goes to his house and after a long wait comes to me with his (very low quality) thermometer already showing a temp of 102. I take his temp again right there in front of me. 98.6 degrees. I tell him he's fine and needs to go to school. He said ok and then came back like 10 minutes later saying he talked to his mom and she said he doesn't have to go to school as long as he stays in bed all day.







I am so sick of this shit. I feel completely used and disrespected. It's one thing to watch someone's kid but I didn't anticipate spending all day with a lazy teenager on my couch. I just want my house back. I really just needed to vent. This is my own fault and next time they ask for a favor, you can bet your ass my answer will be no, no, no and NO again.
  ---   
tl;dr Have agreed to do too many favors for needy neighbors and now watching their kid for 2 weeks. He's manipulative, lazy and I have learned my lesson about helping them.


Edit: I just wanted to add that the kid doesn't shower or brush his teeth as much as he should and has only showered once since he's been here. I had to basically force him. Also, he never flushes the toilet, so I have become familiar with the look of his turds. Just had to get that off my chest."
48,"(UPDATE) Boyfriend (29m) has the ring, but it's been a while and I (26f) am starting to feel like it's never going to happen.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7efmrl

My original post only had a handful of comments, but I thought I should update for those who gave me advice. It also might be helpful for anyone searching the sub for this kind of post in the future. 

So I did end up talking to my boyfriend that night after posting here. It was hard to bring up because, as I mentioned in the OP, I didn't want to seem pushy and he has also said before that he didn't want me to talk about it and ""ruin the surprise"". I asked whether he still wanted to get married, and whether there was some goal or milestone he was waiting for. At first he still didn't want to talk about it. He got briefly annoyed and said I was being impatient and it'll happen. 

I explained how it's been upsetting me lately, that I didn't think I was being impatient and actually I thought it'd been *too long* instead. He said he didn't want to tell me his plans and ruin it. I said he did not need to tell me exactly when and where, but I need to know that this is still something he wants, and I need a timeline because I can't deal with ""someday"" anymore.

Finally he admitted he's been waiting for a promotion at work, because he didn't want me to have a ""loser husband"". (His words, I've never thought he was a loser). It turned out at this point he unofficially had the promotion and was just waiting for the paperwork to come through and finalise it. He said he had plans to do it soon. I asked what he meant by soon, because his idea of soon could be different to mine.. In the end he said it'll definitely happen by the end of summer (was spring here at the time and is summer now), so if all goes to plan we'll be engaged within a couple of months!  

If you read and commented on my OP,  thank you. You gave me the confidence to have the conversation and I feel heaps better. Now I can be excited and look forward to it again, instead of feeling negative and upset about it. 

**Tl;dr:** Talked to my boyfriend. He was hesitant to give up any plans at first, but when I explained how I've been feeling and pushed a little he admitted he was waiting for a promotion at work. He recently got the promotion and promises he'll ask by the end of summer (in southern hemisphere, it is summer here now).

Edit: added info to tl;dr."
49,"I (34f) don't know how to tell my husband (34m) that I want a divorce. (20 years)


I'm sorry in advance, because this will be long. 

I want a divorce. My husband (34) &amp; I (34) have been together 20 years, married for 15. We have 2 children, 4 &amp; 1. We (obviously) started dating when we were young, &amp; aside from a couple of silly teenage breakups, things were good for a long time. We were truly best friends. We loved spending time together, he made me laugh, I always tried to go out of my way to do thoughtful things for him, &amp; to make his life easier.  We traveled together preferred to spend a lot of our free time together, but still both took time to spend alone with our respective friends a few times a month. 

When my son was born, everything changed. He was a very wanted child. We'd tried for 10 years to get pregnant, and husband was wonderful throughout my pregnancy. He came to every appointment, we took parenting and childcare classes, he talked to the baby, read to my belly, the works. 

About a week after we came home from the hospital, it was like a switch flipped. He was screaming at me &amp; our anytime the baby woke up at night. Telling him to ""shut the fuck up!"" and telling me I was a bad mom because the baby didn't sleep through the night. My son and I started sleeping on the couch, in the hopes that he wouldn't hear us wake up at night. Then he started going out nearly every night after work. He'd be gone until 5-6am, 6 nights a week, come home, go to bed, &amp; sleep until he had to leave for work. He was short tempered with me, &amp; didn't want to help with anything baby or house related. 

I thought that maybe he was just having a hard time adjusting to parenthood. I asked if he was depressed, if he was having an affair, if he wanted to look into individual or couples counseling, &amp; got a firm ""no"" to all 3. When my son was 18 months old, I told him that he had to be more present, that he wasn't being much of a husband or father, &amp; that it wasn't fair to me or our son. He cried, said he'd do better. Instead, the morning of Valentine's Day, after I gave him his gift, he said, ""I don't care where you go, but I want you both gone by the time I get home from work."" 

I was devastated, but I packed my son &amp; i's things &amp; left. We stayed in contact, obviously, &amp; I offered him daily visits with our son. Most of them he turned down, many he just didn't show up. He told all of our friends and his family that I had cleaned out our bank account, taken the baby, &amp; left, all without his knowledge. 

After a few months, he started begging us to come back. He said he'd kill himself if we didn't. I'm embarrassed to admit that the manipulation worked. I still loved him very much, &amp; I wanted to give our marriage every chance. A few months after I moved back home, my birth control failed &amp; I got pregnant again. I wanted an abortion. I knew that we weren't at a stable place in our marriage, &amp; I was terrified that he'd pull the rug out from under me again &amp; id be alone with two kids. He sobbed. Swore things would be different, that he'd learned his lesson, that he wanted this baby, &amp; our family. 

Two weeks after I brought our daughter home from the hospital, he told me he'd been having an affair and he moved out. He said he regretted marrying me, that I'd tried to trap him by having kids, that I disgusted him &amp; he hadn't loved me since before our son was born. 

At this point, as scared as I was to be a single parent, I wasn't as sorry to see him go. I wanted stability, whatever form that took, for me and my kids. I never kept the kids from him. I let him spend the night at my house many times to spend time with them. (My daughter was still too young &amp; was breastfeeding, so she couldn't be away from me overnight, &amp; he still had no idea how to care for our son). 

While the kids and I were visiting family for a weekend, a few months after he'd left, he moved back in. He didn't ask, we didn't discuss it, he was just there. And we just…existed. Stagnant. 

In July, I told him I wanted a divorce. He fell apart. Screaming, wailing on the floor. He told me he'd take the kids and I'd never see them again. Called me every foul name in the book. Begged me to give him another chance. He said that he'd taken a long time to ""grow up"", but that he had now, &amp; he was 100% sure that he wanted to be with me, wanted our family. He asked me to wait a year and give him a chance to prove that he'd changed. I told him I'd give him 3 months. 

Now it's been 6 months. I'll admit, he's made changes. He rarely goes out, tells me constantly (to the point that it's irritating) how much he loves and appreciates me. He's also started drinking to complete drunkenness every single night. He still doesn't help with the kids, but he plays with them. His temper is explosive and scary. I'm just done. 

It's a ridiculous cliche, but while I do love him, I am not in love with him anymore. I hate for him to touch me, it makes me cringe. I don't want to spend time with him. It irritates me when he wants to hang out. I've given myself a deadline of the end of January to tell him. I just don't know how. I'm afraid of hurting him. I'm afraid he'll completely spin out. And I'm terrified of him having unsupervised visitation with the kids. He doesn't take care of them. He's never given them a bath, taken them to the doctor, changed a diaper, put them to bed, made them a meal. He screams at them. Not yelling. I have two toddlers, I understand that sometimes kids drive you crazy. I've yelled at them. I'm talking about veins popping out, spit flying, red-faces screaming. He's obviously an alcoholic. I'm afraid he'll pass out smoking (which he does in his bedroom) &amp; burn the house down. His mattress is covered in burn marks. 

I'm fucking terrified. How can I trust him to keep our kids safe? Never mind basic care, I mean just the baseline safe. I've already been told by a lawyer that I've got little to no chance of ensuring supervised visitation for him. There's nothing provable, &amp; essentially, I just sound like a bitter ex. I'm miserable with him, but I keep thinking that at least I'm with the kids all the time. I can step in if he gets scary. I can make sure they're safe.  How can I let him use our kids a guinea pigs, to just ""wait and see"" if he figures it out, hopefully without hurting them.  

What the hell do I do? 

I'm so sorry this was so long. I really appreciate you reading it. I guess it's been building for a while. 

TL;DR- I want a divorce, scared of the outcome. 

Edited to add: I don't want to screw him in the divorce. I'm letting him stay in the house, keep his car (which is in my name), and not file for alimony. I planned to ask for child support (less than the state recommended amount, because I want him to be able to live too), &amp; offer him (hopefully supervised) every-other-weekend visitation, as well as one afternoon each week."
50,"Girlfriend[20/F] started a huge fight because I didn't ask why she didn't reply to my[24/M] text. I ended up getting dumped because of it. Really confused....


My girlfriend of 2 months started a huge fight yesterday.  So basically I texted her a sweet godmorning text in the morning and she got really happy about it.  Afterwards she asked what I was doing etc. and I replied but she didn't answer my text.  She had said the day before that her friend was going to sleep over at her.  And I thought she was spending time with her so I didn't bother if she didn't answer me for 4 hours. I wanted to give her space.  After 4 hours she texts me all angry about why I do not care about her and why I didn't ask why she didn't reply, I said I thought you were with your friend and I saw on Facebook Messenger that you were active so I assumed nothing happened to you.  She was furious and said she was testing me to see if I cared about her and I said that's not a nice thing to do. I said if you saw my message you should have replied.  She got furious and started attacking me for being a bad boyfriend.  She said she wanted a man not a boy.  And I said I do care about you it was just because I thought you were with your friend and I wanted you to have your space. That's why I didn't ask if something had happened.  

Long story short I ended up apologizing for not asking if something had happened to her during the hours she didn't reply.  She still said that I was coming up with excuses and she didn't want me to be sorry. She said she didn't want to teach me how to behave like a man. I ended up apologizing and said I would ask more frequently how she is during the day just to check if she is alright. She said I need to call her when she doesn't answer for a while because she might be dead or she might be cheating on me. So finally after a 30 min intense phone call she says she is not angry any longer but wants time for herself and I said I respect that.  So we ended the phone call. About 30 min after we hung up I heard my phone vibrating during the night and I woke up because of it. I saw texts from her saying she is breaking up with me because she feels like we are not compatible with eachother. I was like seriously?  Before this argument we had such a good time together and just yesterday she said that she was so happy with me because I understood her and I was giving her so much affection and she loved it.  I am just confused. I didn't end up pursuing her more because that's just my personality if someone doesn't want to be with me I won't force them because it requires that two people want to be in a relatipnship to make it work. 

She was furious and said she didn't want this  any longer and that I was like a girl. She started attacking me personally and said that she doesn't like relationships and said you have to come to my parents and ask them if I can propuse to their daughter. She wants an engagement already after two months. I said never I need to know someone for at least 1 to 2 years before I even think about engagement.  She said I should leave her alone and should stay far away from her. 

She is 20 and has already divorced once and I want to know her very well before I even think about marriage. I feel like she is forcing me to marry her fast I really feel uncomfortable.  

I am really confused. Yesterday I was the best guy ever and the most loving man. Today I am a bad guy because she didn't reply to my text and I gave her space to be with her friend. Guess what? I ended up getting dumped.  
I do not know what to do.  Have someone ever been with a partner like this before? I don't feel like I have done something wrong. Should I fight for her or just leave her?  

Tl;dr 
Girlfriend dumped me because I didn't ask her why she didn't reply to my text for a couple of hours. She by purpose did not reply to my text just to see if I cared about her. I wanted to give her space because she was with her friend. Not a good excuse according to her. Apologized and promised to more frequently ask about her but still ended up getting dumped.  "
51,"Wife (44F) of 9 years keeps buying expensive things and using the excuse that she was 'drunk' and that she is sorry. She recently used this excuse, except I know she wasn't actually drunk. How do I confront her about these lies?


I am not even sure what to do really. I have a wife of 9 years, we have 3 kids together. My wife...  has been spending a lot. Like she went to a jewerly store and got a 280 dollar necklace a while back, and she kept apologizing and saying she was drinking with her girls and I told her it was fine, she looked nice with it anyways, I let it slide. Except... she used this excuse again, 3 weeks ago, when she got something off of amazon. A 250 dollar Nintendo switch, so she can play zelda. I confronted her about it and she just said ""oh uh, that was the night we had dinner with cheryl, I had way too many glasses of wine"" and I just told her that wasn't okay, and she should cancel the order. She did, thankfully, only because I stood over her shoulder when it happened. Again, she went out with her friends to some bar, apparently ordered 70 bucks of food on seamless, and her excuse was 'sorry i was drunk'. Except... she drove home. And when I confronted her about that she suddenly looked like I caught her red handed or something, and she said that it was her friend who drove home. But like, I saw her get out of the car? I didn't even want to keep talking about that so I shut it down. 

It hit a breaking point 2 nights ago. Something came in the mail, a 90 dollar heated blanket. I confronted my wife about that and she said, first off, ""oh... you saw that"". Then she said it was the same night she came home drunk, the night of ordering the seamless, but it just looked like she was lying honestly. I told her she has to return it, and she said she can't. But I soundly told her, no more of this, this is out of hand. We aren't made of money. And I also told her, please stop getting drunk, it isn't like her to drink a lot. But at that point I had already suspected she was lying about the drinking. 

I looked on her amazon account. The order was made a whole day and a half after the night of the seamless order. She wasn't drunk at all that day, I was with her most of the day. She lied about being drunk, and I am sure she has lied other times. She wasn't anywhere near drunk from what I remember the night we had dinner with cheryl. 

So uhh, what the hell? I havent confronted her about this. She hasn't been like this at all in the past 9 years of marriage. What do I do?

61,"Am I [22F] missing some kind of dating etiquette? Am I in the wrong for refusing to be driven places, hugs, and intimate conversation early on?


I'm a 22 year old female in the US, and while I've never dated much due to being focused on school and other things, I've started to get back into it. 

I recently went on a casual lunch date with a guy I found off Tinder a couple years older than me. He offered to pick me up from class and drive me to the restaurant; I very politely refused and said I'm happy to meet him there. He was fairly bummed out and came up with a couple other reasons as to why I should catch a ride with him- ""it's cold"" ""it's the polite thing to do"". Weird, but I insisted I can drive myself and am happy to fill him in on why I prefer to drive when we meet up.

He brought it up in conversation at the restaurant, asking why I refused a ride. I said that first of all, for safety's sake, I don't accept rides from anyone I have not met several times before. As well, I was assaulted in a vehicle and prefer to not put myself in that situation again. I also stated that I'm just the kind of person who's more independent and would prefer to do some things myself. Was very polite and straightforward about this.

He still seemed a bit bummed out about it and didn't really seem to entirely, *truly* grasp what I was saying. But we moved on and had a somewhat decent lunch. At the end when we were leaving, he very quickly swept in for a hug and caught me off guard, so I didn't really hug back as I didn't see it coming. I'm really not a hugger at all, I **very** much appreciate my space; maybe its just who I am, but I reserve hugs for people I actually know, not individuals who are essentially strangers still. There were a couple other things throughout the lunch that stood out- he got pretty intimate about family and life, and just seemed a little bit too...intense over all.

I've seen all of these behaviours numerous times before on casual meal or coffee ""dates"" after meeting casually in a bar, or on a dating app. Guys who are essentially strangers insisting on rides, being too physically close, getting way too personal way too soon. 

Am I just somewhat of a cold-hearted witch, or am I right when I say that it seems people are getting too intense too soon? I very much am an emotional and caring person who wants an actual relationship, but I don't throw myself at people so quickly. There are times I feel that I'll never get into a relationship because I don't open my entire heart and life to someone on one of the first dates.
  
  ---   
  TL;DR: went on a date with a guy who was weirdly insistent on driving me, hugs, and intimate/personal conversation. This is not the first time I've experienced this on first dates. It's off-putting to me. Am I crazy, or is this the new norm of dating? Feeling like I'll be #ForeverAlone because of it."
62,"How do I [27F] ask my girlfriend [31F] to ease up on the affection?


Lately, my girlfriend has been acting really weird; she's been extra affectionate and it is driving me crazy!! These days I am actually dreading coming home (we live together) because when I do, my gf acts like she hasn't seen me in a week. She'll run to the door, greet me with a slow and cutesey ""...hiiiii.....I miiiiiissed you"" and then give me a hug where her arms go underneath my shirt and lasts like 10 seconds. She'll go in for at least 3 kisses during this hug. This is all before I've even closed the door or taken off my coat. I'll give her a hug back, but if it's not up to her standards she goes ""what, are you not happy to see me? I'm so happy to see you! Awwww *pouty face*"". Over the next five minutes I'll probably get another hug and 10 kisses. 


If we're just sitting on the couch watching TV, I'll see her trying to catch my eye and when I look over at her she smiles. So I ask her what's up and she just says ""Nothing, I just love you!"". And then she'll put this really sheepish look on her face, and go on my lap to cuddle. It really feels like she's acting like a 6 years old or a cat. At night we usually spend 30-60 minutes reading in bed. She will insist on holding hands while we're reading and will go ""aww *pout*"" if I move my hand to scratch my leg, or turn the page of my book, or if I just want to switch positions. When we are actually going to sleep, she'll come over to the middle of the bed (double sized bed) because her side is too far away from me. She'll then wrap her arms and legs around me, put her face in my hair and also hold my hand. I can do this for a bit, but this is not a comfortable position to sleep in. 


Another thing I can't stand is how much she touches my butt. It's SO ANNOYING. Literally every single time she passes me, she'll touch my butt and giggle. And she knows that I don't like it, but she'll do it anyway. She'll also pee with the door open and get sad if I don't look at her or make any acknowledgement. She gets dressed/undressed in the bedroom or n the bathroom with the door open and gets annoyed/pouty if I don't notice and come over to touch her boobs or something. 


Maybe I am overreacting here or am just crazy, but I am getting so overwhelmed by the way she is acting. It's just too much and it's actually a huge turn off. At the end of the day I just don't want any more touching! How do I tell her to cut down on the affectiony cutesy stuff without hurting her feelings?

  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend is being really touchy and affectiony and it's driving me insane. How do I tell her to cut down on it without making it seem that I don't like her?"
63,"My [29f] boyfriend of almost 3 years [32m] tells his friends very intimate details of our sex life plus other personal things and I feel completely betrayed, but he doesn’t seem to see anything wrong with it.



I’m more of a quiet and reserved person and the fact that my boyfriend did this has completely embarrassed me.


Last weekend we were at a party. It was just a small gathering of my boyfriend’s friends about 8 people in total including my boyfriend and I. Anyway the conversation started to take a sexual turn and people were sharing very intimate details of their sex lives. I was quiet and uncomfortable and I think some people started to notice, so of course they shifted the attention to me and playfully tried to get me to open up. I politely explained I don’t kiss and tell, hoping that would be the end of it, but of course it wasn’t. When I started to become visibly more uncomfortable Max (fake name for one of the friends there) said “Don’t worry about it. What she won’t tell us, Tom (fake name for my boyfriend) will.” Tom (my boyfriend) was quiet and looked like he saw a ghost and finally they took the hint to move on.


On the car ride home I was furious and asked does he go into the kind of vivid in depth detail about our sex life like his friends were doing when I’m not around. He explained that he did but that’s just the way guys talk. I felt so disgusted and exposed and asked him to tell me exactly what he told them. I was shocked at the type of personal things he told them, he even admitted to telling them about something awful and personal that happened between my biological father and I that no one knows about other than him, and my mother. I began to cry and scream I was so furious! 


He explained that he didn’t think it was such a big deal that he disclosed such personal information about me without my permission to his friends then he tried to flip it and said it was no different then a time I canceled plans with a friend and told them the reason was because he, Tom was sick with the flu and I was going to stay in and take care of him. How is me honestly explaining that the reason I would have to cancel on a friend because my boyfriend is sick, the same as him giving away very detailed information about our sex life plus other very personal traumas that I experienced without my permission? I feel like he’s trying to gaslight me and I’m seeing a side to him I’ve never seen. I’m honestly thinking about ending things with him over this.


TL;DR my boyfriend told his friends VERY detailed information about our sex life plus other personal things about my life without my permission and I feel so betrayed but he’s trying to act like it’s no big deal."

69,"Mother (58) called social services on me (30F)


I cannot give a lot of information about this but here are the main points.

My child has special needs and has been seen by a fair few medical professionals. They have been put on medication (prescribed by a paediatrician) to help them with their learning. My mother absolutely hates that I'm ""drugging"" my child. I'm not particularly happy about it but it has extremely improved their learning. We have been working with social services since last year to help my child get Disability living allowance and to help them with trouble at school.

Recently, my social worker called to let me know of a claim made against me. She read the transcript to me but could not give any information about the caller. It was very obviously made by my mother. Luckily my social worker has thrown the claim out because she has met us and knows that it is all bullshit. After talking to my father (they are divorced) he confirmed that it could only have been her. I asked my mother to stay away from us. She is denying it.

Now some back story: My mother was extremely abusive to me and my siblings growing up due to Ill mental health. Every time I let her see my child she would lie about things, for example cutting their hair and denying it. Her partner would say things like ""I love you more than I like myself"" to my child who would then copy the phrase back. When asked about the phrase they would lie and say they didn't teach them that.

There is honestly no one else who could have said those things to social services. If it wasn't her then someone did it on her behalf. It is not healthy for her to be around my child. She is now threatening the legal route to see my child. Can she actually do this?

TL;DR mum called social services saying I'm crazy and still expects to see her grandchild

EDIT: just to add, I will not be letting her anywhere near my child after this incident."
