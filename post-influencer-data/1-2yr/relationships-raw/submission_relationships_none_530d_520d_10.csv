0,"M [26F] with my MIL [70F] contacted my parents because she is upset that her son [32M] and I are not having kids immediately


There seems to be a lot of this going around so I'll keep it short; we're recently married (six months) and from the moment we got engaged (1.5 yrs ago) she started asking me when I'm going to stop birth control. 

Now I'm still fairly young and building my career, so my husband and I decided a while back that we wanted to wait a few years. My parents did the same (had my eldest sibling at 31), and they've always said they'll respect whatever we choose to do. 

My husband is his mom's only child (his dad has other kids), and she has a chronic medical condition. She's not terminal, but certainly won't improve. Because of this, she's obsessed with 'having grandkids before she dies', as she's told us many times. 

I've explained gently each time she's brought it up that a) her schedule is not our priority, and that b) she knows our plans and we'll tell her if they change. 

After we had this same conversation again the other day, I just found  out she then emailed my parents, saying ""You're so lucky you already have grandkids, as it seems {me} is more concerned with her career than her children. 

Beyond just the fact that it feels like she was trying to get my parents to put pressure on me (they didn't, but they did call to tell me about the email), it actually was quite a difficult email for my parents to receive, as there have been a number of infertility issues and miscarriages in our family. As such, we have an unspoken but hard rule that nobody ever asks about pregnancies or babies- you just trust that people will tell you when they want to.

I feel like I need to explain to her bluntly and firmly that she crossed a line, and that any questioning on this front in the future will be unacceptable- especially since it's possible that we'll also have trouble conceiving. I don't know how to explain this, and neither does my husband- his traditional method of dealing with his mother is to ignore her. Any advice?

tl;dr my MIL doesn't understand that pressuring us for grandchildren is painful to me and my family- how do we get her to stop


update: hubs and I have now discussed and read through y'all's responses (thanks), and we're going to call her jointly (with him leading the convo) to clearly lay out our boundaries, with clear penalties if she crosses them. he's gonna keep it short and simple- we will accept no questions on anything to do with my womb, and we will accept no advice related to it. My parents have decided they are going to respond and say that they support us fully and if she has any issues she needs to deal with them herself."
1,"I [28 F] just moved in with my boyfriend of three years [28 M] and it is unbearable. It’s like living with an overbearing mother.


My bf and I had been together for about three years when we decided to move in together. I still have a couple of months left on my lease so I’m subletting, and more and more I’m considering moving back into my own place (which I’m sure would cause a huge fight at the least and a breakup at worst, but I’m at the end of my rope.) 

We’ve been living together about two months and I am at the end of my rope. He is not a bad person (obviously) but living with him honestly reminds me of living with my mother, who was also overbearing. 

Examples: 

- When he gets home from work, he does a house “inspection” (he does not call it this, but i do). He goes around checking to see what’s out of place, what’s messy, etc. and if I’m not home, will text me photos of the out of place items, or what he deems too messy. It can be as excessive as a fork in the sink. 

- He will just sit and stare at me sometimes, often in moments when I’d prefer not to be stared at. The most common example is when I’m eating and he isn’t. If I bring a plate into the living room so I can watch TV with him, he will sometimes pause the TV and just watch me eat. I have asked him in varying levels of annoyance why he’s watching me, and he says “Oh I just want to look at you, you’re so beautiful” or something along those lines. 

- Because of the above, I’ve taken to going to another room to eat if I’m eating without him. HOWEVER, if I do that, he will question me extensively about why I need to sit in another room, why don’t I want to spend time with him, etc. even if I’m like “I’m only going to be 20 minutes!”

- This also relates to the above: if I don’t sit with him the entire time he’s home, he will grill me about why. He will call me almost every ten minutes that I’m in another room (even if in the bedroom or living room) and ask when I’ll be done, when am I coming back, etc. 

- If I am in the same room with him and get up to leave, even just to go to the bathroom or get a drink, it’s like a five minute conversation about where I’m going, what am I doing, when will I be back. Just now (what sort of prompted me to write this post) I wasn’t feeling well and really had to use the restroom suddenly, and of course as I’m standing there trying to not shit my pants he’s giving me the usual questioning of where am I going, why am I leaving, can I give him a kiss before I leave, and when will I be back? 

I guess there was some of this when we would visit each other or stay at each other’s apartments, but nothing as excessive as now, and when it’s your full time living place/residence it’s clear how unbelievably annoying and suffocating this behavior is. 

I don’t know if I should try to talk to him about it (I’ve mentioned it in passing or like in the moment when he’s doing it, that I don’t like it) but right now I’m at the brink of just wanting to move back out, but I’m afraid he’ll want to break up if I do that since it would be setting the “rewind button” on our relationship. I really don’t know what to do because I love him and he’s a good person but this is no way to live. 

[TL;DR My bf is unbelievably overbearing when we are together at home]"
2,"[Update] My [28F] friends [30sF] want to start a GoFundMe page for my best friend [29F], best friend wants us to do it but I feel ashamed to start one. Is my ego getting in the way of being a good friend?


[First post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86q18s/my_28f_friends_30fs_want_to_start_a_gofundme_page/?st=JFOKASMC&amp;sh=b3a0986f)

It didn’t get a lot of attention but a few developments. 

Well, Brianna got over 10k in donations. She’s put her other kid in day care ($2500 a month!) and her son that was sick is back in school. She sits home and quit her job. She actually had the audacity to text me and say “we never hang out anymore, I’m free all day.” While I work two jobs, I went no contact with all of them. 

A mutual friend called and told me I was “unsupportive and heartless.” Told her my side of the story and that friend asked Briana and Tess about it at a lunch the next day. They all backtracked and said Brianna needed a “break” after her “week long scare.” So she’s taking a “a couple months” off. Mutual friend horrified and told a lot of people we knew. I didn’t have to do a thing and a few people have reported the GoFundMe page (it has been deleted, not sure if by them or the company)  and asked for donations back. Not sure how it all works but I’m done with them and their poor choice in lifestyle. 

**TL;DR** Went no contact with scummy friends. "
3,"I (28f) love my husband (31m) of 5 years more than anything. But he can't seem to grow up when it comes to a job. His snowmobile tour business just folded, latest in long string of events like this. What can I do here?


My husband ""John"" and I have been married 5 years, together for 8. John has an amazing personality, he's full of whimsy, charm and humor. He's stunningly, ruggedly handsome and he still makes me swoon.

The problem is he just can't seem to grow up when it comes to work. He has a masters in electrical engineering that cost his parents a fortune but he hated it so much he's never worked a day in a tech or engineering company. Since we've been together here's a list of the jobs/companies he's started since we've been married:

1. Ski lift operator

2. Owned a crepe truck

3. Hiking guide

4. Opened a bike shop 

5. Tour guide
 
6. Massage therapist

7. Snowmobile tour company.


Now I'm not saying that any of these jobs is a bad thing at all, what johns problem is that he gets super enthusiastic about a ""new"" thing, spends a ton of time doing the fun and exciting part of a new adventure but he loses interest when the tough, boring, mundane reality hits. The snowmobile tour company is a great example. He had a ball buying the snowmobiles, scouting the trails, designing logos, etc... But he was unwilling/unable to do any work advertising and networking to actually get customers through the door. We had a crazy dry winter this year too so to make this work, he would have had to work twice as hard, but he'd essentially given up by late January. The whole list above played out very similar.

All this means I've had to work (nurse) lots of overtime  just to keep us afloat, much less save for retirement and I want to adopt kids so bad but we are nowhere near solvent enough to even consider it. When I try to talk to him he just tells me ""something will click, don't worry about it"" and I get lost in his charm and believe him all over again.

What can I do here? On one extreme, I guess I can keep the status quo and stay and love him for who he is, the other extreme is I cut my loses and admit that love isn't enough to sustain a relationship. I'd love any advice in that middle ground.

Thank you.

Tl;dr: my husband refuses to grow up when it comes to work. After a string of failed business attempts I'm still working double and often triple overtime just to keep is afloat and our lives haven't started. What can I do?

4,"I [22/F] am in love with my best friend [22/F] of 16 years. It’s become unbearable to keep my feelings and emotions in check around her. I don’t know what to do.


[removed]"
5,"[UPDATE] I [24F] am moving in with my boyfriend [24M] of 1 year in the spring. My mother [60sF] has a very traditional opinion on cohabiting and will not take this news well.


[!!Original post!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mxf60/i_24f_am_moving_in_with_my_boyfriend_24m_of_1/?st=JFO2LPUW&amp;sh=bc383f14)

Hallooo! I wanted to drop a quick (good) update and hopefully embolden any other folks out there who might be struggling with breaking from longstanding familial views as an adult. 

[disclaimer for typos via mobile]

So we made the move—BF and I found a wonderful unit in a great part of our city and moved ahead of our original schedule. We’re settled, we’re happy, we’re healthy; we need to hang a few most posters and are waiting for a new computer desk, but the apartment is home now! We adore it. 

But February into early March was a GAUNTLET. 

BF was a real rock throughout the process. He talked through every possible scenario under the sun with me, we confronted conversations about out future a lot earlier than we expected to (tossed around the idea of a long engagement, different marriage timelines, the whole 9). Throughout, he was adamant that this was MY decision. I took Us into consideration in a primary way, but he was sure to make sure the final call was mine and mine alone. We did a lot of holding-and-crying, his family was incredibly supportive, and I ultimately decided that the only net-gain decision with everything taken into consideration was for us to proceed with the move. 

My mother took the news very, very personally. I told my parents initially when I went to their house one night to have dinner with them, but they reacted with staunch resistance so I let the conversation rest for a few days. I wanted to set up another in-person conversation with my mother to say hey, this is going to happen, I love you and I know you care about me but I need to do this because it’s what’s best for me and my relationship—she got impatient and we ended up having that conversation over the phone. She was extremely upset and ended up hanging up on me, but I had said my piece. It hurt, but at least it was mostly done. 

There were a few tense days that followed, with a big weight removed from my shoulders but a couple other family members messaging me to say how disappointed they were with my decision to move forward with something that upset my mother so much. It was sort of amazing to me in a weird way, to see those foundations rocked so much by ONE decision. My uncle put it best—it was the first true break in ideology my sister or I had ever brought to the table, so it had big fallout.

My parents soon invited BF and I over for another dinner to talk about the decision. It was nerve-wracking and we all cried a lot, but at the end of it all the air was cleared to the point of “Well here we are then.” My mother was still very upset, and my father’s attitude was more of “I don’t agree, but life goes on.” They didn’t want to hear any more about it at that point, so that’s where we left it then.

Over the next several days, things were awkward. I emailed my mother to thank her for her openness, and she responded back with cautious optimism that I might reconsider but she obviously still loves me. She let me know that she will hold reserved feelings for BF until we get engaged, but if that’s what she needs to do to feel alright with this then that’s what we work with. I told her thank you, I don’t want us to lose our relationship over this, I’m still moving, but we will go from here.

It was only a couple weeks ago when things finally started truly cooling off. I think it was a combination of my father and some of her friends with adult children sitting her down after a few days to say “Hey, this isn’t the end of the world.” She has been much more open to discussing the apartment and the future with me, and I’m SO glad I went about this openly and truthfully. It will still take a lot of work from both of us to keep an understanding between us, but I feel like that’s really possible now. 

Thank you SO MUCH to all the comments on the original for all the different advice to consider. It was so helpful to hear from others who were in a similar position. 

For anyone else approaching or in the middle of a situation like this, I want to stress the importance of being honest with yourself, your motivations, and your plans for the future. I couldn’t have done this without MOUNTAINS of self-reflection and discussion of some of the harder things to talk about in a relationship, both the familial and the romantic. Be open to conflict and willing to address some tough stuff. 

At the end of it all, I’m convinced from here ‘til Sunday that I’ve made the right decision. It was a super important step of adulthood for me, and though it came with consequences they’re the kind I’m prepared to work with. There will be bumps along the road going forward with my mother, but nothing we can’t handle.

Now I just have to find wall space for TWO collections of posters ^^;

TL;DR - Had some really hard conversations, made some really tough decisions, but ultimately decided to forge ahead with the move. My mother was extremely upset, but she’s willing to rebuild going forward with a lot of fresh effort from both of us. New apartment is fantastic, but could do with more wall space."
6,"My[30m] wife[31f] had an affair 2 years ago I forgave her, I just found her depraved text messages between her and the guy. I am debating divorcing her first thing on Monday


I don't want my information to get out in public so I am going to share what I can to be limited as possible. My wife and I have been married for 6 years. Two years ago she had an affair with another man. 

It was a really rough time for our marriage. Mentally I was fucked up, I couldn't think straight, I was hurt, angry. But my wife calmed me down, she told me the that her affair was short lived that it was because she just liked the attention of another man finding her hot. And that when it started she didn't know how to get out until I found out. The messages which I saw pointed to that, and just the evidence I found. That it was mostly texting and they slept together a couple times. 

I recently found some chat logs that paint a completely different picture. My wife was the one that pursued him, she would sext him constantly and if anything she was the one that pursued him. Through their messages I found out she did stuff in bed that she would never do with me or as she claimed with anyone. And on top of that they never used protection either. 

I know the affair is over, but after reading these messages I am more hurt than before. I have kept it all in and I am furious. I am thinking of waiting till Monday and just getting divorce papers. But at the same time, I don't know what to do my wife has been great to me since the divorce. I am broken now more than ever before please help me. What should I do? Do I confront her? DO I tell her about the chat logs?? 

**tl;dr- I found the text messages between my wife and her lover. We had already reconciled but much of what she told me was bs. I am thinking about ending our marriage.**"
7,"My close friend (34f) froze me out (31f) when I told her her husband assaulted with me. She caught him cheating and she wants my forgiveness


About a year ago, I was at a party. My very close friend, Carla, and her husband, Jake, were also there. Carla and I drank too much so Jake drove us home. Carla fell asleep in the car. When we got to my apartment, Jake walked me to my door, but then he tried to kiss me and pushed his way into my home. Inside, he assaulted me. He clearly thought I was black out drunk because he said several times that it was a very good thing I wouldn't remember any of it the next day.

The next day I remembered everything. I immediately called Carla but Jake answered and pretended like nothing had happened. I didn't want him to warn Carla, so I played along. I think he figured it out though. I wasn't able to talk to Carla until I went to her home uninvited when I knew Jake wou be at work. I told Carla everything. She told me that I didn't need to spin lies, she knew that I had dragged Jake into my apartment. She called me a bad friend and a bunch of other names. Eventually, I just said ""You're going to regret this"" and left. She took that as a threat and started telling all our friends that I had tried to seduce her husband while she slept and then made threats against her life. Most people didn't believe her but enough did. The past year has been rough.

About a month and a half ago, Carla walked in on Jake having sex with her sister. In the fall out, Jake admitted to lying about what happened with me. Carla has been calling me and sending messages through our friends begging me to forgive her so we can go back to how we were.

I want to forgive her. I do. But she didn't just destroy my relationship with her. She tried to destroy my relationship with everyone we both know. She said unforgivable things about me. She never for a second entertained my side. I get that it was her husband. I get it. But I don't know if I can forgive it. Does that make me a bad person?

My therapist says he gets it and doesn't want to push me in any direction. He says it is my choice if I want to focus my energy on rebuilding my friendship with Carla and he'll help me if I want that. But if I don't, he'll help me move on. I think often about the amazing times Carla and I had together, but it feels like there is this darkness eating away at those fond memories. I hate that she's hurting right now, but I think I hate it more that she didn't hate that when I was hurting. Am I selfish? What would you do in my shoes?

Tl;Dr: My friends husband assaulted me. My friend didn't believe me and spread false rumors about me. Now she knows I was honest, but I don't know if I can forgive her. What do?"
8,"My (35M) brother (36M) wants me to fire his wife (32F)


I own a company that’s been fast growing over the last few years. For the most part, my wife has run the secretarial side of things but about 6 months ago, things got so busy that the workload was just too much for her and we decided to bring in someone to help out. 

I’ve had a very shaky relationship with my brother in the last 15 or so years, but I really respect and like his wife. She’s well educated and very friendly so we thought she would be perfect in a part time customer service role if she wasn’t too busy. I offered her the job and she was thrilled. 

In the last several months, she’s gone above and beyond my expectations. My customers rave about her. She’s incredibly detail oriented, great at smoothing out customer issues and her work in general is really impressive. In my opinion, she’s become an irreplaceable member of our team. 

Earlier this week, we decided to pull the plug on plans we’ve been making to open another location. My sister in law lives in an ideal area for us (it’s about 2 hours away) and we have a ton of work out there, so my intention is to open the location in her area and get her to run that office. She works from home now and that wouldn’t change. The location itself is just to house trucks and equipment so she doesn’t need to be there to answer phones. It would be closer to full time than what she’s doing now, but she’s always seemed interested in doing more work for us and we’ve discussed this plan in the past. 

All of this was pretty exciting until my brother called me up yesterday and pretty unceremoniously asked me to fire his wife. He didn’t say why. Just asked me to do it and make up a reason if I couldn’t think of one. 

Wtf?

I don’t understand. I’m paying her probably more than he makes hourly. She’s about to get a huge raise. I want to eventually make her a partner. I’m at their house at least three times a week and the place is super clean. They have three kids, but they’re all doing really well. My sister in law says she loves working again and that she isn’t overwhelmed. I haven’t seen any indication that she’s not being honest. She’s a great mother. She’s wonderful to my brother. She and my wife have a great friendship. 

So what’s the problem?  

I’ll say it straight up. I’m not going to fire my best employee. If she wants to quit, fine. But I want to get to the bottom of this and I feel like I’m missing something. 

TLDR:  My sister in law works for me and is great at her job. My brother wants me to fire her, won’t give me a reason. "

10,"I [17M] don't talk to my parents [43 M/F] at all. I'm afraid this is unhealthy and will affect my ability to interact with other people when I become an adult.


`Sorry for not replying to any comments. Everyone's comments are so long and I have a lot of stuff to do today so it's taking` `me forever to read everything.` `But, the advice has been really helpful, thanks!`

**My parents immigrated to Canada from Vietnam after my first birthday. I've lived here for 94\% of my life. I don't speak a single word of Vietnamese but I understand a lot of it. They exclusively speak Vietnamese to me at home, and I reply back to them in English.**

I've gone days where I haven't spoken a single word to my parents. I am more comfortable speaking to my friend's parents than to my own. I don't feel like I can tell them anything. I have heard of children saying they can tell their parents anything. I cannot comprehend that. I know they love me, and I feel bad that I can't hold a conversation with them, when I can speak to my teachers or friends with no issues.

I feel bad that my parents have done so much for me, and yet I can't show them that I love them. Next year I'm graduating high school and I plan to live away for university. I'll be gone from my parent's life, and had 0 interaction with them. I feel terrible about this. It's not fair for a parent to raise their child, watch them go through childhood, and graduate high school without talking to them. That would be like spending hundreds of thousands of dollars watching a rock grow for 18 years. What is the point in having a child if they won't even talk to you?

I think that this is extremely unhealthy that I've gone through my whole life like this. I've always had the idea that parents didn't talk to their children. I remember the first time I heard that some children speak to their parents like they are friends. It was such an unusual concept to me. Every TV show I watch shows children talking to their parents like normal people, and it gets me anxious. I'm scared this will bleed into my adult life.

My friends describe me as asexual and while that's true for now, I know that won't be for long. I do want to find love when I grow up. I want someone I can say I love them. I want to feel loved. The problem is I haven't said the words ""I love you."" once in my life. I feel like this is going to affect my intimacy. I believe this communication problem I have with my parents is going to have a huge impact on my future significant others. I'm afraid I'll feel bad when they do things for me, when in a loving relationship that is expected. I don't know how this will affect my early adult years, but I know it's not healthy.

I have a terrible mindset that if I try talking to them in full sentences they won't understand me, even when I know that's completely wrong.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I've tried pinpointing the reason before but I just can't find it. I don't have depression, and I'm usually very happy. I don't think anyone else has such a huge communication issue with their parents like I do. They have done nothing wrong to me but I just can't talk to them for whatever reason and I feel guilty and bad about it.

**tl;dr**: I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents. I have gone days without saying a single word to them. I am afraid this communication issue will affect my love life in the future and other unforeseeable things."
11,"My [56M] grandson has been diagnosed with Asthma. My wife [57F] wants time with him, but doesn't want to learn from our daughter [28F] about what to do if his Asthma acts up.


I'm a first time poster. I have been deliberating posting this with myself for about two weeks. 

I have been with my wife almost my entire adult life. We have three kids together and two grand children. My youngest grandson was recently diagnosed with Asthma from his doctor. My daughter and my son in law have had to go to a lot of meetings with a doctor to learn what to do when his asthma acts up. My daughter recently asked my wife and I to learn about things to look out for and what to do if he does get an asthma attack. 

I have been going to talk with my daughter and the man that instructed her and learning myself. My wife has been making excuses as to why she doesn't want to learn how to handle this situation with young children. It's always I have to go shopping, or the hospital is too far away for me to travel. She comes up every time with an excuse even if I offer to tell or show her myself. 

My wife also wants to be able to take our grandson out places by herself when I am away. I work for a talent agency, and it involves a lot of travel at times. I'm also unable to run to the store when our grandchildren visit or leave the house because my wife doesn't know what to do, and it would upset our daughter. My daughter has told her if she wants to have our grandson to herself she needs to learn, but she's operating off the it will never happen to me mentality. 

Could someone please help me talk to my wife and get her to understand the situation. I've tried and tried.

Tl;dr: My wife is refusing to learn about what to do if our youngest grandson gets an asthma attack. She's operating off the it will never happen to me mentality, but still wants our daughter to leave her alone with him. "

13,"Suddenly seriously freaked out by my (18/F) bffs(20/F) parents (late 40s)


I've known this family for a few years, I've become particularly close to my best friend and her Dad. Their friendship means the world to me, I practically live there.

One day I was over there, casually comfortably hanging out with her dad. Suddenly he started telling me how beautiful I was and other romantic things, I froze in shock when he pulled me to him and started kissing me and running his hands over my body. I just had the presence of mind to pull away when who should see? His wife. Great. She came in, barely looked at me, asked me to leave, and started SCREAMING at him. I left.

My friend is away travelling so I have some time to gather my thoughts. I didnt go back there for almost two weeks now. I called her Dad on the phone so we could talk and maybe clear the air. He was really sweet and apologetic ""if he had upset me."" ok. yes. He went on to say other flowery things like.. how hard it was to resist someone so young and sweet and beautiful as myself. how much he cared about me, just wanted us all to be happy etc went on to be really apologetic about everything, ok, Im starting to think that we can just talk it out and just maybe get past this when the man goes ON to say, oh so casually, that yes, ""wife"" was pretty mad when she first saw that but that she has since admitted to having ongoing fantasies about it.

Wtf? wtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtfwtf. Sorry ok. but what? How can I possibly go back there now? I would be *completely devastated* to lose my friend over this.... what do I do?

TLDR: Bffs parents turn out to be fn creeps and I am distraught"
14,"My [17M] big brother [20M] wants me to write a love letter to his girlfriend [20F] for him, but I think he should do it himself.


My big brother has been dating his girlfriend for almost two years now. For their two year anniversary, he wants to give her something special. He asked me if I could write a love letter to her for him. I do a lot of writing in my spare time, and I write a lot of stories on other subreddits (obviously not on this account). I've also always gotten straight A's in English, and I consider myself a pretty strong writer. My brother on the other hand always got C's in English and struggled with writing assignments, so it makes sense why he's asking me to write to his girlfriend.

But I feel like that defeats the whole purpose if I'm the one that writes it. I don't know much about my brother's girlfriend. I've talked to her twice, she's pretty and seems like a nice woman, but that's all I know about her. I *could* write a really nice lovey-dovey-fluffy letter, *but* it would be my words, and it wouldn't be genuine.

I told my brother that he should write it himself, but he says he doesn't know how to start. He can't put into words his love for his girlfriend and says I'd do a better job at it - even though I don't know anything about her. My brother has been begging me for the past few days to write it because their anniversary is coming up (April 2nd). He said it would make her really happy because she's never received a letter before, and he'd owe me big time for it.

I know that my brother loves his girlfriend very much. He talks about her all the time when he comes home from school to the point where I need to tell him to stop because I'm not interested. My brother shows a lot of affection for her when they're together, and I find it quite endearing. I don't think it would be that hard for my brother to write a letter because clearly, he's deeply in love with her.

How can I get my brother to understand that it would be a better if he was the one that wrote it for her?

**TL;DR:** My brother has been begging me for the past few days to write a love letter to his girlfriend for him, because I'm a strong writer, and he doesn't know what to say or how to start it off."
15,"Guy [28M] that I [25F] have been dating for two months giving me the silent treatment after I turn down his invitation to Netflix and chill because I wanted to go home and sleep instead


**TL;DR: Guy I'm dating starts ignoring me after I turned down his offer to come over at his place in favor of going home to sleep.**  

The guy is also a redditor, but I'm posting this with minimal edits anyway because I'm lost on how to proceed.   

I [25F] met Matthew [28M] six months ago on a subreddit's casual IRL meet-up. We didn't really get to talk to each other as I was mingling with other people at the time, so he didn't really make an impression on me. Later on I joined the subreddit's casual Discord channel, of which he was a member. He reached out to me first and this is when we started to get to know each other.  

He asked me out after a few weeks of chatting, and while he wasn't my usual type we clicked in chat so I thought it was worth one date.

Sure enough, it was.

We really hit it off after the first date, and since then we were going out at least once a week, unless we couldn't because of work obligations. We have a lot of common interests, conversations came and flowed easily, and I could feel myself relaxing around his presence so I became optimistic about where things were going.

The problem started shortly after our last date. We watched a movie, had dinner then walked around a nearby park just talking and joking for hours. It was getting pretty late, and while we were in no real hurry to end the date we both had our own thing to do the next day, so we couldn't stay out for long anyway. While we were talking about what we could do before going our separate ways he suddenly invites me to come over to his place, which was a short walk away from where we were.  

It was the first time he has offered to stay over, and I was surprised as it came out of nowhere. He talked about a lot of casual things we could do at his place, but the way he said them involved sexual subtext.

While I was taken aback by the sudden offer I wasn't completely against it either. However, my sleeping patterns have gone to shit (he knows this), and I've been working towards fixing my sleep schedule because I've been waking up tired and cranky due to lack of a good night's rest.   

I kind of dawdled on answering as I was still weighing the pros and cons. Finally, I gave him my answer and told him to ask me again on our next date. He seemed a little disappointed, but I thought he took it graciously and then we parted ways for the evening.

The silent treatment/ghosting started the next day. He's always been eager to start the convos more often than not, so it was strange when he went silent the next day. And the next. And the next. He's a busy guy but we've never missed three days of convos in a row so I was starting to get confused. When I did initiate our recent chats his replies were shallow and unenthusiastic, which confused me even more.  

It has been four days since we last talked to each other in chat. I was discouraged by his short replies so I haven't initiated another conversation since. I have thought of asking him if me turning him down last time is the cause of the issue but I don't know how to tell him without sounding clingy.

Some background on my dating history: I'm a late bloomer who started dating after I graduated college. I've dated some guys since then but none of them really move past the six-month period, so when it comes to romance and relationships I guess I'm pretty virginal. I'm usually quiet and reserved when it comes to flirting and displays of affection, which gives the impression of me being frigid. Could this be part of the problem?

Frankly I *hate* *hate* *hate* ghosting, playing hard to get and all these dating mind games and if that's what's really happening then I'm just thinking of cutting my losses and moving on.

Did I do something wrong in prioritizing my beauty sleep? Was I too frigid? What should I do now?"
16,"My (18F) Asian parents (49M, 46F) are uncomfortable with me inviting my white friends to the house or any events. What do I do?


This has been going on since my childhood. I understand that I'm living under their house and am not entitled to have friends over or anything but I'm worried this might have consequences in future.

I have a younger brother and whenever he wants his Asian friends to visit, stay overnight, come to events, it's never been a problem. He went to a school with a lot of Asians while I went to a less diverse one. Most of my friends are white.

I have not been allowed to invite them to  any parties we host and only one friend at a time has ever been over under circumstances like getting ready for prom. I just feel like my friends are unwelcome in our home and my parents are really uncomfortable just because they're white.

I had a massive 18th birthday event and my parents invited practically every Asian family in our community. I'm grateful and enjoyed it but it just sucked that these people I'd never met before came to my 18th party while my closest friends weren't invited just because they weren't Asian.

Also, when I dated a Russian guy, my parents were very uncomfortable and made me end the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what to do. When I get to university, I'm not the type to stick to a group of people just because they're my race. I don't want to explain to any new partners or friends why they can't meet my parents or come over. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.

**TL;DR** 
Parents don't let my white friends to visit, stay over or come to events but let my brother's Asian friends do all of the above."

18,"My [25 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 2 years intentionally scares me in different ways and I'm tired of it. How do I get him to stop?


My boyfriend sleepwalks and talks in his sleep. He sleepwalks very rarely but he sometimes (still rare) wakes up semi asleep and mumbles something, then goes back to bed.

When he talks in his sleep he does a very frightening voice. It's deep and he says eerie things sometimes, like ""Don't go there"", ""It can smell you"", ""I am not real, I never was"", and many other things. It freaks me out but he can't do much to stop so I got used to it.

BUT, he also scares me intentionally and sometimes pretends he's sleepwalking or talking in his sleep to jump scare me. The worst time was hen he walked to the kitchen in the middle of the night while I was watching TV, mumbling some stuff. He stopped in front of the kitchen aisle and when I got close he moved suddenly and grabbed me.

It scared me so much I cried in the floor and he as basically like ""Don't be silly, I was messing with you"". Another time he was pretending to talk in his sleep beside me and quickly turned around and grabbed me.

Why is he doing this?! I'm tired of it. He's such a polite and kind person the rest of the time, and I say this honestly, not trying to convince myself of it. He very rarely does it but I never know if he's actually talking in his sleep or he's trying give me another scare. How do I tell him to stop? I really want him to stop, it's hurting me and he hasn't listened to me. How?

**tl;dr:** Boyfriend sleepwalks and talks in his sleep, but he sometimes *pretends* he's doing it just to jump scare me. I want him to stop and he doesn't. How do I get him to stop?"

20,"My best friend/boyfriend [21M] of several months is going away for the weekend with his ex-girlfriend [20F] so that they can ""talk"". I [20F] feel disrespected and incredibly upset.


We met about a year ago and become close friends quickly. He was dating the ex-girlfriend in question at the time and they had been together for 5 years. Eventually he broke up with her and we realized we had feelings for each other. We've been going out since then and things have been slow since he was just getting out of a relationship. That's the short story, and I don't care anymore if anyone I know finds this.


A couple of weeks ago I had been getting frustrated because I felt like things weren't moving forward anymore. Before I expressed this to him he broke down and told me the feelings about his breakup had just hit him and that he must've blocked out the trauma until then. We talked through everything and the main problem was that he blamed himself for everything that had happened, even though that wasn't the case. I saw his relationship fall apart by itself and told him this. 


Following this talk he said he felt better about things and he started treating me the way I had been missing. I spent the night at his house and got to meet his family and everything. I told him I felt that was important to me and I was happy, and we discussed that we should still take things slow since we are both dealing with a lot of exam stress right now, but it felt like a step in the right direction. We haven't put a title on it but we agreed to be exclusive a long time ago and things feel more serious than ever. 


This morning he told me he was going to his ex's cabin, just the two of them. He said they needed to talk because they're both ""not in a good place"". I told him I didn't think that was okay, and asked how he thought I was supposed to be okay with this. He apologized but he's going anyways. I knew they still talked sometimes which I honestly am not okay with in the first place because he doesn't tell me about it, but I was shocked when he said this. It's not that I believe he will cheat on me when he's there, it's that I don't understand how someone can have those kinds of boundaries. Yes, we have discussed this before and he knows how I feel. 


Am I wrong to feel completely disrespected by this? I honestly don't even know what I'm supposed to say to him anymore, I'm just so upset. I don't understand why this is necessary and I especially don't understand why he thinks it's an appropriate thing to do. 


TL;DR: my best friend/boyfriend and his ex apparently ""aren't in a good place"" so they're off to her cabin alone together. I feel like shit. "

Hi. Something happened last night, and it got me thinking. Usually, me (M27)and my girlfriend(W29)always scare eachother for fun. However, last night it did not end well.

We recently bought a house. She hid upstairs in the office room.. I went in there to grab a book, and had no idea she was in there, hiding in the dark behind the door.

She scared the sh*t out of me. For about two seconds my instinct kicked in, I yelled like a f'ing gorilla and grabbed her pretty hard. I didn't realise it was her, I hands down thought I had an intruder in my house.

Needless to say, she didn't take it well. She started crying, and now she seems so.. distant.

Have anybody been in a similar situation? Any advice? It feels like she is afraid of me now.. which of course, she don't need to be..

28,"My girlfriend [20/F] is refusing to let me [20/M] see her while she’s in the ICU


My girlfriend and I are high school sweethearts. We started to date when we were 15, but ended up going to college on opposite ends of the country. It’s been a little rough, but we text and talk on the phone all the time so we’re in touch a lot. I love talking to her, she’s just so sweet and smart. I’ve always known her to be a bit overly honest, very up front with how she feels and never afraid of anything. In short, my girlfriend is the best.

A few days ago, she told me she’d been running a fever and was generally feeling really under the weather. I asked her to go see a doctor since she was just feeling worse and worse. My girlfriend told me she didn’t want to, since she’s always been a little bit afraid of doctors. Eventually, her roommate took her to the ER since her fever was really high. She was texting me from the hospital, saying she was being admitted and all. I told her I wanted to come see her and was looking at tickets, but she told me not to spend the money. I told her that it was important for me to be with her, but she insisted, so I didn’t push, especially not with her being so sick. We’ve been talking over the phone, mostly, since she’s been too weak to keep up a text conversation very long.

Earlier today, she was admitted to the ICU. Her mom called me to tell me, and also said that the doctors don’t know what’s happening. They’ve been trying to treat her but it’s been ineffective. I got on the phone with her for a little bit, and told her I was really worried and wanted to come see her. My girlfriend said she didn’t want me to come, and when I tried to push it, she told me she wasn’t up for arguing but she didn’t want me coming.

I want to respect her wishes 100%, but I’m getting scared. She could *die*, and I’d be across the country not knowing what’s going on and never getting to see her again or say a real goodbye. I don’t want to be a pessimist, but it’s a real possibility. The doctors could never figure this out, and she could die! And I’d never see her! And even if she doesn’t die, I want to be able to see her. I want to take care of her, do my share to help out and make sure she’s okay. I want to support her through this. Do I just book a ticket and go on my own? What do I do?

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn’t want me to see her while she’s in the ICU."

31,"I [21F] made an advance towards my friend [18M] and he freaked out. Was my approach too aggressive, and did I lose my chance with him?


I've known my friend for around a decade. His parents are close friends with mine, so he comes over to visit occasionally (I still live with my parents). I was certain that he liked me back from all the flirting I did weeks prior, but I knew he'd never ask me out because he's so awkwardly shy (in a cute way).

His parents came over for dinner yesterday, and he was with them. I invited him into my bedroom and we talked for a bit about university. I was flirting with him the whole time, touching his arm, smiling etc, and he was responding positively to everything so I decided to make a move on him by giving him a kiss.

He happily received my kiss, but when I pulled away he freaked out and looked really nervous. He wanted to say something to me but he couldn't get the words out of his mouth, and he left my room afterwards. He avoided eye contact with me when all of us were eating dinner together, and it was pretty awkward between us for the rest of the time he was there.

I sent him a text that said I enjoyed the kiss and would like to explore a relationship with him, but he left me on read and hasn't replied back in a day.

I feel like I fucked up big time. I've always been upfront to guys, and they usually like that but I probably should've changed my approach towards him because he's never had a girlfriend, or kissed a girl before (except me). I ruined my chance to be with him, and I guess our friendship because of how aggressive I was.

How do I navigate this situation? Our families are going to the beach this weekend, and I was hoping if things went well yesterday we could've used that time to go on a date, but now things are going to be so awkward between us.

32,"My[45M] wife[45F] has been having nightmares for about a couple of weeks - something happened last night and I don't know how to help her deal with her issues.


I have been married to my wife Anna for little over 20 years now and we have two kids. Two sons aged 18 and 15. My wife and I have what I consider to be the perfect marriage. Honestly, this is maybe the first issue I ever have with my wife. She is the most caring and loving human being on this planet and I love her to death, but my God, she can be stubborn sometimes. 


Now to my problem. I still have no idea what happened to her. Ever since these last two weeks, she has been having troubles sleeping. She is having nightmares to be precise. I could hear her quietly sobbing at night, waking up in the middle of the night, hyperventilating. I would try talking to her but she would just shrug it off and tell me she had a bad dream and that's it. I didn't really pay too much attention to this since in the morning, Anna would look and act much better and I didn't feel the need to push her. 

But last night she scared the fuck out of me. I was asleep when I heard her screaming in her sleep. I woke up and saw her crying. She almost immediately hugged me and I tried talking to her, asking her what happened. She wouldn't say anything, she was just hugging me. I calmed her down and I managed to fall asleep. 

I wake up again to go to the bathroom and I see that my wife is not in our bed. I walk in the living room and I see Anna on the floor, her head in her knees and I can hear her crying. Again, I approach her gently and try talking to her but again she doesn't say anything. She is just crying quietly and doesn't say a word. I manage to get her to come to bed with me and I spent the remaining of the night trying to get her to talk to me. But nothing. She was just quiet and basically non-existent. 

Nothing changed in morning. She talks to me now but she tries her best to avoid the topic. She keeps telling me she is fine and that it was just a bad dream she had that spooked her. But I know my wife. And I know when she is lying to me. And that's what she is doing this right now. Hell, our son even asked me what's going on with his mom. He heard her screaming last night and he is worried. And I don't know what to say to him because even I have no idea what's going on. 

Obviously, something triggered those nightmares since like I've said this started happening in the last couple of weeks. I am worried about my wife and I don't know how to reach out to her right now. She doesn't want to talk about what happened and I don't know how to help her if she doesn't let me. Any suggestions on how to reach out to someone who doesn't want to be reached? 


tl;dr my wife has been having nightmares in the past couple of weeks with the most frightening experience happening last night. She was screaming in her sleep and was non-responsive for most of the night. Now she doesn't want to talk about it tries to brush everything off but I am worried for her and I don't know how to reach out to her and help her.

My husband “Josh” and I have been together for five years, married for two, and have a five-month-old child together. He is my best friend and we split everything 50-50. We have always had great communication and rarely fight.

After my daughter was born my body still hasn’t gone back to normal and I now have acne for the first time in my life. I have a pimple near my mouth that’s almost gone and healed. He thinks it’s herpes. I’ve tried to explain to him that my body just isn’t what it used to be and that it will take about a year to adjust back to my former self.

He’s been ignoring me then making comments about me cheating for the last 24 hours. I sat down and talked to him this morning before we left for work and I explained to him again about my terrible skin. He is visibly upset and doesn’t believe me. I don’t know how to navigate this or “prove“ that I’m not cheating. I’ve offered for him to go through my phone and computer as well as social media, he has all of my passwords to email and everything anyway. 

Reddit, I know if Josh posted in this sub and it was the other way around, everyone would probably say I’m cheating. Seriously though, I love and respect this man, I work 50 hour weeks as well as do 50% of the child rearing, I’m too tired to even notice other men; never mind cheat. How can I get through to Josh?

35,"My [26F] husband [29M] has started avoiding me, lashing out, and listing all the things he doesn't like about me now that we have a 7 month old baby.


This requires a lot of backstory, but I'll try to keep it short. My husband, ""Tom"", and I have been together for eight years and married for one. We have a seven month old son from an unplanned but very much wanted pregnancy. We were both very young when we got together, so our relationship has been through a lot, but it's always been strong and the past few years have been especially excellent and a lot of fun. But the past three months have been completely different. 

I am the primary breadwinner in our family. I took eight weeks off for maternity leave, but Tom is in law school, so I have to work 45hr+ a week to cover bills/childcare/etc. I love my job and love working, but I'm completely exhausted 100% of the time. I have become responsible for basically all of the childcare and all of the housework because Tom thinks that being in law school removes any responsibility he has toward his household and family. This means that I take the baby to and from daycare every day, get him ready to go, keep my house clean, take care of our animals, pay our bills, do our grocery shopping, cook, and work a high stress job on my feet 45-50 hours a week, all on about 5 hours of sleep. I know this is pretty normal, but I'm running on empty at the end of most days. 

In the meantime, Tom has started spending more and more time away from the house. He is in class anywhere from 1-4 hours a day and usually spend 1-2 hours a day in the library studying. He also spends about 2 hours a day at the gym. For the first few months of our baby's life, this was great. We were both out of the house for about 8-10 hours a day and got to spend our evenings together and with the baby. We were both exhausted, but happy. 

Now, on top of his usual time commitments, he's joined a rec volleyball league with his law school classmates that takes up 3-4 hours multiple nights a week, has started staying out extremely late at night and even spending the night at his friends' houses, and staying away for long periods of time on the weekends (15-16 hours at a time). 

Several weeks ago, my son had RSV and I had to take 2 days off work to be with him. He was miserable, sick as a dog, and we were both exhausted, yet Tom didn't come home until 11 one night (Thursday) and after midnight the next (Friday) despite knowing how sick we both were. That Saturday, he went to campus at 8 am to work on a paper and ended up not coming home until the next morning. He only stayed home for an hour before going back out again to take my son on a walk with his law school BFF, ""Jenny"" and her dog (and let me tell you, I have literally not had one moment of jealousy over the past 8 years, but it doesn't help that his law school BFF is a tall, gorgeous blonde girl who he spends basically all his free time with or talking to). He doesn't use any free time to help me with anything around the house, instead doing things like going on a hike with Jenny or going with her to the mall. 

Finally, about a week ago, when he came home 4 hours after he was supposed to, I told him we needed to talk. He was clearly expecting it. After I told him that it seemed like he wasn't interested in spending any time with me or talking to me anymore, he basically agreed and said that he wasn't happy and that he hadn't been for several months. That he was worried we hadn't been happy before I got pregnant and that we never should have gotten married because I'm a different person now than I was before I had the baby.

He said over and over again that I'm not a fun and happy person, and that I don't like doing anything because I usually just prefer to come home after work, put the baby to bed, and have a class of wine and watch Netflix while I clean the house. He said he can't motivate me to do anything like go to the gym (I go for walks several times a week and I'm on my feet literally all day at work, I'm still trying to work the gym into my schedule but it's taking a backseat right now), and that I don't ""lift him up"" (WTF....) or motivate him, because he constantly needs someone on his ass pressuring him to do stuff or he won't get it done. 

He said he no longer enjoys talking to me, because I just snap at anyone who doesn't agree with me, and that no one else likes talking to me either. He said that he's miserable every time he has to be with me alone at our house. Essentially, he gave me a list of conditions that I need to meet in order to be the wife that he wants me to be and to have the personality he wants me to have. 

To top it off, he told me he hated how much I like my job because he thinks I prioritize it over him, despite the fact that I helped build my company from the ground up and have taken a huge step back from the operation to focus more on our family. Even though I earn the income, his potential to earn more income means that law school is currently more important than my actual work. 

After this tirade, I had essentially nothing to say. I was shocked by almost all of this. Even at our worst moments, I felt like our relationship was bound together by our love and respect for each other. We have always been each other's best friend, have always had so much to talk about, and have been there for each other through enormous ups and downs. I mean, literally, this was my SO of 8 years telling me he basically hated everything about me with almost no warning. He said he thought we should try therapy, but I couldn't even think about it at the time. 

Our 1 year anniversary was a few days later (good timing), and we'd already planned an overnight trip a few hours away. We decided to go anyway, just to see how it went, and before we left, he gave me a gorgeous pair of sapphire earrings and a few framed photos as a gift. It, and the rest of the weekend, felt like such a freaking joke since all I could do was replay our conversation over and over in my head. And now he's giving me earrings?? Like wtf?? Things are all better now because you got all that off your chest?? The past few days have been the exact same - him acting like nothing is wrong and me feeling like I don't even know or recognize him, and feeling very uncomfortable when we're alone. The whole weekend felt like  a stunt - like I had to perform in a certain way to make sure he didn't get bored or frustrated with me. 

The thing is, I know I am none of those things. I know I'm not boring, or sad, or unmotivated, or a bad wife. Even if he says it a thousand times. I like myself, and a lot of other people like me too, and I'm not interested in changing that. But now I don't know what to do. I was so depressed at first after our talk, then I was angry, but now I just feel numb. The thought of going to therapy with him makes me sick. I can't imagine trying to work things out. But maybe I need to be more understanding of where he's coming from and why he's feeling how he's feeling. Please help me understand things from his point of view, or at least help me gain some perspective on where things should go from here?

36,"I [23F] recently broke up with my boyfriend [26M] of three years and he wants a detailed reason, but I don’t think he will understand or accept them. How can I do this so it’s productive and doesn’t hurt him?


Long story short, I was with my boyfriend for about 3 years and we were living together for nearly all of that time. Sometime around the last 6 months I’d become really unhappy and finally decided to leave him about two weeks ago.


He wants an explanation, which I completely respect, but I don’t want the conversation to be a huge list of things I don’t like about him (many of which he doesn’t understand or see in himself). I still care about him a lot so my goal is to be able to communicate these things in a way that can give him some closure and insight without making him feel like an awful person or have a huge disagreement about our interpretations of events.


Among them are things like: he’s rude and impatient with his friends, arguments get blown way out of proportion because he’s extremely emotional, he didn’t want to spend time with my family, alcohol would make him really angry and he took it out on me verbally, our conversations often centered around people/events and not ideas, he didn’t have a career direction or goals he was working towards, he didn’t like me spending time with my male friends alone but also didn’t want to get to know them.


To be clear, many of these things (particularly the lack of goal direction or struggles with alcohol) are things I do not judge him for. They are simply characteristics that - when combined with everything else - are facets I do not want in a partner.


**TL;DR** My ex wants an explanation for why I left him, but the reasons are primarily character issues that he doesn't see in himself and I don’t know how to explain them to him in a way that gives him closure, doesn’t cause an extreme amount of pain, and makes sense to him."
37,"My boyfriend(26M) of 8 months got mad at me(20F) for cutting my hair.


So, some background on this, my boyfriend(26M) and I(20F) have been together about eight months. Before him, I was in a very emotionally abusive relationship for over two years with a man who was much, much older than myself. Boyfriend has been very seemingly understanding towards the situation and does his best to let me have my freedom and work with me on things.


However, my boyfriend is also heavily involved in the music scene from our city. He has a relatively big following, and therefore he tends to be mildly obsessed with looks and appearances more than I am able to understand, though I am currently attending a school where they push you to look your best anyway, so this never bothered me. 


I just recently actively started to grow my hair out, so anyone touching my hair or cutting it makes me super nervous, but I am a cosmetology student, and I like to keep my hair blond. When I first started school, I was admittedly neglectful of my hair, especially considering how often I lighten it, one of my teachers and I have been slowly trimming away the damaged hair as I grow it out, so I can get rid of the bad without having to cut it all off at once. 


Yesterday, my teacher convinced me to cut off what was left of my damaged hair (about two inches). After she was done I instantly regretted it, I feel like I have set myself back as far as my hair growth goes, didn't say a word about it to my boyfriend, assuming he would only notice if I were to mention it. 


Later that night we were hanging out. It was sweet, and I was happy to spend time with him. We were cuddling, not really saying anything, when he suddenly starts saying things like ""Don't ever cut your hair again"", ""That was so stupid of you"", ""Why do you try to keep it so short?"", and my favorite ""You were doing so well..."". 


He kept harping on it too, every time the conversation would change slightly, he would circle it back around to how horrible it was for me to have cut my hair. Even me trying to explain why I was cutting my hair was useless, and he would argue that I didn't /have/ to cut off the damaged parts of my hair. Cutting it was avoidable. This made me feel a bit weird. I am not mad that he said this, just taken aback that he would approach the situation as such, knowing how my ex was with me. I hate that I cut my hair, but now that he’s said something I have started to get really upset over it, and I really wish I would have just left it alone.


Eventually I was able to politely, yet firmly, tell him that I was over the conversation and he needed to shut up (not in those words, though). I just really do not know what to do. My entire view of relationships is jaded because I have only ever been in one other real relationship, and it was a very poor example of how one should work. This is the first time anything like this has happened, and I don't know how to feel or react towards it at all. There haven't really been any other red flags, and the relationship is wonderful otherwise. What do I do from here? Should I bring it up again and affirm how I feel about it? Do I ignore it and look for more red flags? What do I do if/when I find them? Thank you in advance, like I said before I don't know how to relationship very well, so any advice is appreciated. 


tldr; Boyfriend gets mad when I cut my hair at school, and I don't know how to react.

38,"Best friend [26F] turned roommate has essentially moved her boyfriend [25M] in to our apartment. When is the line crossed?


I have not had a relationship in about three years, so sometimes I don't know what's normal and what's crossing a line. I live with my best friend, Hannah, and for the last two years - everything has been fine. But about three months ago, she started dating Tim. Tim is very nice, and I do like him a lot, but I don't want to live with him.

Tim has his own place, but sleeps here every night, hangs out here with her (both not employed) all day, showers here (taking up time and space in an already shared bathroom), does laundry here, and cooks here. So essentially, he lives here. It's Hannah's place too, and I'm totally fine with her having him over a lot.... But this is too much. I think that he should pay bills. I brought this up, and she said that he couldn't afford bills at two places and that since he doesn't have his own key, then he's not living here really.

I don't know. She thinks because I don't have a lot of relationship experience that I am either jealous or just non understanding of the situation.

So, I guess I'm just looking for input. How much time should a significant other stay over? Should I insist be pays bills or just suck it up until the lease ends?

Tl;dr; roommate's boyfriend has seemingly moved in and I don't know what to do

Edit: Got back from work to so many valuable comments and advice! Thanks everyone! Will definitely be sitting down for a conversation with Hannah this week. "
39,"My husband (27M) of 2 years refuses to add me (26F) on social media.


My husband and i have been married a little over 2 years. He made a new facebook account shortly before we got married, he was locked out of his old one. I sent him a friend request for his new account, and 2+ years later he still hasnt responded to it.

When I first questioned him about it, he said he never gets on and that he hadnt even seen it. That seemed like a reasonable excuse, especially since i don't spend much time on mine either. 

A few months go by, i notice he still hasnt accepted my request. I ask him about it again, and he shrugs it off, not really giving me an answer. At this point im not sure how to proceed..i mean on one hand it feels silly to get upset over it, because at the end of the day its just facebook. But on the other hand..im his wife, his partner...wouldnt that be one of the first people you add on social media? Especially since hes friends with his brother, his cousin, his grandma..

But he is also friends with a TON of women. Out of about 2000 friends, i would say 95% are girls. I only recognize a few. I tried to talk to him about this as well, and he says there ""aren't that many girls"" and asked ""why does it even matter?""

This is all concerning because in the past, before we got married, i have caught him messaging girls on facebook. When i caught him he said he was doing it because he was bored, and he apologized profusely and promised it wouldnt happen again. Now im feeling stupid for believing him.

Im not sure how to handle this now. I have no evidence of him messaging girls, but i have a feeling he very well could be. I know he has been spending more time on FB because he often tells me about things he reads on there. So....what to do?

Tl;dr my husband wont accept my friend request on facebook, but he is friends with a lot of women. He has been caught messaging women in the past, but as of now i have no evidence that he is. Advice? "

41,"My (16f) mom (32) keeps bringing random men to our house and it makes me feel unsafe


PLEASE DON'T THINK I'M SEXIST, I SAY MEN BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES SHE BRINGS IN AND OUT!

My mom brings a lot of random guys to the house like every week. Sometimes they just play cards on the kitchen table or they just come to hang out. Some even spend the night and I'm just like... Really? I honestly don't care about who my mom hangs out with but I don't like her bringing them to our personal house. Where they could come back and break in, kidnap, or anything! 

Many of them are really weird too. A lot of them keep commenting on my looks which isn't really ""weird"" but I found them inappropriate. I've told her that I don't feel safe with her bringing these men in and out because they could come back and do anything plus if I die or go missing it'll be her fault. But she told me that I need to ""stay in a child's place,"" mind my own business and ""stop being so overdramatic.""

I'm sick of this. There's been men falling asleep on MY bed or MY floor. My mom would send them through my MY room to use MY bathroom when the other ones were taken up. They would literally just bust in my door and say ""your mom told me to use your bathroom, the other ones are taken up."" No knock. No nothing. Just barge right in. It's rude and I'm sick of it. 

My dad lives in another state, but if he were closer I would definitely call him to get me. Plus, his house is already full of people. My Grandma lives in a retirement home. So, I don't really have any other family members that I'm close with.

What now? 

Tl;Dr: My mom repeatedly brings men in and out of the house with no regard to my well being. I've told her that it makes me feel unsafe and she doesn't care."
42,"My [32F] SIL [27F] found a language tutor for our daughter [8F]. I am a native-speaker and the tutor's accent is not great. SIL is offended we are turning her down. What to do next?


So this is a pretty thorny issue. My husband and I [30s] have been looking for a good tutor for our daughter. I am Chinese and my husband is American. We really want our daughter to learn Chinese from an early age so we've been shopping for a good tutor. 

Here's the issue. My SIL is usually very outgoing and helpful and she approached my husband a last week with a ""surprise."" Apparently a coworker of hers is Chinese as well and her elderly mom wanted to find a part-time job. My SIL perked up and suggested the mom become my daughter's Chinese tutor. She arranged everything and basically told the mom ahead of time that she'll get the job because SIL knew husband and I haven't found a tutor yet. SIL figures it'll be a perfect match for us because her coworker lives only ~10min away and the mom has lots of free time during the day. 

My husband and I discussed it and we agreed to meet the mom and have an informal interview. SIL must have misread this and thought we were officially hiring her. Well we all met one day and I started chatting to the mom in standard Mandarin. Turns out SIL's coworker's family is from a VERY rural part of China and the mom's accent is nearly unintelligible to me. On top of that she's barely literate too (claims she only went to school until she was 12). Well it was a definite no-go for me but my husband was a bit caught because of my SIL. 

We eventually approached SIL and told her thanks for her help but we want to find a tutor ourselves and SIL got VERY offended. She asked me what my problem was, and I was direct and told her I didn't understand the mom and I wanted another tutor for my daughter. SIL asked me if it was just a dialect I wasn't familiar with and I said it's possible, but I also want my daughter to speak the same as me and I'd prefer a professional. SIL then became uncharacteristically annoyed and kind of passive aggressively suggested that I was being overly elitist and choosy. 

Now my husband has told me he agrees with me but he wants me to find a common ground with his sister. I don't really know how to. I don't want her coworker's mom to be teaching my daughter anything quite frankly but obviously I appreciated her gesture and told her so. SIL has been very vocally angry with us and has even turned her parents against her too in this whole mess. They don't understand how drastically different the accents can be, and seem to assume that I'm turning down SIL's tutor just because she has a slight ""twang"" or whatever (like someone turning down an English tutor with a slight southern accent.) This obviously paints me as some horribly elitist, snooty person who won't even help out an elderly woman in need of extra cash.

I don't know what to say or do now to resolve this?

------

**tldr**: Husband and I were looking for a Chinese tutor for our daughter. SIL brought us her coworker's mom who speaks in a very strong accent. I told SIL we want to find someone else but SIL is now very offended and accuses me of elitism. What can we do?"

44,"My wife [32F] doesn't want to go back to work yet, but my [35M] current job is killing me. How to compromise?


We have a 3 year old daughter and my MIL is currently living with us and helping with childcare. My wife was initially supposed to go back to work after her maternity leave, but found it difficult to after the baby was born. We agreed that she would take 2 full years off and focus on the baby and herself. In order to finance all of this, I switched to a high-pressure position that has great pay but absolute shit hours. I had other plans for my career but now we've been in a holding pattern since bills must be paid. 

Well our daughter is 3 and a half now and wife and I have been revisiting this issue again. I pretty much laid it all out for her, telling her that my current job is making me desperately unhappy, tired, and resentful of the fact that I never even get to see my own daughter during the week. I leave for work at 6:30 (before she wakes) and I get home after 8 always. My bosses are the type of people who'd work until midnight, and they expect the same from me since I've ""chosen"" this career path. Every morning I wake up dreading the day and every night I sleep dreading the next day. 

I am absolutely miserable and I don't think my wife even cares that much. I've approached the issue of her going back to work sometime soon but she either gets upset or brushes me off and shows no intention of looking. I don't know what else to do. I've suggested moving companies and she gets upset, telling me that I'd be singlehandedly putting our whole family at risk for no reason. She keep saying she wants to compromise but I can't leave my job. I don't see what the compromise is... What can I do at this point? How can I get through to her? 

I feel like I'm drowning but no one cares. My MIL is in the picture too which makes it more difficult. Every time I talk to my wife about my job concerns, she breaks down and starts crying or shakes her head and walks away, then my MIL sees and accuses me of saying hurtful things to my wife. It's like I'm trapped in this loop with nowhere to go.

Obligatory throw away since my husband and family know my main account.

So, I met my husband, Jared, 3 years ago when I moved to this state for work. We hit it off immediately, began dating, and recently got married in October. Our relationship has been nothing short of amazing (until certain events, I'll get there). He's kind, he's funny, he's loving, he gets along so well with my family. We rescue dogs together, own our own home, and WERE financially stable. I'm well aware there may be concern over our age gap, however it has never been an issue; we are both very sound in our careers, lifestyles, and future goals.

On to the problem. A month before our wedding, Jared was complaining of headaches. I finally took him to the ER and they found a mass on his brain and a hole in his skull. He was in ICU for a few days before being transferred for surgery. Without getting into too many details, it was NOT cancerous, just a condition that requires many surgeries, lots of money, and so much fighting with his insurance company.

Jared's surgeon recommended we wait until after our wedding (beginning of October) to have the surgery. We talked it over and thought it best that we postpone the wedding and just focus on getting him better-- I saw absolutely nothing wrong with that. It wasn't a huge wedding, we did have some out of country travelers, but everybody understood. Unfortunately, when Jared brought this up to his mother, she adamantly shut him down and stated we'd be having the wedding as planned (keep in mind, this woman maybe put 120 bucks towards the wedding, no big deal, but she had no leg to stand on refusing our decision). Jared is the type to go along with what she says/does, so we stuck to our original plans and scheduled his surgery a week after the wedding, not even.

I loved our wedding, but I also hated it. It was supposed to be the happiest time of my life, and honestly I was more concerned whether my husband was going to die, if it was cancer, what was going to happen, etc. My anxiety was through the roof, I was worried he'd get sick during the wedding, all-in-all, I wish it had been postponed. I wish it almost every day. Not because I didn't want to get married to him, but because I didn't get to enjoy it the way I really wanted to. It was ""let's get this obstacle out of the way so we can get you into surgery.""

So we get him into surgery, everything turns out okay (non-cancerous) but we have at least 3-4 surgeries to take out all of the mass, heal the tissue over his brain, then fix the hole in his skull (if you're curious what it is just because it sounds odd, message me and I'll explain). Anyway, this brings me to now, six months later.

I'm exhausted. I have spent most of my time as a newlywed taking care of him post surgeries. Taking care of him when he's sick, tired, in pain, etc. I spend time on the phone with bill collectors, his doctors, surgery centers, and unfortunately his insurance. We are in so much medical debt because his shitty insurance decided most of his doctors and surgeon are out of network because he decided to travel two hours south to one of the best neurosurgery places in the country. I am fighting a battle almost every day, doing appeals, figuring out payment plans, counting every penny we have. Before this, we were so comfortable financially. We could take weekend trips, buy ourselves nice things, put money away, etc. Now we're wondering how we're going to make it through this.

I know this is long, bear with me. The stress of everything has caught up to this once stoic, strong man. He's irritable, he's tired, he's impatient. He comes home from work and I can tell he's in a very sour mood. He nitpicks at almost everything I do. Few examples:

*Last week I was having a really off day. A bad migraine and my blood pressure was really up. I still had to go out and do something at work quick and Jared asked me prior if I'd get some fast food for him. Before I left, he saw I was in bad shape and told me not to worry about it, he'd make a salad or something. So I went and did my thing at work and decided I'd ""surprise"" him by going to the store and getting him fresh veggies, croutons, etc for his salad. I got home and he was so disappointed and told me ""I didn't want any of this. I was just throwing things out."" Then he remained mad at me for a few hours.

*He's been quick to saying mean things lately. A few weeks back he said if it wasn't for him, I'd be in a ditch somewhere.

*When I bring anything up that bothers me in our communication, he's quick to say ""stop the garbage that's coming from your mouth hole."" That or he will call me silly, dramatic, miserable, or that I've gone off the deep end.

*Last week my Grandpa passed. It was around 8 at night and my mom skyped me (she's in a different country) and broke the news. I was just about to go lay down at the time when she called me, so of course I stayed up for about 1.5 hours talking to her about my Grandpa, our memories, and what's next. While I was talking to her, Jared texts me asking what I was doing and why I wasn't in bed. I explained that my grandpa had finally passed, I was just talking to my mom. He didn't reply. When I finally went to bed, he was pissed that I didn't take the time to walk into the room to tell him I'd be on the phone for awhile. I didn't even think to do that, I just lost my Grandpa. Not only that, but four weeks prior I lost my Grandma. 2 grandparents in one month, and he was so insensitive to not say ""I'm sorry for your loss."" In fact, I think he still has ignored it. He was just pissed I didn't let him know I'd be on the phone.

I understand this is one-sided, but I've been taking care of so much stuff the past six months, and yes maybe I'm emotional, but I'm not crazy. I'm not going off the deep-end. I'm just asking that he communicates better with me, pays attention to my needs, asks me how I'm doing every now and then. The only other people that ask how I am is my mom and 2 brothers. Everybody else, including his miserable family, push me aside, tell me I'm not doing enough, my house isn't big enough, my yard is a mess, my floors are dirty, etc.

He is so quick to shut me down every time I bring something up, so I mentioned marriage counseling. He finally agreed to it, then backed out last minute saying he's not ready. I tried explaining to him that I wanted to do counseling together because I think that we've had so much on our plate since being married that having another person to talk to us and walk us through our feelings could significantly help us progress together. (Note: he has been married before, but she cheated on him and became addicted to drugs. I can confirm this as I've seen and met her by accident. It crushed him for a long time, and he became a bit wary of opening up to someone else).

The straw that broke the camel's back was him coming home today and venting for 20 minutes about work-- alone that's not a bad thing, but I just started a new, better paid job today and he forgot or just didn't care. I brought it up to him later in the evening and he got mad at me saying he did care but work was crazy. I said I just wish you'd communicate better and remember these things. He said I was miserable, to just leave if I don't want to deal with this.

Sorry if my whole post is a jumbled mess, I'm sure it is. It's so hard to put everything down in writing when there's just so much stuff going on. I'm just tired. We haven't had the time to be newlyweds. I went from marrying this amazing person, to him changing within days because of his first surgery. He still has so many amazing, beautiful qualities, but when we fight/argue, it's bad. I get upset because I'm not heard, he gets upset because I'm being dramatic. I just want common ground.

Now I'm sitting on the couch where I'll admit I've slept on quite a few times over the past few weeks since his 2nd surgery. Have I mentioned I'm tired? Probably like 80 times. I finally found the time to schedule with my therapist this week, I really look forward to that. I just figured I'd make my first post on here and see how many people tell me to divorce him, LOL. I truly don't want to, he is everything to me. I just can't tell if this is true colors shining, or just being so, so, so down in our luck right now. I guess my question is, what do I do? Where do I go from here? Does anyone else have any advice on what to do to get through this? 

I think I'm done now, I'm going to go cry my brains out while I try processing everything I wrote down but haven't told anyone yet. I appreciate everything in advance, fellow redditors. Thank you so much.

54,"My [24F] roommate [23F] is pissed off at me for calling her parents when she didn't come home for 5 days


I'll preface this by saying we have been living together for about 9 months now, and friends for almost 2 years. We have always shared openly about our lives and relationships and have never had tension or fought about anything before. 

I feel I should recount events in chronological order to make it clear why I was worried about her in the first place, but see the TLDR at the bottom for the short version.

Sat, Mar 24: Roommate breaks up with her boyfriend [42M] after he falsely accuses her of cheating with the evidence being he heard a male voice over the phone after she forgot to hang up and she sounded happy (she told me she had just got home and the neighbor came over with his dog). He says many awful things to her, including ""no one will ever love you as much as I do""

Following this incident, she asks for my opinion and I tell her that I think breaking up was the right thing to do and that based on what he said he may have grown to be emotionally abusive and controlling in their relationship. She says she will stay out of contact with him for at least a month, when they will then talk again to discuss him paying back money he owes her. Everything seems fine so far.

Fri, Mar 30: My boyfriend is over staying up late playing video games after I go to bed. He sees her let her ""ex"" boyfriend into the apartment around 4am. Doesn't ask questions.

Sat, Mar 31: I see my roommate in the morning where she divulges she has been 'weak' before running off to work. I didn't know until later that day that her boyfriend had come over, so when I found out I sent her a text telling her that even though I support her as a person, as a friend who cares about her I can't support her decision to be in contact with him again. She does not reply.

Sun, Apr 1: She has not come home (not super unusual as her parents live 30 mins away and she often spends nights there), but I text her saying I haven't heard from her and asking if she is doing alright. She has read receipts on and she did not read the message.

Mon, Apr 2: I call her in the evening, and the phone rings and goes to voicemail. I tell her I'm worried about her and asked her to let me know that she's ok. After no reply for 5 hours, I find her other close friend on Instagram and message her asking if she's heard from her. She says no, but that my roommate told her she was staying with her parents for Easter. She then texts my roommate and gets a short reply, seemingly unaware that anyone is worried about her, but when she calls, my roommate won't pick up the phone. She happens to be in the area, so she drives by my roommate's parent's house and sees that her car is not there. 

Tues, Apr 3: I finally get a text from my roommate saying she is ok and that she is at her parents house. I ask when she's coming home and all she says is whenever she is ""feeling better."" I ask if we can meet for dinner and talk but she says no. I talk with her other friend about it, because it doesn't sound like her texting. She always uses emojis and this time she typed out :/ and :(. Friend agrees that when she got texts they also didn't quite sound like her. At this point, I start to wonder if she is with her ex and he has taken her phone away. 

Wed, Apr 4: Morning, I call her dad to see if she's been home. He says no and thanks for calling him. Awhile later I hear from her mom, who after hearing the story and the text I sent, says I probably pissed her off by saying bad things about the relationship and discounts my concern that the guy is emotionally abusive, saying the things her said to her during the breakup were normal (I know that her parents strongly disapprove of this relationship so I was super confused by this seeming defense of the guy). Afternoon, the friend gives me the ex boyfriend's number and I call it. A mildly female voice answers and says they are Margery and don't seem to understand any of what I'm saying. To me it sounded like it could be the ex trying to sound like a female. I'm getting increasingly worried that he's holding her against her will. Around 5pm, I try calling her phone again and it goes straight to voicemail. Everyone I ask for advice is saying I have grounds to file a missing person's report. During this time another friend of mine is googling the guy and says that half the places his professional profiles say he's worked for have no record of him (magazine covers, for example, he is a model). I'm starting to be really worried that this guy has been lying about who he is. 

Around 7pm on Wednesday, my roommate calls me back. She tells me that she is very mad at me. Turns out she was already really mad at me for telling her that I thought the relationship was a bad idea (and I assume that's why she was ignoring me for so long). She also said she was very mad that I got her parents involved. She tells me that she is on vacation in florida with the guy and doesn't know when she'll be back. I ask what about work and she says she hasn't been scheduled in awhile (her mom says she was supposed to work on thursday). She tells me that she's sorry she ever shared details about her life with me and ""won't make that mistake again."" I'm in tears at this point as the culmination of the day's stress is released. She says I shouldn't have been worried, and ""there are a lot of things I don't know"" about her life. She then ends the conversation and tells me not to bother her. 

My question is this: was I in the right for getting her parents involved? Or was I overreacting to the situation? How should I interact with her when she finally comes home?

TLDR: My roommate was gone for 5 days, lied about where she was, and is mad that I called her parents and told them I thought she was missing. "

56,"My [25F] boyfriend’s [25M] mother [45] called me rude last night and wouldn’t stop.


Just FYI: We’ve been dating for four months but have known each other since we were 13. 

I guess I need to start with last week and how last week happened. So after we started dating my boyfriend suggested we take a spring break trip to Mount Rushmore. He told his mom about it and she decided to take everyone to this trip. My boyfriend’s siblings came, their significant others, their kids, the parents— EVERYONE. I wasn’t happy about this. This was supposed to be a trip for just us two. So last week, spring break, happened. We stopped in Nebraska first because he has two family members there. During that time with his family, I was feeling horrible for that day. I have social anxiety and I did not do well there. I was nervous. I was shaking. I cried. It was just too many new people for me. Especially when we ALL slept in the SAME bedroom floor. Yes you read that right. So when we went to South Dakota for Mount Rushmore, we avoided his family during the entire trip and met up with them one last time in Nebraska before driving back home. 

Last night I saw my boyfriend for he first time since the trip. We went to his place and his mom asked me what my problem is and why I acted so rude in front of their family. She kept going and kept going about me being rude and how that’s their only family members here in America because all their relatives are outside the country. I told her I have social anxiety and she told me to get used to being around them because they’re a big family. She just told me to get over it. I was hoping that my boyfriend would stop his mom last night but he didn’t.  So we left his house early and I could not stop crying. He said he thought it’d be worse. So this morning I told my boyfriend that I didn’t wanna go to his house anymore for at least a month. He said it’s whatever I want but that he doesn’t think it’ll make anything better. I just need advice as to what to do. I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for because I’m not sure what I’m feeling or thinking anymore. 

TL;DR My social anxiety caused me to seem rude to boyfriend’s mom and she came after me and told me to get over it and I’m so upset. 

Edit: Wow. Forgot to mention: his nieces, all under the age of 8, kept telling me how they hate me and how jealous they are of me being in a relationship with their uncle. Like, they were the meanest kids ever I swear. 

Edit: My boyfriend just texted me “I told my mom how wrong she was to say anything. She obviously doesn't admit she did anything wrong.” Oh boy. "
57,"My boyfriend (M, 27) and I (F, 27) are having problems concerning his female friend (F, 27)


TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend’s female friend is crossing some boundaries. Am I wrong to feel uncomfortable?

My boyfriend and I met in January of last year and started dating just a couple of weeks later. He’s my rock, my best bud, and we’re completely crazy about one another. My previous relationship lasted 7 years and was terribly unhealthy, but it taught me what I do &amp; don’t want in a partner. So I know without a doubt that I DO want what I have now. 

In the year and some change that we’ve been together, we’ve rarely argued - in fact, our arguments are just civilized discussions had with the utmost amount of respect for each other. However, the few times we’ve had these discussions, they’ve been about a female friend of his. Let’s call her Jane. 

I should say that my boyfriend’s two closest BFFs in his friend group are both women. They’re beautiful, funny, intelligent, and have grown to be my friends, too. I trust them and my boyfriend 100% &amp; have never gotten any kind of weird vibe. They’re wonderful. 

That said, Jane is not included in that friend group. In fact, my boyfriend’s BFFs can’t stand Jane. Here’s the story: Jane and my boyfriend went to high school together and had a small falling out senior year. They reconnected a few years later on a dating website as they were completing their undergraduate courses. They grew close again — except this time, my boyfriend developed feelings for her. She didn’t return his feelings, but (according to my boyfriend’s BFFs *and* my boyfriend himself) she did HEAVILY rely on him for all of the emotional support she wasn’t getting from her own unrequited interests. My boyfriend did meet other women during this time - he even dated one for six months - and he swears his feelings for Jane were over by then. But they did go on a road trip together while he was dating his ex — something the ex was understandably uncomfortable with. He and Jane had planned it months before he met her, though, so he felt obligated (and probably wanted to go on a road trip lol). 

Anyway, their friendship slowly started to fade from “see each other every day” status to “post memes on each other’s  walls” status while he was with his ex. Six months later (when we met), he described Jane to me as a person with whom he used to be close, but no longer shared similar interests. Then, she moved. 

I’d never met the girl, but after she moved and he and I got more serious, Jane added me on Facebook. Cool. She’d like/comment on every little thing I posted. Cool. She came to town and we met her for dinner. Cool. She was kind of weird during dinner (ex: she ran and JUMPED into his arms and held on for the longest five to ten seconds of my life like he was just coming back from war or some shit). That wasn’t so cool, but I can deal. 

She comes back into town a few weeks later, but I’m gone. She invited my boyfriend to dinner, but he doesn’t want to stay up that late (like 11pm). He didn’t tell me any of this until I happened to ask if she’d been in town a few days later. We have a little talk in which I express that I’m not entirely comfortable with the two of them having a late dinner alone. He totally understands. 

A few weeks later, Jane posts on my Facebook wall and tells me her mom saw my pic  “approves” of me. What?

Around Christmas, my boyfriend and I are shopping together when he suddenly takes a pic of something and sends it to someone on his phone. It was Jane, but he told me it was his male friend. He admitted to the Jane thing a few days later and told me he told the white lie because he didn’t want me to feel uncomfortable. He’s very apologetic and I understand where he’s coming from. I let it go because it was just a picture of a stupid card &amp; I trust his intentions. 

Christmas night, my boyfriend and I are on a romantic getaway. Suddenly his phone buzzes. It’s a heart emoji from Jane, followed up by a “I wish I could have seen you while I was in town for Christmas” and “You and jlibby18 look really happy.” He shows me the texts, sends a short, respectful response. Done. 

Since January, Jane has been sending him red hearts, “ily” messages, random pictures of the two of them from years past, etc. He has been largely unresponsive because he knows that I don’t quite trust her intentions, plus he and his BFFs find her behavior odd as well. She confronted him about his unresponsiveness yesterday with a “are we okay” text. He told me about this tonight and was super vague about the details of the discussion. I asked why he was being so vague, and he showed me the full text convo. 

He basically told her he wasn’t comfortable with the hearts and “ily” and random photos and stuff like that now that he’s in a serious relationship. She got super defensive, said I was threatened by/jealous of her, insisted she didn’t know what the big deal was. Then, he totally backed down. Said it was actually just a problem that I had with her due to my own jealousy, problems from my last relationship, and wariness due to his lack of being completely honest with me (the mall incident). She responded by telling him how she wants to be close to him, he’s her friend, that’s why she does what she does, and said the whole thing made her feel “physically and emotionally ill.” Then they started joking around like nothing had happened. 

I was super upset when I read what he said. I felt he painted me as the jealous girlfriend (though he didn’t use any harsh words or say anything outright negative about me). I don’t think my previous relationship is any of her business, and it concerns me that she seemingly refuses to try and put herself in my shoes. I don’t see her as a “friend.” I see her as an unrequited love interest from years ago who still expects that my boyfriend provide her with the emotional support that he did a few years ago.

He was super apologetic. Cried. Said he didn’t want to lose me and would talk to her and explain that his relationship with me is too important to continue letting her have this weird space in his life. 

I believe him. He’s the kindest person I’ve ever met, and he shows me every day that he truly loves me. He doesn’t like confrontation, which is no doubt the reason he tied to smooth things over with Jane the moment she got upset. We talked for two hours, and he never once raised his voice or got defensive. He listened and understood. I told him I would never ask him to give up a friendship for me, but that I wanted him to set clear boundaries with her. He insisted that the best course of action would be to end the friendship all-together, as he wants to be with me and make sure I know he loves me “without reservation.” 


I’m worried. I don’t want him to resent me years down the road for ruining this friendship. He promises that won’t be the case, and keeps validating my feelings about the situation.

Reddit, what do you think? Am I overreacting, or is something a little off about Jane? Have I ruined my (otherwise extremely healthy and fulfilling) relationship by allowing myself to feel inferior? 
"
58,"My partner (34m) gets so angry with me that he screams and throws things, how do I (28f) handle these outbursts in a mature way?


My boyfriend is a good guy with a kind heart, he is a feminist, loves animals, is basically my dream guy.  We have a ton in common and typically get along well.  Most of the time I would say he’s my best friend.  Except there’s one thing that’s really difficult for me in our relationship.  When he gets angry, it’s like he becomes an entirely different person.  He is rude, sarcastic, irrational and just vicious.  The kind man that I love is gone.  It’s like a Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde type thing.  And the problem is . . . he gets angry fairly often.  Usually over something that I didn’t know would piss him off or didn’t think anything of, like asking a question.  

Conflict resolution is difficult because he talks over me, yells/screams at me until I stop talking, and responds to anything I say with, “If I’m so horrible, why are you with me?” etc.  (For example, if I say, “It really scares me when you yell at me,” he’ll say “Why are you with me, then?”)  Or he suggests that we break up.  It makes me feel like he is not actually committed to the relationship if any little everyday conflict is gonna make him threaten to break it off.  It’s also difficult for me at times because I was in an emotionally abusive relationship when I was younger and experienced verbal abuse as a child that makes me very sensitive to aggression and yelling (which he is very aware of) and his behavior sometimes triggers me to have panic attacks.  

It confuses me deeply because most of the time he is a genuinely likeable and nice person.  When he is not in that angry mood, he typically acknowledges that his behavior sucked and apologizes.  He is currently doing a self-directed anger management course and when he is in normal mode, he praises me for my kindness and patience toward him while he is trying to grow.  But even with the course, about once a week he totally loses it on me, yells, uses sarcasm and contempt, gets really aggressive toward me, twists my words and talks me around in circles until I just don't know which way is up, basically does anything he can to derail what I’m saying.  When all I’m doing is trying to resolve whatever conflict is happening so we can get back to being happy.  It’s emotionally exhausting always being the one trying to work things out while he just wants to fight me to the death.

I don’t understand why he does not seem to respect me.  He says often that I am his best friend, he wants to marry me, stuff like that.  But I don’t get why he acts those ways if he genuinely loves me and wants to get married, because I feel like a couple that can’t even successfully handle tiny everyday conflicts is not ready for the difficulties of marriage.  He got angry when I told him that and we were not able to discuss it.  

I know everyone is gonna rush to tell me to break it off, but I am more looking for advice on how to handle these kinds of issues.   I do not have experience with anger issues and it seems like many things that I do exacerbate the problem without me having awareness of what I'm doing.  Also, he flat out refuses to go to therapy or couples counseling so that is not on the table.  Thanks in advance for any advice and thanks for reading ☺

**tl;dr - partner of 2 years is a lovely guy with severe anger issues, I am at a loss for how to handle them **

59,"I [30M] ruined my girlfriend's [28F] potted plant and have no idea how to tell her.


My girlfriend has this succulent plant she's had since college. She's named it and is obviously very attached to it. About a year ago she had to leave for a job opportunity abroad, with the intention of setting up base in the new country while I sorted out my affairs and joined her soon. She left her plant with me in the meantime as a reminder of her love, which I appreciated greatly.

A year later the plant has somehow grown to become a twisted cronenberg version of its former self. It grew ridiculously tall and thin, sprouted out multiple little succulents everywhere, grew weird roots, and on top of that the entire midsection is naked. I tied it to a wooden chopstick for support so that it wouldn't topple over from being so top heavy, but it continues to grow tall and gangly. I've checked in with my girlfriend multiple times about the plant's progress and I don't think she realizes how bad it is. To be fair, even I didn't realize how bad it was until I was sorting through some pictures and found some where it used to be its cute, compact, leafy self. I've tried everything, including watering it more frequently, re-potting it, setting it on the sunniest window, pruning shriveled leaves and of course replacing the support with longer ones. The damn thing just won't stop getting taller and weirder. I even took it to the local flower shop and was told that it was perfectly healthy, even though ""he's kind of an ugly guy.""

I have no idea how my girlfriend is going to react when she sees the plant. She's going to be furious at me for sure, which is warranted, but I really don't want to break her heart when she finds out her beloved, once pretty succulent now looks like something straight out of some sort of hellscape. I did learn that there's a way to cut the succulent into sections and replant it, so that I'll have three small and relatively nice looking plants instead of one monstrosity, but I don't want to make any mistakes and accidentally kill the whole thing. What do I do???


tl;dr: my girlfriend has this succulent plant that she loves dearly. plant apparently hates me, even though I followed all her instructions, and has evolved into something that looks like what Tim Burton would come up with during a bad acid trip. No idea how to break the news to girlfriend."

61,"I (29F) bought Easter stuff for my friend (24F) and may have made her abusive marriage worse for her


Tldr at the bottom 

So some quick back story, we're both cashier's at your local one stop shop. She's been so sweet since I've been working there and always puts a smile on my face despite my tiny cold black retail heart. 

On to today, We're selling out of Easter stuff FAST, like there's hardly anything left. So she asked me if I think there will be Easter stuff left over on the 4th. I laughed and told her no because it's pretty much all gone now. 

She started crying. I had no idea what I did wrong and ran to her to see if I could help in any way. And ohh boy, she let loose. She didn't go into detail too much but she doesn't have money to do Easter for her 4 year old and 8 month old. So I opened my wallet and tried to give her the money in it. She denied. I told her that's fine but I WILL take her shopping when we clock out.

She opened up to me a lot more when we started shopping.  She's been married to this guy for about 2 years. She's been the bread winner while he slacks off at home and pushes her older kid onto someone else to watch because ""not my kid, not my problem.""

They've been arguing a lot lately and he refuses to say he loves her. He hasn't since she had their baby. He gets angry when she tries to talk to anyone from work and at least once he almost broke her wrist trying to take her phone away while texting one of our pregnant co-workers. 

He started working again, and convinced her to buy her own car. She did and she loves it. Then  he quit his job. They're struggling now and she's going to have to work 2 full time jobs while taking care of 2 kids because he's a lazy ass. 

 So I said fuck it. I bought her kids everything they'd ever want for Easter. I bought Easter candy, eggs, baskets, stuffed bunnies, toys, movies and a pool for them. Kids don't know why parents are upset, they just know they are and it hurts them. 

My friend was crying and hugging me. Thanking me non stop and all I want is pictures of the kids Happy on Easter, no money back, no favors, just happy kids. But I'm worried I set her up for more abuse. She said the kids will love it but her husband will be pissed off. I told her to kill him with kindness or tell him it was an Easter drawing from work and the winner won a gift card or something. 

It's been two hours now and I haven't heard from her and I'm really worried. I told her about Reddit and how it will most definitely help her with everything because I couldn't do it without Reddit. But holy shit. I really hope I didn't make any thing worse for her. 

**Tldr** I (29) helped friend (24ish) and I really hope I didn't make home life worse for her because her husband is controlling and abusive."
62,"Tears during an amazing first date? Cause for concern at all? (22f) (24f)


Me and this guy met on Tinder. We’ve been speaking casually for a few weeks before we met up. He was really attractive and seemed cute over text so why not meet up!

The date was, well, magical, honestly. He wasn’t just attractive - he was funny, flirty, and witty. We didn’t have a dull moment, and I felt a pretty intense connection. I had to kiss him on that date.

And the kiss was even better. There were soft kisses, tender kisses, full kisses, deep kisses, aggressive kisses, and passionate kisses - I’ve never wanted to keep kissing for so long. It must’ve been well over two hours of us just kissing each other on a bench. There were even little pecks to close off a session while we were out of breath and we’d just look into each other’s eyes with such lust. My god, I was melting in the moment.

And he seemed to as well, because I noticed his eyes started tearing up while we were holding eye contact at one point during the session. He ended up saying “I’m sorry, I’ve just had a rough time of late, but moments like this really remind me how magical life can be from nowhere. It’s just a strong feeling and I didn’t expect it”. It was so sweet and honest, but it did surprise me that he was so emotional suddenly. Am I overthinking after a perfect date and should I be more considerate, or am I okay to feel a little bit cautious despite how sweet it sounded? Maybe it’s just because my previous boyfriends haven’t been emotional in the slightest? I don’t know. It’s just... different for me and has all come about so suddenly - the emotions and the connection, that is.

**TL;DR**: unexpectedly strong connection on first date. Guy tears up during intimate kissing session. Is it a bad thing?"

64,"Me (35/f) and my husband (36/M) with my sister-in-law (32/f) and mother-in-law (66/f); they make snide remarks about our vacation splitting time.


Both myself and my husband (married 4 years, together for 13) work full time jobs with limited vacation.  I get 12 days a year off, including sick days.  He gets around 20.  We have a 2-year-old daughter, who is in daycare, so naturally she has been in and out of minor illnesses all winter.

We work really hard to keep our family healthy, for obvious reasons, but importantly, so we can use our vacation time for actual vacation....and not just a sitting at home recovering from a virus.

My husband's family lives about 5 hours from us.  We make an effort to travel to visit with them at least 3-4 times a year (Thanksgiving, long weekends, etc.).  They rarely come to visit us.

Over the last year or so both my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law have made snide remarks about us spending our vacation with my family.  We go to the beach with them for one week every year.  This is something that occurs EVERY year, so we can easily plan for it.  It is also very meaningful to both myself and my family, as it is something we have been doing for decades.  Other vacation days are spent travelling to see concerts, go on solo or friends vacations, or take the (unfortunate) sick day.

My husband family doesn't have a beach tradition like my family.  They also don't like planning trips and will wait until the last minute to actually book houses, plane rides, etc., should they choose to travel.

Neither my mother-in-law or sister-in-law have ever worked.  I don't think they understand how precious vacation time is and how it needs to be PLANNED for....often many months, if not years in advance, in order to not only afford it, but to earn the requisite PTO hours.

I wish my husband would kindly explain our situation, but he says he doesn't want to get into it with them, that they wouldn't understand, which I kind of agree with him.

We are going with them to the beach in about a month.  We (most mostly they) decided to plan this vacation only about 3 months ago so both my husband and I can only take 3 days off, instead of the full week.  My mother-in-law made ANOTHER snide comment about it over Easter.

What should I do and/or say the next time something is ""slyly"" brought up about how we spend our free days?  I want to be empathetic and reason they just want to spend time with us and feel slighted when we can't join.  It is very frustrating to deal with people who don't understand basic working life. I have gotten to the point where I want to tell my husband I don't want to visit them AT ALL.  I work really hard, day in and day out, to provide for my family.  My vacation should be MY vacation, and if I spend one minute of it with them, they should be grateful.  I understand I sound resentful, because I am.

TL;DR- we work, they don't.  How I choose to spend my vacation is not your business.

Fiancee and daughter go around the city a lot to do different things when I'm at work. Yesterday I had the day off, so I went with them to a painting class they go to. There were other parents with their kids there, and we sat next to this dad and his son. Right when my daughter saw him she jumped up and down, waved, and said ""hi daddy"". My fiancee didn't correct her or anything, just exchanged a hug with the boy and dad. 

It was like almost the whole time we were there they barely said or paid any attention to me. My daughter seemed to be much more interested in them, what they were doing, and just what the man was saying and how he was interacting with her. My fiancee was practically giggling at everything he was saying and doing, and afterwards when we left daughter said ""bye bye daddy"".

When we were in the car fiancee said that ever since they attended that class she's called him that, and despite the many corrections she hasn't stopped, so she just ignored it. I told her how i felt a little left out, to which she just laughed and said because it was my first time there. But the man didn't acknowledge me or anything, despite me being right there. I don't know i just got a strange vibe from him, and I just feel like my daughter is seeing another man as daddy because of all the time they spend with him. They go on play dates together, lunches, and places like the zoo and museums. My Daughter and his son are best friends, but I feel like all that time has replaced my relationship with my daughter? I don't know, is this something I should bring up with her?

69,"By a crazy coincidence my (21f) boyfriend (23m) of 5 months is from the same area my grandfather (86m) was born in Spain. They get along so well but I feel so left out when they are together. Am I just being petty?


My grandfather was born in a pretty small town in Andalusia in southern Spain. He's a very, very proud Andalusian and talks about it constantly. He lived there until he was about 13 until his father ran afoul for some reason of the Franco regime and they escaped with help of the Vatican first to Cuba then to the US. He's a really nice man and was running 5k races (not walking running) until about a year ago but he took a real severe turn when his doctor put him on a new medication and since then he's been very sullen and almost like he's ready to just pass. 

I started dating a new guy that I met in my MA program at school. I knew he was from Spain but it wasn't until we had been out a few times that I told him where my grandfather was from. It turns out, his town is maybe 5km from the farm where my grandpa was born. 

I took him to meet my grandpa and from the first moment they started speaking the Andalusian dialect with each other. I can understand some of it but since the Spanish I can speak is from school and Mexican Spanish (my mom is from Mexico and I spent way more time there than I did Spain) they  quickly lost me. And not only that, they are talking about things I couldn't possibly know which is awkward when it's in English. From the first meeting I felt like my grandpa was stealing my boyfriend. 

So my boyfriend was homesick so he started hanging out with my grandpa like they were best friends. I mean I bet I could go over to my grandpas house now and I'll bet my boyfriend would be there fixing him pescaito and tomatoes for breakfast. I feel like such a third wheel. They cook dinner together, the laugh, they skype with my boyfriends family in Spain like 2 or 3 times a week because it turns out they have friends from the 1950s in common and have since become like long lost brothers. 

So for my family, they are so excited because it seems that my grandpa has a new lease on life and he's active again and he smiles and laughs and tells his jokes. 

I know all this is great and my grandpa will probably live longer and happier because of it...but I feel left out. I feel ignored by my boyfriend and i feel like he's much more excited to see my grandpa than he is me. Then I feel bad for being jealous of my grandpa and feel like horrible for wanting to take away from his enjoyment. 

Am I just being petty? Should I just step back and let them enjoy themselves? Or do I need to speak up and say something?

tl;dr: by an amazing coincidence, my boyfriend is from the same area of Andalusia where my grandpa was born. They are like best friends and I'm jealous and feel left out. Am I just being petty?

tldr: my parents disapprove of me moving in with my boyfriend, and have already said horrible things to me about it. I don't want to bring  him around because I'm scared they'll say hurtful things to him, but they're insisting they need to have an ""adult conversation"" with him.

I [22F] have been dating my boyfriend Leo [29M] for a little over a year now, but have known him for two. Leo and I met at work at the restaurant I've worked in since I was 16. He's, quite honestly one of the best things that has ever happened to me. He's made me a better and happier and more joyful person, and he's helped greatly with my day-to-day struggle with anxiety. Long story short, we're both very in love, and very happy. 

Currently, I live with my parents. I've lived with them throughout nearly all of my college years, except for my first year away at a different school. I won't say it hasn't been a struggle living at my parent's as an adult, but I've saved quite a bit of money and am leaving college with virtually no debt (minus a car loan). 

The problem, however, is that my parent's are devoutly Catholic, and I am not. I used to be very religious, but after my own individual research and self-discovery I've found the faith to be lackluster, and I'm rather disillusioned with the church, and christianity as whole. They've taken this hard, but my mother especially seems to be affected the most. I've always been her ""golden child"" of sorts, the one who was going to be deeply devout for life, who would marry a nice catholic boy and have a dozen children. Whereas my two brothers were never as devout as I once was, and they're more of a ""lost cause"". It's important to mention that both of my older brothers currently live with their significant other's, both unmarried.

My parents have met Leo twice. Once for the initial meet-n-greet of sorts, where my mother literally sobbed and basically told him not to touch me sexually. (she used a less shocking metaphor, something about me being a 'precious jewel' and how he needs to treat me like one, blah, blah, blah. I was mortified.) The second time was for a brunch in October, where my mother was clearly disinterested in getting to know Leo at all. Other than those two instances, they've had no contact with him, as my mother has grown increasingly more hostile about our relationship. She seems to think that Leo is the cause for my departure from the faith, when in reality, I was having doubts an entire year before I even met him. In fact, Leo is more religious than I am at the moment, but he's not Catholic, and to my mother, that means he's not good enough.

I graduate in May, and I will be moving out of state to pursue a job opportunity at a non-profit that I've interned at for the past two summers. The pay isn't incredible, but it's far above minimum wage (and as an English major this is a win in of itself) and they've offered to finance my graduate school degree. It's also a work environment that I've loved working in, with people that I love working with, and with a foundation that I love working for. It's the perfect job for me as a post-undergrad. 

I was going to take this position regardless of whether or not Leo would come with me, but we talked it over, and he said that if I'll have him (and I absolutely will) he'd love to move there with me. I'm so, so, SO excited. I love this man. He makes me better, and I can't wait to start this new adventure with him. The problem is, of course, that my parents are losing their shit.

My mom has cried, screamed, begged, and lambasted me with insults and really, truly just some horrible things. She now knows that I'm no longer a virgin (her nightmare apparently) and has hinted many times that I'm just some kind of floozy now who goes around sleeping with all kinds of men. Which is just not true. Leo is my absolute first and only sexual partner, and even if he wasn't, the fact that I enjoy having consensual sex speaks nothing of my character. 

My parents have told me that if Leo was a ""real man"" he would come and ask them for ""permission"" to move in with me. To which they would of course decline. They told me they'd be happier if I married him than move in with him. Which is just baffling to me. They want me to not take this job, to stay home, or to leave Leo behind until we're ready to get married. 

They continue to insist that they want him to come over and talk with them, and my dad has told me multiple times that he'll just go to Leo and I's workplace and ""have a beer and a conversation"" with him. It's not that I want my boyfriend and my parents to have a bad relationship, it's just that I don't want to subject Leo to any of the insults or terrible things that my mother has said to me. I don't want him to have to deal with that, because I know my mother, and I know when she's really angry (and she's REALLY angry about this) she does not hold back, and has been known to say some awful, hurtful things.

I graduate in May, and I'm moving out at the beginning of June, and I am not going to change my mind just to appease my parents, or be unhappy just to make them happy. I just don't know how to rectify this. Should I bring Leo by and just let them say their piece? I just know my parents will NEVER accept this situation, no matter what, and I think the closer I get to moving out the more hostile they'll become.

73,"My [21F] ex-Best Friend [22M] pretended not to know who I am


I ran into my ex-best friend of 7 years (friendship ended 1.5 years ago) in a public, social setting at a bar and he spoke to me as if i was a stranger and was very dismissive, ignoring my attempts to make conversation.

There was no real reason why our friendship ended apart from the fact that he got a girlfriend and suddenly stopped speaking to me. His girlfriend was not at the bar with him so i struggle to accept that as the reason for why he acted so strange with me.

I can't help but let my mind wander and I keep contemplating messaging him and asking why he acted that way but then I also wonder if i should leave it and just accept that our friendship is in the past. What should I do?

TLDR Ran into my ex best friend who stopped speaking to me bc he got a girlfriend and he acted weird and like he didn't know me. What should i do?"

75,"Me [25 /F] with my new roommate [23 /F] she moved in 3 days ago and my place is already trashed. Help!


So, I've been living alone for the past 7 months but I always ha roommates before that. I decided I'd get one again in my new apartment to help reduce the cost of rent. It's a really nice apartment and I've kept it very clean and well maintained. The new roommate (we'll call her Sally) had told me that she was very clean and that her was well behaved and trained. She seemed really normal and sweet so I went for it. She moved in a little less than 3 days ago and my apartment is trashed! It smells like piss and BO and the stench gets stronger the closer you get to where her room is. I mentioned it to her and suggested she at least open a window but she hasn't done even that. She started using my things without asking within an hour of moving in. Her dog has peed in the apartment twice that I know of and I had to clean it up even though she had been home all day and was right there. There's pet hair everywhere. And I mean everywhere. I grew up with 3 dogs in the house and that still never amounted to this. I can't leave my room without shoes on because my feet turn black with grime instantly. I work from home and used to sit in the living room but I can't do that because her dog will constantly jump on me. Plus the dog hair and general gross-ness makes my nose get stuffy, swell, and hurt and makes my eyes burn and water so much I can't even read my laptop. I've mentioned the pet hair several times but she hasn't made an effort to clean anything once. It's only day 3 and it's this messy already. What can I do without causing more harm than good?

 TL;DR New roommate of three days and her dog have trashed my apartment, she uses my things, and wot clean up. "

77,"My [29f] SIL [35f] is driving me crazy because she's jealous of the relationship my sister [25f] has with my daughter [2f]


A couple months ago my SIL Daisy came over for dinner. She'll come over maybe once every couple of months. Otherwise we see her at bimonthly dinners at the inlaws' house. We were talking about shopping for Christmas presents and mentioned how nice it was that we got to both go alone without a toddler crying over every last toy. She asked where daughter Gina was when we went. My husband told her that my sister Lele babysat. 

I was a little hesitant to say anything as there's been weird jealousy in the past with Gina. She was the first baby on both sides of the family. I think all of my inlaws get a little jealous of how much time we spend with my family. My family is very laid back and easy to get along with while things with my inlaws are very particular and need everything to be structured. My husband has even agreed that he'd rather spend a Sunday afternoon watching a football game with my dad and brother instead of sitting in his parent's sitting room watching MIL play with our daughter. Also, my sister and I are basically best friends and have been our entire lives. All this together means that my daughter and sister spend a lot of time together and are very close. 

Back to Daisy. After she found out Lele babysat, she started asking if she could too. This weirded me out for many reasons. 1, who the f asks to babysit your kid? I mean it's one thing if you mentioned you were going somewhere and someone says ""oh i can babysit for you."" This did not happen. My SIL asked five times over the next month when she could babysit. Not come over and spend time with Gina, but babysit. 2, she doesn't have much of a report with Gina. When we're at the inlaws, they hog her and Daisy doesn't get much time with her. When she comes over to our house, she spends most of her time on her phone. She'll sometimes get on the floor and play with her for a minute or two (usually when we suggest it) but before long she's back to texting or whatever the f it is she does on her phone. My brother is kind of the same way. Gina is still pretty young- he's not great with little kids. But he's fine with the relationship he has with her. I'm pretty sure once she's more into sports and games, they'll bond better. 3, I do not trust her alone with my child. Maybe in a few years if we really need someone and Gina is more self sufficient. But keeping up with a rambunctious toddler is hard work. Especially if you sit on your ass and stare at your phone and ignore the toddler. We also don't really go out much. If we really don't want to take Gina, my parents or sister watch her.

After about a month of us pretty much avoiding the question, she stopped asking. Fine. Great. Done and over with. 

Until my sister posted pictures on Facebook of the four of us (myself, husband, Gina and Lele) at Santa's Village. My sister didn't have anything going on the day we were going so she tagged along. The next day, SIL texted asking if she could take Gina to Santa's Village. I said I would let her know next time we went so she could come with. She said ""I could take her next weekend. You guys don't have to come."" I ignored it and just said ""we'll let you know""

I feel like I need to point out that I am 100% sure SIL isn't up to anything nefarious. I don't think she gets that this is not a normal ask- she's pretty awkward and very immature. 

This has happened three other times since I've noticed the pattern. Not as severe but still pretty annoying. My sister will post a picture on some social media of her and Gina or just Gina- just hanging out at our house or whatever. Within twenty four hours, we will get a text or call from SIL asking to come over for dinner. If she ramped up her game and started playing with Gina when she came over, I don't think I'd mind as much. But nothing has changed!!!! Nothing! She still comes over and basically ignores Gina to sit on her phone. So it just turns into a boring evening where we have to watch our toddler and host at the same time and it gets awkward. I always vowed that I wouldn't let my feelings about my inlaws get in the way of their relationship with my daughter (they're not bad people, they're just weird). And I don't plan on turning SIL away when she asks to come over. It's just so annoying. 

What really got me here to ask for advice is my sister- she's starting to feel bad. She told me she avoids posting anything about Gina online because she doesn't want Daisy to feel bad and doesn't want me to suffer through a boring evening with her for no reason lol. That pisses me off because Lele is the sweetest person and I love the relationship she has with my daughter. I don't want her feeling like she has to tiptoe around Daisy and the entire internet.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation? I can't just tell my SIL to either put her damn phone down or stop asking to come over (which is what I kind of want to do). It would just end in hurt feelings and drama. I don't want SIL to feel bad, I just want her to put her flipping phone down and play with her niece or stop insisting she come hang out with her every time she sees my sister doing it. I just want my sister to be able to hang out with Gina and share so with her friends on Facebook if she wants to. If I can also get out of these boring dinners with a phone addict, I'd be thrilled

tldr: SIL is obviously jealous of the relationship my sister has with my daughter but sits on her phone instead of playing with her"
