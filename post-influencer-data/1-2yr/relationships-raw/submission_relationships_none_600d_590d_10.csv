1,"[Update] My [20/M] girlfriend [24/F] of 3 years is pregnant, she wants to keep the baby but I don't. I'm freaking out, what am I supposed to do?


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7l6mnz/my_20m_girlfriend_24f_of_3_years_is_pregnant_she/)

I wanted to write a quick update. About a month ago I wrote a post asking for help. I was still in denial about being a father, but reading the replies snapped me back to reality. I talked to my girlfriend, she was worried that I'd leave her, because I mentioned once that I never wanted to have kids very early in our relationship. I've changed my mind since then, and I reassured her I was here to stay, that I was going to help her raise our child as a couple. We went to the doctor to make sure she was actually pregnant, and she was. 

Since then I've gotten a decent paying job to help support our child, and have been living with my girlfriend for 4 weeks. I told my parents about the whole situation, and they offered to help us in anyway possible. Our community also has a few resources that are meant to help new parents, which I'll be sure to use because I've no clue on how to be one.

It's weird to think that in 7 months I'll be raising a kid, when sometimes I still feel like one. I have a lot of learning and maturing to do. I hope I can be an excellent dad. Thank you for the advice Reddit.

  **tl;dr**: I'm staying with my girlfriend and helping her raise our child. I'm so excited and nervous to be a dad!"

3,"I [18m] broke up with my girlfriend [23f] of 2 years today, but she threatened to ruin my life if I don't stay with her and claims to be pregnant with my child.


**Update: I can’t believe I’m getting even better advice than what I received in my other post, you guys are seriously saving my life. I can’t thank y’all enough. I’ve been reading all the replies, and I’m coming up with a plan to deal with this. Also, after reading my post again I noticed some typos and lack of cohesion. I guess because when I originally wrote it I was still crying and not thinking straight. Sorry for that.** 

I'm located in Canada.

Hi Reddit. I asked for help about my girlfriend yesterday and received a lot of advice. You guys gave me the courage to do the right thing, which was to break up because of her predatory and manipulative behaviour. It didn't end the way I expected though. I'm sitting in my room, crying and contemplating if my only option is to stay with my girlfriend. 

Shortly after making that post my GF saw it, and wanted to have a serious discussion about our relationship. She came over to my dorm and we talked. She asked me why I made my post. I said I wanted different opinions on what she did to me.

My girlfriend was mad, she told me we were perfect for each other, that people on Reddit couldn't and would never understand our unique relationship, and how I left out crucial details. I broke up with her. I told her we couldn't be together because of what she did to me at the beginning of our relationship, and that my trust was forever shattered.

Immediately she started crying and pleaded with me to stay with her, she said that she needed me in her life. She started apologizing for what she did and promised that it stopped after the first month. I almost gave into her begging but I held my ground. Once my girlfriend realized I wasn't changing my decision she started getting aggressive.

My girlfriend threatened to ruin my life, destroy my reputation with my friends/family, get me kicked out of university, and fired from work if I didn't stay with her. She had a list typed up with all my insecurities and secrets that I've never told anyone except her. She showed me the video I sent 2 weeks ago of me masturbating (I wasn't underage when I sent it), and implied that she would send all of these things to my boss, professor and everyone else I knew.

She asked me to visualize what my life would be like if everyone I knew was disgusted by me, or that my boss and professor knew how I jerked off. I cried when I heard all of this. I didn't know how to respond. My girlfriend came over, gave me a kiss, and said:

“If you stay with me I promise none of this will happen to you.”

At this point I felt powerless against her. It was like I had no control over anything and I was an observer looking into the conversation. I still told her that I didn't want to stay with her.

She told me she was pregnant with my child. I didn't believe her and called her out on it. Then she reminded me of the time she wanted me to cum inside her 6 weeks ago. I wasn't wearing a condom, and I thought she was taking the pill, but she revealed to me that she wasn't. 

This is such a fucked up situation and I just want to stay in my room and forget about everything. My girlfriend is giving me 3 days to come up with an answer and if it's not the one she wants she’ll ruin my life. 

I don't have a single clue how to handle this, what am I supposed to do here? I don't want people to see that video of me jerking off, or know about my deepest secrets. I'm scared to death that she's not lying when she said she was pregnant. I don't want to raise a child and I can't afford to. It was fucking stupid of me to have unprotected sex AND cum inside of her, but I wanted to make her happy so I listened. 

Do I have to stay with my girlfriend? Will I have to accept the fact that my life is ruined. Could I even recover from this if she goes through with her plan? 

**TL;DR:** broke up with my girlfriend today, she threatened to ruin my life by getting me fired from my job, kicked out of my university, and ruin my reputation with my family and friends if I don't that stay with her. She also claims to be pregnant and I think she's not lying."

5,"My sister [22F] got her first job at my company and she feels they're not ""respecting her talents enough."" Somehow this is my [27F] problem. What do I do?


Ok so I work for a large, fairly prestigious PR firm. My sister studied media &amp; communications at a pretty well-ranked state university and I helped her secure an interview. She did well on the interview and became the top pick for the job. However, she's only been working for 3 months and she's already complaining. 

She complains that the company undervalues her talents, which she believes is very clear from her resume and her college achievements. True, she was involved with a lot of student organizations, but that doesn't translate into the adult working world. Everyone starts out at the bottom and works their way up. My sister absolutely can't comprehend this and thinks because she was a ""big deal"" in university she needs to be fast-tracked to a bigger role in this company. 

I've told her multiple times that this is just the way things work. EVERYONE goes through this. Hell that new hire from Stanford we got 4 months before her has just moved from spreadsheets/assistant tasks to basic events planning/smaller projects. I tell her if she wants a more integrated role, she should go to a much smaller firm that's much less hierarchical, but she wants the prestige of our large company as well. 

The issue is my sister is such a golden fixture in my family. Everyone talks her up and treats her like she's already made it and famous, even though all she has in her belt are some leadership positions in her student clubs. I think she's gotten a huge ego from all of this and she keeps pushing me to ""get her more responsibility"" and ""find her projects that are better suited for her talents."" I tell her she hasn't earned more responsibility yet and she just needs to be GOOD at what they've given her now. As of now, she barely bothers to complete the few tasks that's given to her because she doesn't think they matter. It's no surprise people aren't giving her more, because no one thinks she's even competent at the bare minimum. 

My parents are pretty much bothering me 24/7, especially when my sister calls them upset and in tears. I'm so sick of it but I don't want to sour terms with my family altogether. What can I do/say to my sister to help her understand how things work? Has anyone been in this position? Thanks!!!

6,"My [29/M] gf [29f] said we should try an open relationship. She gets very upset when I mention other women.


We met a few months ago through mutual friends.  It started as a one night stand, but we fell in love, even though she thought I was a player. (After a month or so, we said ILY.)

Our chemistry is amazing. She is kind and supportive.

The sex is passionate, but even out of the bed we have soooo much fun together.

After a few weeks she proposed for us try an open relationship, as she thinks it would work better for us. The rules are: be honest,  notify the other in advance, and don't hurt anyone.


I agreed, as this is something I also wanted to try. I was always intrigued by this idea.

She said I can have sex with someone else, as long as I tell her in advance and use condoms.

...

Sometimes she teases me with old lovers, like a guy she had hot sex with on a vacation; she even made comparisons between us.

I could only take it half-jokingly, I felt a bit of a sting. But after a while I too found it funny. 

But whenever I tried to do the reverse she got tense.

There was also one time when I caught her chatting with a guy, while the two of us were out for dinner. I said I felt this is disrespectful. She said sorry, you are absolutely right. She apologized profusely, it would never happen again.

I know about this guy, she told me they are going to spend a weekend together. And that maybe they are going to have sex. 

I haven't yet done anything outside our relationship. I don't sext anyone.

Here I'd like to reiterate, that 99% of the time we feel absolutely awesome around each other.
I'm definitely her primary man, we spend like 5-6 days a week together.

We were also discussing about including someone in our bedroom activities. This person has to be male, she said.

I agreed. I too find the idea arousing.

But I am still not exactly used to the concept of openness. I am getting there mentally.

Anyway, during one of our pillow talks, I wanted her to tell me what she would like to do with other men. Like a detailed description. I would have found it arousing. She reluctantly started to tell me, but stopped. Minutes later she asked me ""How would you like it?"" or something similar.

I misinterpreted this as ""How do you like it with other women?""

I made a couple of statements for example ""I like when they..."" 

(I only said a bit of vanilla stuff.)

She got very very upset. She said I disappointed her, and she is sick to her stomach. And maybe we shouldn't see each other for a few days. And I was inconsiderate of her feelings, because she told me before she doesn't like other women, and I was supposed to know how she'd react. That I tried to hurt her. That I was on an ego-trip by telling her about my conquests or something.

I said I was sorry, this was an unfortunate miscommunication, and we should put this behind us.

She said we'll see.

We still slept next to each other.

There is a chance she will have sex with someone else tonight. She is going to a dinner party, and one of her old lovers will be there. She told me this.

Does she have double standards? Is our relationship unbalanced?

Or was I inconsiderate?

12,"My (18M) lifelong best friend (18F) kissed me and admitted to being in love with me, after I comforted her when she got bullied at school. I don't know if my feelings for her are romantic or platonic.


According to our parents I met Katie when we were 4 years old, but we didn't become best friends until we started going to elementary school together. She's always been shy and quiet, kids would pick on her for that, and they’d make fun of me for hanging out with Katie because she was weird. I didn't care though because she was my best friend.

Last week at school I saw Katie getting bullied by a group of girls. She got upset and walked outside. I followed her out. Katie told me to go back or I'd miss class, she said she was fine but I knew she wasn't. I wanted to make sure she was okay.

We went to our favorite spot that we used to hangout in when we were little, which was underneath a certain tree in the park. Katie vented to me about the bullying she experienced during elementary school, and how this brought back bad memories. I gave her a hug and tried my best to comfort her. Katie thanked me for being a good friend and for always staying by her side. 

She kissed me afterwards. It surprised me, but I didn't pull away, and I let her be the one to finish the kiss. Katie said she's loved me for years. She asked if I felt the same way and I said I didn't know. She started sobbing and apologized for telling me in the first place. Katie said keeping it hidden was unbearable, and telling me was the only option, but now that the truth was out our friendship is ruined forever. 

After thinking about it, I've come to realize how beautiful she is, and how much she makes me smile and laugh. I felt something when we kissed and I liked it a lot. I love spending time with her and giving her hugs. I've never gotten tired of her company, being with her brings me happiness that I don't get with other people.

I just don't know if these feelings are platonic or romantic. I've never had a crush or fallen in love with anyone before, and I've never thought of Katie as a potential girlfriend until now. 

I can't imagine what life is like without Katie. One of my first memories is being at her 5th year birthday party. I helped her grieve when she lost her older brother, and she stayed in the hospital with me to help me recover when I got into a car accident. Our friendship has endured through so much, but I don't know if it can survive this.

I'm scared. I'm lost. I'm confused. I don't want to lose my best friend that I've known for eternity.

**Edit: 1** I think I only got two hours of sleep... and school starts in a few minutes, but I'm going to tell her everything I said in this post. Thanks for all the advice!!

**Edit 2:** I talked to Katie at school today for the first time in a few days. I told her that I wanted to date her, how beautiful she was, and how I felt when we kissed. She was super ecstatic about it, and we've been hanging out with each other since we finished our exams 4 hours ago. We're going on an official date later this evening. Dunno what we're going to do, but I know we'll have an amazing time.

Holy shit. I'm so excited that I'm dating my best friend! Sorry for keeping you guys waiting, I've been spending all my time with Katie today. I'll be sure to write a proper detailed update post in a few days if I can.

Also, I kissed her again, and it felt even better than the first time :)

25,"Husband (63M) refuses to let our previously heroin addicted son (28M) back into our lives. Our son has been sober for 5 years and has become very successful recently.


Son got into a very bad crowd as a teenager. Part of it was just the neighborhood we grew up in, it was a bad neighborhood, too much nightlife and drugs and partying, at age 15-16 he was basically already a street kid. At age 17, he joined a band, and at times we didn't see him for 2-3 days at a time. He was just a lost kid basically. He was very good looking, and I think that was part of his downfall at that age, his ego and his looks/charm made it so he went crazy partying and doing drugs with models at clubs and all that stuff. He got invited to parties that we would never have gone to at that age, he was a very, very popular guy. Then, one day, when he was 17, we found needles in his room, he was doing heroin. At first we tried to get him to go to rehab, and he went, and then right when he got back he did it again. We got into a massive, massive fight, he left, stealing nearly 500 bucks from us, and left to washington DC with his band. We were heartbroken. 

He tried to come back 2 months later, and my husband was so mad that he got into a fist fight with him, and my son never came back. 

I stayed in contact as much as I could. He would call me from random phones asking how everything was throughout the years, we met up a few times without my husband, sometimes he looked alright, sometimes he very clearly had relapsed. He never quit that band, and they seemed to be doing alright for themselves. 

Then, I just lost contact, for a really long time. He said he went to Los Angeles, then Sao Paulo, and that was all I knew for years. I have 2 other kids, and at the time... well he just wasn't present in my mind all the time. I hoped the best for him, but I had no idea what he was doing with his life at all, and I figured if he wanted to let me know he would. A year went by without any contact, then another... then 5 years went by. 
  
Up until 3 months ago. He called me, and I nearly broke out in tears. We talked for a very long time. He had been sober for 4 years he said. His band had gotten huge suddenly, and they were making a ton of money off of touring. He said when his tour was over, he planned to move back to nyc, and that he wanted to see us and reconnect with us. I thought he meant dinner or something, but no, he wanted to be a part of our life and everything. 

So fast forward 2 months later, and he sort of impromptu came to the apartment. He said hello to us, and my husband was really, really clearly upset at his visit. He gave me this stink eye the entire time, like I had betrayed his trust. My son looked GREAT. Holy shit did he look good, the dragged out face he used to have was gone, he clearly was working out a lot, he didn't look well... sketchy anymore. My husband didn't care really, when my son left, my husband freaked out, asking why the fuck he came over and all this stuff. He said he knew he was coming, but he didnt want to fucking talk or see him. 

My husband doesn't like us bringing his name up at all in the apartment. So even though I DID tell him he was sober and living in NYC, he didn't care. 

So what the hell do I do? I tried having a sit down with my husband but he just dismissed everything I said. I told him to toughen up and stop acting like a baby over this, and that it was his son, and he said ""that boy is no son of mine, hes just another junkie who stole from us"". I couldn't believe him. 

So what am I supposed to do? Tell him his father still hates him? How do I get through to my husband?

Edit: I said 5 years in the title, it was more like 4 and a half years.

31,"My [26F] boyfriend [28M] made comments about my friend’s discomfort during pregnancy, and I think my reaction is a little over the top. I don’t know what to do.


Hi Reddit, thanks in advance for reading. I am sorry if some of my words are a little off; English is not my first language. This might get a little long, but there is some relevant backstory that sheds some light on my behavior. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. We do not live together, but he is often over at my apartment.

I grew up my country’s equivalent of the bible belt. My country is well known for being very very progressive in our larger cities, and very very conservative in our villages – this is true I think for most countries, but the sheer difference between our “levels” is pretty well known.

I grew up in an abusive household, surrounded by really misogynist men, and have experienced trauma on both these fronts. This obviously caused me some mental health issues. I was afraid of, and uncomfortable around, men for a very long time. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

I tried very hard to get out of my shithole village. I graduated a year early at 17, left for the most liberal city in my country, and started on my university degree and after a couple of months I started therapy also. Just getting out my surroundings did help. Obviously I needed (and still am getting) professional help, but now that I had men around me that weren’t over-the-top horrible I could imagine a life where my feelings on them had changed.

One of my most longstanding issues is a fear of pregnancy. I thought for a very long time I “had” a fear but in light of recent events maybe I still have it. The thing is, and this is the huge part my therapist and I had to tackle, my fear of pregnancy wasn’t based in non-facts. I was very well educated on the specifics of pregnancy. My fear of pregnancy was basically the fear of real symptoms (pregnancy brain, your body getting sore, your vaginal canal having to dilate, etc.) and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude. You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them. A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable. A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones. These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on. And on.

Basically my fear of pregnancy was partly the pregnancy itself, and partly men’s unwillingness to understand women after pregnancy. Where I’m from, men don’t know anything about pregnancy. My mother pumped milk for my 3 youngest siblings, and he didn’t realize you could even do that because he didn’t realize we had a pump and he never walked in on her doing it until my last sibling. My brother didn’t know about lochia after pregnancy – which is fine if my brother was 12, but not okay if he’s 28 with a third trimester pregnant wife. The women where I am from say that it is “impossible” for men to understand pregnancy and we need to live with it. They are at the same doctors appointments explaining the realities of pregnancy, aren't they? I always maintained that men were apparently just unwilling to Google stuff and maybe sometimes empathetically take our word for our discomfort.

This took a lot of therapy to unpack, not to apply to all men, not to fear for every time I had a relationship (romantic/friendly/coworker) with a man. And this sort of thinking obviously pervaded for more than just pregnancy.

I’ve been in therapy since 17, and after three years I got the worst of it out of my system. Now, 6 years after that, I see my therapist once a month for basic check up. Usually there’s nothing to worry about; I like to keep going to have an external reference to keep my head on straight.

The actual problem is this: my friend recently gave birth, 7 weeks ago. She lives three hours away and I saw her right before she gave birth, but after her pregnancy she’s tired of all the visits and kind of just wants to nest – she doesn’t want to leave the house yet or have people over. But we do call a lot.

Yesterday morning we were calling and my friend was a bit emotional. She and her husband had gotten into a fight about sex and intimacy, because she didn’t have to have sex yet. She had a very tough and traumatic childbirth, is still discharging lochia, is breastfeeding, etc. She doesn’t want to be touched if its sexual, and she was crying to me because her husband never just cuddles her unless he wants sex and she has to constantly turn him down. She was very upset and I was trying to console her.

After the phone call, my boyfriend asked me what was wrong since I was obviously consoling a friend. And I was a little affected by it too, more than I’d like to admit I think. I know my friend’s husband and he’s a wonderful man, so this seems very out of character for him, which obviously triggers some of my issues. I explained the situation and my boyfriend started laughing and said that my friend should just have sex, even if she can’t normally it should be anal, and a bunch of other stupid shit. I don’t want to get into it too much. Basically all the examples I mentioned, all the fears I thought I worked through, came right out of his mouth.

I started dating him because he was one of the most kind, liberal men I’ve met. He was understanding during menstruation, understanding of my background, understanding of therapy. We never spoke about pregnancy because we’ve only been together a year – my fear of pregnancy specifically only came up tangentially. I guess that’s my fault, I guess I should screen men on these specifics on one of the first dates.

At first I tried to explain to him why he was so wrong, but I started crying. I wasn’t in a position to communicate, and that’s my fault. I was very unprepared to have this conversation, especially when I am emotional. He left. I booked a session with my therapist. Right now I’m cuddled up on my couch trying to keep my anxiety in check.

But I can’t really seem to calm down. Am I overreacting so much? Am I expecting too much? Is my reaction so weird and my expectations so weird? Do I just need to let this go? Or can I realistically just not expect better from a partner? I’m so lost. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to call my friend so soon after she called me with this.

Please help give me some perspective.

**TL;DR:** I was confronted with my fear of pregnancy that I thought I had dealt with in therapy. My boyfriend's reaction is exactly the reason I had fear of pregnancy. I don't know what to do."

34,"I (29F) quit my martial arts club, senior members and owner lost their shit over it. What gives?!


This is long, so I apologise in advance, but please read it all as I need some insight. Names changed for privacy.

&amp;nbsp;

5 years ago, I joined a martial arts club. It was technically run as a business, but acted a bit like non-profit; the owner had opened the school with his own money and ran it for the love of it, and the black belts were volunteer instructors. Members paid monthly fees, payments went towards rent and equipment and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

The training was great, I befriended some of the junior belts and was really keen to befriend the black belts. This wasn't successful - while the black belts were friendly in class, and sociable at club gatherings (like pub meetings and Christmas parties), they made it very clear that there were professional boundaries the black belts needed to uphold. Too much familiarity wasn't recommended between the black belts and the junior belts, so the idea of becoming good friends with them wasn't an option.

&amp;nbsp;

The club atmosphere was very much a 'help everyone out and support one another' type of thing - it was all volunteer stuff and everyone was encouraged to help out where possible: this included cleaning, helping out with kids class, organising social events and so on. Very community-orientated. I did a LOT of helping out in this regard.

&amp;nbsp;

This also extended to member's personal pursuits - the black belts were keen to show support to members in their professions and and hobbies. The black belts came to see some theatre shows I performed in, and one of the black belts offered me free design work for a business I was starting. They were also supportive during a really serious mental health crisis I was going through. In turn I helped out one of the black belts with a script he was writing, and edited his resume. I did not perceive these as acts of genuine friendship, but colleagues supporting one another to promote good rapport/goodwill in the club.

&amp;nbsp;

My relationship with the black belts was colleagues only. We did not socialise outside the club unless it was a club event, rarely talked about our personal lives, didn't invite each other out for coffee/a meal, talk over Facebook/text and so on. It was supportive and helpful, but aloof-ish. I DID want to be closer friends with them, but there seemed to be subtle resistance.

&amp;nbsp;

By year four, I became unhappy with the club - four black belts had suddenly left, and there were some politics happening that made me feel like I wasn't being taken seriously. I had sat down to discuss this with a black belt, James, and it went BADLY. Long story short, he guilt-tripped me for wanting to leave (""we have invested a lot of time in members, and it feels like a slap in the face when they up and leave""), and confirmed people didn't take me seriously/respect me (then said staying at training would 'help me tackle this', implying he thought I didn't get respect in other areas of my life). It ended in an argument. I said it felt like I was leaving a cult.

&amp;nbsp;

The owner spoke to me a couple of days later and reassured me that the black belt had not taken a good approach, I wasn't wholly disrespected by the club and asked if I would reconsider leaving. I agreed to come back after a 6 month hiatus.

&amp;nbsp;

I came back for a year, but the training had become so boring and lifeless (it really changed when the other black belts left) that I had lost all interest. The owner apparently knew I was 'pulling away' and had talked to the other black belts about this. Some junior belts and I had previously spoken to one particular black belt, Kevin, about the classes being boring - he said things would change, but they didn't.

&amp;nbsp;

I also noticed that Kevin had become more relaxed in his approach to newer belts, and was fraternising/socialising on a more friendy level with them - texting, hanging out, Facebooking, talking personally. His relationship with me was still the same - friendly but socialising only at club events.

&amp;nbsp;

One day, after many weeks of very sporadic attendance, I Facebook messaged Kevin and told him I wanted to cancel my membership, and asked what steps I needed to take. I explained I had lost interest in training, and was still bored with class, it wasn't the same since the others left. I said I wasn't keen to go to the club and discuss it due to what happened last time, plus my mind was made up firmly. I thought he would be understanding.

&amp;nbsp;

He curtly replied, saying it was common courtesy to come and 'face those who had supported me over the years, come to see my shows, helped me through hard times, given free design work etc.' He said it was the courteous thing to do, to say goodbye in person to those who cared about me, that it was 'a kick in the nuts' to have a member quit via email like they were a common gym. He said 'what are we doing this for, if people don't give a shit?'

&amp;nbsp;

I was mystified by this, because I wasn't close friends with any of them. I said I didn't see the purpose in saying goodbye in person - who would I say goodbye to? I wasn't close to any of them, and we were colleagues, not proper friends, exactly how it had been explained to me at the beginning. Besides... what would I say? ""Hi, I'm leaving the club because I'm bored. Goodbye"". Why would I need to say goodbye in person anyway? 

&amp;nbsp;

I explained this, plus said I didn't want the big blow-out conversation where I was convinced to stay. I said sitting people down and making them feel guilty for leaving leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. I also reminded him of all the help I gave to the club in return for their support, so we were square.

&amp;nbsp;

I told him nobody would care if I left (why would they? I wasn't dying, or leaving the country. They could contact me anytime) because I was hardly training anyway. He said 'that's your opinion'. When I clarified that our relationship was colleagues, not friends, he got REALLY upset and said ""I have to go"". He did not respond to my messages clarifying WHY I felt we were not proper friends. I was polite in all my messages, and no point said anything offensive. I emailed the club to confirm cancellation - definitely wasn't going to the club in person after that.

&amp;nbsp;

I met up with some of the junior belts today for a catch-up - Kevin was there, he ignored me, I ignored him. One of the girls who was friends with him texted him about the situation (I had told her I quit) - Kevin said I was a dickhead who didn't have the courtesy to come down and say goodbye to the people who cared about me, that I thought 'so little' of them to suggest we were colleagues and not friends, he had showed my FB convo to James and the owner, who 'were disgusted', and that he 'knew I was going to spread rumors about the club being manipulative and cult-like'. He said ""Oh she thinks we don't care about her at all, thinks we didn't like her or see her as a friend, is she trying to get me to feel sorry for her?""

&amp;nbsp;

The thing that stung the most is when he texted her saying ""we supported her through her shows, defended her against people who didn't like her, and dealt with **her emotional bullshit**"" - he knew full well I had had a serious mental health crisis at the time (anxiety/depression) and had attempted suicide. I had also had a brain MRI that showed minor lesions, which might have caused the health issues. To refer to that as 'emotional bullshit' made me feel betrayed and furious - I had shown a vulnerable side to them, and he used it against me like I was some crazy drama queen.

&amp;nbsp;

I am completely blindsided by this and cannot understand why he perceived it this way. He has fundamentally misunderstood everything I have said. I am furious - he has been defriended from Facebook and I will never speak to the heads of that club again. 


&amp;nbsp;

Have I missed something?? 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I had colleague-like relationships with black belts at my club, as it was part of their system to maintain professionalism with junior belts. I quit over Facebook message years later and they got super upset because I didn't go down in person to say goodbye. They got extra upset when I said we were colleagues, not friends."
35,"My (21 M) boyfriend looks like he was extracted out of an Abercrombie beach photoshoot, and I (20 F) look like I could be one of the crabs in the background of that photoshoot


We will call him D.

D is quite possibly the most attractive human being I have ever seen in person. 

Every feature on his face looks like Donatello himself slaved and labored over a slab of marble for hours with a chisel. The kids jaw looks like it could actually hurt you. His nose would make Brad Pitt jealous and should be on the front page of a male plastic surgeon catalog if those even fucking exist. Don't even get me started on his hair. His hair looks like it belongs on some through-bred show horse. It is a lawless mane, for it does not abide to regular things that hair should abide to. He never needs gel for it does not frizz. He never has to comb it because for some fucking reason the shit just stays in perfect place. AND when you mess it up on purpose he still fucking looks like he should have been one of Derek Zoolander's model friends. His eyes? You guessed it! An unreal shade of blue that would make anyone look 4 to 5 times just to make sure that they aren't colored contacts. Fuck are you kidding me? And yes! Of course he has a perfect body! 6'1 and 185 lbs with a waist and abs that Jillian Michaels could not even sculpt out of someone. And how could it even get better?

Well it does. He is incredibly sweet, innocent, motivated and absolutely hilarious. I was sick last night and I was coughing a ton so I left to go sleep on the couch so he wouldn't get woken up by me, and he checked on me every single hour throughout the night to make sure I was okay. WHAT? Nobody has EVER been that considerate ever. Who does that?! Jesus christ my ovaries were pounding out of my skin last night. I wanted him to pump my guts so hard. It was romantic as hell.

Do you ever feel like somehow your perfect human has been somehow put into a machine and created for you? I have no idea how this has happened.

I've been heartbroken many times before and I have always been on guard meeting people but all of my walls are broken down and I feel like I really found someone I want to wipe the ass of when I am 80.

And you know what? I KNOW that he is so much more attractive than me. I do. And it does get to me sometimes. I've always been very flat chested so sometimes I have a hard time taking my shirt off in front of him because I know in my head that he can do better than me. I don't have the washboard abs that he does and I sure as hell have the curliest and frizziest hair. So I guess what I am asking is how do I train myself to let it go? I know that he loves me, how do I make sure my insecurities about my body do not leak into the relationship?

36,"My mum [47F] and her fiancé [49M] are demanding I dye my [21F] hair blonde from my current pink for their wedding


Hey guys, am having a few issues with my family at the moment regarding my hair. I’ve had my hair pink/purple for around 2 years now and love it, I really don’t want to change it, my friends associate it with me and it makes me really happy. My mum and her fiancé are getting married in May and have brought it up to me that they would like me to dye my hair blonde for the wedding. I said that I wasn’t willing to do this as I didn’t feel it was right to change my body for the sake of one day, that I wouldn’t feel like me and feel like they don’t want me as I am on that day, on top of the bleaching that would be required to get it to that level from where i am now would be damaging as fuck (i imagine id have to cut a large amount off) and that to redye would be very expensive.

Their opinion: that i’m being selfish by not wanting to do this, that they’re having a very traditional wedding and “sometimes in life you have to conform” and that i would be ruining the photos and aesthetic. I’ve raised all my points with them but my mums fiancé just insisted i was being arrogant and stubborn and that if I loved my mum i would do what she asked.

I said i could compromise by hiding my piercings, they said that was a given anyway. I then said i would be willing to wear a wig to which they laughed off and said that i “wouldn’t be me” and that it would be insulting to people who actually wear wigs (yeah idk). 

My dads side of my family agree with me but they’re not listening to what anyone else is saying and say it’s only their opinion that matters. I said if it was that much of an issue I wouldn’t have to be a bridesmaid/in the photos but mum started to cry and said that was unfair, that i was ruining her day.

Help me guys, i really don’t know what to do and love my family. My hair is really important to me, it may sound silly but i have a long history of sexual abuse and mental health issues, and dyeing my hair really felt like reclaiming myself in a way... i’m not willing to give it up and genuinely feel they are being unreasonable. If you disagree and think i’m being a twat then tell me, I really need an outside perspective 

TL;DR my mum and her fiancé want me to dye my hair from pink to blonde for their wedding as i’m a bridesmaid, i disagree and this upsets them. Help!"

A friend of mine went missing on a foreign country around 5 years ago. No one knows for sure what happened, but the police suspect he was taken (or sold) as a prisoner to work in a drug scheme, since he knew how to speak many languages and was living alone. 

If he's alive, I don't even want to think about the things he must have gone through. The situation is very delicate and I'm tearing up just thinking about it. His parents spent so much money trying to find him, they travelled there and went looking for him in a very dangerous region on their own, I haven't seen his family in person since he was missing ( I moved to a different city around the time he disappeared), but I've been following the case closely and have watched them give interviews about it on TV and newspapers and they're obviously heartbroken. I know his mom, used to sleep over at his house sometimes and she's a total sweetheart.

Anyways, I knew I had pictures of him on my old photobucket account, but I tried to access it for years and just coudln't remember my password nor the e-mail. Today, out of nowhere, I had an insight - I remembered one of my old passwords and it worked - there are some pictures of us from around when we first met, he took pictures of me and I took pictures of him - we were laughing and having a good time. I remember that day very well and it's always been one of my treasured memories of the times we spent together. 

I thought that it might be a nice gesture to send those pictures to his mother along with a text, though I don't know what I'd write -- maybe something about how I remember him being a beam of sunshine, a person who always cheered me up, who was sensitive and full of life -- But I don't want to upset her somehow, I don't know if it would make her too sad. Should I just send her the pictures with no sentimental text? Or not send anything at all? I truly don't know what to do.

We haven't talked in a decade. He just hit me up randomly. I only answered because I hold no animosity towards people in my past, regardless of what happened. Texts were exchanged back and forth and he asked to go to lunch then asked if I wanted to come over to his apartment. He tried FaceTiming me but I declined his call. He's hit me up for 5 days straight. Tonight he FaceTimed me multiple times and kept asking for me to pick up my FaceTime call. He said the following --

1. It's important (This kind of scared me because I'm not gonna lie we didn't use protection 99% of the time. I'm gonna get myself tested today)
2. I have nude pictures/videos of you (which I never consented to and I was a minor if he has illegal photos/videos of me)

I quickly told him off, said if he exposes me that would be spreading CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, and then blocked his phone number. Btw, did I mention I just looked his social media up and he has a GIRLFRIEND.

43,"I (26F) have not talked to my brother (31 M) and sister (33F) for 4 years because they left me to take care of our mother when I was 18, they now want to get back into contact


This is a long one but I appreciate anyone that can read it and give advice. Also it’s a throwaway because some of my family uses Reddit. Shortly after I graduated from high school my mother’s mental health started to decline. She became more paranoid and aggressive toward me and my brother who lived with her as well. Two months later my brother couldn’t handle it anymore and moved 12 hours away back to my dads. I was taking a gap year before I started uni so I  stayed home to save some money. My mums mental health began to worsen, she quit her job, became paranoid and forgetful, crashed her car. I realized something was really wrong when she started to take old packets of food to the grocery store so she could remember what she needed. I drove her to multiple doctors before she finally got a brain scan and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 55. I discussed what to do with my sister, brother, grandparents, and aunt about it. They didn’t outright say I had to take care of her but it was heavily implied that they expected me to take care of her because I was still living with her. 

This is where the worst 4 years of my life began. I couldn’t find any other job in the small country town besides the one at McDonalds because it allowed me to work nights and take care of mum during the day. Mum quickly got worse, she soon couldn’t use the toilet, was shouting at me all the time and crying and would constantly knock on my door while I was trying to sleep so I was exhausted all the time. My aunt and grandparents lived in the same town as me and offered help but my brother and sister would often find excuses not to visit. They would say stuff like they didn’t want to see mum this way, ignoring the fact that I don’t want to either. My sister did help with her finances but I did not receive a carers pension until two years later because of her assets so I was taking care of her off her small disability pension and my wage from my part-time job. The worse night was when she was constipated for three days and had bad stomach pains. I took her to the hospital where they gave her something to help. When we got home she defecated all over her bed and pants. I remember crying as I cleaned her up and the bed. I would go to work and wonder if she would be alive when I came home. My mental health got worse, I started cutting myself and would constantly cry to my sister about how horrible it is to see her like this. She visited a total of three times during the four years. I remember when mum was still somewhat comprehensive how her face would light up when my sister walked in the house and how invisible I felt. There is a lot more but I don’t want to make this a novel. 

In the last year before she died, she was admitted into a care home because I couldn’t take care of her anymore. I still stayed in the town to visit every day because the home she was in was not the best so I had to check up on her. I started university externally and my brother finally visited her. When she died he helped organize her funeral. At the wake, my brother and sister both came up to me and thanked me for taking care of her and I went ballistic on them. I said a lot of horrible stuff to them, about how earlier on how mum would ask where they were, how they abandoned her etc. There was a big yelling match between me and them and lots of crying as well. I regret doing it in front of our friends and family but I don’t regret telling them the truth about how selfish they had been.  

6 months later, after the estate was finalized, and the house was sold I stopped talking to them. I finished uni and started a new job. I still have them on my social media but I ignore any messages they send. My sister posts memes to get my attention sometimes but I ignore them. I still have a lot of anger towards them. Recently my sister got engaged and is trying to contact me to get me to come to the wedding. They both have sent long messages apologizing and how they want to be a family again. I want those things too but I feel sick about the four years I spent struggling and they ignored me. Should I get back into contact with them?

44,"I [28m] left home and took off on a crazy whirlwind adventure 9 years ago. Picked up a wife [27f] and a couple kids [1.5f and 3m] along the way. But I’m burned out now and really just want to settle down and maybe go home. Wife hates the idea.


Wife and I have been married six years now.

So, basically back in ‘09 I was a 19 year old kid working a dead-end job. Deciding I needed to do something to get out of town and go somewhere in the world, I joined the Army.

It succeeded in my goal. I got the fuck out of my old hometown. I’ve lived in four states since then, and spent time in a few foreign countries. When I was a little younger I loved that stuff. I always looked forward to going somewhere new.

The first place I went was Arizona. I met Savilla there, a Tucson girl. She was pretty similar to me. She spent her whole life in town and wanted a way out. We clicked, and eventually got married. Overall out marriage has been pretty good. She’s a good wife, we rarely fight, and I think we’ve done alright together.

Had a couple kids, both unplanned, but we do the best we can and we do love our slightly less-than-planned kids.

The Army has been a pretty good job these last nine years. Decent pay, awesome benefits. But these last few months I’ve really started to feel burned out. And old NCO once told me that the first time I come into work and really don’t care about my job, it’s time to take off the uniform. And I’ve hit that point. I still take care of my soldiers, I still care about those guys, but we’re on a training mission and I’ve realized I just really don’t give a fuck how well we score on it.

I’m tired of this life. I’m stressed out all the time. My body seems to constantly hurt. I mostly live off of cigarettes and coffee it seems like. I still try and keep up a good face for the fam, but that mask slips now and then and I wind up snapping at my kids for doing some kid thing, then immediately feel like a complete asshole.

I’ve realized that the only place I really want to go is back home, and pick up a normal life. I honestly think it is a pretty good idea. I’m from the midwest, so cost of living is cheap. There are a few industries in town I could work in, and a good community college where I could get certified in something new.

Its time right now for me to decide if I’m staying in the Army or if I’m going to get out in a few months. I tried talking to the wife about getting out, and *possibly* moving back where I’m from. She shit the idea down, hard.

The biggest reasons she gave are job security and the benefits for me and the family, both of which are really good in the military. And she doesn’t want to settle down in one place, especially somewhere “cold”, which she would call the place I’m from (even though its not *that* damn cold).

I know her reasons for wanting me to stay in are perfectly valid reasons, but I really am starting to feel like I’ll be in an early grave before I make it 11 more years of this (when I’d be eligible for retirement). I can compromise on moving back home, but I really think leaving the military is necessary at this point for my sanity. I know it would be a big transition, but I think we would be happier for it. The wife, steadfastly, disagrees. It’s causing a rift in our marriage, the first we’ve really had. I don’t want to ruin our relationship, but I don’t think I can keep up this life, and if shes not willing to compromise on her end, I’m really thinking it would be best to end the marriage.

Help?

46,"My (41f) husband (42m) hit me. Now what?


Married for 8 years.  He's had anger management and alcohol issues the entire time I've known him, but he's never touched me before.


=========================================


3 months ago he came home drunk one night and I was angry because he hadn't told me where he was and I can't stand it when he comes home at midnight really drunk (his friend dropped him off).  I told him he needed to get his drinking under control and I went to sleep in the spare bedroom.  He came in and said I had a holier than thou attitude and I wasn't perfect either and then he pushed me hard (I was standing beside the bed and I fell onto the bed).  


========================================


The next morning he was very apologetic and said he'd try to control his drinking and not get into situations where he gets so drunk.  Needless to say that didn't actually happen and he continued to drink (as he has all along).



=========================================



Last night he came home drunk again.  I didn't say anything about this at all.  Instead I asked him to please come to bed and go to sleep.  However, he was restless and didn't want to sleep.  He was making a lot of noise and since it was after midnight I told him to knock it off (being so loud).  He didn't say anything to me but instead walked over to me in the bed and hit me hard in the side of the head by my temple.  I was actually shocked.  He just said ""fuck off and leave"", so I went to the spare bedroom to sleep.



=========================================



Now he's again very apologetic and swears he will not hang out with his drinking buddy again.  However, the very next morning he suggested that I contributed to it by ""escalating"" him while he's drunk.  That isn't the case -- I simply told him to stop making such a ruckus at 12 am.  He's scared I'm going to divorce him.  As much as alcoholism sucks, I can deal with it (I have my whole life from various people).  However, I've never experienced domestic violence before and I have no idea what to do.  


=========================================


A key point here is that his ex wife claims he hit her several times during their marriage. He strongly denied it and said she was saying that to get full custody of their kids (she didn't end up with full custody).  I believed him as he'd never shown any signs of being violent towards me.  However now I'm thinking she was perhaps telling the truth.



=========================================



Could this be a turning point for him?  I know he is deeply ashamed of his actions.  Or am I a fool for thinking this won't just keep happening with more frequency now that he's crossed that line?  Obviously I do NOT want to get divorced if at all avoidable.  I still love him, I love our life together and I have so much invested in our marriage.  Does anyone have experience with this?



=========================================

47,"People always seem to immediately assume that I [24F] am unintelligent. It impacts my self esteem and my working relationships. What am I doing that makes me come across this way to others?


I made a throwaway because I didn’t want this dumb wall of insecurity to be associated with my main account. I'm sorry for the wall of text. Thank you in advance for reading.

I think I’m a pretty smart person, but for as long as I can remember, other people in my life treat me as if I’m below average. It feels like I’m always coming from behind in proving my intelligence to people. This has really hurt my self-esteem and made me very insecure about how I present myself to others. I don’t know if I’m exhibiting qualities or actions that make me come across as unintelligent, nor how to fix them if I am – and if I’m not, I don’t know how to brush off these assumptions people seem to have about me.

I noticed this first start happening in high school when I joined a specialized debate team. Essentially, you can pick one person from the other team to go head to head with for one portion of the debate, like in Mean Girls when the opposing Mathletes choose Lindsay Lohan to answer the game point question. Understandably, you pick the person that you think will perform the weakest, so that your chances of beating them are better. Almost unfailingly, if I had yet to debate/present by the time this round rolled around, or the opposing team hadn’t seen me at previous debates, they would pick me.

If I won (which, at risk of sounding braggy, I mostly did – I’m a good debater and proud of my performances), it was super common to hear comments, both in person and secondhand from friends/acquaintances later, from the kids I’d beat that the judges must’ve only scored me well because I “wore pantsuits two sizes too small” (FWIW, I think I’m a very conservative but fashionable dresser, with suits that fit just fine and appropriately) or “had the presentation skills, but no real substance to my points” (which I disagree with, but is at least a better point.)

I thought maybe this was just bitter high school kids being mean, but it’s continued for basically my entire life. My freshman year of college, while interning for a well-known politician, the woman supervising me told me she had advocated against my selection as an intern because I’d listed Cheer Captain on my resume and she had seen cheerleading photos on my Facebook when looking me up so she’d “just assumed [I] was a dumb bimbo,” but lucky for me, she’d gotten to know me and was *so* glad they’d picked me now! (It was my freshman year, so I didn’t have a lot of leadership experience yet, which is why I listed it.) Who says that to a person? What about me made her feel emboldened enough to not only say that to me, but to make assumptions based on the athletic team I’d led?

When I graduated college with 3 majors and highest honors, people were shocked. “I didn’t know you were doing all that,” was something I heard a lot from acquaintances, “I assumed you’d just taken an easy major so that you could do cheerleading”. When I got a job at the leading organization in my field, I overheard comments implying I’d traded favors (real mature) to get it because there was “no way it could have been earned on merit.”

Even now, within the organization, when walking into a room to give a presentation, older personnel (men and women alike) will ask me to get them coffee or send a message before they realize I’m the presenter, not an assistant. 

It happens in random social settings constantly. If I meet people in a bar and mention where I work, I’ve had a lot of people immediately respond, “That’s cool. Doing HR or as a secretary or something?” When I explain my actual job duties, I’ve had people say verbatim “Wow, I didn’t know you were smart!”, “You didn’t strike me as the kind of person do that level of work,” and my personal favorite, “wow! Is you like, intelligent or something?”

I recently took the LSAT and scored a 179, and shared my good news with my friends, who were thrilled for me. When they told some other friends of theirs (who are just acquaintances of mine), those other friends flat-out accused me of lying because there’s no way *I* could’ve scored that. 

I am looking at some well-known law schools. I was at a party recently, and met some alum of my first choice school. I mentioned that I am applying, and they immediately responded with “Oh. Well you know it’s really competitive, right?” When I told them that yes, of course I know that, but I feel confident I have a competitive application, they basically demanded details where I had to spend 15 minutes justifying why I’d even be a candidate for the program to virtual strangers.

I don’t mean to make a laundry list of accomplishments as a humble-brag, which I worry is how this comes across. I only mean to provide context for when I say I do feel like I’m an intelligent person and it’s infuriating, demoralizing, and embarrassing that so many people in my life who don’t know me assume the opposite. 

For a long time, I more or less accepted it as an annoyance I just had to live with, and tried to focus on building my own self-esteem and being secure in my accomplishments – because if I *am* an intelligent person, I shouldn’t need other people to know it to prove it to myself, right?

But now, in my line of work, it’s directly impacting my ability to perform. In the short term, people assume that I am an intern or a secretary, which wastes valuable minutes that I could have been presenting my report or doing my actual work and breeds resentment in me. In the long term, I work in a very reputational building; people assuming that I’m stupid will actively hinder my promotion potential, and the assignments I’m given (we’re often tasked by people who are not our immediate supervisors). I need to change whatever it is I’m doing that makes people assume this – but I can’t figure out what it is.

It definitely happens more frequently with men than women, but often enough with women too that I’m not convinced it’s just a sexism thing. I don’t think I’m particularly attractive, so it’s not a “wow she’s hot, must be dumb” thing. Also, plenty of the people who explicitly told me they had “just assumed [I] wasn’t that smart” think stereotypically attractive women like Ivanka Trump or Emma Watson are both beautiful and geniuses, so even if I were conventionally attractive, it’s not like they have cognitive dissonance about beauty and brains.

I wear pretty tasteful makeup – foundation/mascara, some blush, neutral eyeshadows/lipsticks that usually looks like I’m not wearing anything. I dress pretty exclusively in black/gray/navy suits at work, and keep my hair straight, neat, and shoulder-length. I think I look professional and presentable. Outside of work, I wear skinny jeans and sweaters or blazers a lot. Nothing flashy or, in the words of my former internship supervisor, “bimbo-y.” 

So what is it, Reddit? What about me causes people to make snap-judgements about my intelligence? What can I do to come across as more intelligent to strangers and acquaintances; and if nothing, how can I build my self esteem to stop caring about this so much?

**EDIT: **Wow, you guys! I am blown away by all of these responses - I'm struggling to keep up reading them. What an awesome community of wonderful people. There is some really amazing advice in here and I've done a lot of reflecting on the wisdom you all have shared.

To answer a few questions/points that came up frequently:

1. A lot of you have asked if I'm curvy or have big boobs. I am not and do not, I'm just skinny.
2. My comment about Ivanka/Emma wasn't about my personal thoughts, just those of friends who cite them as examples of women who are both hot and smart. I tried to pick an example from both the right and left of the political spectrum. Otherwise, it's not that deep. 
3. I only included the cheerleading thing as an example because, to this day, it shocks me that this woman said that to my face. It has not been on my resume since I was 18, I promise lol.
4. I dress conservatively, but not frumpy, IMO. Fitted pantsuits or skirt suits in navy, black, gray, and tan; and a white, plum, or olive skirt suit for when I'm feeling ~wild~. The heels I wear are usually pointed-toe and 2-3 inches.
5. I don't have an accent, do uptalk, or fry my words. I do occasionally find myself overusing ""like"" and making what's probably an excessive amount of pop culture/internet references, but I consciously try to keep an eye out for them.

It seemed like a lot of the advice revolved around the idea of changing either my personality or appearance, both of which make me kind of sad. But I do think there are small elements of each that I hadn't considered before that are definitely contributing to the problem. For one, I would describe myself as the opposite of ""stoic"" - I smile a lot at people when they're talking (even when it's not a smiley conversation), will laugh at awkward silence or at ill-timed jokes to make the speaker feel better/more comfortable, and avoid conflict and fail to stand up for myself frequently. 

I'm also guilty of using filler that makes me sound less confident. For example,  ""Hey boss, I was wondering, if you had time, if you could meet with me to discuss this project? It's not urgent, whenever you're free"" as opposed to ""Hi boss, would you be available to discuss Project X Thursday afternoon?"" All of that is something I've been meaning to work on in both my professional and personal life, and I think that will be a good place to start and see if I notice a difference. 

Another poster pointed out (I'm sorry, I can't find your username to tag you!) that I may be interpreting lots of different issues as having the same ""source"" because they make me feel the same outcome, though they may not necessarily be caused by the same thing. I think that's a great point -- those kids on debate made me feel gross and like an airhead because kids are mean; I may be assumed to be an intern at work occasionally because I'm young; those law school alum may just be pretentious jerks because they went to a top law school, so they look down on most people; that woman at my internship may have just thought cheerleading is dumb; other examples may be other combinations of sexism, ageism, or all/none of the above. I think compartmentalizing how/why/when these things happen may help me feel like it's not one giant commentary on me, but a combination of other, separate factors that all happen to make me feel the same way.

All in all, I know that the biggest problem here is my self-esteem and my insecurity. I wrote in another comment that it feels like a vicious cycle, where my worry I'm not perceived as intelligent makes me question myself, or come across a certain way, which probably reinforces to people that I'm not.  The only real way to fix that isn't doubling down to convince other people I'm smart: it's fixing my own confidence. Easier said than done, and if anybody has some good tips on how to do that, that would be awesome.

I am reading every single comment/reply and will reply to the PMs soon too. Thank you all again for all of this help, advice, support, and story sharing - reddit is such an awesome place and I am so glad I reached out to you guys!

  **tl;dr**: For what feels like my entire life, people who don't know me personally have assumed I'm unintelligent. It often feels like no matter what I do to ""prove"" my intelligence to others, I am always coming from behind in looking smart. It makes me insecure and affects my performance at work. What can I do to change this?"
48,"My (38M) wife (36F) of 12 years had a nervous breakdown (I think), not sure what to do


My wife of 12 years and me have had a good marriage, with minor ups and downs. We have two daughters, 4 and 7 years old. 

First, my wife has always been a calm person. She rarely fights and is a great communicator. As a person, she is kind and intelligent to everyone. 

Recently, she's been under a lot of stress. About three months ago, her mother died (her father died 5 years ago). There has been a big fight between her and her siblings (two of them), and the fight is about inheritage (they can't agree on who inherits what), and my wife has been put into middle, with the other teo constantly forcing her to pick sides, causing some high end drama, etc. She doesn't want to fight with them so she's been trying to be civil and reasonable, etc. 

Other than that, her job is also causing stress to her. She only has one day off in the week. Her bosses are demanding and one of them is verbally abusive. She has the most of work to do, finishing her coworkers' duties, staying longer at work because of that (and she's always been taken advantage of by her colleagues because she wants to help everyone out).

Then her aunt is ill and poor, and has no one to support her. My wife is the one who takes care of her (visits her every day, helps with the medicine, chores etc) and her siblings don't want to be part of that. This aunt has no one else and lives off a small pension and, well, if my wife didn't help, nobody would and the woman would have to take care of herself, while she can't even walk properly (has suffered two strokes, numerous health problems etc). 

When it comes to household chores and children, we do everything 50/50. Our younger one is constantly having tantrums which is normal for children of course, but happens every day, a few times a day.

Anyway, my wife and I have decided to spend a weekend alone, for the first time in a long time. We left the children at my brother's house, and decided to have two days only for ourselves.  Everything was going well, until my wife received a message from her sister which said ""I can't believe you are so selfish, today there was a lot of paperwork and three meetings to do and you just decided to escape from it, what's wrong with you? Do you think it's okay that I always have to do everything while you're just being lazy and probably lying in bed all day? What would mom say? If you even care about that"". (in the morning, my wife had had an argument with her sister about the paperwork related to the house - and my wife is always the one doing that, this is the first time it fell on her sister).

Well, this kind of hit my wife very hard. She threw the phone at the wall, screamed how she couldn't take it anymore, threw everything from the kitchen table (and broke about 7 glasses and three plates), and then started hitting the bathroom door with her legs. I tried to stop it, but she was completely unapproachable, to the point that she cracked the door, then took another glass and hit the window with it, breaking the class and cracking the window. While doing that, she was histerically crying and loudly talking about how he hates everyone and everything and how she wished to disappear. 

I tried to calm her, she laid on the floor and cried ecen more hysterically, and was restless (hitting the floor with her legs etc). 

After it was all over, she went to sleep. 

This happened 5 days ago. She called in sick from work. She doesn't get up from her bed. She doesn't talk, mostly. She seems severely depressed. When I try to talk to her, she tells me to leave her alone. I asked her if she wanted to see a therapist, she refused. 

So she's completely unapproachable at the moment.

Please note that she has NEVER had such a breakdown, never broke a single glass, never raised her tone, ever, in the past 12 (+2 of dating) years. This shocked me, more than you can imagine. 

I have no idea how to deal with this. I'm trying my best to comfort her but nothing is working. It's like she has completely been deprived of her energy.

What can I do? How can I help her?

Tl;dr - Wife has been under a lot of stress and had a nervous breakdown and now seems severely depressed. I have no idea how to help her.

49,"My sister (23/F) wants me (26/F) to be her live-in nanny, she’s upset because I said no


My sister is in the last few weeks of her first pregnancy, with twins. The circumstances aren’t the best, and the father’s not in the picture. She’s been relying on family for a lot of support, and I’ve tried to do my best. I live 2.5 hours away, so I’ll hang out with her and help around the house. I just try to make life easier for her when I can. Recently, we were talking about what she’s going to do when she gives birth. I asked if she had childcare lined up, and said that she didn’t know anyone nearby. Then, she offered for me to move into her house and be a live-in nanny for her since nannying is my job. But, she’s only offering a third of what I charge typically (I share my pricing with her often), and she doesn’t live in a good area and her house is kind of trashy. It’d be a huge change, and not one that I wanted to make.

I said a lot of this, but in a much kinder way. You know, “I like where I live, I’m not into a career change right now” and she got MAD. Like, made me leave mad. I told her I wanted to still hang out with her kids and be present for the birth (in her birth plan, her idea), and she said I could forget about it since I didn’t want to be there for her. She said all I cared about was money and myself, and slammed the door on me. It’s been almost a week, and we haven’t spoken. I’m really afraid she might go into labor on her own and need someone, or she’d give birth and I wouldn’t get to meet my nieces. I feel like shit, but I’m not going to take up her offer unless she offers better compensation. Is it rude to tell her this? Or should I just wait for her?

TL;DR: My sister is mad I won’t be a live-in nanny for her. I won’t take the job unless she offers better pay."

54,"My [37M] girlfriend [35f] of 5 years has a famous ex [38M]. He still tries to get back with her/be in contact. How do I support her?


My girlfriend Erin and I have been together 5 years. Prior to that, she was in a long term relationship with her first boyfriend, we'll call him Mike. They were together for 11 years.

She met Mike at a local event where he was performing with his band when she was 16. Erin is also a musician and she was performing that night, too. They hit it off and started dating.

They were together for over 10 years when he got a record contract. Erin started getting suspicious while he was touring. He came clean about what he was doing when he was touring, which was drugs and groupies. Erin doesn't have a tolerance for anything stronger than pot and doesn't have a tolerance for cheating, so Mike went out the door.

Mike has done well for himself, but for some reason, he can't let Erin go. He will tell her he wrote songs for her, sends her albums, tickets, and presents.

She sends them all back and is firmly no contact. She can't move because she owns her house, so changing the mailing addresses is not an option.

It's wearing her down, though. She wants to maintain no contact, but she is getting visibly frustrated when new things arrive in the mail. It's not all the time, just once or twice a year.

She doesn't want to get an RO because she's got her profession in a prestigious field attached to her name and doesn't want to be dragged as trying to take down someone famous. She doesn't even think a few packages a year constitutes an RO; he's not threatening her, he's just simply sending her things with friendly letters attached.

She's tried to talk to him about stopping before she went no contact, and he just said that he's doing well and wants her to ""enjoy it with him.""

Today is Erin's birthday, and he sent two dozen red roses. There was no address to return to sender, so she can't get rid of them beyond trashing them. 

We're not sure what we should do, but how do I support her through this? It's a strange situation.

TL;DR: My gf's ex is famous and sends her presents/letters all the time. She is frustrated and wants it to stop, but is afraid of dragging her name through the mud. How do I support her through this?

56,"My (21/F) Coworker(40s/F) came into my class and confronted me because it ran over and I was later for work.


I just started a job in my school's library as a student worker. There's another woman, lets call her Tammy, that's been there for a year or two that's also a student worker, but works basically full time. Tammy has so many hours because pushed the old full time librarian out of her position because Tammy didn't like her and their bumping heads led to the old librarian quitting. Tammy proudly told this to me a while back before I got the job. They haven't been able to find a new full time librarian since. 

Tammy doesn't seem like the easiest person to get along with as a coworker. She's one of those people that takes their job too seriously for everyone around them, but doesn't really do much themselves. I spent a lot of time in the librarian before getting the position, likely around 20 hours a week doing school work, and I've noticed she mostly just sits at the desk and plays on what she calls ""her computer"" (she specifically asked me not to use it, even though it's just a library computer we're supposed to use if we need to do research for students, the only other one you have to stand to use. I don't know what the deal here is.) 

I knew Tammy wouldn't be much fun to work with, she's already started bad mouthing the other new student worker to me and I've only been there a week, but this job pays really well and the experience will look good on my resume. I'm just doing my job the best I can and trying to not let her stress me out, but I feel like she's already crossed a big line I need to address with my actual boss.

Yesterday I was scheduled to work after class, but my professor ended up going over our time without noticing. I was about 10 minutes late for work and Tammy came strolling into my class and confronted me in front of everyone to tell me I was scheduled to work and now late. She wasn't polite or quiet about this and it disrupted the entire class and really embarrassed me. She didn't have anywhere to be, so it's not like I was stopping her from going to class or anything like that. 

It was certainly my fault for being late, but the way she addressed it seemed so unprofessional and rude. I was planning to spend my boss an email (my boss is in another city, I'll only see her every few months) because Tammy is telling me I won't be working a time I'm scheduled to and I want to confirm that, but now I think I should also address this in the email as well, but I don't want to come off as a whiny little brat that had their feelings hurt. 

What should I say? I'm totally unsure of how to address this. Any advice would be super helpful.

tl;dr
I was a little late for work and my not so great co-worker over stepped by disrupting my class and embarrassing me in front of 100 people. I want to mention it to my boss, but I'm unsure of what to say.

EDIT:
I sent an email to my boss. I have to head to class now, when I'm finished and home I'll be back to better update this. Thank you all for the support though!

EDIT 2:
Oh my goodness this blew up. I posted hoping I'd get a comment or two that would tell me I was over reacting so I could let it go or help reassure me and push me to actually talk to my boss if I wasn't. All this advice and support is so sweet, so thank you all!!

 I sent my boss a quick email asking her if I should work the shift Tammy told me not to, and explained what happened. I tried to keep it as professional as humanly possible, but I did mention that I was embarrassed by it because my boss is lovely and seems to really care about all of us. 

I got a reply pretty fast. I am supposed to work that day, so no idea what Tammy's deal was with that. My boss said she was sorry it happened, that Tammy ""really likes me and considers me a valuable colleague"", and implied that Tammy's bull is tolerated, even if she does it to her. So... I guess that's bad news. Looks like they just put up with her because they can't find a full-time Librarian and my campus' library doesn't really matter, so long as it's open and staffed. Four months of this, oh boy this is going to be fun.

Tammy and I have always got along well. We chatted a lot while she was working and I was in the library studying. I think she does like me and has a casual respect for me. I'm sure she put in a good word for me when I applied, but it was easy enough to tell she's a bit of a snake and not someone to really trust. I figured so long as I did my job well and kept my head down I'd be able to deal with her, but I'm going to be more careful about everything I do from now on just to be safe. 

I sent my prof a message apologizing for the disruption and explained the situation. Haven't heard anything yet from him, but my schedule at the library has been changed so I start 15 minutes later in case class runs over again.

To better clarify the situation, as I mentioned in a few comments, the class was a video conference. There's about 30-40 students with me in my actual classroom, then around that amount in each of the other three locations, so that's where I got the 100 number from. I was seated in the front of the class, right next to the microphone, and right in front of the camera. Before this happened I was being an annoying know it all and answered a bunch of the professor's questions no one else knew the answer to, so anyone paying attention to the camera would have noticed me during that. This class is for my major. I'm overly passionate about the subject and engage with the Prof/others in the classes when discussions are on going a lot...so that really added to just how embarrassed I got. It wasn't her strolling into a huge lecture hall and making a big scene, but it was just as disruptive to as many students since the microphone was on right next to me and there's no way it wasn't heard by all the other classes.

I also mentioned in another comment that I had another ""Tammy"" in my past and that whole situation was incredibly traumatic. I don't like to tell people due to all the stigma attached, but I'm autistic and have some sensory and social issues. My old co-worker would slam cooking equipment around when she was upset and just generally made it very well known that she wasn't in a good mood. That really aggravated my sensory issues and put me on edge all the time. I'm in therapy dealing with that and other issues I face, but I tried to speak to my boss, then my bosses boss multiple times about what was happening with other Tammy. I think I didn't communicate the issues well with them and it was written off as me over reacting. Oddly enough, this Tammy and other Tammy share the same (real) first name. 

I don't want that to happen again. I really enjoyed that job and ultimately left because of other Tammy, and I'm enjoying this one, but don't want this Tammy to screw it over. I realize now there's a HR department at the school I can go to if things with Tammy go south, and I'm going to be sure to document everything properly to keep a paper trail if needed."
57,"I've [27M] been dating my girlfriend [23F] for two years without realizing her sister [26F] is my old FWB. Yesterday we visited her at their parents house and she demanded I not tell my girlfriend. However, I feel like I owe it to my girlfriend to tell her. What should I do?


Sorry for the confusing title, this is kind of a weird situation. Basically, in college I was really into the party lifestyle and had a number of casual sex partners. One of which was apparently my girlfriend's sister Kate, who I'd see a few times a month. We'd basically just get high and have sex, no real feelings or conversation or anything. Eventually for no real reason we stopped seeing each other, and I all but forgot about her once I graduated college.

4 years after that I had moved to a different town, where I met my current girlfriend Sarah through a work function. We've been dating for about two years and it's been going really well. After the new year we've finally both been able to take some time off, and we decided to visit her parents and her sister who live back in my old college town.

Well yesterday, after we had gotten settled in, Sarah's sister Amanda approached me and asked if I had told Sarah about us. I said I didn't know what she was talking about because I just met her. After some confusion it came out that Amanda is Kate and she had given me a fake name back then. I also didn't recognize her because she put on a ton of weight and has a radically different style now (colored hair and piercings). She literally looks like a different girl, and this was the last thing I was expecting 

On top of that she has demanded that I ""respect her privacy"" by not telling my girlfriend about our past. However, I feel like my girlfriend would want to know and would be really mad if I didn't tell her. On top of that, I feel like there's something else going on because ""Kate"" told me back in the day that she went to my college, but she's apparently an alumni of some other state college and never went to the college in town. And while I didn't recognize her on social media, she's had to have recognized me and has even commented on some of Sarah's pictures of us, so she's at least been lying to Sarah about knowing me.

I'm torn, do I respect Amanda's privacy or do I tell Sarah about our past? There might also be some fallout because Amanda has clearly been lying to her family, so if I am going to tell Sarah when should I do it? We're supposed to stay until next Friday, and Amanda lives with her parents so revealing this could make things awkward for everybody if I do it while we're still staying there. How can I navigate this situation while causing the least amount of drama?

**TL;DR: I've been dating my girlfriend for two years without realizing her sister is an old FWB. She lied about her name back then and her appearance has changed dramatically over the years, so I never recognized her on social media. She's demanded that I not tell my girlfriend about our past, but I feel like I owe it to my girlfriend to tell her. Additionally telling my girlfriend might reveal a bunch of other lies that her sister has been telling over the years, and I have no idea how damaging that could be to her family. What do I do?**"
58,"Lent my brother my car for 3 years because he needed it; just had a baby and told him I’m trying to sell it; he sells it and keeps 40% of what he got because of him having to maintain it all those years.. is he right? Am i crazy?


Hey guys  would really appreciate some input..

Title says it all. My dad bought me this car as a present 7 years ago. After 4 years I decided to sell it and get an suv i could share with my wife. 

My dad felt bad for my brother not having a car and asked me to not sell it and let him use it instead. I agreed. This was 3 years ago and this year my wife and i had a baby - my brother now has a good job and lives at home so his expenses are minimal and i asked him if he was ok with me selling my car and he was fully supportive. I had some trouble selling it given the fact that my brother drives it so finding time to meet with the buyers and my brother not having the car was difficult. Anyways he ends up selling the car last night.. he got $5k for it.. and proceeds to give me $3k and says “the other $2k is for me because i maintained the car all these years and need a down payment for my new car” ... im sorry but I could have sold this car for $10k 3 years ago.. he depreciated the value over the last 3 years and as much as he tried to maintain it the car had rust and other issues. I’m honestly in shock.. does he have right to do this? Am i over reacting? 

Honestly had he asked for a thousand i would have given it to him.. it’s just the entitlement that bothers me so much like he has a right to this car. 

To make matters worse my dad hears us arguing about it and decides to keep the money since he’s the one that bought me the car in the first place... is he right? Honestly i just can’t believe I’m going through this situation. I feel like my own brother is taking me for a sucker and it honestly hurts after i sacrificed selling my car 3 years ago so he could use it. This year i have a baby so our expenses have gone way up and we really need the money. 

Again i wouldn’t have minded giving him some money but he just took it and calls me greedy for wanting the full amount.. what do i do? Just let it go? I don’t know how i could look at him the same way after this.

***more context***

Ok so my dad bought me this car as a surprise, he surprised me with it on my birthday so he got it in his name. He put  $10k down and the $7k leftover he financed but i would give him $250 monthly to pay it off. I have no idea why but we figured there was no point in changing the name (i obviously never expected something like this to happen i have never had any reason to doubt my family). 

My dad has always said this is my car and that I could sell it or do whatever i wanted with it. He just felt bad for my brother and asked me to do him a solid until he got on his feet. They both knew i was looking to sell it now and my brother ended up (i thought) doing me the favor of selling it. But long story short, yes the car was in my dads name.. im feeling more and more like an idiot the more context i add to this :|

TL;DR lent my brother my car for 3 years and this year i asked him if i could sell it. He ends up selling it and proceeds to keep 40% of what he got because of all the maintenance he did for the past 3 years.. "
59,"I [30M] caught my girlfriend [26M] acting arrogant/rude to other women because of my job. I've talked to her but she won't admit it. What can I do?


Keeping this short. I've been dating my gf for 8mths, so I know it hasn't been long. She works as an English teacher and I work in high finance at a big bank. We live in Asia, so apologies for any awkward English. I work long hours but she's been very understanding and supportive and exactly what I'd want in a partner. 

Anyways, last weekend we had a roof party at my place and tons of people attended, lots I didn't actually know (friends of friends). I was walking around talking to folks, making sure everyone was having a good time, when I overheard my gf talking to a group of women. My back was to this group while I talked to another friend so I basically heard everything beginning to end. 

It started with a woman asking my gf what my work-life balance was. My gf said not great but that's what you gotta do for the money. Then this woman said that she was looking for a career in finance too so she might talk to me later to get some advice. My gf kind of chuckled then asked her what she's currently doing/where she went to school/etc. After hearing the replies, my gf openly laughed in a cruel, mocking way and told this woman that she'd have a better chance just sleeping with a director and getting her in that way, because her credentials were ""nothing to write home about and I know important people when I see them."" She said ""don't bother asking my boyfriend, you'd be wasting his time too... sorry!"" The woman didn't say anything, but the other women in the group kind of awkwardly chuckled. For the record, I've _never_ heard her talk like this. I was so surprised. I slid my way through the groups of people to separate myself from her but it made me feel uncomfortable to hear her talk like that. Her attitude was so arrogant, and furthermore it completely misrepresented what ACTUAL advice I'd give to that woman. 

After that I asked my girlfriend why she was being so rude to that random woman, that I would never tell someone they had no chance in any industry. She acted innocent and kept maintaining that I misheard things because the party was loud and it might not have been her talking at all. I am like 99% certain I recognized her voice and speaking tone and also the fact she said ""my boyfriend, [my name]"" (there is only one person there with my name), but obviously I can't prove it. What to make of all of this? Thanks.

**tldr** Caught my gf being very arrogant/rude to party guests while she thought I wasn't there. Confronted her about it but she claims it wasn't her completely. I'm pretty certain it was, but obviously I have no proof. What to make of this?"

62,"My sister's [24f] fiance [26m] played a cruel joke on my siblings and I [15m]. She broke up with him because of this. Now our whole family is upset with us for causing the problem. I feel so guilty and don't know what to do?


This happened a few weeks ago. Our mom works night shifts so during the night my siblings and I are home by ourselves. It's me (15m), my two sisters (18f &amp; 4f) and my older twin brothers (17ms). We have a much older sister that's out of the house and engaged (24f). So our sisters were asleep (it was very late at night). and my brothers and I were up playing video games. I got up to go get snacks from the kitchen, and on the way to the kitchen there's a window. When I was passing this window I see some sort of shadow. I went back to look thinking it was just me seeing something and it was actually a person. All I remember seeing is a person in dark clothing, just wandering around the backyard. I ran back to the living room and told my brothers, and when they came to look, the person was still there, but getting even closer to the door (we have a gate around our house so this person legit jumped or climbed over the fence). 

One of my brothers ran into our sisters' room and about a few seconds later came back half dragging both of them. At this point this person that was lurking around outside began banging on the door, and then it progressed to them kicking the door. I'm pretty sure we all thought this was a robber or someone dangerous in general because then my brothers took my sisters and I and locked us in the bathroom. After that everything that happened I didn't physically see, but a few minutes later we heard a whole bunch of yelling and things breaking. We stay in the bathroom probably for another half hour. Then one of our brothers come back up and tell us we're safe, it was really our sister's fiance. I was confused at first, but then they told us he was playing some sort of ""prank"" on us to see how we would react or some crap like that. I didn't find it too funny honestly. My sisters were crying and terrified, and in the process of them fighting, a lot of things were broken, and fiance was injured in the process. 

Our sister was very angry at him and we got the news that she broke it up with him a few days later. We all kinda feel guilty because we feel like maybe our reactions could of been over the top, but who pretends to break into someone's house. Our mother is upset with my brothers for giving him injuries but what else did he really expect. Everyone in the family is treating us differently now, with a sort of aloof attitude, and our aunt even made a comment about how we broke up a marriage, and should of just played along. Whatever that's suppose to mean. I don't know how to handle this from the family, because even though I know we shouldn't feel bad, I still do. How can I stop it from bothering me as much?

64,"My husband(27m) competes with me(24f) when I'm sick


We have been together for 9 years, married for 1.

I am chronically ill with heart disease. I've had 3 surgeries, my last one was last week, and 5 heart infections. All within the last 3 years.

I deal with the pain and cope mentally pretty well, but I do need bedrest after surgeries or with infections. Also have weight restrictions, arm restrictions etc.

Every single time I go through these things, but husband is suddenly sick/in pain also(mostly a ""pinched nerve"") and moans and groans all over the house, won't do anything because he's in pain. 

Last night he woke me up and asked me to put electrodes on his back because it hurts. I'm in pain too! I had surgery last week! It takes me hours to get comfy enough to fall asleep!

And he will not do any housework while I'm truly in pain, even asked me yesterday if I've had time to make dinner. I can't even drive! Also has asked to use my pain meds to control his pain. WHAT???

Tonight, I snapped(for probably the 4th time), told him I had no sympathy for this ""pain"" that he is going through, that I've had to tough it out every time to take care of myself and he expects me to take care of him. He went on about how he never feels comfortable being sick/in pain around me because I treat him poorly.

TLDR; Husband tries to out-do my pain all the time, what should I do?"

66,"My (24M) new girlfriend (23F) is upset because I am not running around telling everyone that I am dating a trans person. I don’t think that it matters that she was born with a different set of genitalia and don’t know why I need to ‘alert’ all of my friends and family?


Hey reddit, long time browser. I met my girlfriend at a bar close to a month and a half ago. She approached me and blew my doors off – she literally hit all of the things that I find attractive in a girl. Sarcastic and dry as fuck, kind, shorter than me, short dark hair, pierced nose, great aesthetic. Everything. She rocks. Anyways, we talked a lot that night, she gave me her number, and we went for coffee a few days later where she, very nervously, told me that she was trans.  

I definitely surprised her with my reaction because, while I appreciated her ability to feel comfortable telling me that, I didn’t really think that it was that big of a deal. She’s a woman. Just like if I had been born with an extra arm and had it removed when I was in high school or something, it wouldn’t make me any less of a man. Taking things slow, it took a few weeks before we met each other friends (really busy anyways). Eventually she met a few of my best guy friends and they really liked her – naturally, she asked me later what they thought about her. I told her honestly that they really liked her. Then she asked “And they were cool.. with it?”. I figured out that she was asking if they knew she had transitioned and I told her that I didn’t tell them and didn’t know why it was important to randomly blurt it out.

We got in a pretty big argument about this that has (sorta?) mended itself. It’s been about a week and a half and we haven’t really talked about it but she also has turned down two of my invitations to hang out with me and them again. I’ve asked her if she wants me to tell them about it and she says that it isn’t about that. Past that, I can’t really get much out of her. Does it make me a bad person or something because I’m not running around to all of my friends shouting that my girlfriend has a Y chromosome? It’s clearly not important to me and I don’t know why it should be a big deal because I haven’t told my friends that my past girlfriends were ciswomen.. And my social circle is really liberal anyways so I don’t think it’s that she thinks they will think less of her? 

Please help. I really like this girl but I don’t feel that it’s necessary whenever close to me meets her that I disclose that she is a trans person. Where does it end? My close friends? My not so close friends? My family? Work colleagues that ask if I have a significant other? I am PERFECTLY happy mentioning it if someone sees a high school picture of her pre-op or if it were to come up in some other way, but think that she is a woman and that it is silly to run around telling everyone without any context.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Great new girlfriend that happens to be trans. I think that she's upset that she met my guy friends (and made a great impression) and I didn't tell them immediately that she had transitioned. I don't think that it is a big deal and would address it if it came up."
67,"My (26f) mom (54f) passed away last week. It was expected so we are dealing. My sister (30f) wants to read a wildly inappropriate poem about mother’s abandoning kids at the funeral. Do we stop her or let her embarrass herself?


My mom passed peacefully last Wednesday. She has a multi year battle with cancer and she and we knew that the end was coming. Myself and my father have taken on the funeral arangments, though honestly my dad is really on/off in his grief.

There are four kids, I’m the youngest the sister in question is the second oldest. All of us but her remember our parents being loving, caring, even doting people who sacrificed nearly everything the could have had to be great parents. My sister on the other hand blames my parents, especially my mom, for all her problems. She blames my mom for her eating disorder, trouble with men, job issues, not finishing her degree, you name it. The rest of us don’t have any of these problems and for the most part we agree that our sister Issue is her own laziness and unwillingness to accept any responsibility for anything. My sister also has memories of events like physical @buse, screaming, abandonment and even being pushed out of a moving car...the other three of us have zero memories of these events (the time she was “pushed” out of car was supposedly coming home from my softball game, I remember it has she throwing a tantrum and smashed an icecream bar into my dads new car upholstery and we stopped and he made her clean it up). 

So basically my sister told my dad that she wants to read a poem at the funeral. He said ok. I called my sister and asked what poem it was, she said the name so I looked it up and it’s a Poem about a mother abandoning her child in a forest and the mother hating herself for it. There’s no happy ending, there’s no lesson to be learned and it doesn’t apply to our family situation at all. 

I tried to talk to my dad but he says basically my sister gets to grieve in her own way and to let her read the poem. This poem is so inappropriate it will make an already situation worse and shes going to embarrass the crap out of herself. She already is not well liked with our family and friends but this will mean many people won’t ever speak to her again.

Do I just let her read her poem and leave her fate to herself or do I try to maintain some dignity at my mothers funeral and tell her no?
