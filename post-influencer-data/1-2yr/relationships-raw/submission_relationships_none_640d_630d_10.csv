0,"[Update] My [23/M] girlfriend [21/F] of 1 year is going through the loss of her brother, but I have a hard time empathizing with people. I can't give her the emotional support she needs and I feel like an asshole.


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7iwjca/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_of_1_year_is_going_through/)

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. Randomly, she said “I love you”, and explained how grateful she was to be with me. She told me I was making it a lot easier to grieve her brother’s death, and she wouldn’t know what to do without me. She said I was the best boyfriend she could ever wish for and my company alone was helping her tremendously.

I couldn’t believe my girlfriend. She'd witnessed her brother die, was still grieving his death and yet could still find the strength in herself to make my day a little better.

I turned soft -- I felt something inside of me… something I’d never felt before. My eyes started to water. I couldn’t believe it. I was going to cry. My girlfriend saw this, and she couldn't believe it either. That was my trigger. I started bawling. For the first time in my life, I cried. I was embarrassed.

She started crying too, we embraced each other. I cried with her until my tears ran dry. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her because of my lack of empathy. I told her how unfair it was for me to put my emotional distress on her. 

My girlfriend was very receptive. She said it was okay for me to be emotional around her. She said helping me find my lost emotions was the most meaningful thing for her in the world.

My understanding of life has changed for the better ever since that day. I feel like a *real* human being. I’m able to understand what my girlfriend is going through. It took me 8 months, but I’ve finally started mourning the death of my brother. 

My girlfriend has been a lot happier these last few days. She says it’s a direct result of me finding my emotions. This couldn’t have been possible without her. I'm so grateful to have her be a part of my life. My love and undying gratitude for her can't be translated into words. She's the only woman that gave me a chance after hearing about my “condition”, and the only one to help me with it. I couldn't ask for more from my girlfriend. I love her.

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. She said she loved me and gave me compliments for being a great boyfriend. My eyes watered and I cried for the first time in my life. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told her how unfair it was for me to be putting my emotions on her when she's in a time of need. My girlfriend reassured me. She said helping me find my emotions was the most meaningful thing in the world for her. 

My understanding of life has changed since then. I feel like a real person now. Someone who can express the full range of emotions that a normal human should be able to. This all happened because of my girlfriend, I love her so much. I can empathize with what she's going through now, and fully support her in her time of need."
1,"[UPDATE] My [25f] boyfriend [27m] is cruel towards me, and while I know I need to leave, I don't know how.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hrdn8/my_25f_boyfriend_27m_is_cruel_towards_me_and/

I'd like to preface by thanking everyone again for the advice. You guys really hit home and gave me the courage to make the right choice. So seriously, y'all. Thank you. &lt;3

I broke up with E. I said I would go the text and block route, but I just couldn't do it. By the time I got the strength to, we hadn't spoken in a little over five days. I sent him a text message letting him know that I was pulling out of the relationship and would like some space and time to myself. He agreed, and a couple more days passed without us speaking. He messaged me to tell me that he was sorry but didn't think a breakup was warranted. I repeated that I needed time and space and left it at that. He apologized and complied but only for another couple days. He broke down and told me that I was the only real connection he had and that he didn't want things to end. That he wanted to prove himself to me and make things right. That he'd never hurt me again. I declined. It was hard as hell, but I stood firm in my decision. He was saying all the right things, but I knew it was all so very wrong. When I declined, he became petty and once again showed his true colors. He said that he couldn't believe I was the first girl to break up with him and he was embarrassed that a ""5'2"" little girl"" had played him this way. He said that he was only so mean to me because he was ""thinking of the bigger picture"" and needed to gauge my commitment before our LDR began (he reasoned that he needed to know how much I could take because he'd be stressed and I needed to be able to support him through his problems... what?!). I ignored him, and he finally sent one last apology before blocking me. 

While I wasn't as strong as I should have been, I'm still so proud of myself for finally putting my foot down. This ended a nasty cycle I allowed myself to get roped into. I was finally able to walk away. It hurts, but I know there are better things awaiting me in the future. 

E wasn't the only tie I cut. My relationship with my best friend wasn't the most healthy, either. She always liked to remind me of how desperate for love I was and told me I'd never leave E because I was too weak. She'd throw past relationships into my face, tear down my self-esteem, and throw me under the bus. I decided that if I wouldn't let a man treat me like this, why would I allow her to? So while I haven't sent her a break up text, I am slowly phasing myself away from the friendship. Instead, I am making new friends at work and have put so much more effort into my job this past week that I am actually on the radar for a small but significant promotion at work! 

I know this isn't the most exciting update, but I am super excited for what awaits me. I feel sad and a little lonely since I've cut out two of the most important people in my life, but I know that's just the fear talking. If I can land this promotion, I'll definitely be seeking therapy as a couple users suggested, and hopefully that will put me even farther on the right track.

Seriously. This sub gave me hope, compassion, and, most importantly, a backbone.  Thank you. &lt;3

TL;DR: I broke up with E, ended another toxic friendship, and have been bettering my life all thanks to your wonderful advice. "
2,"[UPDATE]I [20F] am a tutor for high school students, through my university. There is a (special needs) student [16F] who is making me extremely uncomfortable by being inappropriate with me. Is she out of line or am I just being judgmental?


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7aewnm/i_20f_am_a_tutor_for_high_school_students_through/)

First of all, I want to thank everyone for the incredible amounts of support I was given through that post. It was extremely scary for me, considering the circumstances, and I was shown nothing but a helping hand and I really appreciate it.

So, it has been awhile since I posted and I thought it would be a really good idea to post an update! I am actually sitting at work right now as I am typing this. This morning I took my last final for the semester, and I get to go home for the holiday’s tomorrow. So not only has time passed, but the semester is over which means I will no longer be working these hours in this specific lab!

I guess I’ll rewind a bit. If you did not read my original post, here is a quick summary of what happened: I am a tutor for high school students. I was hired in for a specific subject, which is a higher level math. I started seeing a student named Elle coming in pretty regularly. At first, she didn’t pay much attention to me, but soon after she started coming into my specific classroom and sitting at my desk every day that I worked. The classroom is set up like a regular school room that you’d see in the movies, with my desk being at the very front. So imagine that, and then a student coming in sitting with me for 5 hours. She would touch my laptop, read my text messages, ask my personal questions (like about my sex life with my boyfriend, who she knew about from reading my texts), she would hug me, grab my food and coffee, and talk to me about either irrelevant or VERY concerning things. Elle is special needs, and has a clear disconnect with being socially aware. I was nervous to approach anybody about my insane un-comfortability with Elle out of pure terror people would think I was being sensitive, rude, and judgmental.

After posting on here, I sent my boss a message saying I needed to talk. The next day I explained to her the situation and told her I was concerned for Elle’s safety based on the claims she was making to me. I told her I was uncomfortable with Elle being in my room because I felt like a therapist and babysitter, which is NOT what I agreed to when being hired in. I also explained that she was asking me inappropriate questions, and feared she was not learning proper boundary skills outside of the tutoring center.

My boss was very understanding and concerned. We took several steps to make sure Elle’s parents were not neglecting her (false allegation under Elle’s part) and that anyone bullying her at school would get in trouble (also a false allegation). We sent e-mails around to make sure everyone was on the same page with helping Elle learn basic social skills and how to not cross boundaries.

As far as what we did on our side, we implemented many no-touching rules in the center. No hugs, no touching the tutor’s personal objects, and making sure if you are sitting with the tutor, it is only if you need help with something.

And as far as what I personally did with Elle… I wish I could say something better but I really can’t. I avoided her for awhile. I was very uncomfortable, and it was going to take some time for me to gain the courage to tell her no. For a few days, one of my co-workers took her into his room to “watch” over. After that, Elle starting requesting to sit in my room. I felt ready, so we let her. She tried to hug me and I followed with a “No, Elle, I do not wish to be touched right now. I can give you a high five though!”. She tried to sit with me and I said, “No, Elle, nobody is allowed to sit with me unless they need help with homework. Do you need homework help?” If she tried to get my attention while I was with another student, I would say, “Elle, I am with someone right now. I will be with you in a second”. Every time I would tell her no, I made sure it was clear but nice, and would put my finger up, smile, and offer her an alternative.

I did that for awhile until recently, when she moved rooms again. I suspect she’ll be back to this room eventually but because the semester is over, I will be having a whole new class schedule. And this class schedule matches up better with a lab on the other side of campus, so I won’t be seeing Elle anymore.

I’m definitely glad I said something, because otherwise Elle’s behavior would have continued into her late teens-early 20s. Right now it is fixable, if she gets any older I feel as though it will be harder habits for her to break. Not just that but it could get her in some serious trouble by putting herself in danger. Imagine if she crossed boundaries with someone who did NOT tolerate it what so ever…. The school, Elle’s parents, and our tutoring center are all working really hard to make sure Elle learns these things properly. Thank you everyone for your help!!

Tl:dr; I gained the courage to talk to my boss. We made many changes and now we are working with Elle’s parents and school to help her learn social skills!

3,"[Update] My [21/M] girlfriend [27/F] of almost 3 years proposed to me a few weeks ago. I rejected it and our relationship hasn’t been the same ever since.


[Original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ioujo/my_21m_girlfriend_27f_of_almost_3_years_proposed/)

I wrote a letter to Sarah. I told her I was sorry for not being empathetic to what she was going through. I told her I didn’t understand how much the proposal meant to her. I apologized if what I said misled her into thinking it was okay for her to propose to me.

I listed my timeline. I said I'd like to be engaged around the time I graduated university and I wanted to get married the same year. I mentioned I was open to having children with her.

I gave Sarah the letter when she came home from work. She read it and we had a discussion about everything over dinner.  

My girlfriend apologized for mistaking my words as a green light for her to propose. She expressed regret for withdrawing physical intimacy and distancing herself from me for 3 weeks. 

Sarah explained to me how she never wanted kids or marriage at the beginning of our relationship, but seeing all her friends get married made her question that. My girlfriend realized she wasn't content anymore on staying child free and not getting married for the rest of her life. 

My girlfriend told me my timeline was acceptable for her. Sarah asked if I could be the one to propose to her this time - I told her I would. I’ve never seen my girlfriend so giddy with excitement before.

I’m glad we could come to a happy solution. I’m excited to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I love her with all my heart and I couldn’t see myself being with a different person. I know I’m young to get married, but I’m absolutely ecstatic to start a family with my girlfriend. 

Our relationship is back to normal, we have sex everyday and she’s comfortable initiating with me again. She doesn’t cry in secret anymore and we’re back to our regular levels of physical intimacy. 

I deeply regret rejecting her proposal because in reality this is what I wanted the whole time. I just needed a few days to seriously think about it. I'm glad my girlfriend has forgiven me for this. I know both of us are equally at fault because of our lack of communication but it really did suck having to reject her. 

---

**tl;dr:** I wrote a letter to my girlfriend explaining to her when I’d like to get married and that I was open to having children with her. Her and I apologized to each other for not communicating clearly enough. We agreed on my timeline and I’m going to propose to her next year when I graduate!

4,"UPDATE: I [26f] am feeling checked out of my marriage [28m].


TL;DR (from my last post) I (26f) am feeling checked out of my marriage with my husband (28m). Is it possible to come back from feeling this was through counseling and work, or separating a more viable option?


[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hmbcu/i_26f_am_feeling_checked_out_of_my_marriage_28m/)

I first posted at the very start if the summer. This summer was great, awful, draining and one I that I am so happy to see go. My fall was full of transition and hopefully, my winter will just be full of relaxation.


My (26f) husband (28m) (together going on 6 years now) and I started marriage counseling the day after I first posted. At the start of the summer, he was very committed to counseling, to fixing us, to pulling his weight and helping me carry my hypothetical water, unfortunately, I was hurt, bitter and angry, and nothing seemed to change my mind. I was checked out and could not see any reason to check back in. I began sleeping on the couch, in the spare bedroom or at friends as often as possible. I tried my hardest to show and create physical distance.We continued to try dates, but they would always devolve into fights or dramatic and exhausting conversations.


His changes tended to be superficial as well. By that I mean he would fix the surface issues, like dishes and sweeping, and ignore the deep-seated issues we had. About a month into therapy my husband admitted that he has been unhappy for over 2 years, so six months before we even got married. I have tried for years to get him to see a therapist on his own, because I believed he had depression, but he always refused. He said that his unhappiness led him to disengage from us, made him disinterested in us, was the reason all he wanted to do was watch TV and check out. Him admitting that was like finding a puzzle piece that makes everything clearer. Now I understood why I tried so hard, why I felt so lonely and neglected. He still refused to go into individual counseling.


I was drained, hurt and began to realize that his depression had infiltrated our lives and marriage deeply. I realized my husband didn't know how I drink my coffee, or what I eat for breakfast. Doesn't know I hate mayo, or constantly spill liquids on myself. There are lots of things he does know, to be fair. But I realized he has been disinterested in everything, including me. And unless I specifically stated something, or we got into a fight about it, he wouldn't notice. Now I know this sounds silly, but I want the person who I have been with for 5 years to know how I drink my coffee or know I always put my hair up when I am stressed and trying to concentrate.


His disinterest was part of the reason I felt so naggy, crabby and on edge so often,  because it was so incredibly hard to get through to him, it was partly why his interest in video games, beer, and DnD came before me. I also realized that my husband loved me in his own way, but his way wasn’t how I needed to be loved.


By fall I had begun to talk to him about separating and moving out. A talk that probably could have happened much sooner, but I still loved my husband and the life we created. It was incredibly hard to realize how broken it had become. I have lived on my own for 2 months now, and it is amazing. I am flourishing. My anxiety has decreased, I am able to solely focus on myself, my needs and wants and desires, and it is both overwhelming and fantastic.4


We have begun the process of divorcing. Which has been awful. Not because of how either of us is acting. But because it is just awful. It is tremendously difficult to realize how much this is hurting him, hurting me. It sucks completely to realize how a relationship can break apart and how someone I used to love so much, will no longer be apart of my life. But at the same time, I am looking forward to my future. There are times I am filled with panic and doubt, that I will be alone and I won’t find someone new. But I can’t let that fear hold me back, and stay in a marriage where I am so unhappy. That’s what I tell myself at least.I don’t know if I went into this summer and this process knowing that nothing would be able to fix us, knowing I was going to be reluctant. But I do know, I tried for a long time, and I became a bitter, unhappy and a sad version of myself. That isn’t who I want to be, nor is it someone he deserved to be married too.


I want to thank you all for your advice, support and chance to vent. I have read and re-read your comments countless times this summer. And screenshotted many of them and look to them quite frequently.


**TL: DR:** I (26f) moved out and divorcing my (28m) husband."
5,"A friend (24M) of mine (23M) apparently lied and told someone we slept together. Now everyone is congratulating me for coming out of the closet, and they think I am just lying because I am ashamed when I tell them I am not gay. The guy who lied refuses to tell the truth.


This is a really strange situation. I hung out with a guy I sort of know at a bar for a while, and he asked to see my gaming PC so we went over my apartment. Jokingly, his friends were saying we were going up there to fuck (I live above the bar). We did a tiny bit of coke while we were up there, hung out and played games and talked about the PC for like maybe an hour and a half or so, then he went back down and I stayed up there. 

While he was down there, I dont know what got into him, but he must have told his friends some story that ended with us having sex. Or its possible one of his friends just thought that? I have no idea, he was really coked up when he left downstairs so I assume it was him who told the story. 

the next day I awoke to a whole lot of people messaging me saying that they heard me and george (the guy) had sex and that they had no idea I was gay and they wanted to congratulate me and all that. I am not sure HOW this spread so fast, but 4 people hit me up. Apparently the rumor developed into not only did I have sex with him, but I also came out to him as gay? 

Either way, I wrote a FB status right there and then seeking to end this tirade, saying it didnt happen, me and george didnt do anything, its just some weird lie or rumor. A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. Another girl wrote as her status ""when straight guys call a gay man a liar about them having sex just to protect his masculinity"" and it was kind of obvious she was referring to me. 

I dont even know what to say. For one, I hit up george, I called him, its been 4 days, zero response. I am not even sure if I have the right phone number. I am not even sure if its HIM spreading this rumor at all, it could have just been someone who saw him go up to my apartment. I've gotten a few more messages from people congratulating me for coming out, and that ""they had no idea!"" and stuff like that. I've told every single one, sorry, its just a rumor, some of them were like 'oh okay sorry'  and some didnt even respond, presumably because they saw my status and that guy who commented on it. 

I don't know what to do. I dont give a shit if I was gay, but I don't want to be known as gay when I am not. Its just a weird feeling because people have accused me now of homophobia over this and I just feel terrible because I have no bad feelings towards gay people, but I just want people to know, I am not gay. Like, this isn't true, at all. But now everytime I deny it it just looks worse. One of my friends hit me up and she said ""look, I know you are denying it, but on the chance you are gay and just feel embarrassed thats okay too!"" and it just made me realize I may never be able to shake this off

What the hell do I do? I barely even know this george guy, he might never respond! 

Edit: In the title I said 'refuses to tell the truth', really its more like he isnt responding at all

8,"UPDATE: How do I [26F] stop feeling bitter about my immediate family's new lifestyle?


I got a lot of really great feedback from the original post about 3 weeks ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fka81/how_do_i_26f_stop_feeling_bitter_about_my/) and guess I just wanted to say thanks. 

It took a few days to digest what a lot of people were saying.  At the end of the day I hoped to approach the situation as me wanting to be close to my family again and basically trying to ignore the money part.  For the next couple of weeks if I wanted to talk to my mother I made sure to call at a time I knew she wasn't swamped with work (either before she left for the day or before going to bed) and if anything to do with money came up, it was treated as a side note. ""Oh dad won 4k last night online? That's awesome for him. Where are you travelling for work tomorrow? Have you been there before? Are you looking forward to it?"" and she just sort of.. opened up. I told her how I was feeling slighted, fully addressed the issue and even told her how I felt the slight favoritism towards my brother, because he was present, was getting to me. 

My mother is an extremely intelligent woman, reading back on my posts I think I stressed this a lot but she really, really is. We had our one super feelsy chat and moved on but she's been going out of her way to show me she's serious this time with actions not just words. I was over recently and before she dropped me off at home (we live about an hour away from one another) she stopped to at a store and remarked ""your dad and brother lost 600$ last night online, what kind of fucked up logic is it that I can't afford to buy you some groceries?"" . Our upcoming Christmas plans, which I was dreading, are now actual plans. She's picked out a theme for before and after dinner, neither which involve gambling, and is incredibly focused on us spending time away from a computer screen. Our gift exchange is a 20$ limit and she found some game online so that nothing is tailored towards anyone and we all feel included. She's been providing ideas for the wedding planning and even called me the other day saying ""Well you call me all the time and I was thinking about you so I thought I'd call you!"" just to chat. Overall... Im kind of stoked about where this is going. It's only been less then a month but I've never known my mother to commit to something and not stick with it so, I'm remaining hopeful.

Thanks for all the insight, personal experiences and words of advice for coping. I read every single one of those comments over and over for weeks so I figured some kind of update was warranted.

TL;DR: Talked to mom again. Used a lot of points from my previous post and communication saves the day once again. "
9,"Husband (28M) wants to leave me (29F) 35 weeks pregnant


So my husband and I have been together for 7 years and married for 3. We are expecting our first baby in January. This baby was planned, and wanted from both sides. I had a miscarriage back in January, and it was really rough on me.

I knew we fought, but I didn’t think our relationship had gotten to the point my husband did. We never fought over finances or big things, it was really just us picking/annoying one another. Last Monday, he told me he no longer wanted to be with me, but was going to stay until the baby was born so he was not leaving me at the house alone pregnant. Then he flipped it on Tuesday and said we will see how it goes, and we hung out like normal the rest of the week. We had a nice dinner out on Friday and on Saturday, we even had a baby shower together, and went to dinner with friends. Thats when I found the messages on his facebook with a coworker - expressing how awesome she is etc etc. I don’t think he has physically cheated on me, but now I know he has feelings for her but won’t admit it to me. He said he was irritable at work and felt bad and wanted to apologize to her - but during this multiple times he told her to hit him up whenever. Yes I snooped (shouldn’t have) and found these and confronted him. He was angry for snooping and told me we shouldn’t be together again. He stayed on the couch last night and I slept in the bed. I know he was on Facebook messenger during this time (which he used to never use until her - she is married too). This morning he said he was going to start staying in the basement with the fold out couch. 

I don’t know if he is thinking about us or is just staying down there so appearance wise he doesn’t look like a crudball who left his pregnant wife? He has being throwing these mixed signals to me. 

This is not what I want. This is not the situation I want to bring our child into. I just want him to hold me and tell me everything will be okay and we will work through the problems together. He refuses to see a counselor with me, so I was considering going alone. My heart is broken, and he knows it.

I am so lost and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is some kind of knee jerk reaction to being a dad next month or what. I am a nervous wreck and can barely eat. 

We have 2 dogs and I want them. If he leaves me, I want both of them. I take care of them, take them to the vet, feed then etc. I know he loves the dogs too so I am sure he would be fighting to get one of them. It’s unfair to split them up though. I was going to register them with the county (they haven’t been yet) in my name to maybe help with that.

Should I fight for my husband? Should I let him go? I know what he is doing is shitty, but I still want to be a family with him.

**TLDR** I am 35 weeks pregnant and husband dropped a bombshell of not wanting to be together on me - should i try to fix us?"

13,"[UPDATE] Me [23F] with my friend [23F], she cheated on her boyfriend/my friend [25M] and doesn't want to come clean


I decided to post an update even though the OP didn't get too much attention. Can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6bfrr9/me_23f_with_my_friend_23f_she_cheated_on_her/).

The TL;DR of the OP is basically this: My friend Sarah cheated on her boyfriend James, who happens to be my friend, too. She didn't want to tell him because he'd likely end the relationship and they had a big trip planned. I didn't know if I should tell him (my gut told me yes, definitely) or stay out of it.

After I posted here Sarah decided to tell James parts of the truth and told me to stay out of it. I decided not to do that since he deserved the whole truth. 

I wanted to tell him in person but he couldn't meet up because he was at a family gathering or something like it, I don't remember. He called and asked me what I wanted to meet up for and I told him the whole truth. That she cheated on him with her best friend, that she didn't tell him everything that happened, etc. I was worried she got to him somehow and that he wouldn't believe me, but he thankfully did. I still send him every text I had of her, which was probably incredibly helpful. 

While I was talking to him she sorta knew what was happening and drove over to his place immediately. When she got there he hung up and they talked. She tried to weasel her way out of it but since he had her texts that didn't work out too well. 

Before she came over he told me this was the last straw, especially since she lied to him about it and made out with said friend once before. I don't know what she did or what she said, but he did a complete 180 and suddenly he was okay with it. 

I've only talked to him twice since then and he told me that it's not such a big deal and they'd get over it.

I'm not a fan of my sister in law Jenny. In the last three years that I've known her she's done everything she could to drive me crazy. She enjoys it. She's always unnecessarily mean, makes fun of me and my friends and always criticizes everything about me.

My other sister in law Marry [31F] and I are close though, she's great. I sometimes look after her dog for her.

Last week Jenny just assumed that I'm going to look after her dog for a few days without even asking. I've never done this for her. She came to drop it off and told me (she did not ask) to take care of the dog for a few days. I told her that I won't do that. She asked for an explanation and I said I don't owe her an explanation and I don't care about her stupid dog. She got angry, called me a B-word and left.

Apparently she left the dog with a friend and the dog had an accident while at that friend's place and eventually died. I don't know the details as I never asked.

Jenny now blames me for this. She says that if I had agreed to take care of the dog none of this would have happened. She posted that on social media along with some rants calling me names. She received backlash from some friends who thought she was unfairly attacking me. She deleted everything later.

Now my mom tells me that she's spoken with Jenny and Jenny would like an apology from me for the pain that I've caused her. My mom and dad told me that I should apologize for turning down Jenny's request of taking care of her dog (it wasn't a request, it was an order), about calling her dog stupid and for causing the chain of events that led to her dog's death.

I don't think I did anything wrong. She is very rude and mean to me, why would I do her a favor when she's not even asking nice?

I told my parents that once Jenny apologizes for calling me the B-word and for her general meanness and rudeness and for the things she called me on social media, I will tell her how sorry I am that her dog is dead. But I won't apologize for not agreeing to taking care of the dog and I won't accept any responsibility for what happened.

My parents say they're disappointed in me.

Am I doing anything wrong here? Are they all right and I'm wrong and at fault here? Should I apologize?

20,"[UPDATE] My [28M] girlfriend [30F] got extremely upset because I didn't want to take a shower with her. I think she might be depressed again, but I don't know how to bring it up.


Hey everyone!


Here is the link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hype4/my_28m_girlfriend_30f_got_extremely_upset_because/


I’d like to thank everybody for their responses/ they were very helpful and eye opening. A lot has happened in the few days since I first posted, so I’ll try to summarize as well as I can. The showering thing – my girlfriend told me that her feelings are EXTREMELY hurt because taking a shower together is one of her favourite things to do with me. Every day she has cried about it because she doesn’t understand why I don’t want to do it anymore, why I can’t just suck it up and do it because I know it makes her happy, and now she says I have ruined showers. We came to a compromise that we would shower together 3x a week and she could pick which days.


I understand that she is hurt by this, but I do not understand her reaction. It felt very extreme and I think the heart of the problem is depression or something similar. I didn’t say anything specific, but I told my girlfriend that how she is feeling (sad all the time) and how she is reacting isn't healthy and not only is it affecting her, but it affects my happiness and our relationship. She admitted that she does feel sad and like life has no point and that she really over thinks things. She didn’t say anything about her anger or outbursts, so I don’t know if she doesn’t associate these things with depression or maybe she is embarrassed? But she said that she would visit the local walk in clinic the next day to see if she could get some medication. This is a good step, but I really think she should see someone more specialized. The other night she mentioned maybe seeing a psychiatrist but she doesn’t seem enthusiastic or open to the idea at all. Well the next day she was too tired after work, so she never ended up going to the doctor.


On Saturday we were still having this argument (it basically restarts every single evening around shower times). It was basically the same stuff – I hurt her feelings, she doesn’t understand, etc. She was getting extremely upset and said that I was trying to push anti-depressants on her when she feels that she doesn’t need it and that I know that she suffers from depression and it's just a part of her I have to accept. She deals with me being optimistic about life, so I can learn to deal with her hating life. I don’t understand how she can acknowledge there is a problem, but not want to do anything about it. 


Anyway, while she was angry I stepped outside. She then closed the door, locked it from the inside, leaving me standing in the cold (it was around -10 degrees and starting to snow) in the middle of the night wearing boxers and a t-shirt. While I was locked out she then got my phone and read through my text messages. I feel like this is just a whole other problem! I may have only been outside for 2 minutes max, but I didn’t know how long she planned to leave me out there in the cold. And then going through my phone?? She eventually opened the door to let me in and so I went to take back my phone and she grabs me and pinches me. Maybe I’m overreacting since I was only outside for a couple of minutes, but I was pretty mad about this. After I cooled down (or..warmed up, technically) she said she was sorry and that it was really mean. But it really felt like I was just…dismissed. It is really bothering me that she did that. I mean, what would you say if I was a kid and my mum locked me out of the house in the cold in my pyjamas? I think this is also added to the fact that she pinched me and in the past has pushed me, kicked me, bitten me, tried to strangle me, and punched me. 


This post is getting pretty long, so I’m going to try and wrap it up. At the moment she and I are in limbo, kind of teetering, break up or not break up? She was crying really hard yesterday and was very sad and offered we both go to counseling. So I know she wants to work on things. I know I have hurt her a lot emotionally, but how many times can I forgive her for hurting me physically?

21,"I[32F] just got a job outside the home, my husband[31M] of five years won't help with housework


For the entirety of our relationship, up until this point, I've worked from home, and only gone into the office 1x a month for a staff meeting. Earlier this year, I was offered a promotion, and a significant pay bump, but It would require me to work in the office and not at home. 

My Husband and I sat down and talked about restructuring housework, and I made a list of all the ""chores"" that needed to be done, and let him pick which ones he wanted. 

The two big ones that he added to his list were the dishes and the cat box. (Note: we don't have a dishwasher in our apartment.)

When I worked from home, I did the dishes every other day. I informed him of this, but told him he was free to set his own dish schedule so long as we had clean dishes to use and ""didn't get flies"". He agreed with this.

Now, however, he leaves the dishes until -every- single dish in the house is dirty. And if I need something specific to cook dinner (The stock pot, a large saucepan, etc) he asks for a list of what I want clean, and only washes *those* dishes. Which wouldn't bother me, except multiple times, I've gone into the kitchen and both sinks are full, the counter is covered in dishes, there are flies, and the dishes I asked for to make dinner are ""clean"" but covered in a thin film of grease. 

Every time this happened, I ended up doing all the dishes, while he comes into the kitchen and wrings his hands and talks about how guilty he feels that he ""let it get like that"".

Every time that happened, I'd remind him of what we agreed, offer to trade him different chores that don't need to be done as often, remind him that doing the dishes more frequently than ""There are none left"" makes it a lot easier. 

He would just wrings his hands, say he'd do it more often, let me finish the dishes, and nothing would change. 

Finally, I'd had enough, and told him I wasn't washing dishes anymore, and that every time I needed to make dinner and the dishes weren't done I'd order take out because the kitchen wasn't sanitary, and he'd pay for it. He agreed.

We've eaten nothing but takeout for the last week, and he's spent probably 200$ on it. I had hoped that'd be a deterrent.

I took today off work so I could take a mental health day. I went into the kitchen to get a drink, and there were flies everywhere. The dishes haven't been touched the entire time. I got fed up and did the dishes, but I'm so fed up with this. I don't have the time or the energy to do a ton of housework *and* go work in an office with other people all week (I have social anxiety, so it's very mentally and emotionally taxing). I've told him this, numerous times, and every time he says it'll change, and it never does. 

And no, he doesn't have depression. Early on in this process I suggested he see a therapist. He went for a few weeks, then came back and said he doesn't have depression or anything, he just has a hard time adapting to change. 

I love him very much, but this is driving me insane and making me just as uncomfortable at home as I am out in public. Are there any other things I should try besides just saying ""if you don't do the goddamn dishes I'm leaving?"" It's so infuriating because he RECOGNIZES there's a problem, agrees with me verbally, but never does anything, and this is the ONLY area of our life where he doesn't seem to take anyone/anything else into consideration. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My husband picked doing the dishes as one of his chores. He never does them, and I end up doing them. I tried making him buy takeout every day he didn't do dishes and that didn't get him to, even after he spent &gt;$200 on takeout."

23,"[UPDATE] Me [24F] with my friends [27-32 M/F] of one year, they make questionable decisions and I am unsure if it's time to cut them off


[link to last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7iknqt/me_24f_with_my_friends_2732_mf_of_one_year_they/)

**tl;dr** of my last post: my new group of friends are very welcoming and invited me to a concert, but once I found out they were all bringing insane amounts of cocaine to do at the show, I was questioning if I should go. 

All of your responses really validated what I was already feeling: I have no obligation to these people and if I felt uncomfortable, I should not go to this concert. I just had a ""gut"" feeling about it, that it was a bad idea.

So the concert happened on Monday night. I was really sad that I was missing out, watching their snapchats stuck at home studying in my pajamas. For a few hours it really looked like they were having a blast.

Well as it turns out...One of the more wild girls in the group bought coke that I guess was a lot stronger than she thought, and/or she did a lot more of it than she normally does. This girl also has some sort of heart condition (she never told me what it was, just mentioned it in passing awhile ago).

She ended up having an embolic **stroke** right at the concert venue. She was rushed to the emergency room. I don't know what the details are of what happened after that, but I do know that she is now in the hospital with a fucked up eye and will have to do rehab for months to walk and talk like normal again. She was only 31. Had a stable job and her whole life ahead of her, who knows how long she is going to be out of work now.

I learned all of this from the group text and I was about to express my sympathies and even offer to visit her in the hospital when I saw a snapchat from two of the other girls from the concert group. Both of whom were there during the stroke. It was a selfie of them at home, and in the background of the picture I saw lines of coke and a credit card on their coffee table.

At this point, I noped the fuck out. I do not want to be friends with people who witness their friend nearly die from a cocaine induced stroke, and proceed to cope by doing MORE coke like the next day. How much more of a wake up call do you need? I left the group text with no explanation and deleted them off snapchat. If they try to text me, I'll be blocking their numbers.

Say nope to coke, kids.

25,"[Update] My [25F] mom [47F] doesn't think I have a right to privacy. Arguments happened. Now how do I handle Christmas?


(Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ixiie/my_25f_mother_47f_doesnt_think_i_have_a_right_to )

Hi all,

I did post something a few days ago, but the mods removed it. Plus I wanted to add a couple of other thoughts/developments.

My mom and I had a very long fight on the phone on Monday. It was ugly. Like, really ugly. I only shouted once, which I immediately apologized for. 

However, I was told I was a brat, how I am being manipulated by this man I'm seeing, that I'm not nearly as smart as I think I am.... list goes on. I was called a liar, but when asked, she couldn't tell me what my lie was (it was some twisted point that didn't make any sense, apparently. Idk.) I was told again that me asking for privacy was indicative of being embarrassed of this man I'm seeing, that I have something to hide, blah blah blah. I mean, I could keep going on.

I repeated to her over and over that I don't appreciate being told how I feel about something because it's both rude and not true. I'm not embarassed. As I said in my last post, there is an age gap, but neither one of us knew until we sat down for a drink together. It honestly surprised us. But we are just taking things once step at a time.

I also reiterated my right and need for privacy and for my desire to be an adult. I was ignored. 

The conversation ended with my mother saying ""you just wait until your dad finds out and see how happy he is about this"" (said with extreme malice). She also said, ""since you clearly don't want to tell me, let me save you the trouble: I won't ask you about your life ever again."" And she hung up.

That stung. 


As dor the dad threat, I should preface: my dad and I don't always have the best relationship. But while talking with my mom, I was actually on my way to meet my dad for dinner. I made the decision to cut off this perceived threat at the pass.... and I told him.

In fact, I told him the way I WANTED to tell my mom (in person), but because of mom's nosiness, it was done over the phone and shit hit the fan.

Anyway, I braced for my dad freaking out... and he laughed. 

""That's it? That's not such a big difference.""

I was floored. 

""You don't care?""

""Hell no. So long as he makes you happy and he treats you well, I'm happy for you.""

You guys, my dad. Lmao. He did have some concerns, but was respectful about the entire thing, and his concerns are the kind you'd have for your daughter in any relationship. He also heard everything about the argument with mom, and feels everything I did was in the right. He even agreed that not telling her right away on the phone was a smart decision, and was glad I told him in person!!! (Can you say, vindication?!) He told me, ""You're an adult. You have a right to privacy. Your mom may not like it, but it's true.""

So. That being said. My mom actually contacted him yesterday and was trying to bring this entire issue up to him, apparently. I can only assume she was making good on her threat of ""wait until your dad finds out."" She wasn't able to, but I am absolutely shocked she is stooping this low to pit my dad against me. The fact she's trying to covertly slip this info to him to get him on her side disgusts me and makes me see her in a whole new light. I'm now even more angry.

But yet, I feel light. I feel better than I have in a long time, and my guilt is lessening by the day, especially since my dad was so supportive.

I guess, my question is... now what? Christmas is coming. How do I handle this? I'm supposed to see her Christmas morning and I'm still getting the silent treatment. She shows no signs of reaching out.

Y'all are the best, by the way. Don't ever forget it.

27,"[update] My SO [M35] devotes all of his time to his hobbies. I [F25] am feeling pathetic and needy.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77y29p/my_so_m35_devotes_all_of_his_time_to_his_hobbies/

My last post wasn't incredibly popular, but I got a ton of great advice and figured I'd update. Before I get into it, I want to say that I read every comment from my first post multiple times. A few in particular have been stuck in my mind for the month or so since I've posted.

Quite a few commenters thought the relationship was salvageable if we made time to hang out together, so I talked to Rex about planning a specific time to hang out. He said he would consider it, but that never came to fruition. 

Rex started spending nights away from home to relax from all the work he was putting into the project mentioned in the first post. Meanwhile, I stayed up, anxious until the morning waiting for him. He didn't want to be monogamous and wanted to meet new people. He didn't want me coming along with him because ""if that new person just happens to be an attractive girl, he doesn't want me to get jealous."" Yes, the wording is awkward but that is how he conveyed it. 

Compounded by the former issue of disparate expectations for the time we spent together, the relationship was over.

...until last week, when he proposed! It was finally my chance to trap him-- just kidding. We broke up of course. 

I think I freaked him out because I became so happy and unburdened during the breakup conversation. I was smiling and laughing, almost in a state of euphoria but also calm, and he definitely wasn't. He did agree that were both unhappy and had mismatched expectations. (Props to the commenters on my last post who said exactly this.) 

One complication is that neither of us can afford to move out of our apartment. We live in an expensive area and it's very much a cliche that couples stay together until the lease is up. And yes we're still sleeping together. 

I haven't really come down from the initial post-breakup good feelings. There is nothing he could do to upset me, because I have no expectations from him, and that feels amazing. In my last post, I mentioned that I felt I would fall for someone who gave me what I was missing from Rex, and nowI 'm distracted and slightly overwhelmed by all the possibilities.  

Rex is not doing as well. He seems tired, sad, and anxious. And he started doing all the things I wanted when we were dating. He actually invited me, for the first time, to go out to the bar with him. It was weird to be the place he was always retreating to. He has stayed home with me, telling me how I'm the best, etc. It would have been nice when we were dating, but now I'm over it. I made very clear that it's over and I don't love him or trust him to love and care for me. 

I've been in a few fwb relationships that were casual and we never fought. The guy would fall in love with me bc he thought I was incredibly laid back, when truthfully I just didn't care about him. I think this is what's happening with Rex as well. It's as if he's into me now because I don't care about him.

I don't have a question really. I feel too inside of the situation to even know what to ask. It's all very empowering, but in an ominous way.

tl;dr He didn't want to spend time with me and wanted to be with other women. We broke up. He is suddenly acting into me again, I don't love him. "

35,"My [26F] cousin [26F] and her much older SO [50M] are staying in my house, and he talks to me like I'm a child.


I had a great year career-wise, and I was able to buy my first house about six months ago. My cousin Sam and her boyfriend Jerry were moving to my city for Jerry's work and were having trouble finding a place, so I offered to let them stay with me while they got settled. Sam and I were best friends growing up, but haven't spoken much in the last few years. I've only met Jerry once and thought he was okay, but to be honest I was a bit weirded out by their age difference - he's literally our fathers' age.


Anyway, they've been staying with me for about a week and the dynamic has been really strange. Jerry doesn't seem to know how to talk to me unless he's giving life advice or asking about my ""plans for the future."" It's like he's an awkward uncle asking his high-school aged niece about her college plans. Over dinner the first night, he asked how long my parents had owned this house and when they moved out - he thought it was my childhood home that mommy and daddy were letting me stay in. He's also expressed surprise that I do basic adult things (""Wow, you do your own taxes?"") or asked me if I know about things that every grown person knows (""Have you ever heard of a 401k?""). I don't really know how to explain it, but his tone towards me is just really strange and not appropriate for one adult talking to another adult who's currently letting him crash for free in their house. 


I find all that stuff irritating, but he is a lot older than me so I'd be willing to write it off if he was an uncle or something. However, the fact that he's dating my cousin who is the exact same age as me strikes me as very odd. I haven't noticed him treating her like she's a kid, but I also haven't spent too much time with them (by choice). The dynamic just seems so skewed, and I don't know if it's worth bringing up with her. Part of me wants to ask her if he talks to her in such an infantilizing way, and part of me just wants to tell them it's time for them to get a hotel and then go back to not really talking to her.

37,"My [38M] low-contact mother [59F] totally lost it when she learned that my new wife [39F] would have almost the same name after the wedding. I'm so tired of dealing with her.


I'm at a bit of a loss with regards to my mother and would appreciate some suggestions about how to handle her. Sorry if this gets long. Just fyi, I don't have any siblings.

My mom and I don't really have much of a relationship to speak off. She was never a warm or affectionate parent, but as long as I performed to her expectations, everything was all right. If I didn't, there'd be a lot of shouting and belittling. Like when I had a depressive episode while getting my master's degree and she told me that I was a total disappointment and she was ashamed to have me for a son. Fun times. 

I'm good now though. Good job, nice home, adorable dogs, not a lot of contact with my mom except for birthday and Christmas texts. We live in the same city, but haven't seen each other in four years. I occasionally reached out, but she doesn't seem terribly interested in having an actual relationship with me. My dad (who divorced her when I left for college) is awesome and I love him and his new wife to bits. They are wonderful and warm people. 

Now for the recent issue. I just got married. Yay! In our country, religous ceremonies aren't legally binding, so we had to have a civil union first. The big party with friends, family and our church is next summer, but my fiancée and I spontaniously decided to have the civil union now. Just the two of us. We took a weekend trip to the beach, got hitchend and it was generally perfect. :)

We didn't tell many people beforehand, but somehow word got to my mother. The day before the ceremony, we were driving to our destination when she called. This was the first time she called in something like five years, so I didn't exactly have a great feeling about this. Unfortunately, I put her on speaker so my sweet wife had to hear all that. 

My mom was livid. I could hear her angry-smoking the whole time. At first I thought she felt bad because I hadn't told her about the civil union beforehand so I explained that the actual wedding would be next summer. But she didn't care. She just hissed, ""is it true that she is taking my name?"" (Short explanation: My mom's name is Mary. My wife's is Mary-Elizabeth.) Huh. I told her that yes, my new wife was taking my name and she interrupted me to say that this was unacceptable. 

Her reasoning was that since they both work in the same field, it would be too confusing for others. Mom is a pharma rep, wife is a doctor. While they both work in health care, they have so far never crossed paths professionally. It's not exactly a small town we live in. Also, our family name is fairly common around here. I work in the same field as well.

Mom said that all my wife would have to do was hyphenate her name. I told her we had talked about that option but decided against it. Now mom was really angry. She said it was unacceptable that ""a woman with her past and reputation will carry my name. There's no way. I will do anything in my power to legally prevent it."" Short explanation: my wife suffered from burn-out about 10 years ago, before we met. Her career imploded quite publicly at one point, but she made a full recovery and everything is all right now. Her career is back on track and she takes great care of her physical and mental health. She's generally very open about what happened to her, which is not all that common in this profession. 

(Side note: I find the idea of my mother going to a lawyer and saying, ""My 38 year old son got married to a woman and she took MY NAME! You have to DO something!"" hilarious.) By the way, my mom has only met my wife once at a birthday party many years ago. We weren't even dating back then, just friends. I don't think they even talked that night. They just happened to be at the same party.

Anyways, when my mom realized that none of this was getting her anywhere she started a confusing rant about how paying for my education nearly drove her into bankruptcy (she never paid for my education, I took out loans for both my degrees. Just finished paying them off last year actually.) and stated that, ""if you two go through with this, I will make sure you both regret it."" I told her that if she wanted to threaten us, she'd have to be a little less vague. She just huffed and said she hoped we had a fun ceremony, then hung up. 

Well, and here we are. All this happened three weeks ago, but I don't really know how to proceed. I told my dad the whole story and he said, ""well, at least she won't come to the wedding."" He simply cannot imagine not inviting your mother to your wedding. 

My wife has been wonderfully supportive and laughed it all off rather than be offended. She thinks I should cut all contact immediately (which would basically amount to not sending a Christmas text), but honestly.... it's hard. I still find it difficult to cut her off. Is that normal? I don't want to invite her to my wedding, because I feel that only people who support our relationship should be there. But yeah, it's hard. Sometimes I'll see a woman who looks a bit like her and my heart still speeds up. Because she's my mom and I haven't seen her in years. I miss her, or rather, I miss having a mother who cares. It all sucks. 

So... should I just cut my losses and not contact her anymore? Should I send her a final message, a letter or even call her? I'm honestly exhausted from trying to have a relationship. Is it all right for me, as the son, to give up?

38,"My [19F] pregnant SIL [26F] is cold and short with me, but kind to everyone else


Using a throwaway just for privacy reasons. Sorry if this gets long at all.

My sister is a lesbian, and married her wife a year ago. They receive financial support from my parents (they're wealthy, and generous), have good jobs, and as such, have decided to have a baby. Currently, her wife is about six months pregnant, and the two of them are visiting for holidays. I'm in college, so I don't see them very often (yes, my parents give me financial support as well- everything is fair and square), but I'm really excited for their baby. My sister and her wife had been dating since their senior year of college, and were friends since childhood before that. I'm 7 years younger, so I was kind of left out of the loop. I never knew my sister's wife until they got married, and even then, I was swamped with my first year of college, so I didn't *really* ever get to know her. I was really excited though for this trip, since we'd get some one-on-one time together!

Our parents live about two hours away from my sister and her wife, and I flew in from across the country. We're all staying with our parents, who are not yet retired. My flight got in yesterday late at night, so I slept in. My parents went to work, my sister went to go do some shopping. My sister-in-law stayed in with me, but I didn't realize she was around until she came downstairs while I was making lunch. She's pretty obviously pregnant, and I haven't seen her since her wedding- so I was really excited to see her. She was not. I said hi, and went to hug her, and she backed away. I apologized, and she just kinda looked at me weird, and went looking through the fridge.

I tried to make small talk with her, so I asked when she was due. She gave me a really weird look, like I'd asked what her cup size was, and then just said March and kept making her food. I said I was really excited to have a niece or nephew, then asked if she wanted a boy or girl. She sighed really loudly, said she didn't care, and moved on. My sister had mentioned that her wife had PTSD due to a previous pregnancy, so I worried that might've been it. I tried to shift the subject, and asked how her work was. She set her knife down really loudly, stared at me for thirty seconds, then said ""fine"" and went into the dining room without saying anything else.

Throughout the day, I kept just trying to interact with her. Offered to get her a drink while I was in the room, she just muttered no, asked what she was watching, ""you wouldn't know it"" (it was the *Simpsons*), said I was really glad she was spending the holidays with us, a very begrudging ""yeah."" Really, I thought this must just be how she is. Then, my parents and sister came home, and she was super cheery and nice to them. My dad was asking if they had names picked out, and she just wouldn't stop chattering on. My sister said she wanted a family name, and her wife insisted on a unique name. My mom pointed out that my name (Anais) isn't very common, but it's also a family name (same as my grandmother), and they should consider it. I said I wouldn't mind having a niece with my same name, and my sister was really enthusiastic about it. Her wife gave me a death glare.

I just ended up getting the silent treatment! At dinner, I asked if she would pass the potatoes, and she didn't listen. I repeated myself, she ignored me, and then my sister told her I had asked for her to pass the potatoes. Suddenly, she was all bubbly and giggling ""guess I didn't hear!""

What do I do? Should I tell my sister? Directly challenge her? I have very positive relationships with my parents and my sister, and I want to be really involved with my niece/nephew, so I really don't want to go 100% no contact or anything. How can I try to resolve or at least get over this?

TLDR: My sister's pregnant wife is weirdly cold and kind of short with me. What to do?

UPDATE (as of this morning): So, we all had breakfast together. I sat across from my sister, between my parents, with my SIL kitty corner to me. My SIL actually SPOKE TO ME!! But it wasn't all that positive. She asked if I was seeing anyone, in kind of a snarky tone. I said no, school was really busy, I just didn't have time, etc. She responded, ""Well, not everyone finds someone."" My sister tried changing the subject, asking my parents whether or not they'd gone to their winter home yet (they're those rich people). My SIL was *so* nice to them. She was saying what a gorgeous house it is, how grateful she was to have been able to take a vacation there with my sister last month. My mom is easily flattered, so once my SIL got started, she started gushing about her, and it was just a mush fest.

After breakfast, I offered to go take our dogs for a walk. When I came back, my parents had left with my sister to go shopping again, and my SIL was the only one home. She asked me how I was liking college, and I said I was liking it a lot. I major in pre-dental, started talking about it a bit, and she rolled her eyes. I apologized for oversharing, and she said, ""No. It's fine. You just have a problem with reading the room, I guess."" Then, she walked away. When my sister comes home, I'm definitely going to tell her about it."

I’ll try to only give relevant info, 

I’ve been friends with most of these people for a couple years. They’re mostly co-workers.

One of my girlfriends is moving across town this weekend. She and her boyfriend aren’t loaded on money, so instead of hiring a moving company, they rented a U-haul and offered beer to all of our friends for anyone who could come over to help.

My husband had to work on Friday, but I asked him to drop me off at their house so I could help out. I’m not exactly a weight-lifted, but I figured any little bit would help and I wanted to help a friend in need.

In what proved to be a tragically stupid move on my part, I helped another friend pick up a really heavy air-conditioning unit........thing. I don’t even know what the heck it is. A big heavy piece of machinery, basically. I managed to keep up my end all the way up into the truck, but there was some confusion when my lifting-partner and I went to set it down. I think he said something about letting go, but I didn’t really hear him, and when he dropped it my left hand was still between this thing and the shelf we were setting it on. It smashed my hand *hard*.

I’m not ashamed to admit (okay, maybe a little ashamed) I shrieked when my hand got smashed, and I was openly crying when I climbed down from the truck. 

My hand hurt so bad I thought it was broken and it was already swelling bad, so I told my friend that I felt like I needed to the hospital. The one friend who had lifted it looked at my hand and said that it didn’t look “too bad” and I would probably be fine with some ice. 

I could barely even think with how much pain I was in, so I reiterated that I really felt like I should go to the ER. The friend who owned the house told me that no one there was sober enough to drive me in, so I’d have to call an ambulance if that is really what I wanted to do.

Instead, I called my husband. He left work early and once I was able to tell him what happened in between sobbing and came to get me.

It seemed like my hand was hurting as it swelled up more and more, and by the time my husband got there, I barely felt like moving. He wound up physically carrying me to the car and took me to the hospital.

To sum it up, I had some of the smaller bones in my hand are fractured, and there was serious bruising and swelling. All-in-all, I should be fine as long as it is given time to heal.

I shot a text to my friends letting them know what happened, and maybe I also wanted them to know I was actually hurt and not just overreacting like they seemed to think.

I was next scheduled to work tomorrow, but it’s just not going to be possible without my hand (I’m a hair stylist) so I stopped by work today to chat with the boss and let her know what was going on.

When I went in, my friend that had been lifiting the Ac unit with me saw me come in and asked if my hand was better. I told him I felt better since the doc gave me some good drugs, but I’d probably be out of work for a while. He gave me a look like he didn’t really believe me and said something like “Oh, well *that* must be nice.”

I told him it really wasn’t, since I’d rather be doing my job than nursing a busted hand, but whatever. 

The boss was cool, she told me just to take what time I need and call her when I’m ready for shifts again. But then when I was leaving the office another coworker (the one who owned the house the accident was at) said loudly to coworker #1 “Hey be careful around [OP], we don’t want her to have to call her husband to carry her out of here, too!”

I fake-laughed at the joke, but the tone of voice made it sound like it wasn’t really meant as a light-hearted joke, and it upset me that it was said loudly while clients were in the salon.

While I was walking out, same coworker said something like “Have a good vacation”, again in a tone of voice that seemed less than sincere.

I’m home now, I’ve noticed my friends are largely ignoring my messages. And I’m a little humiliated by what was said at work.

I don’t really know what to do here. I love my job and I would much much much rather be there than sitting here in bed with one working hand, and it makes me angry that people are implying that I’m faking it or something. What do I do??

42,"I [26/F] humiliated myself at a company Christmas party. How do I recover?


We started drinking at around 6 PM and the drinks were all free, so needless to say I took advantage (regretfully). I'm a huge lightweight, but once I get going I just don't stop unless someone practically forces me to. 
I probably had at least 9-10 drinks ranging from mixed drinks to beer. 

A lot of the night is a blur, but unfortunately I do remember asking two of my coworkers if they wanted to have sex, in so many words. I can't remember entirely how I asked them, and that's part of what terrifies me. Neither of them are in relationships or anything, so there were no SOs that I disrespected in the process as far as I know.

I do remember apologizing profusely several times later in the night to at least one of them. Luckily, I don't see them around the office because they work remotely... However, I also told SEVERAL people what I did throughout the night. 

I already plan on significantly curtailing my drinking because I do think it's a problem that I want to change. 

I have no idea if this is even the best place to post this, but I'm pretty terrified of losing my job now as well as my professional relationship with others at work.

43,"My (32F) grandfather (83M) picked up a woman in her 30s tonight, took her to dinner, and she stole his car.


My grandma died three years ago and my grandpa has literally been lost without her. We are all lost without her, but especially him. They would have been married 60 years this month. He is lonely and is literally looking for love and just basic companionship in all of the wrong places. I would love to be there for him more but I work crazy hours and live four hours away.

He called me tonight and told me he saw a lady panhandling and wanted to help her out. They spent some time together and he took her out to eat. She left his jacket in his car and asked him for his car keys to go get her coat because she was cold before their dinner came. He said the food came and he ate and then went out to look for her. Both she and his car were gone. He called the police. The police ended up finding the car only after she led them on a high speed chase and ended up crashing. She fled the scene and somehow evaded being caught. There is a special place in hell for a person who would take advantage of a lonely old man. 

I told him to please try to make smarter choices and he said, ""Sis, I'm so lonely it hurts."" The more I think about him saying that, the more sad I become. I wish I could help. He goes to the occasional senior citizen's dance but that does not seem to be filling the void. 

What would you suggest for my grandpa? I want him to have a purpose and a will. I hate to see him hurting and lonely. I hate to see him being taken advantage of by low lives (and this is not the first one).

44,"So it turns out it's not that my father [36 M] didn't want to have anything to do with me [17 F], he didn't even know about me in the first place!


The story I got told at 14 was that my dad wasn't my biological father, he was the man who married my mom after I was already born, and basically my mom and dad thought at the time I deserved to know this because a few people in our environment kept saying how I didn't look like him and I was asking them if I was maybe adopted or something. Yeah, I know. 

Very little was spoken of the man my mom got pregnant with, but the basic gist of it was that he didn't care about mom being pregnant, didn't want a child in the first place and then she didn't want anything to do with him any further, so she cut all contact (no child support because my mom's family is well-off).

I won't bullshit you and say I wasn't hurt, but I got over it quickly enough with the help of my mom and dad. Sadly, mom and dad got a divorce last year, just felt like they didn't love each other that way anymore, I guess. They're still good friends with each other though, no drama, for which I'm grateful. Still, this sort of prompted me into thinking about my biological father lately and I ended looking him up online. Dunno what I expected to see really, but he's just... normal, I guess? I might have been thinking he'd have this kind of asshole look to him because of how he rejected me before I was even born. 

Anyway, one night after drinking more than I should with some friends on a night out, I did a stupid thing and sent him a message, basically accusing him how he's horrible, evil and other less polite words, because of how he abandoned me. 

Next morning, after I actually remembered what I did, I see his reply to me. It's polite, but confused and he has no idea who I am or how I'm supposed to be related to him (I had my dad's last name), saying in the end that I probably got the wrong person, and wishing me the best. I don't know, it just pissed me off, even though I was sober (and a bit hungover), so I fired up several paragraphs to him about who exactly I am, who my mom is and what he did to us. His reply came in the evening and it was quite extensive, but I'll sum it up for you: they broke up with each other, on bad terms, after they were together for a little over a year, she never mentioned any pregnancy to him and when he tried to contact her later afterwards, because he felt like shit how it ended, she rebuffed him and blocked him and that was the last time he tried getting in touch with her. 

Needless to say, me being pissed off at him was gone in a flash, and now my father was the one angry at my mom for doing this. I was wondering how to talk to my mom about what I found out, but I didn't have to bother, because my father contacted her first and confronted her about her hiding me from him. 

We're getting to know each other slowly, mostly over the internet, though we talked a few times over a video chat, because he doesn't live in the same country as us. It'll be time soon enough to meet IRL and I'm nervous like hell, but by all accounts and the way he's talked to me, and held back on sharing me with the rest of his family, I think I'm going to like him a lot. 

Why the fuck did she do it? She says she has no idea why she really did this, blames it on pregnancy and stuff, but I don't see how the pregnancy could have influenced her for my whole life. I love her, but there's times when it's just the two of us and I can't help but hating her for denying the both of us a chance to know each other as I grew up. I can tell my father is hurt about this, though he doesn't talk about it directly. And my mom probably can guess how I feel, given that she just starts tearing up at times she sees I'm angry or being curt with her.

I'm split in half, happy when I'm talking with my father, but mad like hell when I talk to my mom after. I want all this to get better, but at the same time, I want her to hurt. What do I do now?

46,"UPDATE: me (19f) uncomfortable living with roommate (19f) after new information has come to light about how she’s acting while we’ve been living together


My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ip58g/me_19f_uncomfortable_with_my_roommate_19f_because/?st=JB7GW3C1&amp;sh=bd47b0b3

I know not a lot of people commented on my original post, but I figured those of you who did take the time to give me advice (thank you, by the way) would be interested in what decisions I’ve made about the situation.

I had my meeting with my RA on Sunday (4 days ago) and she told me my options, which I pretty much already knew. I decided that I would think about it for a few days and see how it was living with Molly, and see if I could just turn the other cheek and then GTFO at the end of the year, as I originally planned.

At first I was doing really well. I was polite but not over friendly/over sharing, she was the same. But then the second we would stop talking to each other, she’d get on her phone. So far, Danielle has not told me about any other posts regarding me, but it still made me very anxious, to the point where I would get nervous if she just checked a text. I realized that this was going to be how it was all semester if I continued to live with her.

So I reached out to my friend (we’ll call her Isabelle), and asked if she was still up for me moving in with her. She was enthusiastic, and we started doing all the things we need to do to officially move me into her room today. I’ve decided not to tell Molly the real reason I am moving out. As a couple of you pointed out, she clearly has no problem with trying to do things to hurt me, and out of worry for my personal belongings (which she has complete access to until I move out), I have decided to tell her that Isabelle’s roommate is moving out spring semester (which is true), and that Isabelle doesn’t like the idea of living alone and that she asked if I could move in with her (little white lie). However, if she pushes me, and tries to “pry the real reason out”, I’m going to tell her what I know (minus Danielle’s involvement) and I will be asking the RA to mediate the move-out process so that she doesn’t wreck any of my stuff as a final “f-you” gesture.

I have also decided that to minimize the awkwardness of moving out, I’m not going to tell her until this Monday (four days from now), which will mean after I tell her, we will only have 3 full days together until I never have to see her again! 

Thank you guys so much for helping me, I think hearing everyone say that I was not in the wrong and that she’s kinda cuckoo was the push I needed to make this move. Thanks for all the advice, hopefully I never have to go through this again!

TL;DR: I decided to move out of my room so that I can stay with a friend who is less judgy and more supportive and positive."
47,"Me [24 F] and my picky eater husband[25 M] have recently gotten bad news from the doctor (more him than me) and it looks like we need to eat healthy and exercise but its a fight every step of the way :/ HELP


So my husband and I have been together for about 5 years, and recently found out we both have some high cholesterol and high triglycerides and our doctors have told us to basically eat better and lose weight. okay, duh. I've been on the healthy track for a but now and have lost about 6 lbs in the past month so I'm not too worried about me, I know its all about creating some good habits and crowding out the bad ones but YOU GUYS, my husband won't jump on the health train!


The problem is that he is a ""picky eater"" of the highest caliber. The man literally will not eat any vegetables besides raw carrots, green beans, and corn on the cob. He likes a good bit of fruit (mostly berries, grapes, and only granny smith apples) but will let it rot in the fridge if I don't set it in front of him and remind him to eat. He likes beef, pork, and chicken (and some fish/shellfish) so I'm not too worried about that. He prefers to live off of hamburgers, chicken fingers, french fries, and beer. He drinks about 20-24 beers a week. He is a GM of a restaurant about 40 drive from where we live so he likes so grab donuts on the way to work or fast food on the way home. And to all the people saying to hide good food in some of the stuff he does eat...listen up.


Here's a list of the foods he absolutely refuses to eat/try:
Condiments(only recently has he started to use hot sauce)
sauces of any kind, 
soups or chilis, 
beans that aren't green beans, 
all cheese (well, he only eats cheese on pizza or velveeta macaroni, but all others are off the table)
casseroles or any food that's mixed together
breads that have hard crusts, he will peel the crust off (he wont eat toast, eng. muffins, waffles that are too hard etc)
and a bunch of other things, i could go all day. 


My point is, I've read that a lot of the solutions on here tend to be ""let him fend for himself"" or ""have talk about the importance of good health and he'll come around"" or ""force him to eat or he can go hungry""but those don't seem to work here. He KNOWS his health is bad and is ""eh, fuck it"" about it. He'll just go get a burger and fries from the nearest place if we don't have food at home he'll eat. He seems to believe or want to believe that since he ate like crap while he was a teenager and it was fine, he can do so now. Even if I can talk him into a regular exercise routine, if he doesnt change his diet, nothing will really change!


If you have any good advice on EXTREMELY picky eaters, please comment! I mean the guy wont even try mustard! He loves pickles and only eats those on a burger (just bread,meat,pickles) but wont try mustard :/ I'm tired of acting like a parent and begging him to be healthier. We have a 7 yr old who eats better than he does but I do see some bad habits forming (mostly a strong affinity for soda...)

48,"Should I [33F] press my husband [38M] of 6 years to explain where his money ($2k/month) goes?


My husband and I have been married for 6 years, we've had some bumps in the road but mostly happy. We have a his/hers/ours accounting style, we each get our paychecks deposited into our own accounts, and transfer a substantial portion into the ""ours"" account to cover joint expenses. 

For my part, ""my"" money goes to frivolous stuff like eating lunch out at work, dinner and drinks with friends, or shopping for personal  non-necessities (or a treat yoself spa day or similar). I spend between $500 and $1000/month on that stuff, and put the rest in savings.

My husband spends closer to $2000/month on unnecessary/fun personal expenses. I don't care about the amount but I honestly am just confused about what he spends it on. He works from home and never eats out, he goes out with friends maybe 2-3 times a month and it's not like they're popping bottles in the club. I've brought it up a few times and the conversation goes something like this:

Me: So what are you spending $2k/month on?

Him: I don't know, random stuff

Me: Like what though, you don't go out much during the work day, that's where I spend most of my money like on lunches and parking

Him: I don't know, I just spend it on whatever

Should I just drop it or should I push him to show me his statements or give me a real answer? It just seems so weird to me that he's spending THAT much on ""whatever."" He has no problem contributing to our joint expenses and saving, so that's not an issue and maybe it's just none of my business what he's spending on?


**tl;dr:** My husband spends about $2k/month on ""whatever"" and won't give me a real answer about what ""whatever"" is.

1. The charges are on his credit card, which he pays off every month, not cash

2. He is a gamer but is philosophically opposed to in-app purchases as he feels he should win based on his own merits, not stuff you buy. He also usually talks to me about the games he is playing and buying, and waits for Steam sales to stock up.

I think those were the big ones but if I missed any you can comment again or username ping me, it's hard to keep up with this many replies."

Hello, I am bisexual but really I am way more into girls relationship wise so I basically keep it a secret from my mom, who is pretty christian. She isn't like outwardly homophobic but I doubt she would really be okay with it, she would likely act okay with it but not actually be privately. Like, for instance, when I told her I smoked pot (well really she caught me) she just sighed and rolled her eyes but then later I found her praying/crying that I would stop doing drugs because she doesn't want me to get into trouble. She is very much that type of person. 

Anyways, about 3 months ago I was at a club and me and this spanish guy Rafael did cocaine together in the bathroom then hooked up. We didn't do much then, but he gave me his number and we met up a few times over the next few weeks and slept together, then it just slowly faded away and we stopped. He was a cool guy, he was quite a bit older than me but honestly, with guys I never cared about that. 

So you can imagine my surprise when my mom tells me she has a new boyfriend, shows me a picture, and its Rafael. She said they had been dating for 2 weeks now and had fallen in love very fast. 

I have a few thoughts on this. For one, Rafael is a REALLY great guy. He is really funny, charming, kind, he seems responsible enough (that time we did coke was like a very rare occurrence for him apparently), and he earns a lot of money. The guy has an apartment in the West village, easily like 5k+ a month there. 

However I have some obvious problems here. For one, my mom is christian, like homophobic christian. I don't think she is crazy outwardly homophobic but I do remember she voted for a republican on the basis that she didn't want gay marriage. I also remember her saying she didn't want to go to provincetown in cape cod because she didn't want me 'influenced by the gays and homosexuals'. Honestly, whatever. She is from Colombia, she doesn't even know that much english, I doubt she will ever get over her homophobia. So I considerably doubt she will ever know this man is bisexual. 

Another thing is that Rafael said he doesn't tell most people that he is bisexual. So he won't tell her. 

So I am in quite a conundrum. I don't want to tell her I slept with him for obvious reasons, she will find out I am bisexual and I don't know how she will react. But it is DEFINITELY WEIRD.

What do I do? Just not tell her? I live with her, I am bound to meet Rafael eventually again.

Every time we've gone to visit my family its a nightmare. My parents absolutely love my boyfriend and so does my grandmother and extended family. It's literally just my sister. She also overheard me skyping my mum saying that my boyfriend and I are planning on getting married when we're a bit more financially secure and this has driven her nuts. Normally when we visit we stay with my best friend and her husband but they're out of town and I'm not comfortable asking to say in their house. There are no hotels in my beach front hometown that are under $250/per night so staying somewhere else isn't really an option since we're planning on being there for about 1.5 weeks.

Whenever the boyfriend and I are visiting, she and her racist friends make comments that range from him having a tiny penis to accusing him of eating dog. It basically sounds like they're middle school bullies tbh... Since we don't stay at my parents we can avoid it by leaving but this time it's not so avoidable.

So my question to you reddit is how do I deal with my racist sister and her friends? 

**TL;DR: My twin sister is super racist and I'm coming home with my boyfriend for the holidays. How do I deal with her?**

Edit: I didn't clarify two things in my post that I should have. I **ABSOLUTELY** do not just sit and watch while my sister says awful things to my boyfriend. I'm completely in her face 110% of the time for it. It just never makes a difference. She's never anything but perfect around my parents and they both work long hours so the time they see us interacting is very minimal. This visit was my boyfriend's idea after he spoke to my mum on the phone. He loves visiting my parents and the plans were made before we realized that my friend is going to be out of town. The comments have never really bothered him, they bother me and I hate hearing them."
53,"My (32 M) wife (30 F) can't comfortably have sex as it triggers her serious anxiety. We consented to the option of a mistress/fwb (she was ok with this and she suggested it initially). My conscience tortured me and I stopped, apologized, and we're renewing our vows. Did I screw up our marriage?


We've been happily married for 6 years, we have 2 angelic daughters (5 and 3 years old), and we have in truth a very happy home. My wife is amazing, really a perfect wife and mother. She is a full time mom and wife, she cooks 3 delicious meals every day, she keeps our house running perfectly and she (along with our adorable little girls) makes my life happy and fulfilled. 

My point is she's great and we have a truly happy home, but I think I have failed as the father and husband of our household in the last year (around 10 months). My wife isn't comfortable with sex, she has never been, it has always been difficult for her because it reopens the wounds of her childhood trauma. She has been to many therapists, and she still goes to a therapist, and we have tried everything to make it more comfortable for her, but her discomfort with sex, any sexual activity, has been an intractable problem. It's not physical pain/discomfort, but it's a flare-up of her general anxiety disorder.

I knew of this before we were married, she told me that in all honesty she won't want to have sex very often, but I was in love (and we're still just as in love now), and I said that it didn't matter to me, that I loved her and would give up anything for her. And we did have sex (obviously we had 2 kids), but not very often and it has never been something she's comfortable with. 

I have always been okay with this, I have had a good deal of sexual frustration but that's the sacrifice I've had to make for the woman I love. And my wife has always expressed affection in other ways. She has sacrificed so much: she carried and gave birth to 2 beautiful daughters for me, she has given up her career outside of the home to raise them full-time and care for our home, she cooks amazing food, and we are physically affectionate even without sex, I could go on and on. 

My wife could tell that I've wanted sex much more than she felt comfortable with (for example, I often would unconsciously look at her with desire, and she can easily pick up on the ""wanting sex"" vibes that I unconsciously put out). One night she suggested the idea that I could be more fulfilled and happy if I had a mistress, a woman I could have sex with rather than her, but that would not replace her as my only love. The idea had a strong, immediate appeal to me. Honestly I got stupidly excited and desperately latched onto the idea. Her stipulations were that it was with only one woman (that I wasn't being promiscuous) she had to be a regular lady (i.e., not a prostitute) with no STDs, and we could only be friends with benefits, not loving in the way I do with her, and she doesn't want to know who the woman is or see her or hear anything about the sex. I told my wife, honestly, that I could never handle her with another man, that this would quite literally destroy me and I would probably lose all will to live so how could she be okay with this, she said that she knows this but that it's different because I'm a man and she's a woman (we later found out this wasn't really as true as she thought and we were making a big mistake).

Eventually I found a girl that I clicked with, a 27 year old girl that one of my friends introduced me to, we hit it off and flirted and got her phone number. We talked and met and hit it off, I explained the situation, and she said that she was fine with it, she was mainly looking for a guy to be monogamous with but not too serious and she understood the marriage situation and she said I seemed like a nice normal guy, etc. We met and had sex once or twice a week usually, sometimes less frequently. Did this for months, but it wasn't what I expected. It just left me with a sense of wrongness, and this seemed to grow with time. Eventually my fwb started saying that I seem guilty and maybe I shouldn't be doing this. She was right and this snapped me out of it (I was hooked on the incredible physical pleasure of having sex with this woman, but slowly dying inside and starting to hate myself). Yes my wife and I both thoroughly, repeatedly consented to this, but it just didn't feel right regardless.

I've been tortured by my conscience and by this feeling I can't describe, but it's like I'm betraying everything good in my life (my wife, my daughters somehow, and even somehow my parents and grandparents who raised me to be a decent man). So I amicably broke this arrangement off with the young woman, who fully understood. I have told my wife that I failed her as her husband, that I'm supposed to lead our family and that I shirked my duty over my personal pleasure. I told her also that I've learned that I need only her and that I was so much happier before I did this, even though I was getting way more sex these last months I've been feeling unhappy and miserable. 

She also admitted that she regretted it as well but kept her feeling a secret, when she knew I was gone with this girl she was burning with jealousy and anger at the idea of me with another woman and this was painful in a way she didn't expect. I apologized thoroughly and we seem to be okay now, as far as I can tell (I'm not very good at understanding my wife though, honestly). 

Do you think we will be okay now and that we handled this problem well? Does this situation ever work out, a man having a mistress? My wife knows that mistresses were often the norm throughout history and she thought this meant it would be okay, but we both found out it just wasn't, not for us.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My wife is not comfortable with sex, sexual activity of any kind triggers her trauma-related anxiety. I knew this completely when I married her and wasn't bothered by it. She knew I wanted sex and never really get even nearly enough, and suggested the possibility of a friend with benefits. I did this with a woman for months, but the guilt grew and I couldn't live with it and broke it off and I apologized to my wife thoroughly (we plan on renewing our wedding vows even). My wife though that ""mistresses"" were something normal and we'd be okay, but it was painful for us both and we couldn't do it any longer. Does this work out for anyone? Did we handle this properly and will this likely be just a stupid misstep in a happy marriage and family life?"
54,"My [25M] sister [15F] is dating my ex's [26F] brother [14M] and it's causing massive problems with my fiancee [26F]


I use to date Alicia 6 years ago when I was studying up in Queensland at University. We broke up because I wanted to move back to Melbourne and she didn't. I met my current partner shortly after I got back. 

What are the odds that 6 years later Alicia's family would move to town? Not only that but for her brother to go to the exact same high school as my sister and for the two of them to start dating. They've never met each other. He's never met me and my ex's brother never met me. The two of them don't actually know we use to date because our parents told us to keep out mouths shut and not to ruin their fun. 

As I said, my parents and Alicia's parents have told us to keep our mouths shut because it's both of theirs first real relationship. It's causing massive problems with my fiancee because she's not happy my ex is back in the picture. She's mad that I had to talk to her for a while when picking my sister up. She's not happy that my sister is dating my ex's brother. What do I do about my Fiancee not being happy about this?

55,"My[23M] mother[47F] wants to bar my gf[23F] from coming home with me for the holidays for the most stupid and ridiculous reason and I don't know how to react to this?


[removed]"
56,"My [25F] mother [47F] doesn't think I have a right to privacy. Not sure how to proceed, or if I'm in the right.


I literally just had a spat with her on the phone which sparked my thinking. I wanted to see what other people thought.

My parents have always been what could be described as ""helicopter"" parents. I've always been a people pleaser, so I never really felt the want/need to push their boundaries or keep things from them.

That being said, I'm 25 now. I live alone. I have a great job. I'm doing pretty damn well. And I kinda want to have my own private life.

However, my mother seems to think that I don't have the ""right"" to not tell her stuff. As an example, tonight's argument was that she was supposed to come and pick something up from my place. I told her she'd have to come before a certain hour of the day, as I was having some company over for dinner (a man I am seeing). She was shocked and said ""I never thought my daughter would ever tell me such a thing!"" She seemed to laugh it off and I was a little confused, but whatever, I moved on.

Tonight though, she called me and it came up again. She asked who was coming over and I told her (she knows his name). She then asked me for some personal details about him... And I declined to answer. My reason is that he is ""unconventional"" for who I usually date, and I didn't want to bring that to her attention before it was necessary. I figured ""hey if this works out, then we can cross the bridge when we get there."" I told her ""I don't really want to talk about that right now.""

She did not like that answer. She then proceeded to needle me with little questions that got her closer to what she wanted, and then I cracked and told her what she wanted to know (because I knew she wouldn't let it go).

She then said I was being ""dishonest"" and I was ""embarassed"" about this man (I'm not, btw), and that she's my parent and that means this sort of ""tell me everything"" dynamic will always exist between her and I. When I expressed my displeasure at her tactics and her lack of respect for my privacy, she told me I was being ""argumentative"".

Now, my reason for not wanting to tell her are pretty simple: I've got no idea where this is going. We might not ever have a relationship. I didn't want to put the cart before the horse. I also wanted to tell her in person, or even let this person explain it to them if it ever came to that.

I don't feel like I'm in the wrong, but what really makes me angry is that she had a fit at me last week over not ""enforcing boundaries to people who were saying bad things about her to me."" Her therapist told her this, apparently. But when I told her tonight ""I thought we were in the practice of enforcing boundaries? Do I not get to have those too?"" she got hostile.

I guess I'm not really sure what to do? My dad, who used to be the worst perpetrator of this is actually a lot better now. But that only came to pass because I stopped telling him stuff entirely for a while. 

So, how I approach this with my mom?

Tl;dr- Mom doesn't think I have a right to keep things to myself as a 25 yr/o independent woman."
57,"Me [28 F] with my Neighbors [30s M/F], how do I get them to stop parking in my driveway while we're at work?


Over the past 3 weeks my neighbors have been parking in my driveway from about 8:30 am - 2 pm without asking. I can see when they leave their truck in our driveway via our outdoor security camera. They usually move their vehicle over just after I leave the driveway for work.

Initially, my husband gave them permission to park there for one day while we were at work. He was clear that this was a one-time deal. Since then, it appears to have become a habit (they have parked in our driveway 4 or 5 times since they asked the first time).

It just irks me that they continue to park there without asking. Yes, we are not at home all day, but what if I needed to come home and they were parked there? What if they get hurt on our property or their truck gets damaged?

How should we ask them to stop without ruining the neighborly relationship? I don't want to make them feel bad, but I also want to make it clear that we are not ok with this.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Neighbors keep parking in driveway without asking. How do I ask them to stop kindly?

—-


UPDATE: Husband sent a message to the neighbors telling them to please not park in our driveway without asking. Response was, “OK. No problem. We’ll just park in the empty lot beside you.”

Technically they can’t park there either as it is private property and they will be ticketed. 

In fact, the neighbor who was parking in our driveway was the one who told us they’ve been ticketed for parking there. So I feel like her saying that she’s going to start parking there again is trying to make us feel bad for making them park there and potentially get tickets?

Not our problem, I know. For now things have been resolved. "
58,"I [26F] feel like I should stop giving rides to my [23F] coworker because of the accidental text message I received from her


I drive about an hour and a half each way to work. My coworker lives in the middle of my route but still about 10 minutes out of the way. We get along ok but I usually find that her to be extremely dramatic and never happy which puts a damper on the drive.  I’ve been giving her rides to work for about 2.5 months. At the beginning, she said that she was a little strapped and needed to wait until the next payday to give me gas money, fine. I’m nice so I accepted that. After the initial gas she didn’t pay me any gas money for the next month. I’m not confrontational but I worked up the courage to ask her for a set amount of gas money each time we get paid. That was two weeks ago, I told her $60 but she paid me $50. Again I’m not confrontational so I figured she must’ve misheard me so I let it go so that there would be no awkwardness. Last night I was driving her home and when I got to her house I checked my phone while she was getting her stuff and getting out. I realized I had texts from her. I was confused and asked what it was and she said she accidentally sent the messages. I didn’t really read them because at this point it’s about 1am and I’m tired and just want to go home. Today when I picked her up she made a comment about forgetting that she had weed in her pocket. I let her know what she does in her own time is her business but I don’t want weed in the car because we work at a gov agency and if I ever get pulled over for speeding or something that can cause other issues and I also drive one of my mother’s cars and would never hear the end of it. When I got to work today I was telling my friend about the whole weed conversation and showed her the text messages that my coworker had accidentally sent to me. It wasn’t until then that I took the time to read them and say that she said that “she drives so slow and we missed that light” because apparently, we were driving beside her friend. 
I feel like this is grounds for me to stop giving her rides. How dare she talk about the speed that I drive especially because there are about 5 speed cameras on the road where this was sent. Now I don’t feel like I can drive her without thinking that she is texting about me, and if you said that what else are you saying about me. I’ve thought about this and this could potentially cause her to lose the job but I don’t feel like that’s my burden because she chose to have a job so far away knowing that she doesn’t drive. Advice? 

TL;DR: Coworker that I drive to work called me a slow driver and now I want to kick her out 

Edit: Wow, thank you all for your responses. I made this post literally 2 hours before I had to drive us home. She was on the phone for most of the ride but when we got to her house I told her that I wouldn't be able to drive her anymore. Later, while I was finishing my drive home she sent me gas money (still not the agreed upon amount) and wrote a message saying thanks for the rides and that she hopes it didn't stop because of something someone else may have said. She also mentioned that she thought we were better friends. I still have not addressed the texts because it's my day off and I just don't feel like it. I don't hate her, won't tell whatever secrets she feel like she told me but I just can't provide a service for someone and feel like someone is talking shit about me. 

Thanks for the encouragement and support! "
59,"My [25/f] husband [26/m] of two years told me he was considering divorce. We have a three week old.


[reposted because I didn't add in relationship length, sorry] 


I'm completely blindsided by this. Things have been a little stressful with the baby but it's not like we've been fighting or anything. The baby is healthy and pretty laid back. I'm almost down to my pre pregnancy weight. We can't have sex yet but we fool around a bit almost every night. I thought things were going well.


This time of year is usually rough for me. Five years ago, from December to February, I went through several traumatic events including the death of a close family member, a severe eating disorder and self harm problem, and some worse things that I can't go into detail about because they get flagged by the subreddit rules. This week is the ""anniversary"" of that particularly traumatic event, and I usually need some extra support during that time. I've had therapy for it and I've made huge strides in terms of overcoming it, but this time of year is still hard. Husband knows about all these things. He has since before we started dating even, since we were friends long before that.


Today was a bad day, and I was talking to him about it on his lunch break today. He asked what he could do to help, and I told him that some extra time together this evening would be great. Just some time to snuggle and watch some Netflix. Basically just having him around. He seemed super eager to provide that and the rest of the day was uneventful. When he got in from work, he seemed normal. Said his day went good. He showered and we ate supper. Got the baby settled. I tried to initiate some affection but he suddenly started acting kind of cold and withdrawn. 


After about an hour of that (and him being home for over three hours) I told him my feelings were hurt because he hadn't even hugged me since he came in. I told him it was upsetting because I had been upfront with him about me having a rough day emotionally and explicitly told him what I needed from him in terms of support and he hadn't given that to me. I figured that after telling him how I felt, he'd probably snap out of it or at the very least tell me why he was acting like that. Instead, he got more withdrawn and it ended up spiraling into me being very hurt and him acting annoyed/inconvenienced. He eventually brought up the fact that he felt our relationship had serious issues and that he was considering divorce. And about ten minutes after him dropping that on me, he was in bed asleep. 


I've been up bawling my eyes out since then. I keep trying to get him to have a conversation with me about it because I'm completely panicking over it. But he keeps blowing it off, getting pissy because I woke him up, and going back to sleep. I know I should just leave it be till morning but I can't. I'm heart broken. I've been bouncing between all these emotions. Anger, fear, confusion, even feeling like I don't want to go on. And that is a horrible thing to feel when you're holding your newborn baby in your arms. I asked him why he was considering it, and all he would tell me was that he didn't know, he just was. I can't figure out how that makes any sense. How do you not know why you're considering divorce? 


I keep scanning every single thing in my head, trying to figure out what went so wrong to make him consider ending our marriage. There were no red flags. No warning signs. No small buildup. Other than the expected stress of a baby, things have been normal. Just last night, we decorated cookies and put up the Christmas tree. Honestly, we've been better than ever these past few weeks. When we do have disagreements, they're healthier and more productive than they've ever been. Our communication has been great, or at least I thought it was. 


I love my husband and my family so much. I can't figure out what I did wrong or where this came from or why it came out tonight of all nights. I've almost been sick to my stomach from being sick upset over this. I haven't stopped crying for hours. And he's just snoring in bed like nothing has changed. I can't even bring myself to lay next to him because I feel like I've done something to make myself not worthy of being a mom or a wife in his eyes. I have no clue where to go from here or how to even begin the discussion with him on where to go next with this. 


Tl;dr husband told me he has been considering divorce less than a month after the birth of our child. It came completely out of left field and I am at a complete loss on what to do.

60,"My [29F] mom [58F] is insisting on bring guitars to my baby shower and I can't get her to understand that I do not want them there.


So, half my family are musicians, it's great and all, music is a huge part of my life, and usually I love singing along while my mom plays. However, my dad is coming in from another state for the party (also a musician) and I haven't seen him in almost 3 years. The problem is, when my family starts playing music together it is a jumbled mess of people playing over other people, no one knows the same jams, so we get about 30 second of a song before the move on to another, and it is nearly impossible to get a single conversation going if there is even a tambourine laying around. 

There will be mixed company before and after the party that are not musical, I am not very musical myself, though I love to sing, can't sing right now, being pregnant makes it really hard to control my voice, I just want pleasant conversation. My mother told me that my dad even said my request for no instruments is ridiculous so she is bring them anyway.

I want to scream! Why can't she just listen to me, it isn't her damn party!!! What do I do, am I drama queen?

TL;DR
Can't get my mom to understand that I don't want everyone playing guitar and singing at my baby shower, I just want conversation and laughs, but she refuses to abide."

My husband works for one of the top animation studios in hollywood. He has worked on/animated several films that have come out in theatres over the past couple of years. He has a really good stable source of income, but for the past year he hasn't really been happy there. The studio is great to him. He's just lost interest in being there. It's nothing to do with the studio itself, they're great. It's more he's bored of it. He's told his boss he's thinking of leaving. They don't want him to, but he's always welcome back if he does leave one day. 

My husband has made some friends in different companies. He's been talking to some of his friends that work for one of the big 2 comic book companies who has been talking to him about taking a leap into being an artist for them. Nothing major at first, just doing posters and other promotional art. He's got a job there if he wants it.

He was talking to my parents last weekend when they asked how his job was going. He told them he was thinking of becoming an artist at one of these companies. They lost their mind, because it would be a lot less than what he normally makes. They don't want him sitting around making less money drawing people like Iron Man/Batman all day. It caused a huge fight my parents over the money situation, and how I'd be making more than him. 

We decided to go to his parents place in Alabama for Christmas instead of staying here for it after the fight. My siblings have not left me alone since.

63,"My [25F] boyfriend [31M] and I have decided to start ring shopping with the expectation of a proposal by this time next year. Suddenly I feel like a kid who is not ready for all this grown up business of marriage.


We're been together for almost three years, living together for one year. *He* is absolutely wonderful - no doubts whatsoever about him or our life together. I've known since shortly after meeting him that this was it for me - but now that it's actually happening I suddenly feel like I'm not old enough to be getting married, like we're rushing into things even though I know our relationship has been moving at a perfectly reasonable pace. I live in the south so I've watched all my friends and cousins get engaged and married beginning back when we were in college, and I always felt like ""What's the rush? If you really love each other then you can wait a few more years.""

But it's already been three years. It'll be another year before the engagement, then another year after that until the wedding. I'll be 27-28 by the time we actually get married. Isn't five years more than enough time? By that point it's not ""what's the rush?"" but "" what's the wait?""

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that it's normal to feel a bit unnerved by big life decisions. I'm hoping than by age 27-28 I will feel ready - whatever that negligible feeling of ""readiness"" may be.

**TL;DR: Engaged to be engaged and suddenly feeling like I'm not old enough for marriage, despite being fully secure in my relationship. Should I wait for some negligible feeling of ""readiness"" or just move ahead and power through the doubts by discussing them with my SO?**

65,"I am a [29F]. My [34M] invited me to his city for the weekend then ditched me. How do I process this and should I say to him?


I was in a city about 4 hours north of mine a few months ago for a job interview. While there I met a cute guy and we exchanged numbers. We have been texting ever since and he suggested a visit at some point. I love traveling and taking unexpected opportunities, so I said yes. We worked out dates and I bought a plane ticket. He lives about an hour from the main city I met him in, so he got us an Airbnb.

At this point I have to mention that he has 2 kids who live with their mother, his ex-wife, in the same city he does. Before I booked my plane tickets, he told me that he couldn’t hang out all weekend because he had some “baby stuff” to do. I said sure that’s fine, I can entertain myself for a few hours. This past Friday, I flew in at 11 am. He picked me up from the airport, drove me to the Airbnb, and hung out for a while. He then said he had to finish work for the afternoon and then had pizza night with his kids, after which he would be back at the bnb around 7 or 8 pm.

I went downtown and checked out a few things, grabbed wine and liquor and snacks, and. went back to the bnb. At 9 pm he text me saying he was tucking his kids in and would be back soon. At 1220 am I text him asking what was up. HE NEVER CAME BACK.

I didn’t hear a thing from him until 11 am on Saturday. He text saying “sorry, I crashed with my son. making them breakfast now”. I was pissed so I didn’t respond for a few hours, and then I text him saying I thought what he did was rude and inconsiderate.

He didn’t respond so a few hours later I text him again asking if I was wrong for thinking this whole situation was weird. He responded no I wasn’t wrong, but it was just bad timing on his part and he didn’t have time to hangout that night.

So, I took a day off work and traveled to this city to spend the weekend with guy, to be ditched the entire time and with no communication about it unless I badger text him into responding. I asked him for an explanation and he hasn’t responded aside from saying he’s sorry but again is busy today. 

Honestly it’s dumb because I barely know this guy but i’m having trouble settling my mind about the weirdness of the weekend. It was so pointless, HE was the one who asked me to visit! I don’t expect nor want to talk to him again but I need some advice about how to process this because honestly it’s making me feel weird and insecure. Fellow redditors, how do you come to terms with the relationships that confuse and disappoint you? And do I owe this guy any more contact? 

**TL;DR: Long-distance fling invites me to his city for the weekend, settles me into our Airbnb, and disappears** 

**UPDATE** 
Y’all were right. I don’t know if he is divorced or not but he definitely lives with his “ex”. I sleuthed hard and found her social media profiles. I messaged her asking if she had an ex named (guys name). She responded with “not really an ex...how can I help you? Or, how can you help me?” So that’s when I knew. She was extremely gracious and kind and asked me for proof which I supplied. We had a conversation about the situation and she basically said he insists she’s paranoid and crazy about her suspicions that he cheats, and was relieved to know she’s not crazy and to have some evidence to confront him with. I feel and hope I did the right thing. "

Hi! So, this is sort of a weird complaint, but bear with me. I [22F] currently live in an apartment with a friend, but every once in a while, I invite my mom [59F] over to chat and have dinner.

I love my mom, but we're very different. One thing she does that I literally do not understand is go through my trash. Not the kitchen trash, but in my bedroom and bathroom, my personal trash can. Or, if applicable, a bag I've accumulated for objects I am donating. 

She'll literally empty a trash bag or can out on the patio area attached to our apartment, or in my room and just sort through things. Often times, she looks and recognizes that it's just papers or wrappers and puts it back. Every once in a while, she find something and ask why I'm throwing it away. One such object I was tossing was a greeting card from a relative. She told me that it was rude to throw it away and 'rescued' it from the garbage. One time she found the wrapper for a condom and commented that she was, ""Glad I was being safe!"". It bothers me she goes through my trash, even if all the items within are pretty unimportant.

I've asked her to stop, but she retorts that she should be able to see what I'm disposing of and that I shouldn't get so 'worked up'. I see it as an invasion of privacy and unnecessary, which she says an overreaction. 

Am I crazy? It's ultimately not important, but it drives me nuts and she's never done this before (to my knowledge) even when I lived at home. 

**EDIT:** Some more information (just to generally put it out there). 

My mom used to go through my mail before I sternly told her to not open it anymore. I eventually just got the post office to forward me my mail to wherever I lived while in university. This has become a non issue. 

My roommate locks her doors when she is not in her room and her bathroom is not accessible from any other part of the apartment. Her trash is undisturbed.

There is a cultural difference at play. Her mother (my grandmother) was very similar in these habits. My grandmother is Japanese and lived through WW2 before coming to America, where she was very poor. If she could, she wouldn't throw away potentially useful items. She could find uses for almost anything, and if she couldn't, she adhered to stricter rubbish laws than I do and would habitually sort anyway. My mother, in addition to this, was raised on a hippie communal farm and was more used to saving and sharing spaces. She does not hoard in our family home. It's actually very clean.

**tl;dr**: Mom goes through my garbage. I think it's weird, she does not. How can I get her to stop after saying that it makes me uncomfortable?"
67,"My [25F] hypochondriac sister [26F] is pregnant, and lying about her condition


Just for privacy’s sake, I’m on a throwaway account. 

My sister and I are a year apart, and the middle children of the family. When we were growing up, we kind of flocked together, and shared many similar interests. Our father passed suddenly and painfully from a disease, and my sister developed debilitating hypochondria afterwards. She’s been diagnosing herself ever since she was 13, and has taken it up with her doctors on many occasions. It’s gotten so severe in the past, that she’s told all of us she was suffering from cancer, but no doctor could back up the accusation. Her husband eventually debunked the myth, and forced her into therapy. She was doing better, and they decided to start trying to have kids. My sister was having a lot of difficulty, and it was making her hypochondria worse. Ultimately, she and her husband got divorced, but she continued to try for her baby.

A month after she got pregnant, my husband and I found out we were also expecting. She was super excited about it, to my face, but I found out from our brother that she’s been saying some really nasty stuff, accusing me of stealing her spotlight, and robbing her of the attention she “deserves.” I apologized to her in person, and she said it wasn’t a big deal, she was just jealous and hormonal. We made up, and went on our merry way. Later on, my doctor told me that we were going to have twins, and after I told my family, my sister decided to announce she was suffering from major complications.

Obviously, we were all concerned. I offered to go to an appointment with her, and she obliged. When we got there, her doctor persistently told her she was doing fine. There were no issues to be found. My sister pushed back, demanding blood tests, etc. She made us stay until lab results came back- all negative for what she was looking for. I asked if she’d been seeing her therapist and she said no, but she was doing fine without it. Every week, there were new lies and new things that were happening to her. All of us were lost, and my mom was making trips to visit her 2 hours away every time she made a new claim. Now, she doesn’t waste the gas.

My husband recently had to go away on a business trip, and I came down with a really nasty cold. My mom came down to take care of me for a bit, and I was texting my sister about it. She got jealous, predictably, but told me it was fine, I needed the love. I was glad she was kind of getting over her issues. Later in the day, my sister called my mom and said she was having contractions, even though she’s only 7.5 months along. My mom was panicked, and asked how far apart they were, and she was told they were close. My mom drove to my sister’s house, took her to the hospital, only to discover it was all another falsehood.

We’re all at our wits ends. I’m tired of my sister texting me once a week, asking me to come help her with a new health issue. Obviously, I don’t want to cut contact because she’s my sister, and I love her. Also, I know she’s mentally ill, and needs support. Plus, if one of her lies actually turned out to be true and I had let her be abandoned in her time of need, I would hate myself for the rest of my life.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation? I know I can’t do much, as she’s an adult, but any tips are appreciated.

TL;DR: My hypochondriac sister is now pregnant, and is making up complications and illnesses for herself to garner attention."
68,"My (26M) girlfriend (22F) gets angry and asks for a very specific style of apology, which I absolutely hate.


[removed]"
69,"I (32m) lent my brother (35m) money. It has come out that he lied to me both times about the circumstances. The money was out of the fund I saved to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring. Even after the lies came out my brother wants me to loan him money again


Earlier this year my (32m) brother (35m) came to me and asked me for a loan. He told me his house needed a new roof but he didn't have the money for it. My brother has never asked me for money before, he has a job and is not a deadbeat or anything. I didn't even hesitate to give him the loan. He asked me not to tell anyone, including his wife, because he was embarrassed and he promised he would pay me back. The roof on his house was fixed and I told him to take his time paying me back because we had a good relationship and my brother had always been stable and it never crossed my mind he could be lying to me. Once when I was in college he loaned me money to get my car fixed when it broke down and he didn't hesitate and I paid him back once I found a summer job a couple of months later. A few months later he asked me for money again. He had been laid off from his job and had found another job which was only 3/4 of the pay and he said he needed it. Once again I did not hesitate.

In November just before Thanksgiving my sister-in-law (35f) filed for divorce from my brother after 10 years of marriage. My brother had an affair with a woman he worked with. She got pregnant and her boyfriend found out about the affair and the baby. He told her to choose between him and my brother. My brother and her decided to end the affair, not tell my sister-in-law and she married her boyfriend and her and the boyfriend passed the kid off as his and didn't tell either of their families. My brother had told me and everyone else including his wife there were layoffs coming at the end of the year, but really he found another job so he could get away from his former affair partner.

His wife told the court she had just found out about the affair and the baby and filed not long after. There is no way to prove it and it doesn't really matter but privately she admitted she knew about the affair and was going to leave but once it ended she decided to wait until the other woman married her boyfriend and my brother took a lower paying job. She outed the affair to our family and the other woman's family and the people they used to work with. The other woman knew my brother was married and he knew he shad a boyfriend. She has filed for a divorce from my brother and is suing the other woman. His wife has all kinds of photos, emails, texts, and receipts and there is no way to deny the affair or that my brother is the father of her kid. She has gone no contact with him and told him to talk to her lawyer.

When my brother told me he needed money to get the roof fixed he used the money I loaned him to buy the other woman jewellery. When he told me he got laid off and had to take job with lower pay because he couldn't afford to be unemployed, he really had quit his job to get away from the other woman once the affair ended. There is proof he lied and he admitted it. He didn't ask anyone else for money (parents, friends etc.) except for me and I was stupid enough to believe him.

He is in trouble with his divorce because of the affair and the baby but also because he used his wife's pay and money from their joint account to buy stuff for the other woman and he hid these expenses from his wife. Now he wants me to lend him money to pay his divorce lawyer or a possible settlement to his wife, and also for a family lawyer because he has applied for sharing custody with his kid now that affair is public knowledge. The other woman is angry about being outed and sued and she is now asking for child support since my brother was named as the biological father and put on the birth certificate. He wants me to lend him money for the divorce lawyer, family lawyer and child support.

I have been saving to buy an engagement ring and propose to my girlfriend. Our second anniversary is in 5 days and I was planning on proposing to her then but now that 1/3 of the ring money is gone I am putting it off because I can't afford as nice of a ring as I would like. My parents, cousins and friends think I should just buy a ring and propose anyways because they know I want to propose. I am mad at my brother because he lied to me and now wants me to lend him money again. My parents are mad at him too because he cheated on his wife and lied to me about why he needed loans. If I had known I obviously never would have given him my ring money.

How should I approach things with my brother going forward? I am angry about this whole situation. Thank-you for any advice or just encouragement.

**Edited to add because I forgot**:

---
**tl;dr**: Loaned my brother money two times this year because he really needed it. He lied to me about why he needed it, was cheating on his wife and spent it on the other women. His wife is divorcing him and now he wants me to lend him money for lawyers and child support for the other woman. I was saving for an engagement ring for my girlfriend and I gave him that money and he knew it. My parents, cousins and friends think I should propose anyways. I am so angry with my brother."
70,"[UPDATE] My [28F] boyfriend [24M] has money issues and I end up paying for things we do together


I wrote this post a month ago 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/775qgz/my_28f_boyfriend_24m_has_money_issues_and_i_end/ 

So I thought I'd write an update. I’ve already tried doing it from my other account that I normally use but my post was deleted. I don’t know why.

First of all, I would like to thank you for all your replies. Some of your comments really got me thinking and made me seriously reevaluate my relationship.

The update will be rather short compared to my original post I guess.

It’s Christmas time and we have Christmas Markets everywhere. On Saturday, November 28th, I wrote to my boyfriend that I was at work but that I have a day off the next day hoping that maybe he would invite me to do something together. He didn’t. He told me that he was sitting at home doing some stuff for his university. I said that I was at a Christmas Market, again hoping that maybe he would ask me if he could join me. He didn’t. On the next day he said that he hoped that I had had fun and asked why I didn’t come to his place after that. Well, because I was angry, that’s why. I was angry because again I had to spend my Saturday evening with my colleagues instead of him, which is ok but seriously, when will we as a couple do something together? Don’t you want to invite me? Don’t you want to say: oh, I would like to do that with you too, maybe next week? Nothing, guys. Nothing. It doesn’t cost millions, seriously. And it’s not about buying some stuff that we don’t need. It’s about going out, drinking some Glühwein and spending time together on a Saturday night. So after my last email I just stopped contacting him altogether. He noticed that and asked me if I was ok to which I said no, that we have all the same problems all the time and that I don’t know what to do, because his reactions are ridiculous and I’m seriously tired of repeating all the same stuff over and over again. I asked him what was there I could do? To which he replied, well, you could ask me how I’m doing. Or tell me how you’re doing. Or tell me that you’re unhappy. And then we would again come to the conclusion that I’m going through a phase where I’m too busy with my own shit and that I don’t ask you out enough. And after that everything will be fine and we will hang out at my place again. 

I was mad because he basically told me: here’s how it is, I’m not gonna change, calm down and come over, you’re not getting what you want. So I replied to him: “Oh, so it’s a phase. Good that these phases only last some short time and not a whole year or so.”

That was my last email, to which he didn’t reply. It was a week ago and neither he nor I contacted each other since. I’ve gone through all the emotions possible since then but I’m good. I’ve realized that with all the good things that I have in this relationship, it will never be the way I imagine it or hope it to be. I’ve realized that this relationship is not ok and that my boyfriend only does the things he’s comfortable with doing and no more than that. And this is not how relationships work. I mean this is how they don’t work. I’m hurt by him ignoring me, treating me like I don’t exist and don’t matter at all. I don’t know if he’s trying to manipulate me into giving in or if he is just being stubborn. Or if there are some other reasons why he just disappeared and doesn’t want to come over, apologize and say that he wants to be with me and wants to work on our relationship. Whatever the reason this is not how grown-ups should resolve their conflicts. I’m in a relationship with a stubborn and proud kid who has some serious growing-up to do and I’m not going to be around and wait patiently while he is in the process. And yes, I lied about our ages: he’s 23, I’m 29. And honestly, I’m too old for this shit.

Oh, and I wrote in my last post that we were going to go to the theatre. Well we didn't because he forgot that we were going to do that although I reminded him 2 times a week. He forgot and told at his job that he could work so he went to work instead. It was like a week after I had wrote my last post and that was really really upsetting.
 
**TL;DR I think it’s over but I’m not sure because we haven’t talked to each other for a week. But it doesn’t matter because I don’t want to be part of this absurdity anymore.**"
71,"My girlfriend [26F] found out I [28M] was interested in her best friend [26F] first and is upset.


Throwaway because my girlfriend reddits

Backstory: I met my current girlfriend, Leslie, of 6 months and her best friend, Ann, at the same time. I was initially interested in Ann. Leslie is pretty but in a different way from Ann, who falls into what people would probably call ""conventionally attractive"". When getting to know them both, I began to really enjoy Leslie as a friend. Our humor is much the same and we just play off of each other really well. She's a joy to be around, truly. About a month into knowing both, Ann got a boyfriend so I immediately lost interest because I don't go for women in relationships. Having the same friend group though, I kept hanging out with them and began to become romantically interested in Leslie as I got to know her as a person. I asked her out, she said yes and we became mutually exclusive pretty quickly. I don't consider this settling in any way, shape, or form. Both women are awesome in their own way. So much so that when wanting to make plans, people get bummed if both of them won't be able to make it because their friendship just has a dynamic that draws people in. Myself, included. 

Current situation: When I was thinking of pursuing Ann, I spoke with my younger brother about it. It wasn't pining or anything of that nature but more just keeping him updated on my life since I live three hours away from him. He's met Leslie several times now. My family loves her. She loves them. 

On a visit home two days ago, my brother went to a party and the DD ended up drinking. He, wisely, called me to get him. Leslie and I went to pick him up. Her to drive and me to help contain him since he tends to do stupid stuff when he's drinking. He ended up telling how much he liked her and was so glad that Ann had gotten a boyfriend so quickly because he didn't like her as a fit for me nearly as much as her. 

Now, Leslie has a bit of insecurity when it comes to her and Ann. Not enough to ruin their relationship or keep her from being happy for her friend but just to how people react to them. A lot of times she's ""in Ann's shadow"" and there's been two other guys she was interested in that ended up being interested in Ann. She doesn't blame Ann but has acknowledged that she had always felt like the only way she would get someone to be interested in her was if Ann got in a serious relationship and it made her feel like she would never be enough if people kept comparing her to Ann. After she confided that in me, I made a vow to never ever let her know that I had been interested in Ann first. 

So, now she's incredibly hurt. She feels like she was lied to and she feels like I settled for her but that is so far from truth. She left here the next morning and told me she just needed some space to process the hurt so she doesn't make a rash decision or lash out from her insecurity and when I get back in two days, we'll meet up and talk. 

I don't know what to say to assure her that I didn't settle and make sure I don't lose her. Any advice Reddit?

TL;DR: My girlfriend found out I was interested in her best friend first like two other guys before me. Feels I settled and doesn't want to be second best. I don't want to lose her. "
