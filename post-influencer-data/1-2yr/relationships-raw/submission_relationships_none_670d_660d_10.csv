0,"[Update] My [25/m] wife [25/f] spends 90% of her time on her phone


Hello there.  
  
Original post:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7co0qb/my_25m_wife_25f_spends_around_90_of_her_time_at/  
  
Thanks to those that commented. Was helpful to just talk through everything and get some outside opinion on the matter.  
  
**Quick recap** for those that don't want to read the other thread.  
  
Basically my wife spends an exorbitant amount of time on her phone when we're home. Regardless of what we're doing she has it next to her. I had talk to her about it in the past to no avail. It was getting to me lately because she wasn't spending quality time with me or our daughter.  
  
**To the update:**  
  
The night I posted we ended up talking. I told her how it sucks that I feel like we're so distant lately and like we don't really spend quality time with one another. **SHE** actually raised the idea of once she comes home our phones go in the bedroom and we spend time with our daughter together until she goes to bed. No phones or electronics to distract.  
  
We carried on the conversation past phone usage to a few other things that had been bugging me and realized that we don't spend time doing things outside the house anymore. Often using our daughter and exhaustion from work as an excuse. She admitted that she would say she wasn't interested in doing things outside the house when I'd recommend it and she said she'd be more open to it.  
  
We also decided that we'd take a walk twice a week after she gets home from work to a convenience store down the street with our daughter.  
  
I'm pretty thankful to y'all. I was feeling pretty lost lately and I feel like this is actually going to have not only a big impact on my relationship but my life in general. Thank you all very much for your advice.    
  
**TL;DR**: We talked the same day I posted. She admitted that we needed to be off our phones/electronics more and **SHE** recommeded that we put our phones away and spend time with our daughter until she goes to bed once she gets home. No electronics or anything just time with her. Also admitted to not being open or receptive enough to the idea of going out and having ""date"" days and said she'll work on being more open to that. We're also going to take walks twice a week to a store down the street with our daughter. Thank you everyone that offered advice. It definitely helped. "

2,"My girlfriend [23F] broke up with me [27M] last week, but she still expects me to give her a ride home for thanksgiving


Prior to breaking up last Wednesday, my girlfriend [23F] and I [27M] had been together for just over three years. 

Up until this past August, she lived in Georgia, about two hours away from where I was living in South Carolina. 

In August, she moved up to NY for graduate school, and in order to be closer to her, I found a job and moved to DC. 

Things had been a bit rough in the months leading up to August, and the stress of moving and starting grad school/ a new job certainly didn't help things. 

Given the rough few months we had had, she was left questioning whether or not she still wanted to be in a relationship with me. She voiced her uncertainty to me on the phone last Monday, and expressed to me that she had a strong desire to go out and have some experiences with other men. To go on dates, and see what else was out there. 

I told her this wasn't at all what I wanted. That I wanted to work through these hard times together. She responded by saying if she didn't go out and have these experiences, even if things improved, she would always regret it. And that's where we left things.

When we spoke the next day, she had decided she wanted to come down to SC and spend a few days with me for thanksgiving break, before returning home to visit her family. There was one catch though. 

On Friday the 17th (im driving from DC to SC on the 16th for my bday/thanksgiving break) I was going to have to drive two hours from my home in SC to pick her up from the airport in NC, and then two hours back. The following monday, I would have to drive her two hours from home to take her to GA to be with her family, and two hours back. Then, Sunday after thanksgiving I'd have to go two hours out of my way and pick her back up in GA, and then have her ride with me all the way back to DC, where she would fly out to NY. 

At this point, I voiced my confusion given the conversation from the previous day.  She said she thought one positive experience together could really turn things around, and that she wanted to give it a shot. She had the flight up and ready to book, and there was only one seat left, so despite my voicing my desire to talk things out first, she went ahead and booked it. 

The next day, I tried to talk to her about her desire to date other men, and about how we could improve our relationship and work through the rough times we had been having, and it ultimately led to her breaking up with me. 

Since then, we haven't had all that much communication. She has ignored most of my texts and the ones she has responded to, she's been rather rude/mean. I pointed this out, and her response was ""it's unreasonable of you to expect us to be friendly right now. It's too soon"". Which honestly, I understand. She's right. 

Then, she texts me and tells me that she still needs me to pick her up and take her home, and that she still needs to ride with me back to DC. She doesn't have the money to change her flight, and she doesn't have anyone else to pick her up. 

I told her I didn't feel I owed her that, as she broke up with me. She pointed out that I had committed to coming, which I most certainly had. I asked her if I was willing to come, if she would be able to set aside her anger for a few hours and be friendly, and she said she would do her best to be cordial, but being friendly was too much to ask.  She said she would sit in the back and work the whole ride. 

My question is, do I still owe it to her to go and pick her up?  Would it be selfish of me to tell her she needed to work this out on her own? I really don't want to leave her stranded, but I don't feel this is really my responsibility anymore. What do I do here?

TL:DR - my gf broke up with me and still expects me to give her a ride to and from the airport, and I'm not sure what to do. 

Update : whoa! I was not expecting this many replies. Thank you all so much for your input. It is greatly appreciated. To those of you that have said I'm being a doormat, you are 100% correct. And I have been for.....yeah pretty much our entire relationship. I try my best to be kind to people regardless of how they treat me, but at some point you have to have a little self respect. 

Anyhow, I had pretty much decided not to pick her up prior to seeing all of your replies, and reading through them has solidified my decision. 

I just texted her saying ""Given the fact that you just broke up with me, and that in your own words ""it's too early to expect to be friendly with one another"", I'm not okay with coming to pick you up on Friday, or taking you to DC on Sunday. Sitting in a car with you for 20+ hours when you can't even be friendly with me will only make it harder for me to recover from this breakup, and I'm not willing to do that to myself. I hope you are able to find another way home, and I hope you have a wonderful thanksgiving with your family. Sorry for any inconvenience this causes. Best of luck to you. 

I didn't have it in me to be rude to her, but I got the message across nonetheless. 

Thanks again for the replies. Y'all are awesome."

4,"Update: I (23f) was dumped by my friend group after breaking things off with an abusive ex and am having trouble moving on.


It's been a month since my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/74zv56/i_23f_was_dumped_by_my_friend_group_after/), and let me just say y'all, I'm doing good.

I took the advice of this forum and deleted all of my old 'friends' on social media. Some noticed, some didn't. One girl messaged me asking if she had done 'anything wrong'--with all the politeness of my Southern upbringing, I diverted her question as to not discuss my abuse and personal life over frickin' Instagram message (of course, this was on Instagram, because that's all that matters to these people). Speaking of, I'm sure all of my old friends noticed me cutting them out online, because social media means everything to them. I still notice a few of them watch all of my Instagram stories almost right after I post them, which makes me pity that they missed out on an amazing person they probably think of often: me.
Not seeing my old friends antics online allowed me to clear my head and just be less obsessed with missing them and my own loneliness. It was all fake anyway, carefully posed pictures of boring, mean, cold lives. I know that, because that used to be me.

I've learned to enjoy my own company this month, as well as joined a local D'n'D group as per the recommendations y'all. Nerdy as hell, not at all Instagram chic, but a total fucking blast and the people are great. I've gone out dancing with them once (absolutely hilarious), and look forward to getting to know them more.

As for my abusive ex, I haven't heard anything about him other than seeing online that he's still partying and being his same old shit self. I went ahead and unfollowed the person who posted that video of him, too. I wrote a poem about how that video made me feel, and wouldn't you know yall, the place I submitted it to wanted to publish it. I have a mini book coming out next year, of poems I wrote when feeling absolutely alone. Seeing that video also inspired me to flush the rest of the drugs left in my house.

Thank you everyone for helping me through the darkness. The most important advice I received was that my friend group picked my ex because he was like them: empty, mean, and on the road to destruction.

I'm only a month in, but I feel like it's been a year. And I owe it to you guys. To other women getting out of abusive situations, you are a badass queen and not everyone will know how to handle your newfound strength. Keep shining.

**tl;dr:** Deleted old friends online, cleared my head, went sober-ish, became a half-elf druid, have a book coming out."
5,"Update to: My (25f) husband (24m) went out last night and has yet to return home


A few months ago I posted [this]https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6xekle/my_25f_husband_24m_went_out_with_his_friends_last/) looking for advice about my husband going out all night with his friends. The post was locked but I felt like some people may want an update.

So my husband returned home shortly after I posted to find me packing the car. I was honestly ready to walk at this point since this was the second time in just a few months that he had betrayed my trust. Before I left though I gave him one last opportunity to explain himself and he broke down crying and finally opened up to me. 

In April of this year, someone that he considered to be a dear friend and mentor was killed in action in Afghanistan. I knew that he was upset about it, but at the time our daughter was only two months old and I was struggling pretty badly with PPD and PPA. He felt that he couldn't talk to me about his own pain because he knew that I was in a bad way myself and so he turned to his co-workers. They were able to commiserate with him about what he was going through but unfortunately their way of dealing with sadness was to just go out and drink until you don't remember why you're hurting anymore. Obviously this set him on a path of self-destruction but at the time he didn't know how to vocalize how deeply he was hurting and he was just trying to stay afloat. 

This doesn't make what he did okay, but I finally was able to understand what was going on with him since his behavior the last few months was completely different than what he normally is like. 

He agreed to go to therapy a few times a week and is finally making some progress with his grief. We've got a long way to go but things have been getting better. 

As for the friend who texted me off of his phone calling me a bitch, when I showed him the message the next morning he was extremely upset and confused. Apparently at that point in the night my husband was pretty drunk and, although they work in the same company, they are part of different platoons and he did not really know the guy that texted me. It doesn't explain why he felt the need to text me (who he has never met) off of my husband's phone and call me a bitch but some people are just assholes I guess. 

TLDR; Husband was going through the loss of a friend and felt like he couldn't talk to me about his pain due to the fact that I was going through PPD/PPA. We've been going to therapy and I'm confident that our marriage will be okay. "

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bvybj/my_29f_ex_boyfriend_32m_moved_out_with_his/

Hey guys - so I just wanted to update some of the people who commented and gave me some insight. All of your comments were really appreciated and definitely helped me think. 

So for the last week my ex has been staying with family when hes not at work and we have been sharing time with Sarah. We met up this weekend to talk about everything and our life plan. He basically said that he does still love me, but that his schedule is just not something that can change for him anytime soon. I am trying to be understanding and supportive, because I do want to be with him and Sarah. We are going to look into counseling for us as a couple, and also family counseling for the three of us.

I did bring up legal adoption of Sarah. I was shocked when he said he was thinking of the same thing. He said that no matter what happens with us as a couple he always wants me to be a parental figure to Sarah. We had both hoped that someday I would adopt her, we just didn't see us breaking up or it becoming an issue. I am so glad we are on the same page about that. I am over the moon and were going to meet with a lawyer on Friday to get the ball rolling on that. 


I am hoping that this relationship can be saved because I really do feel like I have a family with them. My number one priority throughout this has been Sarah, and I am cant even explain how happy I am that I will get to legally be her parent. I know I wont ever be her mother but I'm glad that we will be together no matter what.

Thanks Reddit! Sorry this is kind of all over the place. We're still figuring everything out, but I wanted to update!

tl;dr: We are going to start couples and family counseling, as well as beginning the process for legal adoption!"

12,"SIL [23F] gifted me [27F] a sweet, but ugly cat necklace. Husband insists I wear it at all time so SIL's feelings aren't hurt, but I really don't want to look like a crazy cat lady.


This is a really ridiculous story I know but please give me some slack if I sound like a terrible person. 

Anyways my SIL [23F] is a very, very sweet and kind person and is also on the spectrum (high functioning Asperger syndrome). As a result she can be slightly awkward and in certain situations very sensitive. My husband and his family try their hardest to make her feel comfortable and support her when she's forming relationships. 

This is why what I'm about to tell you sounds so terrible. Last weekend it was my birthday, and we threw a small backyard BBQ for friends/family (SIL and in-laws live down the street from us, 5 min away). SIL approached me and gave me a small jewelry box with a really nice card. The card said something like she knows I have 3 cats that I love and she wants to gift me meant just for me. 

Well, you guys I almost teared up at the thought behind the present. It was ridiculously sweet of her to think of something so personal and tailor made for me. HOWEVER, the necklace itself is...unique. I have 3 cats, 2 from my deceased aunt and 1 I've had for years. SIL got their pictures from my husband and commissioned an Etsy jeweler to make the cat's exact likenesses into these big photorealistic metal cut outs. The metal cut outs are strung on a chain to form a large, jangly necklace. 

There is NO way to wear this necklace surreptitiously. Each of the cat ""pendants"" are roughly 2-3"" wide, and together they make a symphony of loud jangles when I wear it on my neck. I simply CANNOT wear this necklace and forget about it. Either I wear it as a ""statement"" piece or I have to uncomfortably tuck it into my sweater/tops. And not to mention the sheer crazy factor of wearing pictures of your cats on your neck wherever you go.  

I've talked to my husband and he also wants to see me to wear it constantly, because his sister randomly drops by our house and she'd want to see me wearing it. But he thinks it's the sweetest present she's ever given ANYONE, so I haven't really told him how I feel about it yet.  I'm a bit worried because I don't think anyone shares my feelings, to be quite honest. Her parents and my husband all oohed and aawed at the gift (even when SIL was out of the room) commenting on how well the metalwork was done and how pretty the jewelry is and how this will be on my neck for years for sure...

How do I tell them that the necklace isn't my style and I'd rather not wear it out in public? Family events, sure, but out and about? I know how much SIL means to everyone and how this was a huge sign of acceptance from her. I'd hate to give people the wrong idea of my ""fickleness"" and turn sentiments against me.

  **tl;dr**: SIL gifted me a very sweet, but quite ugly ""cat pendant"" necklace. Husband and family expects to see me wear it at all times, but I think it makes me look insane. How to gently explain myself?"

14,"Me [28F] with my husband [31M] of 2 years, he's upset because I'm skipping Friendsgiving


My husband is annoyed because I've decided not to attend Friendsgiving. It's a tradition among our friends and we've participated in the past but this year I'm not up for it. 

The main reason is that our son is only five weeks-old. I'm pretty much recovered physically from my c-section but my mind and body are still **tired**. Our pediatrician said it's important to make sure people wash their hands before touching him because we're entering cold &amp; flu season. I don't want to have to worry about it all night or be ""that mom"" reminding everybody to wash their hands. 

There are other, less significant, reasons too. Most of our friends don't have kids yet. I can't/don't want to drink alcohol, which is always a major part of our Friendsgiving. Being the only sober person by the end of the night will definitely be annoying. The couple hosting this year also have two dogs and three cats, the house is covered in pet hair and the animals climb all over people and the furniture. It's uncomfortable for me because I'm allergic to cats and I don't care for animals climbing on and/or licking me. I wouldn't be happy if one of the pets was all over the baby and it's possible he has allergies too.

**I just don't want to go.**

During my pregnancy my husband frequently reminded me he didn't want the baby to change everything or become the center of our lives (lol). I believe this is why he's annoyed about Friendsgiving. We got into an argument earlier and I brought this up, I told him he's being unrealistic, which apparently really bothered him. I told him he can do whatever he wants but I'm staying home. I have no desire to attend this year and I think he could try harder to have some empathy, I just had a baby FFS. He's so paranoid about our lives *god forbid* changing that he's failing to recognize he's being inconsiderate and causing me to feel some resentment towards him.

I love my husband and I don't like feeling this way about him. I don't know what to do here. I understand his concerns but holy shit, he needs to back off, our son is **five weeks old**. 

Do you think I'm wrong to want to stay home? 

How can I help him see this from my perspective? I want to spend Saturday night relaxing at home, snuggling with my baby, and maybe preparing for actual Thanksgiving. Socializing is the farthest thing from my mind and actually sounds overwhelming and stressful. But he doesn't see it this way. It's all about me being a boring mom now and not trying hard enough to be the 'cool' wife/mom/friend. 

**Update**: We talked a little last night when he came home. I acknowledged his feelings and concerns and assured him I think they're completely valid. However, the way he communicates with me on this issue needs to change (and he agreed). I told him he's pushing me away and I'm growing resentful. I also mentioned how I'm afraid to be vulnerable with him because I worry he'll just criticize me. It was late so we didn't talk long but he seemed to understand. He apologized for being so hard on me about this and he said he didn't realize it was taking such a big toll on me. We'll definitely have more in-depth conversation about this soon. **Thank you for all of your help, reassurance, and kind words.**

Also, because people asked about these things:

- I do take the baby out. I think fresh air is good for babies. I tend to avoid taking him to places indoors with a lot of people, though.

- My husband is a good dad. He takes care of our son and spends time with him. He has him on a blanket in the backyard right now (doing tummy time).

- Maintaining a social life is important to me. Being a mom is part of who I am now but it's one aspect of my life. Our son needs a lot of my time and attention and I *want* to give it to him. But that doesn't mean it will be like this forever. I don't think it's unreasonable to give a new mom time to enjoy loving on the baby and that doesn't mean that's all she'll ever want to do going forward. I actually said this to my husband last night and I could tell it resonated with him. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My (very social) husband is annoyed with me because I am not attending Friendsgiving. Our baby is 5 weeks-old and I'm not feeling it. He thinks this is the beginning of the end and our social lives are doomed because I ""won't"" try harder to be social and outgoing. I spend time with friends and family regularly and believe his fears are misplaced. I also think it's unrealistic to think everything will stay the same after you have a baby."
15,"Roommate (28f) tells me {30m} I'm not allowed to bring gf over anymore


My introvert roommate told me I'm not allowed to bring my gf over anymore because it makes her uncomfortable. She stays in her room all night and day and has never spent anytime in the common area which is where we stay. 

We literally watch tv and then she goes home after that. She never sleeps over. We are not affectionate or anything either. Am I in the wrong for bringing someone over this often without asking? She comes over 2 times a week

Tl:Dr - roommate told me I'm not allowed to bring gf over anymore because it makes her uncomfortable

Update : wow I didn't think this would blow up. Thank you everyone that's given input. I've talked to the roommate and she said that the gf can come over occasionally.... but not every week and especial not 2-3 times a week. Once in awhile is fine but it makes her too uncomfortable to see the S. O. As often as she has. 

To give some clarification, the roommate will not hang out with me when I'm by myself and stays couped up in her room. When I first moved in I've asked her multiple times to hang out and socialize to build a good relationship and I've offered to make dinner together but to no avail. I do believe she uses the living room when I'm not home as I've seen her at the dining table when I've come back from work but right when I step into the house she'll run back into her room.

16,"How can I (F30) possibly tell my partner ( of 7 years )(M37), that HE is the reason that I don't want a second child?




Please do not misunderstand me; I do not regret having our son. I am not pining for ""the way things were before the baby"". The baby was/is entirely planned and wanted. We were both eager first-time parents.  I feel that I adapted to parenthood well, while my partner just... kind of didn't. He did minimal adapting, and as a result I now feel like a single parent with a lodger that occassionally ""babysits"" our son, if I ask him to. I feel let down by him. 


At first, I thought it could be just that he lacked confidence in dealing with a new born.. Now our son is nearly two and my partner is great at being fun with him, when he's ""on daddy duty"", but is still absolutely clueless about the rest of the things that he needs besides play. Caring that he's clean, fed and how much he has slept are exclusively mommy's problems. When I try politely inviting him to consider caring about these things, because it would help me out, I get told, a) he's shocked that I think that he doesn't care..? And, b) not to nag him because he gets enough pressure from work.


We met each other through work. I know his job. I had no idea that it was so very stressful that one couldn't possibly handle also being a parent. Seems like something that he should have brought up for discussion before committing to the deal. I still work part-time since becoming a mom. I do not, however, come home from work and think ""*feed and bathe my kid...? Nah... think I'm gonna ignore the kid and play on Rust for six hours, because I worked really hard today.""*


Aaand that's how he has been for nearly two years and he is not about to change. I have asked him to help more, do more. He might say that he will, but never does. A while ago I spent an unexpected four days in hospital.. I realised how much of an idiot I had been for not insisting on ""training"" daddy, because he did not even know how to feed our son. Completely oblivious to something that we do every day, he had to ask me what he eats. He also wants us to have a second child in the next year or two. I am close to telling him that I would have to be fucking insane to have another baby with him. I always did want 2 or 3 kids someday. He is reason why that plan is now out the window. How on earth am I going to explain that without completely crushing him? I don't actually want the relationship to end. Just definitely want no more kids until he can pull his weight as a parent.


**tl;dr** Sooner or later going to have to tell my partner that he is the reason why I don't want another baby, and it's going to hurt to hear it."

*Gracias all you helpful people.  I've cooled down quite a bit from this morning and your comments helped me realize that I shouldn't think of the house as just mine.  I still think it's weird but I think I'll be okay telling her it creeped me out having someone in the house without expecting it.  Also, I now know about 75 different places to buy locks, should I ever need to.*

I have a short term contract job on a very rural college campus.  There's only 75 people here, including staff.  I've been here for three months, I have one more to go.  My boss is really quirky, but in general I like her.  We teach art.

This morning I skipped breakfast (staff is provided breakfast and lunch) because I've got a cold and don't feel so great.  I live alone, but when I got out of the shower, I heard someone walking around in my house.  I was dripping wet, wearing only a towel and I rushed to my bedroom door to see who it was.  I opened the door and my boss was standing outside my bedroom, with some random cell phone in her hand.  She asked ""Is this yours??""  I seriously stood there with my mouth open for about 3 seconds before saying no.  Then she told me she was heading to work.  I don't even think I responded, just shut my door.  

I took this job because it's an amazing place to put on my resume and it WILL get me jobs after this.  I'm NOT okay with this.  I'm fuming mad at the weird invasion of privacy.  How do I approach her to say I'm livid that she thought she could walk into my house at 8 in the morning just to ask me a dumb question?  Why would someone think that's okay?  Now she's accusing me of not being myself today.  I can't even look at her without feeling angry.  How do I approach this without being mean/angry?  I NEED this job for future referrals!  

EDIT TO ADD:  The campus is the entire town.  There are only 75 people in the surrounding 10 miles- NONE of the buildings on campus have locks except the school store and the directors office.  I can't add one.  The only ""common area"" of the house is the kitchen and it has a separate entrance.  It is NOT a dorm.  Anytime there is going to be a guest instructor staying in my house, I'm given advance notice.
 
tl;dr: I got out of the shower this morning, heard someone in my house.  Opened my bedroom door and my boss was standing there.  How do I handle this professionally when I'm fuming mad?"

I decided to go and see him. I talked to my uncle first and he told me that my brother is acting great, doing good work and is being very reasonable about everything. He also said he's asked about me but kept his distance out of respect, since I stopped visiting him in prison.

When I met him it wasn't easy. I had some unresolved feelings and I ended up shouting at him a little, but also eventually ended up crying in his arms. We talked for hours and hours that day. The more we talked the more I realized how much I missed him and having him in my life, and also how little I knew about our parents. They were horrible to him, really abusive.

Our father used to hit him. I remember him crying in his room sometimes. I always teased him and mocked him for it. I was a lot younger and didn't know what was going on, but I have vague memories that I mostly hurried but now they made a lot of sense. I even remember our dad went to his room with a belt. My mom told me he wanted to see if it fits on my brother's pants. I was 12 I think. I believed it and ever thought twice. No wonder he was acting out and was troubled. I know it doesn't excuse what he did that left him in prison but it adds some context.

When I visited him in prison early on, he would always ask me if our parents are treating me well. They were to be fair, they never abused me. Or if they did I don't remember. I thought he was trying to badmouth them but he was worried about me. He apologized to me that his stupid mistake ended up separating us because he had promised himself to keep me safe and to help me when I turn 18.

Our grandma confirmed the abuse as well when I talked to her. She knew about it and did nothing. She told me my mom didn't kill her self because of what my brother did or my dad's repulse, it was over guilt for not doing anything to end the abuse that my brother suffered for years. My view of my parents have changed completely. 

To make it short, we decided to restart our family with a clean slate. We promised to love each other and take care of each other. We've both been to therapy as well. We missed a lot of years but we have a lot of time ahead of us. 

It's so good to have a family again! I've had friends in these times but never had someone who knew everything about me. Someone I could trust and always rely on. And being that person to someone else. Now I have that and it's amazing. We talk on most days and see each other at least once a week. He's still working in the farm with our uncle and is doing a good job. But I convinced him to go back to college and get his degree. He began this semester. He's also staying away from alcohol completely and I'm doing the same. Both our parents had an alcohol problem and he did something horrible while drunk and our uncle has also been having DUIs, people in our family should not be drinking. I never had a problem with alcohol but I think doing it together is just easier for him and me.

So overall, life is good. And I'm really hopeful for our future! Thanks for your help especially those who gave me the courage to step up and meet him.

22,"MY [31F] mother in law [60F] is upset with me because my son [3M] didn't want to go in our pool with her because husband and I weren't there.


My mother in law is visiting my husband and I from Bali. She's retired in Bali like many Australians do and we rarely see her these days. She's staying with us until the new year. Earlier today my husband I left our son with my mother in law so we could go out and see a movie together. We then headed to Coles to buy our supplies we needed for the week. 

When I got home I could see my mother in law was upset. She moaned at my husband and I that it's hot and she couldn't swim. She told me she wanted our son to go in the pool with her. He apparently stood far away from the open gate shaking his head. He essentially told her that Mum and Dad said I'm never allowed to go near the pool if they're not here. Which we have. We told him that it's not safe and he mustn't do things if we're not here. My husband is swimming with our son right now in the pool, and she's still sulking. She thinks our son doesn't trust her when he was just following what we told him. She said we're raising him to be scared of water if his parents are not there. I'm trying to keep my temper to keep the peace for my husband because I know how happy he is, but I'm starting to break. How do I handle it?

23,"My [F27] boyfriends [M28] centipede escaped and we're fighting about it. 2 years


He has a Vietnamese Centipede (google it) and it came with him when we got our first apartment together a few months ago. He's into exotic animals so this is his idea of a pet. I didn't mind, *as long as it never left the tank*. Now it's got out somehow.

The problem is we'd been going to have his brother, SIL and niece over to visit today. His niece is at the ""crawling everywhere"" stage. These centipedes are very aggressive and will bite if startled or not handled properly. I said he should cancel the visit until the centipede is found. Or at least warn them!

He said no it's not a big deal. What? There's a baby going to be crawling all over with a venomous centipede on the loose? He said she could provoke it into coming out of hiding, then he'd jump in and get it before it could hurt her.

This is fucking insane to me. I get he wants to find his pet, I want it found too but how is it acceptable to put a child at risk?? So I told him if he didn't tell his brother then I would and they could decide if they came. He said ""Fine whatever"" and hasn't spoken to me since that this morning. He DID go call them then, and predictably they didn't want to come. We rescheduled, but he's still annoyed at me...for taking safety seriously?

We've still kept looking for the centipede but I can feel his annoyance at me. Is there something I did wrong?

*Tl;dr* My bf's Vietnamese centipede escaped it's tank. When I told him we should cancel a visit from his family who has a young child, he didn't think it was a big deal. Ended up telling them anyway but he's irritated at me. I don't think I did anything wrong by bringing up safety concerns. What's up with his reaction?

**Edit, how things stand as of 10 pm:** Still no centipede. The apartment isn't that big (3 rooms, 1 closet) and we've checked literally everywhere, no square foot has been unturned. And yes we stripped the bed and sorted through every piece of laundry. We live in a very large and very old building, hundreds of residents. At this point we think it likely got into a crack somewhere in the wall or gone down a vent. The building isn't exactly up on its repairs.

I did calmly tell my boyfriend we needed to talk about his reaction. I told him the phrasing some of you used, that he was basicly saying ""Let's use my niece as bait and lure it out."" He hadn't seen it like that but when I said so he realized it was true. He apologized for being huffy at me, and for his astoundingly braindead idea about his niece. He said he was panicking and mad at himself for not securing the tank right, and acted defensive. Now that he's cooled off he realizes he was in the wrong. He knows he messed up, I told him if he wants an exotic pet again it MUST be a safe one. At least an escaped iguana or stick insect couldn't hurt anyone. He agreed to this.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice!!"
24,"Can’t stand my husband’s classist friends, and how he agrees with them


My husband (39M) has worked upper mid level at several corporate companies and was educated at an Ivy league school. His friends (all from various jobs, mostly from one former job) are all at his career level or slightly above but didn’t go to Ivy Leagues (most have MBAs or other masters degrees though).

I’m (30F) a nanny and never finished college, but I will eventually and I’m not embarrassed by my job (which I enjoy) or a gold digger. I was raised fairly well off (though that fell apart in my teens and both by parents are now below the poverty line, despite their best efforts). I don’t consider myself at a lower level than my husband or his friends. 

Occasionally I hang out with them (late 30’s early 40’s, all females) by going out to dinner/drinks with my husband and his friends, or to one of their houses for a dinner party, or they come to our house for a dinner party, etc. That would all be good except that I find most of them extremely classist and, some of them fairly rude. That would be ok, but I really don’t like my husband either when he’s around them (and after he’s around them too), because he makes extremely classist remarks and is rude like them too. Its still clear that my husband shares those classist views even when his friends aren’t around, it just comes out around them because they encourage that kind of talk.  

As an example, the other night we were out with one of his friends, waiting to meet the others for dinner. One of the friends who wasn’t there yet had just started being “stalked” by a security guard from a former workplace. The friend waiting with us kept talking about was why would the “stalked”  friend be friends with a security guard, why did she even talk to the security/mail room people, didn’t she expect this from people like that, what could she even talk to a security guard about, etc. Then my husband started in, talking about how they had hung out with the mail room guys/security/secretaries but would never associate with them in a non group setting, why would you even talk to them, etc. They both had a mocking and superior tone. 

I found this whole conversation really gross to listen to, especially since I’d seen my husband’s group hang out many times with the mail room guys, the security, the administrative assistants, etc. and the “blue collar” people thought they were hanging out as coworkers, but after they left my husband’s friends and him always talked like they were doing them a favor for letting them hang out, and kind of making fun of them (very gross high school behavior). 

After listening to this I told them that anyone could stalk our other friend, not just a security guard, and my husband’s friend didn’t even acknowledge what I’d said. Once the friend being stalked arrived she was adamant she would never be friends with a security guard or anyone at that level, why way he even be in her neighborhood because he makes minimum wage, etc. 

They also speak ill of their nannies frequently, fire them without warning or good reason (the reasons they give are petty, but everyone always agrees that they were sooo right to fire them, etc. when, in reality, they would actually sue if fired for the same reasons.) and act as though they are waaay below them and kind of trash, and yet brag about how well they treat their nannies (though I know that they pay about $10 per hour less than the average for the area they live, don’t give paid vacation, etc.) 

My main problem is that it seems like this attitude is simmering in my husband all the time, it just only comes out when he’s around them or talking about them. 


Tldr: husband’s friends are classist towards blue collar people (which I technically am) and I find them rude and insufferable. I can avoid them but it seems my husband has the same thoughts as them, but only lets them out around them."
25,"[UPDATE] My [29F] ex [40M] choked his son [10M].


[Original post can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7afmpg/my_29f_ex_40m_choked_his_son_10m/)


My last post didn't get that much attention, but many of you took your time to give me advice so I wanted to give you guys an update!

The day after my post, I called the mother and talked to her for a long time. I asked her if she was planning on calling CPS or the police, she said no. I told her that I am going to call them, whether she does it or not, because I owed it to her kids and I also told her that I felt unsafe and was too scared to be home alone. She started crying at this point, told me that she was scared too and didn't have the courage to call CPS by herself. She also told me that she had contacted a therapist for her children, they have a meeting set up next week. She also talked to the school and informed them that Dave was not allowed to pick up the kids. From my understanding, she didn't breach their custody agreement by doing that or picking the kids up at my place last week.

So, after we hung up, I called CPS. I told them everything I knew about the choking incident and also about his history of being rough with his kids. They took me very seriously. I asked them if I should call the police too, they told me that I should because I'm too scared to go home. So I called them. After my last post, I started remembering times when Dave had been rough with me too, so I also mentioned that to the police.

I don't know the details of what has happened, but the mother was granted some form of emergency full custody. I know she got herself a lawyer too. I know the police talked to Dave but he's still at home. If I understood the mother right, CPS wants to finish their investigation before they hand over everything to the police. But as I said, I don't know all of the details. But the kids are going to stay with their mother.

Dave and I have some mutual friends, I haven't told any of them about what has happened. One of them told me that Dave went on some form of drinking and drug binge last weekend. I decided to come back home two days ago. I was out walking my dogs last night and saw him across the street. He looked at me, stared for a second or so, and then ran inside.

I am meeting the kids on Sunday, but I'm worried that they will be angry with me for what I did. I hope that they will understand in the future, but they love their dad. One of the reasons Liam loved spending time at his dads was that he could play video games, so I asked the mother if they wanted to borrow my PS4 and an old gaming laptop, so I'm bringing that with me. Do I talk to them about any of this when I meet them? I want to make sure that Sara knows she did the right thing and how proud I am of her for having the courage, and I just want to let Liam know how awesome he is and how much I love him. 


  **tl;dr**: Called CPS and the police about abusive ex, he no longer has custody of his kids."

27,"(Update) Is my (40/F) husband (50/M) having/about to have an affair?


Update from my post: [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7cjw9k/is_my_40f_husband_50m_having_an_affairabout_to/)

Thank you for all of your helpful advice and supportive/sympathetic words. I want to provide an update as to what transpired since my post. I wasn’t sure if I was wanted to post an update because I do not think I’m handling this well or valiantly (I didn’t pack up his clothes or call a divorce lawyer or do anything but feel sorry for myself, so I’m a bit embarrassed), but I’ve decided writing it out might help. This is long, sorry. This is what happened: 

**Monday night:**
Waited for my husband to come home after work, and he walked in around 9. He was acting totally normal and I waited for him to change into his relaxing clothes (to be less confrontational). Our daughter was at my mom’s. When he sat across from me at the dining room table, we just talked casually and then I Said: “Hey, so I was googlig xyz on your phone and your instagram was open and while I was looking thru your pics, this girl messaged you. Is she new to the gym?” He looked confused and I tried to look neutral (didn’t want him gauging responses based on my reactions), and then a few seconds later, he was like, “Oh yeah, her? (name)? She’s not really that new. But she’s been going there a lot recently and I wanted to get to know what she was about and how she’s been fitting in at the gym.” I know my husband is friendly and will often randomly chat up strangers, but like you guys know, I felt weird about this. So I basically told him I saw their messages to meet up on Weds and asked if she was going to be a new client of his (he is an independent trainer at this gym. The gym has its own membership, but he works on his own in the space). At first he said “maybe”,  and then when I pointed out that she didn’t mention interest in personal training in the messages, he was like “Oh well no, she wants to be a gym member. Not a client of mine.” I asked him why he didn’t mention her/the dinner to me and he said he “didn’t think there was anything to mention”. So I dropped it. I felt like I was handling this badly and that I was grasping at straws for the sake of continuing this conversation. We didn’t speak about it for the rest of the night, except when he asked me randomly before bed, “So what are you mad about?” I asked him why he thought I was mad and he just said I’ve been acting “strange” ever since he mentioned the girl. I said it was nothing and that was it.

**Wednesday night:**
I decided to trust my husband and keep my faith in him and did not bring it up at all the next day (Tuesday). Wednesday morning, I ask if he’s still going out to meet this girl and he says “Yea, and I might go out with some of the other trainers.” Again, I decided to be trusting because is my husband after all, and why would I doubt every word he’s saying? Wednesday night comes and I try so hard not to think about what they’re talking about/doing, etc. I kept reminding myself that he didn’t lie to me, so it’s not fishy/weird. But then 9:30pm rolls around, and I’m freaking out (inside), so I text “Hey, hope your meeting is going well. Home soon?” And he replies 45min later saying, “Yep, in a cab right now!” Him coming in at 11 is not unusual (sometimes he works until 10, sometimes he hangs out with longterm clients who are always men however). When he gets home, I ask him if he had a good time and what they talked about and if she was liking the gym and wanted to be a client (I was trying to sound like I assumed it was professional) and all he told me was that they talked about her eating/exercise lifestyle, his clients, and travel. Again, I decide not to press it.

**Thursday:**
Something still wasn’t sitting right with me that next day, and I checked his text messages that evening while he was exercising (so much for faith and not checking messages, right?) and this is what I found:

*G:* (Wednesday evening) Hey, I’m on my way but may be a few minutes late

*G:* Here, I’m sitting at the right when you walk in

*H:* Ok, be there in 5

*H:* (12:06am on what is now technically Thursday - about 1.5hrs after he got home) Hey - hope you got home safely. Thanks for sharing time with me. I really enjoyed your company, much more than I would have imagined. I hope I can see you soon, how about Saturday?

*G: (8:30am) Hey, my pleasure. Thanks again for dinner. I have a potluck on Saturday, but maybe another day

And when I checked again about an hour later to see if he answered, the messages were deleted. That gutted me. I was really upset by what I found, and I decided to speak to someone (not a marriage counselor yet), so I called my brother and told him everything. One of the reasons I wrote on here was because the anonymity makes it easy to admit embarrassing things like your husband maybe having an affair. But I feel like I need to tell someone close to me at least. My brother basically told me that he thinks my husband has a crush on this woman, and that either she doesn’t know he’s married, or is looking to make friends at the gym (he doesnt wear a wedding band when he trains, btw) and needs to not be friends with my husband. Oh, and I need to shut it down. I know crushes happen (theoretically), but the idea was crushing me. So this morning (Friday), I told my husband I want to talk to him after work and so when he gets home in a bit, I’m going to tell him everything I know, but more importantly how I feel about this situation.

**Update from last night:**
I told my husband everything: that I saw the text messages too, that I think he has a crush on this girl, and that I am unhappy with it, and if he is committed to the marriage and his wife, then he will stop all of the communication. At first he kept saying over and over that they’re just new friends, that “why would she be interested anyway”, and they weren’t romantic on basically the dinner that they went on, and that she talks to other trainers at the gym so it’s not like the two of them are only friends with each other. So I pointed out that he pursued a date with her, didn’t tell me about her on his own like he should with an innocent friend, he texts her flirty things like about enjoying her company, he asked her out again, and he deleted the messages, and all that stuff and that it all is inappropriate and just flatout deception, lies, and wrong in a marriage. He kept on saying he that he was just deleting stuff off his phone indiscriminately, that he doesn’t question me about stuff on my phone, that I need to trust him and the kind of person he is (he has always been a kind person, who would give a shirt off his back to help a friend) and he “wasn’t serious about seeing her again”. 

That’s when I lost it and just yelled at him that that is a boldfaced lie, that he’s cheating by being attracted to someone and pursuing this attraction by spending time with her alone and flirting sending her texts at midnight, and that I never signed up to marry a liar or unfaithful man, and that I was going to go for a separation. He didn’t even say anything to that - no reply, nothing. I felt so defeated after that I just started crying and I stopped speaking, and he kept trying to hug me and console me. I didn’t even want him to touch me so I asked point blank: do you like her? And he said that yes, he does. That’s when he broke down crying too and kept apologizing over and over and saying he feels guilty. I asked him if they slept together or did anything physical, and he completely denied it (I don’t think they did, but why all of a sudden feel guilty?? And my trust is broken, so I asked) and he just kept saying he thought she was pretty and a nice person at the gym and he liked to hang around her. We talked about it for a long time. I wanted to know of all the details. I asked if he told her he was married (he said he didn’t tell her explicitly, but she saw his Instagram so he know she knows), I told him *again* how much it hurts me, and that they can’t be friends because of this, and that he needs to delete her on Instagram and stop texting her. He said he would text her that they can’t meet up anymore as a “final text”, but that he didn’t want to delete her as a friend on instagram because it’s more work-related. That made me feel still uncomfortable, so I told him he doesn’t need to be friends with her as she is not even a client. I want to trust him that it was just a crush and even if he can’t quit working at this specific gym, he can quit communicating outside of it. 

we decided to think about marriage counseling. He thinks we can work strengthening our marriage (spending more time together) without outside help, and I kind of agree. I don’t know what MC would tell us about this situation that can help us, but I am not opposed to going. So that is where we are now.

30,"My husband [26M] drives dangerously when angry to scare me [25F].


  We were driving home (him driving) from lunch and having a pretty good day when in the middle of the drive his stomach started hurting. We were 15 minutes away from home so I asked him several times if he wanted to pull over to a gas station or something so he could use the bathroom and I could drive home, but he insisted he was fine and wanted to tough it out. We were about 5 minutes from home when we got behind a car of an elderly person that was driving under the speed limit that we couldn't pass.  

  They were only going 5 under the speed limit so I tried to reassure my husband that we were almost home. He became increasingly annoyed as we got closer to home, until about a minute away from our home he got so mad he started tailgating the person's car and swerving left and right in the lane aggressively. I was scared he was going to hit the person and asked him over and over to stop until i screamed ""STOP"" in fear. This set my husband off badly and he moved into a neighborhood turn lane and accelerated hard as if  to pass the slow car, all while i was screaming and begging him to stop. Instead he peels off into the neighborhood, slams on the brakes hard and puts the car in park and screams ""I'M IN PAIN, SHUT THE FUCK UP"" and puts the car back in drive and does a sharp fast turn back onto the road and drives aggressively fast and over the speed limit the rest of the way home as i beg him to slow down. When we stop in front of our house he tells me not to talk to him the rest of the day and slams the door. Obviously we haven't spoken since.  

I am so tired of him using dangerous driving as a weapon against me whenever he's angry. I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time this has happened, months ago pretty much the same scenario happened and he drove intentionally aggressively to scare me since i screamed in fear. He admitted he wanted to scare me because he was mad at me. Last time he did it I told him I wasn't going to tolerate it happening again. How do I discuss this with him?  

Update: My husband came into the bedroom and halfheartedly apologized. He only apologized for ""getting mad"" and said he still didn't feel good and wanted to lie down. I asked him if he was sorry for anything else. He didn't seem to get it and just laid down and went to sleep. I left the room. Considering just leaving and going to my parents house.

EDIT: I am extremely grateful for all the people who are taking the time to give me advice and console me. I'm not sure what I'm going to do at this point besides spend some time at my parents, but I appreciate every single comment (except for a couple of you who were real assholes for no reason) and it's made me realize a lot of things I've been ignoring.

32,"I [24f] started with a new counselor [50sF]... these are red flags, right?


Yesterday I started with a new counselor, a 50s woman. I'm trying not to be too critical, but I left feeling very put-off and unheard. I'm just going to list the major things:

* When I mentioned impostor syndrome, she said ""I keep hearing about that but I'm not sure what it is.""
* She implied my non-violent sexual trauma wasn't as big of a deal despite the fact that I never consented, and in fact said no many times. 
* It took a long back and forth to convince her that my trauma related nightmares occurred whether or not I smoked marijuana that night (I'm an occasional smoker, and she seemed sure it only happened when I smoke, which isn't true)
* When I mentioned having tried psychedelics a couple times but less than once a year, she said she would hope so, as she was always afraid that she'd never come down if she took LSD, but ""I suppose that's not possible...""
* She was insistent that my uptick in trauma related nightmares was more related to the fact that I enjoy violent video games, movies and shows (something that's been consistent since I was literally 3 years old) rather than the fact that lately every other headline is about someone famous being outed as a rapist. 
* She seemed super proud that I stopped drinking heavily--which I did as a result of being sexually assaulted while black out drunk in high school--because ""how you get over trauma is taking steps to make sure it will never happen again""... which to me, felt like a fancy round about way to blame my assault on me for being black-out drunk in the first place.

I have a BA in psych and I try my best not to let that affect my opinions of mental health professionals because I *know* that I didn't learn shit in regards to how to treat a patient... but I dunno. Part of me thinks I should give her another chance, but part of me felt blamed as a trauma victim and judged as a person (for occasionally smoking and for enjoying violent video games/movies/TV).  

Am I crazy, or was she awful? If I cancel my appointment, should I say why or just cancel without an explanation?

**EDIT:** Thanks for your help everyone. In retrospect it's obvious that these are real problems, I'd just convinced myself that I was being overly critical. I cancelled my next appointments with this email:

&gt;Upon reflection, I do not think we will be a good therapeutic match. Whether it be because of a generational gap,  differences in values, or something else entirely, I left the session yesterday feeling unheard and judged.  As such, I would like to cancel the two appointments we scheduled (11/27 &amp; 12/11). Please confirm that these appointments have been canceled, but please also note that I am not inviting discussion regarding the reasons for my cancellations. 

I also managed to schedule a new appointment with a different counselor. Here's hoping he's better. Thanks again everyone!


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: New counselor made me feel judged/blamed for my trauma. Is my BA in psych is leading me to feel too judgmental or should I cancel my next appointment and look for someone else? "
33,"I[19F] recently found out my boyfriend[23M] has shared intimate videos of me with his friends


Thank you so much for all your caring messages, truly &lt;3 it means the world to me. still trying to cope and still upset but I feel I'll be okay. I just need to go about making sure those videos are gone.

I'm shaking while I'm writing this. I just don't know where to turn. I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and three months at this point, and it's very serious. He's the first guy I started dating, once I moved out and he's my first real boyfriend. 
We recently spoke about the possibility of us moving in together in the new year, but now I don't know. 


Two days ago the girlfriend of my boyfriend's friend told me, her boyfriend had expressed discomfort because my boyfriend had shown intimate videos of me to their group of guy friends. When she told me this I felt like I was going to throw up. 

This group of guys are all in our friend circle and we go out with them and their girlfriends often, at least once a week we're all gathered. 
 
I'm absolutely devastated and feel completely humiliated. These videos are of me and/or my boyfriend for OUR use, and they're extremely private ... full nudity and intimacy. 

I have confronted my boyfriend and he has apologized a lot and expressed that he was immature and he wanted to show his friends because he was ""proud"" 
He has sent me about fifty texts these last 24 hours apologizing saying stuff like ""I completely understand why you feel violated"" etc. 

I haven't answered. I can't even begin to explain how embarrassed I feel. These are literally people I see all the time, and knowing they've seen those videos of me... 
On top of all of that we were all supposed to go out to celebrate my birthday this month and now I feel like my whole life has been ruined, it might sound dramatic but these people are my main group of friends, apart from those I have from home. 

I love my boyfriend and I don't doubt he's sincerely sorry, but I don't know if I can ever forgive him for this. + I didn't know he was so immature in that sense. I'm just disgusted. 

 I'm contemplating going back to my parents for a while. 

I seriously need help I don't know what to do or what to think. Part of me feels I have to break up, at the same time I do love him but he has completely violated my trust and those videos were SO PRIVATE. 
I love the life we were building together and our group of friends, I just feel it can't ever be the same. I feel humiliated.

Several of his friends's girlfriends have messaged me and I know it's probably sweet messages but I haven't opened them yet. 

sorry if this whole thing is confusing I tried to make it as clear as possible but im still so upset.

Please help me what do I do?

35,"My husband’s aunt [59F] is suspicious of me [33F] because my son [2M] is blond.


My husband [37M] and I have been married for 5 years. Together we have 2 children, 4F and 2M.  I am half Chinese and half white, while my husband is fully white. I have very dark brown hair, almost black, but green eyes. My husband has brown hair and blue eyes.

When my son was born, he was basically bald. Then as he started to grow, his hair also grew. Now he has the most adorable blond curls, while my daughter has sleek dark brown hair. My husband and I were surprised, but it’s not impossible, considering the fact that his father and my grandfather were both blond. Thus we likely both carry the recessive blond genes.

My husband’s aunt though, is not as easily convinced. She understands the whole recessive gene Punnet square thing (she DOES have a high school education...) but says that it’s “too much of a coincidence” for our son to turn out blond. She’s literally spreading rumours in the family insinuating that I had an affair with a blond guy or something. 

My sweet MIL is having none of her sister’s nonsense. She actually confronted her the other day and straight out told her to stop with the rumours. The auntie then said that my MIL was “blind” not to see that her poor son was being taken advantage of.

My husband and I are very hurt by these rumours that are rising up in the family and even amongst our friends. Those who really know me know that I would NEVER cheat on him, much less carry another man’s child.

 It’s bloody ridiculous, especially considering the fact that my son looks a lot like my husband when he was a baby, minus the blond hair. He looks quite a lot like my husbad’s dad, too (who sadly passed away a year before).

I don’t know what to do. The crazy auntie is causing us so much stress. I also can’t help but detect a whiff of racism in her whole sphiel, like... how can that half Asian lady pop out a blond kid??

Is there ANYTHING I could do? I feel majorly attacked and I know people in our circle are whispering about this.

TL;DR: My 1/4 Asian son is blond, while my husband and I are both brunettes. His aunt is insinuating that I cheated on him."
36,"My [46] younger sister [41] insulted my daughter [26] yesterday.


Yesterday I hosted a Thanksgiving gathering at my house because my mom was in from out of town and other irrelevant reasons.  My sister has always been less than tactful in the way she talks to people, just rather rude.  We have never been particularly close.  She is divorced, no children.  I am divorced as well, 26yo daughter, 22yo son, 9yo son.

So my sister was already in the living room when my daughter arrived.  The first words my sister said to my daughter were ""what did you do to your hair, it's ugly!"" WTF?  Who says that?
  I was not in the room when this happened, but my daughter immediately came to me, face beet red, and told me what she said to her.  It clearly hurt her feelings.    My sister later told my daughter that she was only kidding but never apologized.  My daughter steered clear of her for the rest of the day.

My question is, do I say something to my sister about this?  I definitely want to.  And what do I say?  

TL;DR Sister insulted my daughter, what, if anything do I say to her?"
37,"My dad (49M) pointed a gun at me (26m)


So this happened 6 and a half hours ago. We got into an argument about who's responsibility it was to to get some ground beef. Yeah, you read that right, ground beef started this. He started shoving me, and then for the first time in my life he threw a punch at me and hit me in my face. I unglued and got back in his face and pushed him back. He looked genuinely surprised and ran into his room saying he was going to call the cops because I assaulted him. I made a comment while walking to my room that it must be nice to be able to close ones room door when they don't want to deal with things because even though I pay an equal share of rent I'm not allowed to close my door. I guess he heard this and grabbed his gun and pointed it at me, pulled back the slide, and ranted about having nothing to lose. I just simply left to my mom's house and waited for my dad to go to his graveyard shift so I could come back and start gathering things. I'm now back at my mom's with my most valuable things, I took pictures the the current state of my room and have set up a meeting with police to gather the rest of my things later today after I get off work. My mom informed him (at my request because I don't want to deal with him right now) about the police and that I have taken pictures. So I'm all good there, at least I hope. 

The thing I'm having trouble with is my emotions. For some reason I'm worried about how this is going to affect my relationship with my dad. I know it should be dead at this point, but I keep thinking ""well he's my dad and we got along really well due to similar interests, what's going to happen now?"" I also do not think the full effect of having a gun pointed at me by my own dad has settled in yet. I feel anger and pity towards him at the same time. I guess I'm a confused mess right now and don't really know what to do. Is this normal?

Anyway, I'm going to try and get some sleep. If there are any responses I'll get to them in the morning. Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR** my dad pointed a gun at me, I left, but still remain emotionally confused.


UPDATE: Thank you guys for responding, I did not think there would be so many replies. I had to take a shower at work and just got done with that, I didn't want to wake up my mom to use her shower. So I left her house super early to get some supplies.

I'll start this update by explaining how my dad and I got into an argument about beef as I see some of you guys have asked. Simply put, my dad and alternate who pays for grocery shopping, this week was his week. He forgot to get ground beef and a few other things and had been asking me to buy them throughout the week. I responded with that wasn't my responsibility and I had no money until my paycheck came in anyway. Lasted night was when the ground beef would play a role with dinner and when I came home I didn't smell ground beef being cooked and I made a comment about it (there was probably attitude in my comment) and he replied with ""say that one more time and you'll regret it!"" In my infinte wisdom I replied with ""yeah, or what?"" in a snarky tone. He charged me and started pushing me while screaming at me to get out of his face and about how he asked me to get the ground beef so it was my responsibility. I tried to comply but that's really difficult when everytime he pushed he followed up and pushed me again. Eventually he decided to take a swing at me, I tried to block with my arms but he still managed to make contact with my face. I lost it and started pushing him back while screaming ""how does it feel when it happens to you?"" and ""do you like being bullied?"" I probably said some other things too. I stopped after I pushed him a couple of times and my dad ran to his room saying I assualted him and he was going to called the cops. He then slammed his door and locked it. I was head to my room to cool down and unfortunately I have walk by his room door to do so, and my infinte wisdom kicks in again and mutter about how nice it must be to close ones door when one doesn't want to deal with problems they caused. He screamed at through the door that he had gotten his gun and was not afraid to use it. I replied (again infinite wisdom) *with are you really going to shoot me?"" He responded by opening his door, pointing the gun at, pulling the slide back, and starting to rant at having nothing to lose. The rest is in the OP.

Second part of the update. My mom's boss is apparently super rich and owns a few properties. One of which is nothing but small single room apartments (think Japanese anime rooms where the high schoolers live in there own). He just so happens to have a vacancy and the rent is within my price range. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow morning about renting, my mom has basically said the unit is mine. 

Third part. My dad called me this morning, I picked up without looking because I was expecting a call from my mom about the unit. He wanted to talk financials, my infinte wisdom popping up again, we talked. The phone called ended with my agreeing to send in half of this months rent to the land lord directly and he tried to excuse the incident by saying the gun wasn't loaded. As more than a few of you pointed out. Every gun is loaded, all the time, even if you know that it is 100% unloaded, it's still loaded. I just hung up after that. I cried for a bit too. 

When I find out if I'm getting the apartment or not I'll do an post update in a new thread, I'll try my best to respond to people, but I have to start work in a few minutes, so my replies may be slow. "

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79b6rz/girlfriend_and_i_close_to_5_year_mark_told_her_i/


So here we are almost 3 weeks from the last post. To start I want to say thank you to everyone who replied, it was really great to read all the differing perspectives from everyone who chimed in.

We broke up. She moved all of her stuff out this week and we're going no contact. It's been the hardest 2 weeks of my life. I wonder every single day if I made a mistake and if I will ever find someone who I am compatible with again. I am really hoping that this feeling passes and the emptiness I'm feeling is a product of ending a relationship that was a crutch for both of us.

She had some good points when we talked and I realized that I've been very emotionally distant lately, and I had been projecting my disappointment in her lack of sharing activities with me in a very major way. Turns out I need to really work on myself as a partner before I can be the person I want to be. 

She's still a great person and I truly wish her the best. It's almost harder this way, in a way it'd be nice to have a reason to hate each other but it's been so goddamned amicable it's just a slow burn.

tl;dr We broke up and shit sucks. Hoping things get better and I don't feel like a hollow shell of a person forever"
40,"My (25 M) GF (23 F) wants the most ridiculously expensive things and she already has so much. She wants to buy the iPhone X and when I said no, she threw a fit.


My girl is sweet until she finds something on YouTube and Amazon and uses her money to buy it

I don't want to come off as a controlling person but we live paycheck to paycheck. I work $12 an hour and she works $10. She wants the newest and most expensive things. 

She wants EVERYTHING. Whenever we go to Walmart strictly for grocery shopping, she points to something and is like ""baby I want that. We should get it."" Not even considering if we're able to use it or if we need it. 

She wants a puppy. But I said no. 

She wants a MacBook, when we already have a good MacBook from 2 years ago in great condition. 

She wants the iPhone X when she got an iPhone 7 plus 6 months ago. I said no because we have to pay for our apartment. 

She always WANTS something. Like a 3 year old at a toy store. Except these toys costs over $300 and she's a ticking time bomb with a paycheck. There was a couple of incidents where she stole an iPad from someone or shoplifted from Walmart. This is what happens when she wants something but can't get it. 

I'm annoyed with this. I mean it's great to want things and aspire to have them. But we have expenses to pay for and we barely have enough money and time to ourselves. Sometimes she'll spend $100 or so on shoes and we have to fight about expenses. 

Please help me understand why she is doing this. 

TLDR: Girlfriend wants whatever she sees and sometimes goes to extremes to get what she wants. Even stealing. She buys things without my knowledge even after I disagree. She wants the newest most expensive things without realizing we have rent to pay. "

42,"My [25 F] boyfriend [27 M] of 7 months is very against me getting surgery, and it's really getting to me and having me reconsider our relationship


A few years ago, my gynecologists found abnormal cells in my cervix. I kept going for regular exams to monitor the progress of these cells. Now that I'm 25, and the cells have reach a ""high grade"" status, I've been advised to get the cells surgically removed.


I told my boyfriend about it because I was concerned, and I wish I never had now. He is so against modern western medicine. He thinks that surgery a severe solution to a problem that can be treated with home remedies, and that my doctor is just trying to bank on my condition. He says what I have is HPV, and that I can get rid of it by douching with diluted essential oils (tea tree and lemon) and assured me that this worked as a treatment for his break out of, what appeared to be warts (HPV he said) on his penis. He actually showed me the progress as he did this, and they're gone now, but I don't trust it.
We fight about it a lot. I tell him I'd rather do what my doctor is advising me and get on with it, and he calls me dumb, and says I don't know what I am talking about. I get really upset when we talk about it, because I'm nervous about the situation as a whole, and he tells me that there are so many risks to what I am wanting to do. 


He's urged me to set up one more examination before the surgery, which I have, to try the home remedy method in the meantime to see if it works first.
I appreciate that he's passionate about my health, but he's being way to pushy for my liking. He tells me it's because he cares so much about me and doesn't want me to go through any unnecessary hardship. I'm not sure I'm willing to go through with what he's urging me to do, although he assures me it's safe.
I haven't been able to talk to anyone I'm close to about this, I'm afraid of what they'll think of my boyfriend, as we've already had some obstacles. I really love him, he's just pretty out there with his beliefs. I just need some advice from someone other than him, it's starting to get under my skin.

This really helped give my head a shake, and I'm glad that I reached out to this community. I think I have just isolated myself to him and his ideals for a bit too long, and it was really messing with my thought process... especially since he is someone I care for, and was hoping cared for me. You're all right in saying I am better than this. Definitely not going to fuck around with something so serious as my health for such little cause, and absolutely going to go through with the procedure. Thanks again for all of the input; input that turned out so undeniably unanimous that there is no way I can make anymore excuses for this kind of behavior. "
43,"My (35f) husband (33m) of 8 years is terrible at his ""dream"" job. He wants me to be ""supportive"" but he means just feed him fluff. I want to be honest but he can't handle it. What should I do?


 Basically, without getting into detail my husband has always dreamed of being involved in a certain sports/entertainment business (not pro-wrestling). He sent the president of the biggest company an impassioned email that my husband could work in this industry and that he was willing to work his ass off 24/7 for this guy and amazingly enough the president of this company not only replied but had him on a plane the next day for a job interview.  

I was not in favor of this at all because my husband is a great IT manager and had a real future at his former company. To my absolute shock, this new company offered my husband a job as an assistant talent scout in our region. It was a dramatic pay cut but I have a really decent online business and at we didn't have to move. He was so excited that I just couldn't say no and he quit his job and started his new life. 

The first year wasn't too bad because my husband had a mentor that sort really showed him the ropes and introduced him to people. Out of the blue the mentor quit to work with a similar company in Asia and my husband convinced his management that he could handle the region without any help and deserved the promotion. 

The problem with him in this job are many, first of all he has zero background in this sport other than as a fan. Secondly he's a very physically small IT professional trying to get respect from superbly trained athletes who smash things for a living. Thirdly, he doesn't really have a boss looking over his shoulder and I would say he's not a ""self starter"" and there are often nights where I feel like i have to shove him out the door to get on the road or do his job. With his job, he should be on the road, constantly on the phone, in and out of gyms, schools and training centers on a daily basis--all on his own initiative. 

In August he must have accidentally hit the print button his phone because on our home printer I found an email from one of his bosses that was perhaps the meanest, most direct email I'd ever seen from a boss. He literally lambasted my husband in every way possible, called him a failure and very clearly told him he had a limited amount of time to turn things around before he would be fired for not meeting even the minimal numbers (I can't go into to much detail but basically he's about 80% less than the top scout and his numbers are about 50% from the former guy who ran his region). 

I could not help myself and I had to bring up the email to him. He said he'd just had an off month, I said this email didn't read like an off month, it read like he was failing. He accused me of not supporting him in his dream job. I said at some point honesty has to come before fluff support at some point. He said that wasn't how marriage worked. I saw that I hurt him and said that I promised I'd try to be more encouraging but since myself and the kids were sacrificing for his dream job, he had to put in more effort. 

Well unfortuately, he was better for maybe a week or so and I felt like I did a really good job of constantly saying ""hey you're doing a great job!"" and the like. Slowly but surely he's started to slip into his old habits of just hanging around the house, claiming that watching youtube was ""work."" I still tried to be cheery and encouraging. 

Well I've been trying to not absolutly lose it with him since Saturday. I realized that one of the biggest independent promotions ever held in the state right next to us was Saturday night, and not only did my husband not go, he didn't even know it was happening. It's smack in the middle of his region. I know for a fact his boss asked him how it went and what potential prospects looked like Sunday--and I think (but don't know for sure) that my husband lied to him about having car trouble and missing his flight. 

I have just tried to stay out of his way since I don't know if I can avoid speaking my mind over this monumental screw up. 

He NEEDS to quit this job and go back into IT. How do I find the balance between straight up fluff encouragement of his dream job and blunt and brutal honesty?

44,"I[24 F] hide my professional goals from my boyfriend[26 M] of 3 years.


Hello, reddit.

I'm not comfortable sharing my goals with him. We had met when I was going to graduate, and while I was preparing for interviews, he told all his family about the companies I was applying to and asked them to help me practice HR questions (my primary language isn't English). This made me highly uncomfortable as I'm more of a quite worker.

Then, I thought about applying to graduate schools and told him about it. At first, he wasn't happy with the idea- he said that the degree I was going for won't make me happy and it's mostly useless these days. I stuck by and started preparing for the GRE (again a big deal as I'm not the best at English) and he started telling me that I wasn't focusing enough on GRE, and I should quit my job and prepare full time. As I ranted about work, he started talking about how my job is a dead end one and I should have chosen to work for another company (that wasn't offering me enough pay, but had a big name).

I recently quit my job and joined an average school: it isn't the best school in the world but is good enough to take me down my envisioned career path. All he said was that if you aren't in the best, average or bad doesn't matter.

Now am happy to be a student, and am working hard at school, and he requests me to stay over even when I have lots of work; he brushes it off and says that I can manage by faking output or I could study in the train on on my way, etc. 

I was planning my internship interview applications and he tells me that I should apply to the top 5 firms in the world and anything less is useless (no, he isn't working in the top 5, and yes, is bitter about it).

Now, I have an interview schedules with a top 50 firm and am reluctant to tell him about it. I saw an Instagram caption of a popular Youtuber thanking her boyfriend supporting her through her phd, fitness and social media goals- and I realized how my boyfriend hasn't actually supported me with these goals. He hasn't even helped me with the language despite my asking him to- he always had me ask his family! This may/ may not be healthy.

Am I overthinking? Do we need to work through this?

47,"My doctor parents don't want me [25F] to sue my doctor for malpractice


I will try to keep this brief. A couple of weeks ago I got a pretty bad diagnosis. There is no cure for the diagnosis, only management. I am (I feel) reasonably upset by this, as it means I will no longer be able to work in the field I studied and will likely lose a lot of my independence.  If this diagnosis had been made in a timely manner the problem could have been fixed, but my doctor repeatedly missed it and that window of opportunity has passed. I got referrals from the bar association for several medical malpractice attorneys and they all seem to think I have a strong case. 

My parents are furious that I want to sue my doctor. They are both doctors and don't think I should potentially bankrupt this woman for a mistake (one of my potential attorneys thinks my case is similar to a case a few years ago with a payout in the millions). They keep saying that they didn't see it either (I actually do think they were also medically negligent of my brothers and I growing up but that's a different issue) but it was my doctor's job specifically to notice and intervene. I get that she is human and she made a mistake - I don't want to bash her face in or anything, but I also don't feel particularly bad that her life might be upended by this or that it might end her professional career. My quality of life and my future have been massively impacted by her mistake and I want her held accountable, or at the very least I want a court to determine that there wasn't anything she could have or should have done differently. 

I'm kind of just looking for validation that I'm not a bad person for pursuing this case and for strategies to get my parents to understand why I want to sue her in the first place. I feel like they are being more loyal to her as a doctor than they are me as their child and my world is shattered right now and I need their support. Thank you for any advice you may have.

50,"My [22F] friends [20sM&amp;F] have different ideas on marriage than I and my boyfriend [22M] do.


I understand that I shouldn't care about what people think or say--but I'm realizing I'm going to be addressing more and more of these questions, and I'm looking for ways to maturely answer.

Essentially, a significant number of my friends (my age, 22) are married or getting married. I have made a few less than respectful comments, particularly about a friend who got married at 19, but I've since realized that I have to respect my friends' choices, even when I disagree.

I went to a private university with a significant Christian population. I could name 20 couples that either married this summer or are marrying next summer largely because of their Christian values (i.e., several have explicitly told me they won't have sex til marriage so they're marrying asap). A number of them have been together for less than a year, or were together for less than a year when getting engaged. While many are religious, there are even a few who aren't who married at 20.

I don't mean for this post to be about them, and I understand that there's nothing about marrying young or quickly that precludes them from happiness. Although I do not plan on marrying in the near future, I am happy for them and have resolved not to make any negative comments about it.

The issue is, it seems like that isn't a two-way street. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year. We're very happy together and see this as a long-term relationship that could very well turn into a marriage. But he has at least two years of school left, and I can see how much we've both grown in just the past year - and I know the next years are full of more changes and growth. We don't want to get married yet - it's barely even a conversation for us, because it's something we see as distant - 4 or 5 years down the road.

I've already been asked by friends why I'm not engaged yet, or I get comments from them about how I don't have to worry, they're sure I'll be getting a ring soon. At the moment I'm using the fact he is still in university as a reason for pushing it off, but I know that's not going to last. Plus, I'll be the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding in a few months (with my boyfriend also in attendance) and I know I'm just going to hear more then.

I think a big reason is that I was quite religious when I was younger. For me, it's faded, and I don't really think it's a good idea to marry to have sex. But I know the friends of mine who know that I live with my boyfriend think that I should want him to ""make an honest woman of me"" or whatever, when that isn't really something I care about like they do. I'm not comfortable telling them this, because I don't know how to say it.

How can I politely, respectfully say that I have no intention of marrying right now, especially when so many of my friends are religious and sort of expect it?

tl;dr: Friends are religious and getting married right out of college. I'm not doing that, but how do I deflect their questions and say that without judging them or renouncing they values they think I hold?

51,"Me [27F] with my sister's [32F] pregnancy and birth, our mother[55F] has ruined both and I need help on how to help her cope with post partum and dealing with our mom


This is my first post and kind of long, so appreciate you reading through!

My sister and I have have always had a rocky relationship with both our parents, but it has gotten extremely bad since we both graduated college. For context my sister, Jane, is 32 and I am 27. We both have been low contact or no contact over the past two years on and off. Our mom shows shows classic signs of narcissism like telling us we are putting her in an early grave, we don't love her, she envies other families on social media, jealous of my sister and I's relationship, and that we are always out to get our little sister (22F golden child). These fights usually end with screaming, sometimes physical altercations, or one of us leaving.
This has been a life long issue, but really my sister's pregnancy and birth have been the point I think we can't handle anymore. To give some color to the story below, this isn't just a birth issue. She has caused drama throughout the whole pregnancy. A good example is that she was furious my sister and BIL told my parents at a restaurant that they were pregnant. Her comments were how dare they not tell us in our own home, and disrespectful it was of their privacy.

The current issue is that my sister just had her first baby last week. My sister wanted just her and the husband to be present for the birth, and everyone else to be in the waiting room. My mom wasn't accepting this so while my sister was in delivery, she stormed out crying to the bathroom. Once we were finally allowed into the delivery room, my dad stood by the door with a sour a expression. Then my mom walks in with an angry face, looks sideways at the baby, and in a flat tone ""oh she is cute"". Then refuses to hold her, and they both leave after an hour. The next day she just shows up at the hospital, again with a pissed off expression, refuses to hold the baby, and tells the grandmother ""I know how special this is to you, and i will give you the right to hold her first"" to make the point of how mad she is.
After they leave, I go back to my sister's house to find a giant plant with pink bows. My parents went to my sister's house, without permission, and left in her bedroom (the most private place you can be). To add fuel to the fire, I originally called nmom and said we should go to a florist and get a bouquet. Her only comment was okay, but you better not leave out golden child. Now back to the huge plant...it is signed love, mom, Dad, golden child, and grandmothers. Good job on making a double whammy and causing emotional distress to both children!
The real kicker is what my mom then posted a Facebook status that night. She said ""Really Sad how people intentionally make others feel unwelcome, left out, and excluded"" followed by another post ""I am not allowed to post any info nor photos of my grand daughter"" My husband I were finally allowed to hold her today thanks to my husband"".
The next day she posts a head shot of the golden child (younger sister) ""Love her!!!! I am so blessed to have such a kind, caring, and loving daughter"". After this she blocked Jane and I from social media.
Both mom and dad have been no contact with my sister since Saturday. Mom ignored my birthday on 11/15, but sent sappy I love you and miss you texts all day 11/16. Also, on 11/15 my mother posted on Jane's birth announcement ""so very heartbreaking as her grandparents that you have excluded us"".
She is playing psychological warfare now by alienating and blasting Jane on a public forum, and trying to being all loving me after ignoring my birthday to cause me pain. I know her end game is for me to tell Jane what she is texting me since Jane has called over 16 times, and neither parent has responded. This is a classic strategy she tries to get pit my sister and I against each other
We are both at our wits end. And the saddest part of all is that Jane's MIL is with her, and is acting how a true loving grandmother would. The stark contrast between the two made the issue even more glaring and heartbreaking. We both have so much emotional damage that I am scared it will lead to my sister having depression while dealing with her newborn baby.

Any help is appreciated, and again so sorry for the long post.

56,"Me [29 F] with my husband [29 M] of 3 years, refuses to use condoms but I am desperate to stop my birth control.


My husband has refused to use condoms since we have been together. We were each other’s first partner and didn’t have sex until married. We have no plans to have children as I have a huge fear of pregnancy. I think for him it is partly a pride issue - he even sometimes laughs/boasts between us about never having needed them. 

I’ve been asking since the beginning of our marriage if he could use condoms. My experience of the hormonal birth control pill was awful. It made me very depressed, and I threw up constantly. I switched to the IUD which I didn’t want because was scary and painful because he refused to use condoms. 

I’ve had the coil for a few years now and have had a lot of pain from cysts (I have PCOS) and I have a LOT of hair growth on my face. Basically a full beard. This seems to be a complaint of women with PCOS who use the coil. I shave my face every day, and it has had a huge toll on my self esteem and quality of life. I feel awful about myself and trapped in a bad situation. I just want to stop the IUD so it doesn’t get worse. 

We have so little sex (once a month) and he has been so inconsiderate that I really think about stopping sex completely so that I can finally be free from hormones and start to get control back over my body. Sex is important to me but it isn’t worth feeling this miserable for. 

When I told him this he said “so you’d rather not shave your face every day instead of sex once a month”. He said that in a bitter kind of voice like I was being horrible. Then he said I had backed him into a corner and wasn’t giving him any choice. He still will not even consider using condoms. I said I could buy some to try out and he said he would throw them away. 

I feel like I have tried everything and I don’t know what to do. I’ve explained and argued and I know that he knows how hard this is on me but he doesn’t seem to care. He even said I should just take a plan B after every time. He was against getting a vasectomy and said I should get my tubes tied instead, even after I explained how medically it would be worse on me and more permanent.

57,"I (24f) met a guy online. We've been talking everyday &amp; in a relationship for a couple of years. Finally decided to meet, and he confesses to being older. He's making me feel guilty.


This is a super messed up situation, I know. And it's my fault, I know. But now I need advice putting those two things aside.

I met this guy online and we've literally talked daily since, and have been in a relationship. He's absolutely amazing. We've talked on the phone, and he's sent me pictures, I've sent him pictures ect. I thought it was perfect for my first relationship.

Well, we decided to meet next Saturday. I've spent all of two weeks freaking out, trying to do a quick diet, look nice, ect ect.

He told me tonight he needed to confess something. He told me he's not who I've seen pictures of, he isn't 26. He's 46. I'm devastated.

I feel like I've known this guy all my life. He's all I've got. I have no family, no friends, nothing. So the plan was to finally meet, and then me go and live with him in the near future after we'd spent real life time together.

I freaked out. Super bad. And now he's making me feel guilty. And he keeps saying he's given up everything for me, I should give him a chance, we know everything about each other, we are in love, we can look past this ect.

And he's saying he's still coming to my city and is hoping by then I decide to meet up anyway. He said he's going to take me out to a fancy place as an apology and just wants the chance to prove himself.

What do I do? My whole world is shaken rn. I've invested so much of my life into this guy and don't know if I should just let it all go or give him a chance?? 

Tl;dr; met a guy online and have talked daily and been in a relationship. Time came to meet and he says that's not him in his pics and he's 46 not 26. Begging me to still meet him and give him a  chance. What do I do?"
58,"My[23M] uncle left some money to me, my siblings[20F,18F] and my dad[52M] after he passed away. Now my cousins[22F,20F] and my aunt[57F] are harassing us and make up constant lies about us. How can I deal with these people without creating even more drama?


Essentially what the title says but I guess some background is in order which probably would make this a bit long so I am sorry for that.

I have an uncle, or should I say had since he is no longer amongst the living. Let's call him Mike. Uncle Mike was married to my aunt, my dad's oldest sister, before divorcing her some 10 years ago because she cheated on him. It wasn't pretty. Harsh words were said, even harsher things were done and it mostly came from my aunt. She made out my uncle to be this horrible, abusive monster and she turned most of the family against him. He was denied any access to their children, he was kicked out of the house that he put a lot of money into and was literally put out on the street to fend for himself. 

When I say that most of the family was against him, I don't mean mine. My dad was one, if not the only person, who still talked to him and visited him often. My uncle still lived in the town his family lived.He set up for himself a small vineyard, with a small cottage. And for the past 10 years, he lived there. He used to say that it's peaceful and quiet and he likes that. It really was, it's slightly above the city, near the forest, the air is fresher and it's really beautiful. 

Whenever we were in town, my dad would take us with him and we'd visit him in his cottage. I really liked his company. My uncle was a good man and he always treated me and my siblings with nothing but love. Honestly, we spent more time with him than his own children. He has two daughters and they made it very clear that they don't want to have anything in common with their ""deranged father"". You know, because only a madman would live in isolation. 

Which brings to me a few months ago when uncle Mike suddenly passed away due to a heart attack. He had a bunch of people that help him tend to the vineyard come over a few times a week and they found him. We went to his funeral and at least this time his family showed up but didn't stick around that much. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for his will. 

And we were on it. Me, my dad, my siblings. And my uncle left us some money. Like a lot of money. We never knew he even had that much at his disposal but apparently, he did. His daughters also had something left for them but when we did the math, it turned out that our share was slightly more than what his daughters received. He also left us his vineyard. Or at least he gave it to one of my sisters. His idea was to give it to his ex-wife or kids but again, they weren't interested at all so he left it to my sister. Her bf is interested in those things and my sister by implication so she must have told him about her hobby and he decided to give it to her. 

Again I want to reiterate that we had no idea he was going to leave us money. Or anything for that matter. I guess he appreciated the fact that my dad stuck around and that my siblings and I spent time with him after the divorce and what not. He was always a giving man so I am honestly not that surprised. 

The problem here is that as you can imagine, the fact that we got something out of that will is pissing my cousins and aunt quite a lot. You have no idea how many times I've been called ""money-grabbing brat"" or my dad being called ""manipulator"". According to them, we took advantage of an ill man and ""manipulated"" him into giving us money. One we never really wanted in the first place but whatever. My dad isn't exactly caring that much about their words and honestly, we have bigger things to worry about.


My mom's cancer is back. She started treatment and even though we never wanted the money, they came at the right moment. The prognosis is good but in order for it to stay good, we need to continue with the treatment. And that requires money. So we put most what uncle Mike left us towards mom. 

But even though my dad isn't that bothered, I am. I am done being called greedy, manipulative, jerk, brat etc. Hell, my gf is even targeted because of this. She is from the same town my uncle was and she told me a few days ago that one of my cousins asked her, and I am not joking if she ""plans on getting her hands on her money, much like her greedy bf is doing? ""

I am pissed and angry. How can I tell these people off without creating even more drama? I've never found myself in such a position and I could use some help. My siblings feel the same way. We've been ostracized by my dad's family. My grandparents are siding with my aunt and are constantly on our back because of this. How do I deal with these people?


tl;dr My uncle left us some money after his passing which now creates a huge problem in our family. His children and my aunt now claim we manipulated him into giving us money and that we don't deserve them. They are constantly harassing us, most of my dad's family is siding with my aunt, including my grandparents and I have no idea how to deal with these people.

59,"Me [25F] with my husband [31M] 3 years, he took my phone


I've been in a relationship with my husband for 6 years, married for 3. We also have two kids, our son is 2 1/2 and our daughter is 7 months. 

We got into a fight this morning- he said he's going somewhere later and I (sarcastically) asked if he would be home before the sun came up. It wasn't nice of me but he stays out all night and came home last Sunday at 6AM. He refuses to answer calls or texts or tell me where he is sometimes. He didn't like my question and that led to the fight.

I tried to walk away and he came around so he was standing in front of me. I told him to move and he said he wasn't finished. I said I *was* finished and started to walk around him. He grabbed my forearm and turned me so my back was against him (it's hard for me to describe). He was still holding my arm and used his other to grab my phone from my hand. 

He let me go when he had my phone. I told him to give it back and he said no, laughed, and held it up high so I couldn't reach. He was walking away while he did this.

He left and took my phone with him. I messaged SIL on Facebook and she called him. He told her he pays for it and he can do whatever he wants with it. He's right about paying for it but I still feel what he did was wrong. I need my phone during the day. I also suspect he took my keys because I can't find them. 

I know I didn't handle myself well during this fight. I also take responsibility for instigating with my question about him coming home. That said, I think he totally overreacted by taking my phone and the way he did it bothers me too.

I would like advice on how to calmly and respectfully talk to him about our fight this morning. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel weird about the entire incident, I'm not really sure what to do or think. How do I communicate this to him?

On that very same day, I sat down and had a come-to-Jesus talk with him. He was really taken aback and did not expect that at all. He nearly begged for one last chance, but as someone wrote on my post, I had already made up my mind. 

Anyway, it took me a few weeks to find a place and when I did, I took nothing but my personal stuff. He kept the apartment AND all the furnish. Honestly, I didn't care if that was the price for my freedom.

I grew up with a single mother and never knew my father until I was 17. He also didn't know that I existed until then. He offered me to move in with him and his daughters to get to know my new family.

My dad is usually away traveling for work. So most of the times I'm living with my two half sisters. They are fun and extremely friendly with me. There is an economic class difference between the families. I grew up as lower middle class and now there's so much money around that I'm actually in a little shock when I see the lifestyle of my sisters. My dad sent some money to my account, the number is so large that I never thought I'd see this much money in my life and he said ""this should last you for a while!""

Aside from money... my sisters aren't exactly shy or modest. They're nude all the time. They change right in front of me very casually and they go skinny dipping in our pool all the time. This is more than a big shock for me.

They also have rather loud sex with their boyfriends when they're over. They're not shy about it either. The first time it happened one of them asked if I could sleep at night and I said the noise wasn't helping. She laughed and said I'm allowed to bring someone and make even more noise!

I know I have no right to tell them to change their lifestyle. But how can I adapt and not be in shock anymore? Can I become like them? Or maybe only become more adaptable when I'm with them? I really like my new family and want to be a better part of it.

65,"My husband [25M] and I [27F] are upset and feel disrespected by something his sister and her husband [30s?MF] did at our wedding.


Our wedding was this past October, and in most ways it was a fairytale. All except for his older sister M. 

A little background, if it’s relevant: My husband and I have been together for 5 years, but for most of that time have lived away from his immediate family. In that time I’ve gotten to know M on a surface level, but we’re in no way besties. M has a very strong (read: loud), shallow, and almost narcissistic personality in that if it’s not about her and her immediate family, (husband and kids) it’s not important to her. For this reason I’ve never really felt a desire to become close to her, but we can be around each other just fine. (In case anyone thinks I’m judging too harshly, my husband has expressed that he thinks these things too, sometimes he even brings it up first.)

In terms of the wedding, husband and I had very specific requests for our guests, the main one being to please not bring their children to the ceremony or reception, as we wanted to keep everything adult-oriented. To help people out on this, we hired 4 nannies to babysit the kids at the venue for 7 1/2 hours, or the duration of the wedding. We paid over $2000 for this service. 

Well, after dinner was over, M decided these rules didn’t apply to her and promptly went and retrieved all four of her small kids from the babysitting room and brought them out onto the dance floor. I wasn’t there to see them, but my husband found me and let me know what was going on. I was shocked. We asked for basically ONE thing, and she just couldn’t do it. I almost lost my mind, but I found our coordinator, who then took care of it. After that, M stopped talking to us and I believe left with her husband and kids soon after without saying anything. From what I heard from his other sisters after that, she refused to hear that she was in the wrong, and even tried to guilt trip my husband the next day by text: “I didn’t know the no kids thing was for the whole night”. IT WAS ON OUR WEDDING WEBSITE. “Oh but we bought the kids new outfits. And when you made the kids go back they started crying because they thought they did something wrong”. That could have been avoided if you just did what you were supposed to do. In addition to that, they skipped our welcome party for all our guests the day before. (The rest of his family showed, but M couldn’t be bothered, if that says anything about her. She claims she ‘didn’t know’. Of course, it was on our website.) For what it’s worth, my husband’s parents are on our side in all this, and gave M and her husband a good talking-to the next day, which makes me feel better. 

So here we are, about a month later, and my husband and I have to be around her and her husband at Christmas. I’m not going to actively bring it up while there, but I definitely don’t feel like acting warm and fuzzy toward her. So Reddit, what’s the best way to handle this?

66,"My[46m] ex-wife[47f] blames me and my wife[33f] for turning our children[21m] [23f] against her when she is an overbearing and bitter parent.


Thanksgiving is coming up and my children told me that they are coming to visit me. My son is in college and my daughter is working. We have already have plans on going on spending Christmas together (their grandfather's place/my side). 

I knew this would make my ex-wife mad because they are already spending Christmas with me. And sure enough, I got a phone call from her angry and crying that I am taking our children away from her. That me and my ""b*tch wife have filled our children's head up with hate."" I told her that I would talk to our children and try to get them to see her but it wasn't going to happen, my daughter already purchased tickets.

I don't know what to do in this situation. Ever since my wife and I divorced she has become an overbearing parent. Instead of using the free time from the divorce to go out meet new people, do new things, she instead stayed in all the time and tried to be super involved mom but instead  became an overbearing parent. She will call our children during the week and expect to have long conversations with them when they are busy and get angry they don't talk to her more. When they are at her place, she doesn't plan any fun things to do or anything. 

She gets mad at me for trying to show off when the kids come to my place. I don't do anything crazy  my wife usually finds cool activities in our city a food festival/concert/movie and dinner nothing crazy, but enough that makes my ex-wife furious.

I don't know what to do, I have talked to my kids about spending more time with their mother. And they aren't interested in spending time with her. They said they will Face Time her more, but that her place is just too boring. I don't know what to do here. Me and my wife are the ones that take all of the blame here.

Hi, so I'm a 19 year old trans woman who, thankfully, lives on my own. However, my mom, who doesn't seem all too confident in my transition despite me being due to start HRT next year and already presenting in public, and having had these feelings for the best part of 5 years now, wants me to present as male when I come home for Christmas dinner.

She said that she would be willing to accept it if it really comes down to it but has often expressed she wishes I were not trans because it would be easier for me, and she often also says that ""I'm living in a fantasy world because I don't know the choice I'm making"" (which is untrue, I'm well aware of what my life has come to, which was also not a choice I've had agency to make).

She says that it's not appropriate for my 9 year old sister (who is already aware of what being trans is, as she's mentioned what she found out about it to me before and I had to pretend to be ignorant about it) and that she thinks my 56 year old step dad would be angry, as he's recovering from anxiety issues currently, as well as the fact a few years ago, he kicked me out the house for a few weeks because he found some of my clothes hidden away.

There's no way I could go there as male. I've already spent enough of my life trying to prove to the world that I'm a girl, and the amount of dyphoria I'd have to suffer with would be overwhelming. I'm pretty sure my brothers wouldn't care, and for that matter my sister too, but my mom is adamant I at most dress androgynous.

I want to be able to be comfortable in front of my family, especially at a time we've always gathered around together. I'm not even sure my step dad would really get that angry. How do I convince my mom, and by extension possbily my step dad too to accept who I am?

70,"I've [37M] been divorced for 6 months, separated for a year from my ex wife [43F]. She left me for another man and I just got this email on our first wedding anniversary apart. It's confusing and I need feedback on it.


Little backstory - 

I was with this woman for 10 years, married for about 5.  I got locked up in November '15 for something completely unrelated to my marriage.  I came out a different person, it caused issues in our marriage, and we separated.  We separated in October of '16, she moved out of my house in to another man's house immediately (her high school sweetheart) and lied to me about it the entire time.  I only found out after the fact from a 3rd party.

We wound up hanging out in May of this year under the pretense of talking about the divorce and wound up making out in a park, went to go see a movie, then parted ways.  It was like a date except she was still very involved with the guy she left me for.  After this date, she called me and was very upset and said she was confused, didn't know what to do, etc.  I then just pushed to finalize our divorce because I wanted her to not be hurt/confused anymore and let go so she could start fresh with her new man and not worry about me interfering with her new relationship.  The divorce was finalized in June of this year.  It was uncontested.  No kids or assets involved.

I had absolutely no contact with her since then.  A few days ago I get this email on what would've been our 6th wedding anniversary.


&gt; I know I shouldn't email you and chances are you really don't want me to either, but when I decide to do something, I do it anyways, regardless of what an idiot I will be at the end of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can either choose to delete this now before reading any further, which I would understand, you could choose to laugh about it with your friends or you could choose to read it and keep it to yourself. That is obviously your decision. Anyways...on to the point.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if you remember or not, but yesterday would have been our 6th year anniversary. So, instead of not thinking about it, or choosing to forget about it, I thought about it all day and night and then again today and did the dumbest thing I could possibly do which was read through ALL your emails and texts to me and proceed to make the decision to let you know that and email you. I know, I'm stupid, I'm sure you will agree. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is a large part of me that wishes we could have celebrated ""our"" anniversary together and also a part of me that knows it's all probably for the best that we didn't get to.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that this email is probably not making very much sense to you but my mind is kind of all over the place right now and even though I know what I want to say, I realize that I probably shouldn't say it and in turn, you probably don't want to hear it or even care. Ugh...why do things have to be so difficult?
&gt; 
&gt; So bottom line... I still miss you sometimes (more than I care to admit). We have not been together pretty much since November of 2015 when you got out of jail, we haven't lived together for almost a year and I thought that any and all feelings that I had for you would be gone by now, but clearly that is not the case. 
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess I just wanted to say that I hope you are doing good, living the dream life, etc. And to tell you that for whatever reason, you own about 90% of my heart to this day. I don't exactly know what that means or even why I'm telling you but it is what it is. I really wish things would have happened differently between us and we would have lived out the rest of our lives together, but sadly, that's not the way it went. I know I shouldn't have said any of this and I'm confused on why I did. Like I said earlier, I know this email makes no sense...I guess just delete it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I'm sorry for bugging you...

This email is confusing, painful, it feels like it's ripping open an old wound and I don't know how to respond if I should respond at all.  Is this some kind of fishing expedition?  Is she just looking for attention?  Problems with the guy she left me for?  I don't know.  It's bothering me and I don't know how to interpret this email nor do I know how to respond to it.  I've spent the past year of my life picking up the pieces and trying to move on and while I still care about her and love her on some level, the stuff in this email is all news to me.  Part of me feels like I owe her a response because I have moved on for the most part but another part of me says I shouldn't feed in to it and that it's some kind of a trap.
