0,"UPDATE Me [31F] with my friend [39M], been good friends for two years. I have cancer and am not going to live a whole lot longer. Should I tell him I have feelings for him even though nothing is going to come of it, probably?

I told him.

Last night, after we spent a really great day together where I had enough energy to do everything I wanted, I told him ""Friend's name, I wanted you to know I love you. I don't need anything from you. Just love you. And if circumstances were different, we could have been amazing together....""

He was holding a bag for me while we were waiting for our car, and he dropped it and blinked a few times and said something like ""I know...I know and I don't want to stop spending time with you. I don't know what this is. It feels weird and guilty but I hate being away from you. You are all I think about."" He hugged me and told me he loved me (that isn't new, we do that). I told him I love him too. We cried a little. Then we got in the car.

Once we got back to mine we watched some nature docs and just...held each other. It was so nice. He is still here. I don't know what any of this means lol. I wish this were more climactic for you guys, but honestly I am over the moon. Just having told him.

Tl;Dr: I told him last night. He hasn't gone home yet. I think we are just going to go day by day for now and see what happens? Thank you all so much for the kind words and love.

ETA: I wanted to add this message, thanks /u/aromatichydrocarbons.


Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."" - Louise Erdrich

Thank all of you so much for taking the time to comment. Go love each other. Life is so short.

4,"UPDATE My (M/42) GF (F/36) of 2 years; she says she likes to be ""taken"", I've more of a mutual consent type


[Original post] 
(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tntf0/my_m42_gf_f36_of_2_years_she_says_she_likes_to_be/)


When I made my original post, I was feeling at an impasse and thinking I was going to end a relationship I valued, only because our sex life was starting to slacken.  Initial responses were confirming this fear ""oh you have a dead bedroom... bail on that""


Then I got a few comments about our poor communication, which I kindof knew... but also about how my perception of what my GF was saying she wanted (being taken) was in fact me being stubborn about what I thought it would make me to fulfill that role for her.  


I think, being my age, I get prone to thinking I know a lot.. but in some aspects, I'm as stupid/innocent about things as it can get.  


Prior to the post, I was pretty strict about ""anytime someone utters no, that is full stop"".  I haven't changed the spirit of this - but the comments also lead me to understand that sometimes knowing that you drive a person so crazy they just can't keep their paws off you, lead me to realize I do in fact feel that way about my GF - and that I was intentionally suppressing something that she likely really wanted to feel.


Since the post, the next time we went out, I intentionally was oogling her and telling her ways I was attracted to how she was behaving, looking.  I also took a quick second to tell her that I've been thinking about our bedroom issues and that I decided upon a safe word that she could use later if needed... I told her the word, then went back to smirking at her as I looked her up and down and... she was just radiant about it.  She lit up with smiles and I literally could just tell I had said exactly the right thing to her.  


I'm a ""physical touch"" person and I just notice when she gives more than not - but her contact frequency with me has been outstanding since then (it had dwindled).  Our bedroom situation has shifted to zero complaints for me as well - but our general connection just seems to be a complete reverse from where I felt it was.


I don't think my original post gained much attention, but I wanted to post an update to thank those who took the time to respond and help me out.  This literally took the best possible direction for me - better than I had hoped for in fact.  It wouldn't have been possible without those who took time to respond.


As for me, I already knew there are things I'm ignorant about, but it was another good lesson to realize I can be a stubborn asshole and become too entrenched without realizing it.  The next time I feel like I'm facing an impossible issue with someone I care about, that is going to be one of the first things I take a serious look at.


As people had pointed out, she was telling me what she wanted (if not 100% direct, she was communicating it).  I also think she wasn't listening to me either - but there was enough there to align us back together to where now I'm very happy with us again.

My boyfriend (32M) and I (30F) have been dating almost 2 years. Our sex life is very lackluster.. maybe 1-2 times a month, sometimes more, sometimes we go months without.. he says it's entirely him and has nothing to do with me..

Recently I've started noticing he makes faces when I undress.. Last night I was especially hurt.. I like to sleep in just a shirt, no pants or underwear. I got out of bed for something and caught him looking at downstairs. As soon as I looked at his face, he wrinkled his nose and pinched/rubbed it.. imagine if you saw someone who had just smelled something bad.. that is the best way to describe it.

I don't smell, I had just showered and used lotion. everything was groomed. 

I'm a little overweight, but by no means huge.. he's always told.me how beautiful I am and attractive I am to him..

this wasn't the first time.. this has happened many times. if I'm undressing.. he either doesn't look, sneaks a peak and makes a face, or awkwardly smiles at me..

I've mentioned it before to him, his faces and he says he doesn't do that, and to not put any faith in body language, he says it's not a real science.. and yet he talks about microexpressions and rewinds videos to point them out. He says, sometimes his nose itches, t doesn't mean anything. Am I vastly over analyzing this?

He talks about marriage to me.. but this small thing is ruining our relationship for me. I am embarrassed to undress now. I'm afraid to sleep naked. what should I do?

TL:DR Boyfriend makes unconscious faces when he sees me naked.. like grimacing, pinching/running his nose.. makes me very self conscious.

EDIT: wow.. this got a lot of attention.. to answer the main question I keep seeing..

My bf prefers we sleep naked. he likes the skin contact when we cuddle. There have been many times he has asked me to take my pants off to feel my legs and butt. He has also gone to bed many times in just a shirt and free-balling. So I don't think it's the t-shirt/no pants combo. However, he IS rather prudish. He's never been one to talk really openly about sex. However he is also very okay being naked in front of me (not shy at all), so I wouldn't see how he could be okay with himself but not okay with others nudity? 

Maybe it COULD be just vaginas? I could start wearing a T-shirt and thong and see if it changes anything.. that never even occurred to me.


Also, I'm 99% sure he isn't closet gay. I've seen his porn and he is also from a very accepting family with a transgender brother. "

27,"How can I [27F] get my friend [25F] to stop including me in her low self-esteem?


My close friend Janet and I look very similar. Not like twins, but we are both very tall for women (I'm a little over 6' and she's 6'2""), we both have broad shoulders and are more muscular than average (she swims and climbs, I play volleyball and climb), we both have short dark hair and dark eyes, etc. We've had a few people assume we are sisters, even though I personally can see the difference since I""m... me.

Being our size comes with its pitfalls. Both of us are athletic and in the healthy/normal range for BMI, but because we're both tall and broad, we are obviously bigger than most other women. Obviously tall women and women with muscles get a lot of comments about looking manly, and it isn't helped by the fact that we are both growing out shaved heads from earlier this year (done with a mutual friend going through chemo).

I of course was teased growing up, especially by boys, but I have good self-esteem. My body is healthy and strong and powerful and it does cool things. My mom was pretty tomboyish growing up so I've never felt that looking 'manly' was a bad thing or a threat to my femininity. Janet, on the other hand, internalized all that stuff from growing up and is extremely insecure. She wears a lot of makeup and dresses very feminine and is very concerned with what men think of her, and is constantly scrutinizing her appearance.

The problem is that when we're together, this manifests as her scrutinizing my appearance too. She'll say nonsense things like, ""Wouldn't it be great if we could find a machine to shrink us down?"" or ""I wish we could take our muscles on and off like a suit when we have to dress up."" She'll also say realistic things like, ""We should start wearing wigs til this haircut grows out,"" or ""I'm going to get us (X new product) to make our (skin, hair, bodies, whatever) look better.""

Notice that she always includes me. She will find something she hates about herself and express it by saying 'we' should fix it. My self-esteem is good, but having her constantly scrutinize every aspect of my appearance because she hates her appearance is weighing on me. I've asked her outright to stop doing it twice, and when she says things like that I usually respond, ""Speak for yourself"" or ""Not me, I love my (feature she's dissecting)"" but she keeps doing it.

At this point I'm not sure if I need to give her an ultimatum or just end our friendship. I can't take it anymore. I hate feeling like I'm under constant scrutiny about something that isn't important to me and I hate that she's shaking my confidence by picking at me all the time just because she's insecure. 

She got me into climbing and all my climbing friends are her friends, so I'd be really sad to lose them. She also is a great friend except for this, but this is a pretty big 'except.'

TL;DR: My friend who looks similar to me always includes me in her insecure scrutiny of her own appearance. I've asked her twice to stop and it continues. Save the friendship or end it?"

32,"I [27F] got an email from an ex [25F] of a guy I'm seeing [29M] for three weeks begging me to stop seeing him.


Hey r/relationships,

After many online dates and flings, I finally met someone I liked two weeks ago. He's a really sweet guy and although I wouldn't say I'm in love with him, I think I am really starting to fall for him pretty hard.

A few days into seeing him, I asked him about his last relationship and he told me that she broke up with him a few months back (she cheated on him and then said something about wanting to grow and see other ppl, etc) and that he was over her. However, they hung out about a month ago; apparently, she asks him for favors a lot and although he does not really want to do them and wants to cut contact, he feels bad for her. I didn't think much of it at first because, in my last breakup, my ex-boyfriend helped me a ton because I was unemployed and we had pets together so it was rough for me to transition. 

While we were starting to get more serious about dating, I guess he told her that he was seeing me and that he wanted to stop talking to her. She called him over fifty times on our last date and started to plead with him via text and email to take her back. He ignored all her calls, and one of her friends reached out to him to tell her that it was best if he stopped responding to her and that she was going to seek mental help. 

A few days went by with no incident but I just got an email from her begging me to stop dating him and that she desperately wants him back in her life and that she would appreciate it if I didn't tell him about it. She wasn't threatening in the email, and she seemed pretty self-aware that she sounded pretty desperate. I honestly feel really sad for her because the guy I am seeing is really amazing. But beyond that, I'm a little scared. Why did this girl think it was a good idea to email me? I mean, it doesn't take much for someone to find out who I am (I freelance and have my own website so my contact info is out there), but I honestly don't know if it's worth dealing with. 

What do I do? Do I tell him I got this email? Should I try to answer her? I honestly do feel for her because I have been heartbroken and lost as well, but I don't think I'd ever go to the extremes that she has in dealing with it. I would love to hear anyone else's take on this and if they have experienced this before.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I got an email from a 'crazy' ex girlfriend asking me to stop dating the guy I'm seeing. I really like him but we've only been together for a few weeks and I don't know if I want to deal with this. 

  ---   
EDIT: I forgot to mention to this (and I am surprised I forgot about this). I am assuming that she may have threatened to hurt herself over this in her communications with him, which is why I'm worried and cautious as well. My understanding is that she doesn't have many friends around the area. He has resolved to cut contact, but I'm just worried that maybe we should be doing something else/more. 

---
EDIT 2: I told him. He was apologetic and asked me what he needed to do. We both decided to keep ignoring her and hope that she will eventually tire out. He hasn't fully blocked her just in case she does decide to harm herself. She is currently under somewhat supervised care and isn't in town anymore *phew.* If it keeps bothering me I think I will ask him to actually block her, but it really doesn't at this point. Thanks everyone!"

37,"My [23F] husband's [27M] public angry outbursts are starting to get me into trouble. I'm afraid one day he'll piss off the wrong person and we'll both be in danger.


My husband has been dealing with explosive anger issues for a long time - I'm starting to think that this goes beyond the time period that I've even known him. We've been fighting a lot and there has been verbal abuse going on. I've alerted a couple of close family and friends recently to what's going on and I am deeply considering what my next move is. 

In the meantime, though, there is another problem. The anger is not confined to behind closed doors. It's starting to spill over into public situations. It started with berating me in public a couple times, bringing our arguments into the street or the grocery store, whatever. Now it's getting worse. His anger isn't just directed at me - it's directed at the world in general, and it's getting me into trouble.

Today, for instance, he got into a fight with a taxi driver. He had asked the driver to make a quick stop at the ATM on our route home. The driver told us that he would charge extra for that - more than 25% extra, which is steep. My husband started yelling and swearing at the driver, and told me that he'd get out and meet me at home, and I could take the taxi home. But he slammed the door on his way out, leading the taxi driver to turn the car off, get out, and start yelling at my husband. Then the driver kicked me out and said he didn't want to take me home, and he left me on the side of the road in the heat with all of my grocery bags. I get it in a way, because I wouldn't want to deal with that shit on the job. But I didn't do anything wrong except being married to an abuser, and I had to pay the consequences for it. 

I'm afraid that situations like this will become more common, and that his outbursts will one day piss off the wrong person and put us both in serious danger. He's from a culture where fights are solved in the street, on the spot, with fists and loud voices, but in my culture, you'll get arrested for assault for doing that.

While I'm considering my next move, how should I handle this particular problem?

Tl,dr; Husband's anger problems are causing problems for me in public and may soon put me in danger. "

[removed]"
39,"My grandfather [98 M] got a new girlfriend [80s F] and she's absolutely miserable.


My grandfather has always been sharp as a tack despite his age. Once my grandmother passed away in October 2014, he talked with my father (who been inadvertently put in charge of all of this and is the main point of contact) and uncles and they all decided it would be best for him to move into an assisted living home. The home they found is absolutely lovely--he gets his own little apartment that doesn't look at all like a dreary hospital room. The staff is wonderful, the food is great (I've had some), and the services offered are outstanding.

When he first moved in, he still had access to his car. As time went on, he felt his age catching up with him, and told my father that he doesn't want to drive anymore. He asked my father to hold on to the car keys for him, and he would start taking the shuttle or calling my dad if he needed to go anywhere. So my dad took the keys.

In comes my grandfather's new girlfriend, Mary. At first it was kind of weird because my grandmother had only recently died and they'd been married for almost 70 years. But, it was understandable that my grandfather wanted some companionship, so we all welcomed her.

At first she seemed sweet but now she's absolutely MISERABLE. She's your textbook cranky old lady. She bashes the home regularly, saying it's like a prison there. She gets upset when we all come to visit my grandfather and take him out. She tells us that we're awful for taking the keys from my grandfather, even though it was originally my grandfather's suggestion. His memory is starting to go now, so he's also starting to blame my father for taking his keys, and she just eggs him on. Now when we come to visit him, all he does is complain and act resentful towards us , which he has never done before.

I seriously hate her. She acts like she know him better than we do, and scolds my dad for making decisions that she doesn't like, even though they are in my grandfather's best interest. I think because she spends more time with him than we do, she's filling his head with negative thoughts about his family and it's seriously affecting his mood and overall well being. I want to call her out and tell her to fuck off but I know I can't. I hate what she's doing to my grandfather, I hate the toll it's having on my father, and I don't want to have to always act like I'm happy to see her. 

I want to pull her aside and tell her how much her negativity is affecting my grandfather, my dad, and the rest of my family. How should I go about this conversation? Is this even a conversation worth having?

43,"A relative gave me (30f) a letter from my missing dad that contradicts years of lies from mom (65) should I confront?


My dad went out of my life when I was four and my mom quickly remarried and did everything in her power to make me my (abusive) adopted dad's kid, including changing my name. My whole life I've been told that he was lazy, jobless and that my mom has no idea why he abandoned me but she blames it on his being Japanese, saying in their culture they don't interfere with the kids if a mother gets remarried. Sometimes she would just say I guess he didn't care that much about you. A few weeks ago I got an old letter from a relative who wanted me to know the truth.


This letter was written to my mom shortly after their breakup and states very clearly that he wishes to stay in my life. He asks when he can come and says several times how much he loves me. He says he's going to send letters and gifts (I never got a letter, maybe she tossed them) and says if you won't let me see her, please send pictures. He stated that he has something he intended to give me at 15 and apologizes to my mother for not letting her have whatever it is, saying it would be too emotionally traumatic for her.  Then he says he will respect her wishes and stay away if that's really what she wants but it will break his heart.


Do I confront my mother about letter? I'm not even angry to tell you the truth because she's narcissistic and has always done crap like this, I'm not actually shocked. I'm convinced if I try she will just dig her heels in and refuse to admit it so what's the point? Is there any or should I just keep it to myself and know my dad wasn't as shitty as she let on?


Tldr: narcissistic mom made me think absent dad forgot about me, turns out she pushed him out of my life. Should I discuss this with her?"

She again stated she values me as a friend and said she wants to hang out with my husband and I this week. I did not really read too much into it and just accepted her apology. I really like hanging out with her but it really is not settling well with me for my friend to have a crush on my husband no matter how small it is. I asked my mom for advice she said it is a bad situation and that just because I do not feel threatened by her and trust my husband, it does not change the fact that she as a friend can not be trusted and that she can not really value me that much if she is busy entertaining the idea of being with my husband. I feel really sad about this because I really liked hanging out with her but I do agree I can not be friends with someone I do not trust. Am I overreacting to want to end a friendship over a ""little crush?"" I should add my husband was unamused which is typical for him haha. He just dryly stated that he thinks it is shitty of her but that it's ultimately my choice if I want to remain friends with her.

tl;dr: My best friend has a crush on my husband, I valued our friendship but no longer trust her. Would you end a friendship if you knew that friend liked your spouse?"

53,"My [23F] boyfriend's friends [20s M] all seem to prefer his ex [20F]


Throwaway just in case. Sorry if this is long.

First, a bit of background: 

I've been dating Adam [24M] for four months now, but have been friends with him about a year. He has always had a reputation for being a bit of a ladies' man, but has been sure to tell me that I'm the only one he wants now and was even the one to suggest becoming exclusive. 

Before me, he was casually seeing this girl Ella [20F]. They met because they're both djs for an underground music genre in our city. I remember his friends used to joke about how he was going to have to marry her because she's the only one who could keep up with him—sexually, musically, socially. Once Adam and I even had a heart to heart (way before we started dating, obvs) where he told me that he felt like she was like a female version of himself—her sense of humour, taste in music, best sex he's ever had, etc., and that he was sad she was leaving (she did a year abroad from uni).

Anyway, since Ella was on her year abroad I never properly met her, but I heard a lot about her. Adam's friends are completely enamoured with her—they all (including Adam) went on a boys' holiday to the city where she was living abroad, and she showed them around/partied with them for a week, and they seem to think she's the best thing since sliced bread. They would always talk about how they couldn't wait for her to come back, how fun she was, etc.. 

I never really felt too jealous of her because I had this picture of her in my head as this young girl who's lots of fun but no substance, sleeps around and parties a lot, takes a lot of drugs etc., but last weekend she came back and I met her and she's not what I expected at all. 

I met her at a party and we ended up having a conversation and she seemed so genuine, and I realised quickly that she's incredibly intelligent—her jokes are so witty and sardonic, and honestly remind me of Adam's. She also djed for a couple hours—I don't know much about that kind of music but I could tell it was a really good set, smooth transitions etc., and everyone there loved it.

But the worst part is how effortlessly she fits in with Adam's friends. They treat her like 'one of the boys', doing silly things like wrestling and teasing each other in a way that they've never done with me. 

Yesterday I was at Adam's and he was in the shower and his phone buzzed. I decided to check what it was in case it was important. It was a message from his best friend Jack [24M] saying 'you can't tell me you didn't feel anything when you saw her'. I'm not proud, but I opened his phone and read through their conversation. 

It went something like this:

Jack: genuinely floored by how good Ella's set was the other night

Adam: Yeah she's gotten so much better since the last time I heard her, would be fun to play a set together now she's back

Jack: girl's something else. can't believe you let that one get away

Adam: Well I was hardly going to hold her captive in [our country], was I? Besides, I've got [my name] now so it worked out

Jack: I bet Ella would be into being held captive ;) lol
Jack: you can't tell me you didn't feel anything when you saw her

I don't know where to go from here. I haven't mentioned anything to Adam. Jack has always been nice enough to me, but I feel like I just can't compete with this girl. 

Do I just pretend I didn't see Jack's message? I feel like it's only going to get worse—she's only been back a week, but I know I'm going to have to see her often. 

I also don't want to seem jealous and needy but it makes me uncomfortable thinking about Adam djing with her—they seem to have such a musical connection and it's hard for me not to be jealous because I know I can't give him that. But I also don't want to 'forbid' him from doing something he's passionate about. 

What do I do?

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend's friends seem to prefer a girl my boyfriend used to date. She's been living abroad but came back last week, and my boyfriend's best friend texted him saying 'you can't tell me you didn't feel anything when you saw her'. I don't know what to do or how I can compete with her, they're both djs and I don't want to forbid him from seeing her but am jealous of their musical connection. "
54,"My [20M] Dad [51M] has another son [25M] who I have never met. He also has the same name as me.


My name is Jon, his name is John. We share the same middle and last name as well. 


I've never met him, he lives in another country. My Dad never talks about him, or why he named us the same names. He's the silent, emotionally unavailable type. In all honestly, when I reflect on my life, he's never been a ""father figure"". He had John in a previous marriage, and eventually got a divorce. He never talks about it. 


To start, I never lived with my parents until the age of 8, I would only see them occasionally on the weekends as they lived in another town. They had preferred my relatives (Aunt and Uncle) raise me. My parents then decided to pick me up and move to the US. Right when we moved, my younger sister was born. I remember always fighting for attention when I was younger, I never had that childhood connection to either of my parents as they did not raise me until I was 8. They were very preferential to my sister over me, and I can see their connection to her as much deeper than to me years later. 

For the past 3 years when I lived away for university, my Dad would never call. We spoke to each other 6-7 times a year whenever I would come home and visit. They were always transactional conversations: ""what time is your bus coming?"", or ""how's the weather?"". I don't think he knew the courses I was taking, who my friends were or anything personal about me. Let's just say I've had deeper conversations with Uber Drivers than him. 


I remember on my birthday, I was waiting for him to call. He never did. I eventually called him but just got his voicemail. It's funny, the last time I came home he asked to me to change his SIM card on his phone, but curiosity got the best of me and I saw multiple phone calls between him and John, up to 30m in length. 


I didn't even feel anything. I'm emotionally numb to it. I don't see this man as my father. Just a man who was in my life, who provided for me financially in terms of upbringing. That's about it. Don't get me wrong, I know things could be worse, and I'm grateful for the fact that he was there...but I have no relationship with him. He isn't a ""father"".


Should I be feeling this way? I am concerned I'm unconsciously resentful about my upbringing and relationship with him that  might be affecting other aspects of my life.

57,"I [F26] am very scared of my husband [M27] of 2 years (together 9 years total) but I'm not sure it's his fault - is this just my own issues?


Necessary background – I am a survivor of violent childhood sexual exploitation in my teenage years. As a child, I suffered neglect and abuse from my mother. This makes it hard for me to know what is normal in a relationship; I can be untrusting and assume the worst unnecessarily. I am only just starting to understand, accept and deal with these issues, I am on a waiting list for fast track therapy but it will be a few months (that’s fast track where I live!). This is for my own issues only; my husband was dismissive when I once suggested we get couple therapy (we were having a rough time) and doesn’t really understand why I want my own therapy now as I’m “in a good relationship now”. I found his comment interesting as his behaviour suggests to me that he doesn’t think our relationship is good.

I am terrified of my husband. My home doesn’t feel happy when he’s around and I often loiter at work to avoid going home. When we’re out with others, I feel like he’s a different person and everyone loves him and it’s all great. As soon as we’re home alone he does things that I find scary. I need advice as to whether he is being mean or I am overreacting due to my past issues (and in either case, what I can do to improve the situation). Equally I worry that perhaps he is rightfully angry because I am a bad partner.

I’ll give some examples of what he does that makes me scared:

-	I get the same reaction whenever I do anything that makes him angry, and exactly what makes him angry is unpredictable. I get the same reaction when I really was in the wrong (e.g. being late) or with differences of opinion (e.g. he’s veggie and I am not) or things I really can’t help (e.g. I’m recovering from a serious illness that nearly killed me, when my health limits my activity he becomes extremely angry)

-	He switches the anger on and off instantly. He’ll be angry for all the time we are alone together for several days but every time we see someone else in that period he’ll be flirty/affectionate with me. Once they leave, he’ll switch the anger back on. He’ll also delay the onset of anger until we are alone. I don’t want him to air dirty laundry in front of others but I find the sudden transition to affectionate/doting (and back again) very jarring. He could just be civil.

-	His main way of expressing anger is to sulk and give the silent treatment. He won’t talk even if I address him directly but will sometimes grunt, especially if he wants to attract my attention. Trying to apologise/make it up to him doesn’t work. I’ve recently tried pretending nothing is wrong and being normal/friendly but then he eventually snaps and says I’m being cold and uncaring and need to apologise. This takes a few hours to a few days. I know this sounds very silly and childish but there is something really scary to me about when he does this, the tension is so intense it sucks the life out of everything.

-	When he is sulking, he will fire off these horrible looks. I know it sounds petty but they’re really horrible. He looks halfway between as if I had stabbed him and as if he wants to stab me. He will make effort to get my eye contact to do this, sometimes he will grunt to get my attention.

-	Another thing he will do is punch or kick objects (doors, walls etc.), he will also slam doors, bang about and throw my possessions about. When he’s really angry he will remove my possessions from where they are stored and scatter them on the floor. Usually, this will not be mentioned afterwards and I have to clear up once he’s calmed down but sometimes he will give a reason (e.g. I need to tidy up the things that were in that box because he wants to throw that box away because it’s making the room messy).

-	If he’s bored he gets angry at me for not providing entertainment (but usually says no when I suggest stuff, or says yes but then does something else). If he’s angry about something random he can take it out on me. 

- If he wants sex he will never try to initiate, he will just get angry that I didn’t know and initiate. I don’t have a habit of rejecting him on the rare occasion he initiates in a normal manner but usually he just sulks and I have to figure it out (I do also initiate at other times as well but he usually isn’t interested unless he’s been sulky first).

I want to stress that this is all from my perspective. I may be being ridiculous and seeing things wrongly because of my history. I want to stress that he is not abusive, he never shouts at me or raises his voice. He does not control where I go or who I see and is very supportive of me having an active social life of my own (in fact, sometimes he pushes me to go out when I’d rather chill at home). He is a bit funny about be having a job though and doesn’t like it if I put any extra hours in or have a stressful time (but I when I wasn’t working he hated the fact I didn’t earn an income and wouldn’t let me have any money so I had to go hungry sometimes). 

Even if he is being a bit unreasonable, I do feel it is likely that I am overreacting. I’m sure most normal people don’t get this stressed about some stupid, childish sulks – my mum says that I should give him time to grow out of it but she’s got her own issues so I’m not sure her advice is always sound. I also worry that perhaps his high level of anger is justified and I am a bad, selfish partner. Again, I don’t know what’s normal/acceptable.

TL;DR – my husband is often angry and has weird moods that frighten me. I’m unsure whether this is because he is mean or if I’m overreacting due to issues in my past. Equally, it may be that I’m a bad partner doing things to make him rightfully angry.

UPDATE - wow, I got a lot of responses quickly, thank you everyone, it really means something that you took the time to read my meandering post! Sorry I haven't remplied to everyone, I'm about to log off for a bit because my husband will be home very soon. He's off out later so I'll log back on then.  I'm thinking I'll ask him again if he wants to go to therapy together and make it clear that if he says no I'm likely to leave. It's going to take me a while to work up the strength and get a plan but that's okay. Need to get my head round this.

VERY QUICK SECOND UPDATE - my husband is not going out this evening as planned but has nipped to the corner shop. It looks like the couple's therapy may not be such a good idea after all. I know a good local DV charity so I'm going to contact them. As previously mentioned, I will also be in my own therapy as soon as possible. It's going to take me some time to process all this and decide exactly how to proceed. However, I do plan on being proactive and am hoping the DV charity can help with that. Thankfully I have my own bank account and job! Thanks everyone for your replies, I find it hard to know what is objectively the situation with thing kind of stuff but maybe I need to trust my instincts more.

So if it isn't obvious from the title, I really really screwed up. Basically I was dating the greatest guy ever and was really in love with him and thought he was the best thing ever happened to me. The problem is, is that he's the manager at an oil  change place and that's really all he ever wants to do with his life. I was happy with it, he's very happy with it because he's very good at his job and he also has a group of employees and even customers that love him and he has probably the best performing shop in the state. My sister on the other hand always told me that I am swinging below my ability basically and that I should try to go for another Guy with a better job and more potential.

So I was very stupid and I listen to her and in June I broke up with my boyfriend it was devastating to me and I know it was devastating to him and I have tried several times to get him back but he says I heard him too much and it was a window into my soul that he didn't like looking through even though he loves me with all his heart.

 I am pretty much resolved myself that it's going to take me a long, long, long time to get over this and have pretty much excepted that I screwed up and the only time is going to heal it. So here's the part that really sucks my sister, the one who encouraged me to break up with him, is now actively trying to set up her best friend with my ex-boyfriend. She tells me it's just a coincidence and she thinks that they would be great for each other.      So the obvious question is if her best friend is good enough for my ex-boyfriend why was and I get enough for him? Well she tells me that it's because she could never let her sister end up with the oil change man but she doesn't have the same issues with her friend. I'm so brokenhearted over this that I can hardly even sleep at night, in fact I can't sleep at night because I feel so betrayed and I feel like such an idiot that I listen to her When it certainly seems she had this grand plan all along.

 I'm so brokenhearted it, I am so lost I'm so devastated I don't even know what to do. And now add this B trail in from my sister and I don't even feel like I can face the day most days. How do I handle my sister? How do I handle my ex-boyfriend, I mean is it his life and I should stay out of his business even though I know there was some weird shit going on with my sister and the girl who's trying to date him now?

67,"My parents have threatened to disown me (20F) if I return to university.


I really need some advice on this because I'm at a loss at what to do. 

A few months ago, I tried to leave an abusive relationship and my ex got angry about this, so he sent pictures he took of me without my permission or knowledge to my conservative parents, knowing the consequences and wanting ""justice"" for me trying to escape (I'm aware this is a crime, the police have already told me they can't do anything about it because he's now abroad).

My parents saw these and were pretty distraught; we've always had a rough relationship because I have different views to them but we were honestly at a really good place before this all happened. Psycho-ex knew this, and used it, but I don't want to make this about him any more.

Anyway, I've been told that if I decide to move back to university a few hours away from home again when term starts, I will be disowned. My father didn't want me to leave in the first place, but my mum, aunt and grandma convinced him to allow me. Obviously I've screwed everything up since. 

My problem is, that I have to decide and I don't know what to do about it. Theres no reasoning; both parents are pretty adamant about the fact that if I go again, its permanent, no contact again. Unfortunately, just like me, my dad is stubborn as anything - so I know he means this. But if I stay, I don't think our relationship will ever be as good again. I'm not the kind of person to just forget that they made me pick between my education and my family (I'm aware I'm coming across as a bit of a brat here, sorry).

Having to make this decision is killing me. Ignoring the financial situation etc, I don't know if I will be able to just leave my family like this just to continue with my degree. The thought of never seeing my parents and siblings again terrifies me and breaks my heart all at once. Along with having to deal with the massive betrayal of trust from psycho-ex, I have to make this life altering decision too and I just can't think about it clearly... I really need advice on what to do.

TL;DR: My parents have told me I'll be disowned if I return to university after my ex caused problems and I'm unsure on whether I should. I'm finding the choice between university and family a difficult one to make, and need advice."
