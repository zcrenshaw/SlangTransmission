0,"(Update) I [late 20s F] don't know how to tell my biological mother [40s F] that she won't be my children's ""grandma"" or meeting them


I got a fair amount of replies from my post ~1.5 months ago and thought maybe some of you would like an update. My previous post can be found [here](reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86zgr1/i_late_20s_f_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_biological/) but the tl;dr is that I haven't seen my birth mother in almost 20 years and have only had contact with her online for less than 5; she talks about seeing my future children in an excited, normal, future-grandma way and I don't know how to tell her she won't be fulfilling that role for them, or when to tell her. 


So, I found out I was pregnant less than a week after posting my first question and have just passed the 12-week mark where I feel comfortable telling people. I decided to tell my birth mother over the phone before announcing anything on social media, so that we could deal with any issues in private as they come. After her initial excitement, she said she wanted to come see me sometime soon, and added hesitantly ""...if you want that."" I told her honestly how I felt but kept it to a minimum, basically saying that I would not be ready for that for at least few years because we are both still healing from the past. And she was very receptive! I was surprised but relieved; she told me that she will respect my boundaries and that she is just happy to have my forgiveness as well as my presence in her life. We still have a long way to go and I don't know when, or even if, I will truly be ready to see her in person, but her response made me have a little more respect for her as an individual. 


**TL;DR** Found out I'm pregnant, recently told birth mom how I feel, she was receptive to respecting my boundaries, I am relieved. Thank you to (most of) the people who commented on my previous post for helping me stay strong! "
1,"99.9% sure I [21/M] just found out my girlfriend [23F] of 1.5 years has been cheating on me


Woke up this morning to see a message on her phone from this guy. Ive always been overly defensive about him and for good reason apparently. 


Their text messages are full of times to meet up and sexts. I know reading messages is bad but once I saw that one pop up I couldn't stop myself reading more. 


Told me she was busy on our anniversary. On the day she's sent him a message asking to meet up. 



Currently stood in her bathroom shaking with sadness/rage while she sleeps. Should I grab my stuff and leave? 


Tldr
Girlfriend sending guy inappropriate messages. WHat do

2,"I [25 M] can't forgive my parents (50 M/F) for cutting me off financially during college


As the title implies, my parents cut me off financially during college. They are very successful immigrants (total assets around 4-5 million dollars) who came here with nothing, and worked hard to attain what they have.


During high school, I was a fairly good student and was fortunate enough to receive full scholarships to many reputable engineering schools. I wanted to go to any of them, however they did not want me to dorm in another city/state as I would ""be influenced by american culture"". They told me to go to a nearby private school which had a pretty reputable name, but would cost me around 50k/year. When I mentioned the cost to them, they said they could easily afford it and to not worry about it - they would cover the cost 100%.


During this time I committed to the private school, and started attending. Around this time they found out I had a girlfriend of another race (which is taboo in my culture). My entire life I told them my views about who I would date, who I am (I have never been to India, I am completely americanized in beliefs and culture) etc. I am not sure if this was the reason, but soon after they cut me off financially. When I asked for a reason why, they would not give it to me. 

I struggled immensely during this period in my life, but I was determined to graduate. I went into a massive period of depression, and my girlfriend left me after I went broke. I gained weight and had no friends. I rescued an abused puppy from a shelter and that was the only thing getting me out of bed. I worked 2-3 jobs and went to school full time while taking out as little loans as I could. I graduated with two degrees, and now am living comfortably making over 6 figures a year. 


After I became ""successful"", my parents and I reconnected and we repaired the relationship. They ""apologized"" by saying they went about things the wrong way generally, but they won't admit fully what they did. I have tried talking to them about how I feel but I am met with resistance and denial. They paid for my last semester (I could not get my actual diploma until I did so) and said that they contributed a good amount of money (25k) to my education and that I have no right to be mad. They also deny that they told me to go to the private school and then asked me why I did not take the full scholarships I was offered. This sort of denial is mind boggling to me, I only went to this school because they told me to do so (so I would not dorm far away and thus be able to come home every weekend).


Ultimately, I see my parents growing old and I do not want to regret not spending time with them. However, I cannot get over what they did to me in college. I was left with 0 dollars initially, and went hungry for many days. I currently have about 100k in student loans. In high school, I tested into a very specialized high school (top 10 in the nation) but they did not let me go because the hour commute would give me too much freedom. They just want to control me so I do not bring shame to them in the eyes of their community. They even have a wife picked out for me, but I told them I cannot do that. They just ignore what I say. 


I am still young and know that I see things through the lens of a child, and worry that I do not see the entire picture. I sometimes want to cut them out of my life but am afraid I will regret it. I am plagued with bouts of anger and constant nightmares about what happened, but I do not want to hurt anyone. I tell them calmly how they made me feel, but I just want to yell and scream. How can I continue my relationship with them in a healthy way?


tldr: My parents cut me off financially during college. Now that I am successful, we have reconnected and I cannot forgive them. How should I proceed with the relationship? "
3,"I (24m) found out my dad (49m) is not my real dad. He didn’t know either. My mum (49m) has lied to every single person we know about it.


So at the tail end of last year, my Dad called me and asked if we could meet up as he had something important we needed to discuss. We live a couple of hours apart, so naturally I was super worried. He’s a pretty upfront person and he’s never been like this about anything. 

I agree to drive down in a few days. The day comes and we meet at my grandparents house. My grandparents brought me up from ages 13-21, as my mum moved 200 miles away with her new husband, my half sister and my (at the time) full blood brother when my parents originally split up. My brother is there as well, who’s now 21. We were brought up as brothers, always believing my dad and mum to be our parents.

My dad tells me that when before I was born, he suspected my mum was cheating on me. He found a letter from her old boss detailing their relationship, and how her old boss ‘misses her body’ and wanted her to run away with him. My dad explained that he loved me to pieces and I was always his son no matter what, but that every day of his life since I was born he’s questioned whether or not I was his. He explained that my mums cheating was always prevalent for the following 9 years that they were together, and that he was unsure about my brothers true parentage too, as a result of this. My dad asked us if we’d be willing to do a paternity test - he’d already ordered a kit at great expense, and we could do it there and then. I was fully supportive, this was something that had clearly effected my dad for as long as I’ve lived. I wanted him to get closure over this. We did the mouth swabs (it was pretty funny at the time), he sealed the kit and stuck it in the post. 

A week later my dad called me with the results. My brother was a 100% match (which was a complete surprise to him - they have never been very close) and I was a 0% match. He told me that nothing changes, I’m his son no matter what and he’ll always love and support me. He just had to find out the truth. No worries pa, big respect. We’ve always been super close. We have the same interests and my personality is a total mirror of his. I knew that nothing would change. 

I called my mum with to confront her about this. I told her that my dad was worried that I wasn’t his son, and that he’d suspected her of cheating on him whilst they were together. My mum told me that my dad was always super paranoid and controlling of her, used to beat her and never let her leave the house. She told me he was borderline insane and that I couldn’t trust anything he said, as it would all be lies in an attempt to make her look bad. I asked her if she was absolutely 100% certain that she’d never cheated on him. She told me she’d never even looked at another man, and that I was silly for even bringing this up with her. My response was simply, “then why has our paternity test come back negative?”. 

She began to backtrack on everything she’d said. I asked her who my real father was and she told me she won’t tell me, and that it was a one time thing. I asked her how she expected me to believe anything she was saying after lying through her teeth - to which she replied with a barrage of insults towards my ‘insane’ dad. That was 6 months ago and it was the last time we’ve spoke on the phone. 

I visited my aunt (mums sister). We’ve always had a great relationship. She never had kids herself, and I was always the one she’d spoil like her own. I’ve always popped round to do odd jobs for her like fitting her internet and setting up her laptops and phones, bless her. I told her about what had happened and she told me everyone had always questioned who my real dad actually was, and that she was heartbroken for me that it had gone down like this. I asked her about my mums accusations of possessiveness and beatings - she told me it was nonsense. My dad was working 2 jobs to support the family when I was born, paid for the house and all the bills, bought my mum a car and paid for her insurance. Supposedly, my dad treated her like a queen, and she never needed anything. Her only responsibility in the house was to keep the fridge stocked. My aunt always suspected my mum was fooling around on my dad, as she was always very specific about calling ahead before visiting. She’d get very upset with people who showed up on her doorstep.

I sent a long text (probably not the best way to do it) to my mum telling her everything id learned about her past - how she was a liar and a cheat, and that I don’t want a relationship with her out of respect for the family that brought me up properly. We were always close, but she tried to treat me like an idiot and lie to me about everything, with her defence mechanism being to slander my dad and make false accusations against him.

There’s a lot more to this story that points to my mum being super crazy but I feel like I’ve rambled on enough. As it stands now, my mums birthday is in 2 days and I’ve not spoke to her since January. She sent me cards for my birthday but I chucked them in the bin. Other than that she’s made no attempt to get in touch. I’m disgusted by her. It seems like she just wanted to ‘have her cake and eat it’ when she was with my dad. Meanwhile, my dad and I have a stronger relationship than ever. He wants some sort of ‘revenge’ for it but he’s not sure what to do. He’s tempted to try and take her to court for paternity fraud but he’s not sure how to approach it. I have no interest in who my real dad is. We are fairly certain it’s the man from the letter. We tracked down his family home, turns out he had already had 4 children when he’d met my mum, and was married at the time they were cheating together. He’s still married to the same woman today. My dad and I have been tempted to show up on their doorstep and drop the truth on them all, but maybe that’s being silly.

I just don’t know what to do, really. 

TLDR: mum was cheating on my dad for years. Turns out I’m not his son. She tried to lie to me about everything (despite a paternity test). Accused Dad of beating her and locking her in the house which was confirmed to be a load of bollocks. Dad and I don’t know what to do for closure. "
4,"My [22F] boyfriend's [29] mother ruined our weekend plans and I don't know how I should handle the situation


Been with my casual boyfriend a year in February.  Trying to keep this short and simple. He flew back to his hometown for a mothers day celebration Friday. I dropped him off at the airport. He and his mom and family planned to celebrate Mother's day saturday \(May 12th\).

He and his mother were flying back into the city Sunday \(May 13\) and his mother was being picked up by some friends and taken to a sports tournament she was playing in. Boyfriend told me he would take me to the beach sunday. Midnight saturday rolls around and he texts me that his mother now wants to go to the beach and have lunch and does not want me coming along. I understand that it's mothers day, but they already celebrated and she knew we had beach plans a week ago. Now 12 hours before the flight lands, she doesn't want me around. These plans were also discussed a week ago and everyone knew what was going on.

Boyfriend is expecting me to pick them up from the airport, drive them to his home, and then turn around and leave because I am not welcome on the outing. I told him they could find another ride. I really didn't want to be rude, but my feelings were really hurt and I felt stupid. You want my driving services yet you don't want me around? I don't have any issue with him spending time with his mom, but I feel like expecting me to drive all the way to the airport, pick you up, drive to your house to turn around and leave because I am not welcome, a little rude and ridiculous. Also, this woman has been rude to me in the past, but I have overlooked it.

As stupid as this sounds, both of them come from a wealthy family and he makes very good money on his own. I had my entire car detailed and cleaned Saturday because his mother has never ridden in my car and it's only the second time she's met me. I wanted to make a good impression and not seem messy, so I paid money to have my car cleaned \(its usually messy\) professionally so it would look nice. I even went shopping for bathing suits and beach stuff and was excited to go to the beach. I really don't have a lot of money because I'm in college, and now I spent that money for nothing. I know it seems dumb, but thats just how I am. If I care about someone, I go the extra mile to make a good impression on people who matter to them. I know its stupid.

I basically told him I was not picking them up and they could get Uber or a taxi and he kept asking me to ""please"" pick them up and I eventually just said no flat out and he stopped texting me. I just feel really left out and I have always felt that his parents don't like me, even though I have not done anything to deserve it. I come from a normal working family and I have always felt like they think I'm lesser than them. I just know that my mom would not exclude someone on purpose and then still want them to cater to her and give her a ride, so I'm not used to this.

I feel like if she has the nerve to exclude me then I'll have the nerve to tell them to get an Uber. I know it's mothers day, but they already celebrated and I feel like this was done on purpose to make a point that I'm not wanted or welcome, yet I also feel rude and selfish but mainly mad at myself for making such an effort and trying so hard.

Am I overreacting? Was it rude what they did, or is it just me? Am I being petty?

tl;dr boyfriend doesnt want to include me in plans, but wants me to act as a taxi service"
5,"I (24F) found my husband's (26M) biological family and I wish I hadn't. Its affecting our relationship.


My husband was adopted when he was a baby. We have been together since I was 13 and he was 15. Both of his adoptive parents passed away when he was 18. It was really hard on him and he has struggled with it alot. 

He has expressed in the past that he would like to find his birth family one day. He has no other family members besides his parents who passed away. His parents were VERY adament about not wanting my husband to meet or look for his birth family. We assumed it was because they did not want to feel replaced and never thought much of it. I double checked and confirmed with my husband that he still wanted to meet his birth family before I started looking for them. 

We thought best case scenario they had been looking for him too and he would gain a family relationship and worst case scenario they would not want to meet my husband. 

I started looking for them about 6 months ago. His birth mother had died about about a year after his birth which my husband had heard but it was hard for him to have it confirmed. 

With his birth father I was sent down an absolute rabbit hole and found a TON of information. Basically his fathers birth family had killed several people. His birth grandfather and uncle were convicted in 2003 for killing 2 people but they are suspected of killing up to 6. His biological Aunt killed 5 men and was only convicted of killing 1. His birth father is suspected in several murders but they have never been able to confirm it. He was convicted in 2014 for raping several children under 13 one of which resulted in a pregnancy. They are all currently serving life sentences. 

I triple checked that I had found the right family by contacting my husbands biological sister who is 19. I was hoping she would tell me that we had the wrong person, but unfortunately it is indeed my husbands biological family. I also got more information from her. All of it equally as bad. 

I told my husband what I had found and that night we watched 2 seperate Investigation Discovery episodes about the murders that his biological grandfather committed. The murders were absolutely horrendous, the things that nightmares are made of. 

My husband is a different person since he found out. I'm not sure how to help him. Or what I can do. I know that he was really looking forward to potentially having a family, and I'm sure it's heartbreaking to know that that will never happen. I know that theres no way I could have predicted that this would have been the outcome but I feel partially responsible for not listening to his mothers warnings. 

I think one of the reasons he is so upset is because he some how feels that they are a direct reflection of him. 

When you google his biological fathers last name there is several threads trash talking the entire family. Including family members that were not involved in the crimes. Which I feel like my husband taken to heart. 

I feel like I made a huge mistake and now I'm way in over my head here and could use some advice. 

**tl;dr:** I found my husbands biological family who turned out to be murders. Its affecting my husband and I'm not sure how to help him. "
6,"My[30F] husband[32M] drunkenly propositioned my [31F]cousin after our baby shower and I don't know what the hell to do now.


I am absolutely devastated right now. For some backstory, my husband and I have been together for six years, dated for four years and married for two. I am currently seven months pregnant with our son, and this pregnancy was very much planned and wanted by both of us. We have always had a strong relationship, we are each other's best friend and share a lot of the same interests and hobbies. I've literally never had a reason to not trust him, and vice versa. 

Yesterday was our baby shower, we decided to do a casual co-ed BBQ with family and friends at our place. People brought a bunch of food, we ate a lot and everyone seemed to have a good time. There was also a lot of drinking, which I was totally fine with as I wanted people to enjoy themselves and hey, I'm a fan of drinking when not pregnant of course. A group of about six people were still up drinking around 11pm, two being my cousins who both live about two hours away and were planning to crash in our two guest rooms. My one cousin Rachel (31), who I have always been close with growing up, is absolutely gorgeous, super smart (she's a doctor) and has a great personality. I've had jealousy issues in the past with her just because it seemed like every guy I brought to meet my family seemed instantly enamored by her, even when we were teens. I've never blamed her for it because it's not her fault. My husband and Rachel get along well but I've never felt insecure about it, there's been nothing flirtatious between them that I've ever picked up on. 

Anyways at about 11 pm last night I tell everyone I'm going to bed, they are still playing drinking games, no big deal. Sometime through the night my husband comes to bed, we cuddle and I go back to sleep. The next morning I wake up relatively early and go down to the kitchen to make coffee and breakfast. Rachel comes into the kitchen looking distraught. I ask her what's wrong and she tells me to sit down, we need to talk. Instantly I'm in a panic, and she tells me that last night after everyone else went to bed, my husband hugged Rachel goodnight but lingered to a point that made her uncomfortable and then propositioned her. She told him he was disgusting and that she was going to bed, he followed her upstairs telling her he was just joking and he didn't mean it, not to tell me, etc. Of course I feel sick to my stomach, and I can tell that Rachel feels awful about this and having to tell me. I thank her for telling me and then say I need to be alone and go for a walk. 

When I get back to the house, I start cleaning up and eventually my husband wakes up and can tell something is off but I'm too busy cleaning for us to really talk. Once everyone left I tell him that Rachel told me what happened last night. He breaks down instantly in tears and tells me that he was really drunk and he didn't mean it, he never would have followed through with anything. 

I honestly don't give a fuck. In my opinion, he is now a cheater and has betrayed my trust forever. At the same time, I don't want to be a single mom and I am terrified at the idea of having to divorce and raise our son in separate homes. This isn't what I signed up for. I am also just heartbroken that my husband could do this to me, if he can do this then I really feel like anyone can and that is just making me so depressed. Reddit please help me, I can't do this alone. 

TL;DR My husband of two years ""propositioned"" my cousin while drunk and now I feel like I can't stay with him but I'm terrified of having a baby on my own. "
7,"My (21f) boyfriend (23m) of 3 years dumped me on Friday. I've cried my eyes out but haven't contacted him. He's all over social media calling me ""crazy stalker ex."" How do I deal with this?


I was dumped on Friday. To me it seemed completely out of the blue but to him I guess he'd been considering it for a really long time. It is quite literally heart breaking because even as late as Wednesday of last week we were talking about what we're going to do after I graduate this summer...meaning I was planning on spending my life with him. 

I felt like I handled as maturely as I could (I mean I threw up in the bathroom at Starbucks, had to get an uber because I literally couldn't see, clutched my childhood blanket so hard it hurt my hands...so yeah beyond all that...all good!). I didn't beg him to stay, I asked why just one time and accepted his answer and then asked that he leave me alone. He kept wanting to explain and explain and explain everything but finally I asked him to please leave and he finally did. 

I spent the weekend literally locked in my room doing nothing, which is a huge bummer because my best friend had her graduation party this weekend (she's so great, she actually offered to cancel her party to come over and hang out with me, I insisted she didn't but she was sad I didn't come over but I just couldn't). I didn't call my ex, I didn't text him, I removed him from my friends on Facebook. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to, but I resisted every single urge I had to call and beg to talk to him just one more time. 

I woke up this morning to screen shots from my friends of Rick on both Instagram and facebook talking about ""having to dodge my psycho ex all weekend on my first weekend of freedom."" And while he didn't tag me, he said ""you know who you are!! we're broken up. Stop calling me!"" Obviously, after three years everyone knows who he's talking about. 

The reactions from our friends have been mixed, even before I saw the screenshots, Ricks friends were texting me ""you gotta leave him alone, time will heal this."" I thought they were just being supportive so I said things like ""yeah I know"" but I guess now I know that Rick was telling them that I was basically stalking him. 

I have no idea how to deal with this, it seems that anything I do to him directly will play into his narrative of ""stalking"" or not ""contacting"" him. But if I say nothing, then he basically gets to control the story. 

Seriously, what can or should I do in this specific situation? How do I stop him? Or even can I? This is really bumming me out to say the least and definitely making the breakup so much harder than it needs to be. 

**tl;dr: my boyfriend dumped me on Friday. I haven't said a single word, text, social media message, or phone call to him since I saw him at Starbucks. But he's on social media telling everyone I'm the ""psycho ex"" and that I'm blowing up his texts and calling him non-stop. What can I do about this?**

8,"[Update] My [35m] Son [8m] is about to go through his first Mother’s Day without his mom…


[Original Post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ir2th/my_35m_son_8m_is_about_to_go_through_his_first/)

First, thank you all, so much for all of the stories, ideas, and advice.  It completely blew me away.  I assure you I read every single one of your comments and tried to respond to each and everyone one of you amazing internet strangers, even if was simply a “thank you”.

Saturday before Mother’s Day, we talked strategy, and he said he just wanted to hang low and not do too much.  He usually hand makes cards for family members, and I asked if her felt comfortable doing it for Mother’s Day, he said he did not, I reassured him it was totally fine and then asked if he’d be ok with me buying some cards for him to sign, which he said felt better.

I planned to cook breakfast for my wife in the morning and asked my son if he wanted to help and he said he didn’t think so, I said that’s fine and that was that.  At bed time Saturday night he called me into the room and asked what I was going to cook.  After I told him he looked like he was thinking and then suggested we cut the sweet potatoes into hearts instead of little quarters… blown away, I said that’s a wonderful idea and if you’d like to help that’s great and if not, again totally fine… He got all excited, wanted to set his alarm for like 6am, hahaha.

On Mother’s Day, I got up and then woke him and we went and started on breakfast.  He helped me cut one of the sweet potatoes then went to crash on the couch.  He was kind and warm to my wife and wished her a happy Mother’s day as well.  I got her a singing card from the dogs (we’ve got 2) to help bring levity and take the edge off the morning… But everything went smooth.  

He had swim class in the around lunch and then we went out to dinner with my folks later that evening.  At dinner he got a bit grumpy and solemn… 

When we got home he said he had made a paper flower at school a day or two ago and wanted to write a note on it and burn it so it goes up to heaven, as asked if it could just be he and I and we respected that.

We burned the flower and I snuggled him shoulder to shoulder… I asked him if he wanted to say anything and he just said the he loves her and misses her… completely gut wrenching.  I think now that the idea to commemorate her took shape he asked if he could go in a write her a proper note and send that up too… 

He came back out with a note with a few lines and a couple of lego pieces taped to it for her… we sent it up.

After it cooled he took the ashes of the flower and note and buried it in the corner of the yard and scratch “mom” into the tree next to it.

His mom was cremated, and while he’s got a personalized locket with a bit of remains in it, another family member has the actual urn.  He asked if we could actually have a full fledge funeral for her and have the remains buried, and then if I would take him to visit from time to time… I told him any time he wanted to go, he’s just needs to ask.  He went to bed pretty easy that night, commenting he felt sad, but maintained control of his feelings, even though he knew he didn’t need to.

So that’s my next mission, to wrangle everyone up and plan the funeral for him…

Sorry if this came out a bit weird, maybe this was kinda cathartic for me to write, it’s been so crazy for a while and I think that this really helped me decompress.

Thanks again, to all of you peeps!

**TL;DR** Mother’s Day came and went, we survived, that kid is full of surprises…"
9,"My (29F) husband (29M) thinks I should “suck it up” and hang out with his friend’s partner, whom I don’t have an interest in befriending, because the guy won’t hang out with anyone without her present


Sorry if advance for the length. Last year, my husband and I moved to a new state for his career. He became pretty close with one of his
co-workers, John. John is a nice guy and shared a lot of of our hobbies. We often all hung out together and sometimes my husband and
John did their own thing.

About 6 months ago, John met a woman on a dating app and fell head over heels. He proposed to her after three months. This woman does not share the hobbies of our friend group and has made it very clear that
she disapproves of certain individuals' behaviors, etc. She is controlling of John and sets rules as to what he is allowed to do and
not allowed to do.  However, he hasn’t really done much in the way of standing up for himself. He has cut ties with many friends from the group, and lies about his past behaviors in an attempt to portray a certain “image.” Without going into to much detail, John was a bit of a wild child and this woman is openly religious and vocal about any concerns she has with other’s viewpoints/lifestyles. My husband and other friends invite him to things and he usually says he’ll “check with” his fiancé and then typically says he can’t. Anytime we're at any events for my husband's company, they openly engage in PDA (open mouth french kissed at a retirement party two weeks ago) and she does not make an effort to talk to, or get to know, any of the other women. Admittedly, these events are essentially forced social interaction and most of us are engaging in shallow conversation, so I get why she may not want to try. 

John's fiance and I have come across each other a few times and I've always been friendly, though we really did not talk much. In the
beginning, she was rather cold to me and the other women in the group. She seems to be coming around, as she hugged me and said hi when they arrived at the last company event. I don't necessarily not LIKE her, it's just that we have absolutely nothing in common and I don't have much of an interest in forming any kind of bond. Again, I'm kind and friendly to her and will continue to be.

So, the reason I am posting is because this morning my husband and I got into a huge fight because he wanted to invite them over to our
house to watch a sports event. I told him I really did not want to be stuck entertaining/talking to this woman. I know it's not that serious, but I am at the point I don't feel like putting on niceties.
It's the end of the week, I want to decompress and chill in my house without small talk/entertaining someone who I have nothing in common with. My husband gets angry and says that the only way John will hang out is if she comes with. I explained to him that John's
refusal to hang out independently is not my fault, and that I don't feel that should obligate me to hang out with her. He tells me he thinks I need to ""suck it up"" and hang out with her. This makes me incredibly angry because there are several women I already ""suck it up"" with, including his co-workers and friend’s wives/gfs. I have my own girlfriends who whom I am close, but because we moved I don't physically get to spend time with some of them (I have some here too now that I do see) I don't feel that it is fair to me that I am stuck with the spouses simply because he likes hanging out with their husbands. I don't understand why he can't hang out with John one-on-one! Why in the world do I have to be involved if I don't have anything in common with his fiance?

I understand that we're a couple and that there will be times that I need to take one for the team and suck it up. It's frustrating because my husband doesn't get put in this situation. My girlfriends and I typically hang out one-on-one or they are partners of my husband's friends who we've known a long time so he is happy to hang out as couples. My husband claims he would not care, but in the past he has been unreceptive and pissy if he has to hang out with men he doesn't know well. For example, a few years ago we spent a weekend with one of
my childhood best friends and her husband at her husband’s parents lake house. He complained the entire time about her husband and his family and feeling ""awkward."" I empathized with him at the time and understood that it as probably weird for him.

This current situation is extra frustrating in my mind because instead of us going somewhere, this is my home. I can't simply say ""yeah I'm
over this"" and retreat to my room with my dog. That would be rude. I can't say ""Man I'd love to stay, but I'm beat and need to let my dog out"" like I could if we met for dinner.

My husband accused me of ""having some thing"" with other women in thinking that I assume they don't like me. This is absolutely not true. I have many solid friendships with other women who I actually have things in common! I don't think its fair to accuse me of having an issue with other women when it is normal to not want to spend time with women with whom the only thing I have in common with is that our spouses know each other!

Not really sure what I'm looking for. Maybe someone to tell me if I am being unreasonable or suggestions for how to smooth this over.

TL;DR Husband’s friend won’t hang out without his fiancé present. I don’t have an interest in hanging out with this woman. Husband thinks I should suck it up and hang out with her anyway, because his friend will not spend time with him otherwise. "
10,"My (31F) in-laws (70sF &amp; M) showed me their will and asked me not to share what I found out with my husband (30M) and his brother (32M)


Throwaway because my husband knows my reddit username.

I have been with my husband for 10 years (married for 2 out of those 10 years), we have a great relationship, and we are extremely open with each other. I can't think of any secrets I keep from him, honestly. 

I am a lawyer, but wills/estates are not my specialty and I really know nothing about wills except for what I learned back when I studied for the bar exam. So, when my husband's parents asked that I help them re-draft their will, I declined and sent them a referral for a lawyer that specializes in that area. They seemed extremely disappointed that I wouldn't help them draft a new will, but eventually worked with the lawyer I referred instead. 

After it had been fully drafted, notarized, etc., they asked me to ""take a look at it just to be sure it looks fine."" I reiterated that this wasn't my specialty and that I would review the will but that I was NOT their lawyer (so, no issues with attorney/client privilege here) so I couldn't really give them advice on it.

To back up a little, my husband and I are aware that his parents are well-off. Even though their careers were not especially high-paying, they made a couple great real estate investments many years ago (which they sold a few years back) and are living off their pensions, which seems to be more than enough for them. The value of real estate in my city has absolutely sky rocketed in recent years. We figured that we may get an inheritance from his parents, maybe a couple hundred thousand to my husband and a couple hundred thousand to his brother- which in our minds, is a huge/life changing amount of money.

Well, we were wrong. When I reviewed the will I discovered that my in-laws are much more wealthy than we ever realized. They have already put away the money for their sons ""inheritance""....and it is a lot. As in, we could choose not to work, buy a nice house, live a great lifestyle, and we would still be able to leave quite a bit to our future children.

I kind of panicked when I saw the number and asked my in-laws if this was for real. They gleefully told me that it was, and that they were happy to have told someone finally. My husband and I have been trying to scrape together enough money to buy a house and pay off some of my law school debt. My in-laws expressed how happy they were that now we could ""move forward"" with buying a house without worrying about paying my school debt, etc. In fact, they said that they hope we now buy a much more expensive, move-in ready home.

But...there's a catch. They asked me not to tell my husband or his brother about the inheritance. Both my husband and his brother have jobs that are unfulfilling, they are underpaid, and both had a bit of a hard time landing these jobs. My in laws are afraid that if they learn about the inheritance now, my husband and his brother will quit their jobs. My in-laws believe it is important for their sons to ""build character"" in these tough jobs, and to work hard for as many years as they can.

But....I am entirely uncomfortable with having this knowledge about the inheritance and not sharing it with my husband. We don't keep secrets, he knows I reviewed the will, and when his parents eventually pass away, he will have known that I sat on this information without telling him. His parents are in good health, so I expect this to be a multi-year secret I'd have to keep.

My in-laws are great, but they made it clear that they thought this was a secret I would keep for them, and I fear disrupting our good relationship by telling my husband. At the same time, I can't imagine not telling my husband and I can't imagine how hurt I would be if I found out my husband withheld this kind of information if our roles were reversed. How do I navigate this moving forward?

tl;dr my in laws are secretly leaving a large inheritance to their children, and have asked me not to tell my husband or his brother.  I feel uncomfortable and would like to tell my husband but do not want to ruin my relationship with my in laws."
11,"My (29F) friend (28F) basically soured my whole birthday last night. What do I do? Am I overreacting?


No throwaway because fuck it. Yesterday was my birthday and I went out with a group of friends. To save money, we got a hotel room - I got a good deal on it (it was like $100). 

My good friend, I’ll call her Julia, and I got ready together in the hotel room. She got me a birthday crown, a sash, a cake, and a small present. She also did my make up. I said thank you of course. She asked me a few times if I liked it and I said of course. 

Julia and I got to the dinner place and our other friends met up with us. Her fuck buddy had been texting her begging her to ditch me and have sex with him. She insisted it was my birthday so she wouldn’t leave. All through dinner she kept texting him and wasn’t really talking to us. 

Finally, Julia kept making passive aggressive comments. She said she was going to leave to fuck the guy because she wasn’t appreciated anyways. I didn’t appreciate what she did for me. Etc. All of us were like “really?” She kept saying she was going to leave and would only come back if we said we wanted her to. 

Finally, she left to have sex. In the hotel room I paid for. My friends and I went to a club across the street. The original plan was to go to club X, but we went to club Y. I was having a great time. 

When Julia came back, she pouted in the corner. She said “are you serious? You’re just going to stay at one bar all night? The plan was to go to club X.” She refused to dance with us. 

I feel like my birthday was soured, all because she thought I didn’t thank her enough. Please note, I paid for the hotel room and she never thanked me. 

**TL;DR: my friend bought me stuff for my birthday and thought I wasn’t appreciate enough. She left my birthday to have sex and then pouted that we didn’t go to the club she wanted.**"
12,"I 29F am dating 37M for 4 months who has 3 kids (17F, 14F, and 6M). The 17F wants to meet me.


So my boyfriend lets call him Tyler went through a pretty rough divorce last year when his wife cheated on him with several other men, kicked him out, and then immediately moved one of her partners in. 

It has been a rough deal for him, and I only met him about 5 months ago (we were seeing each other a month before we made it official). Anyways, I have never met any of his kids, they live with his ex-wife and we have taken it slow. About 2 weeks ago his 17 year old was kicked out by the ex's boyfriend and moved in with Tyler. I have been over but only while his daughter has been at work or not home. 

She expressed interest in meeting me and I am absolutely happy and looking forward to meeting her. Tyler and I talked and he is comfortable with it and feels like it is a good step to take in the relationship. Especially where this daughter is older and is now living with him. 

So his daughter is very very into makeup (as am I), but doesn't have anything to store it in and right now she has and uses all of her makeup from a plastic grocery sack. Her and tyler share a bathroom right now since his other bathroom is being remodeled. I thought that maybe it would be a cute idea to go to our local makeup store and buy her a makeup bag/organizer and leave it on his porch as a surprise for her with a little note that says ""I am so excited to meet you! I know sharing a bathroom with a boy is rough, and I wanted to get this for you! Can't wait to meet you!"" But I also don't want to go overboard, but want her to feel comfortable meeting me since I am her dad's first girlfriend since his divorce. I have also never dated a guy with kids before, so it is new to navigate for me, help!

TLDR: BF's older daughter really wants to meet me. I thought about getting a gift for her before we meet, don't know if it is overboard!"
13,"My (22F) mom (51F) can’t handle the fact that I’m losing weight


My mom has always been naturally skinny and never had to worry about dieting. I have always been very curvy and fluctuated from chubby to overweight. In the last year, she’s put on a little weight from aging, but she’s still smaller than I am. Since I was in high school, my mom would make comments about my body in a “concerned” way, incessantly asking when is the last time I went to the gym, offering to buy me diet food, rewarding me with gifts when I stuck to a diet, etc. 

For the past few months, I have been dieting and exercising. I have lost about 15 lbs, but at this point it’s about the discipline and challenge rather than the weight. Well, my mom cannot take it. Any time my weight comes up, her compliments are in relation to herself. “Wow, you’re only four pounds heavier than I am,” or “wow, I’ve never even worn that size in pants!” I can roll my eyes at things like that, but since moving home from college last week, it has already gotten worse. She’s started working out obsessively and making comments about why she can’t lose weight as quickly as I am... except the fact that it took me four months of working out every day to lose weight. I see her buying clothes that she would never fit into just to prove to herself that she’s still the skinny one. She hasn’t said anything outright for me to be able to claim that it bothers her that I could eventually weigh less than she does, but her words and attitude are toxic. I don’t even care about the weight anymore, but it’s clear that she still wants me to be the bigger one, which is making it hard for me to stop seeing myself as the fat one. 

How can I address this with her? I don’t have clear enough evidence to accuse her of anything, but she is making me really uncomfortable, and it’s impacting my self-esteem. 


TL;DR my mom is upset that I may soon weigh less than she does. How can I address this with her without seeming too defensive or sensitive?"
14,"My Mother (60F), Sister (30F), and almost no one I invited is able to come to my wedding for valid reasons. How do I stop being so upset about it?


So, my (36F) wedding is a month away and I need to ask advice from  someone that isn't my fiance (37M). I am angry and sad and feel guilty all at once. I have half a mind to cancel my wedding and just elope, but I can't do that to my husband's family. I am really scared I might do something really pretty that I will regret.

About 18 months ago my now fiance proposed to me and I set out planning the wedding. I know that a lot of my friends and family lead busy lives, so I sent out STDs more than a year before the wedding. And then after several months of tracking down RSPVs I realize that only 10 out of the 60 people I invited are able to come. 

Okay, its disappointing, but a lot of my cousins and friends have kids and busy lives.  It's hard to travel with kids, and I get that. So, I gave my empty slots to my fiance so he could invite more people from his (rather large) family. 

My younger sister is pregnant with a due date a month after the wedding. She had insisted that it wouldn't be an issue. But about a week ago we found out she was having complications and that she may have to give birth earlier than expected. She went be able to come to my wedding. Obviously, it will be safer for her to stay home, so I am OK with that. My mother will be staying with her in case something happens. 

I’m trying to tell myself that I am alright with this. I am trying to be mature about neither my maid of honor nor my mother not being able to make the wedding. It's not their fault, and her baby’s health is much more important than anything else. 

And I thought I was going to be fine, but today I just got an invite for a friend of mine’s (Who said she couldn't make it to my wedding.) son’s birthday party on the day after my wedding. And now I just want to burn everything down.

I am an older bride. (36) In the grand scheme of things I'm not that old,  but I am the last person in my friend group and my family's generation to get married. So, I feel old. I went to all my cousins and friends weddings and was a bridesmaid in several of them.  Some of the weddings were expensive destination weddings, but I sucked it up and went to those too. Over the years my friends started moving away from my hometown and started having kids. I went to their baby showers and first birthday parties. But now when I finally have a wedding of my own, no one is able to make the time to go to it? I just want to throw them a party and give them free food!

I know that I shouldn't be angry, that relationships aren't transactional and I shouldn't be keeping score. That just because they can’t can’t come to my wedding doesn't mean they don’t don’t love me. But I keep on fantasizing about sending a bill for what I spent on every freaking life event party I attended. I specifically dream about stealing my friend’s kitchenaid that I gave to her as a wedding gift and setting it on fire. I almost want to show up to that birthday party and bring a slice of my wedding cake as a gift.

I am not going to do that, though I might end up posting something really passive aggressive on Facebook that won't make me look good. Or I might end up crying at my own wedding because I'll look out at the guests and see that 90% of them are my husband's and my only bridesmaid is his sister.

How am I going to get through this? I know I just need to get over myself and I don’t know how. I wish there a way I could tell everyone how hurt I feel without seeming petty and a bridezilla. But it is petty.


Tldr: My mother, sister, and it seems, no one else I invited is coming to my wedding. How do I get through the ceremony and reception without becoming bitter and vindictive?

15,"Me (24F) cut off from the entire family (1-70M/F) over inheritance dispute


I have always loved all of my family and thought I had good relationships with them. A family member - great uncle (possibly great great uncle?) recently died (who had no wife or children at all but did have sisters (70s) still living as well as closer relatives than me by blood such as direct nieces and nephews (60s)) and he left his house to me, no money. I became under extreme pressure to sell it, which I refused, as he had repeatedly lamented in his final days how upset he was that strangers would live in the house he had lived in for 70 years. I visited him frequently but like the others, I assumed he would leave the house either to his sisters or split. Also, I am renting, so of course I want to live in it, which I assume he knew and factored into his decision but we'll never know as I didn't expect it and it was a great surprise to everyone.

In short, I tried to put forward my point of view and say that I was respecting his wishes and wanted to live in it, also it is not a high value house in any way so by the time it was split it would be a few thousand for each person which is not exactly life changing so it didn't make any sense to me. I got insults, emotional blackmail and finally cut out. Blocked from everything. Excluded from family gatherings. Told that the children - my young cousins - would grow up never knowing I existed (and I love these kids). I was told that I had always been the favourite - the golden child - and now was time to put it right and I hadn't so I was evil, blah blah blah. I don't remember it like that at all (note these are not my brothers and sisters, I am an only child and my mother is dead, so I am not sure that the whole golden child scenario is even applicable). My grandmother raised me after my mother died and all her children had left home, so perhaps that is the problem, but I don't know, because I didn't know about these feelings and my grandmother has also passed. She certainly wasn't narcissitic in any way and from all of my memories, she loved everyone equally, but I think that older relatives did feel sorry for me for losing my mum (my dad left when I was a baby and never came back)

They say it is not about the money, but the fact that I was chosen above other people when I shouldn't have been. I wasn't his closest family (by blood) even if I was the one who visited him the most that isn't relevant in their mind. I am some sort of usurper cutting people out of the inheritance chain.

I have a young son myself, and now he will grow up with absolutely no family at all, not a single person in the world except for me - because I wouldn't sell the house and distribute the cash equally. To be honest, even if I had, I think they might have done the same, as they have suggested that I influenced him and said some horrible things - from people who previously I had great relationships with and were nothing but friendly. 

I feel awful because it is a united front against me which really makes it look like I've done something wrong, but I don't feel I have. Yet I have gone from a big loving family to being a pariah who has been blocked and uninvited from everything over receiving a gift that other people didn't - one I never asked for but chose to accept.

Anyway my question is has anyone ever been pushed out by their whole family and what did you do? How do you come to terms with it? How do you live life with no family? Knowing that your family hate you and not really understanding why? Should I have just sold it? If I sell it now, will things ever go back to being the way they were?

**TL:DR I have been cut off from family over an unexpected inheritance and I don't know how to cope with this. I love my family and I am absolutely heartbroken, hurt, confused and don't know what to do now.**"
16,"My(31M) Wife(29F) slapped me when having an argument


My wife and I have been married almost 4 years. 3 months ago we had one 2nd child. A couple days after giving birth while still in the hospital I got a call from my Mother in Law telling me something was wrong with my 3 year old son. She was belligerent and I couldn't understand what happened. I told her to call 911 and ran out of the hospital to drive to her house. When I got there I found out my son had a febrial seizure. She told me he woke up with a fever and she put him back to bed. He woke up again later crying and she gave him an herbal remedy to make him feel better. It was probably too late for anything at that point as he had a seizure a few minutes after. She does not believe in tylenol, and claims she couldn't find the one provided that was in a bag we left with her. Thank God he is ok now, but I have not been happy how the situation was handled. 

My MIL is against vaccinations antibiotics and most standard western medicine. I find it quite hypocritical considering she raised my wife and BIL giving them tylenol, antibiotics and they are vaccinated. I have had at least one talk with her prior to this that my kids take tylenol when they have a fever. She is a very nice lady, but quite naive and has been lured into paying a lot of money for herbal remedies from a naturopathic doctor for illnesses that seem to be fabricated. This is not a knock against alternative medicine, but more giving a back story on my MIL's lifestyle. She has never had a real full time job, and is quite spoiled by my hardworking Father in Law. 

I lost all trust for my Mother in Law taking care of my kids after this. I sent her an email a month ago telling her that if she wants to start watching her grand kids again, I would like her to take a first Aid/CPR course to be better prepared to handle emergency situations. My wife and I are both trained through work and I do not know if or when my mother in law has ever taken a course. 

My wife approved of my request, but when I finally got a response from MIL it was her arguing me. I didnt respond as there was nothing to argue about in my mind. My wife has brought up a couple times how hurt my MIL is. I'm sure she does feel bad about the situation and maybe tylenol would not have prevented it. I am upset I wasn't informed my son was sick. He was neglected for a couple hours before she gave him an unapproved medicine. She didnt call 911 as soon as it happened. And did not take him to the ER, an ambulance had to come get him.

I told my wife a couple days ago that I found it quite irresponsible my MIL was ignoring my request to obtain first Aid/CPR training. My wife defended her mother by saying she had more life experience and was more responsible than I was. I told her that was not true and immediately got slapped in the face. I got up and began packing a bag telling her how uncool it was to hit me and not to ever do that again. There were some curse words and i was irate, but I left for the night and went to my parents. 

She did not say anything to me for 24 hours when last night at 2:30am I couldn't sleep from my anger about the situation and she was up with the baby. I told her it was ridiculous that after 24 hours I didnt even get an apology for being hit. This escalated into her telling me I am disrespectful of her mother and acting like a dictator for making demands of her and holding our kids hostage from seeing her. 

I understand my wife defending her mother, but find it ridiculous that she has no remorse for lashing out in violence. I left this morning telling her I am a very rational and calculated person and I need more than a coerced apology to start mending our relationship. 

I love my wife dearly and she is a great mother to our children, but the defense of her mother has gone too far. I am not sure what to do. I hate the idea of our family breaking up. We both have been under a lot of stress from a new baby, work, selling a house and looking for another to buy. This is still no excuse for her actions.

TL:DR
Wanted Mother in Law to take a first Aid/CPR class after emergency situation with son she was involved in. MIL has ignored request. Wife and I got into an argument over it and she slapped me. Half hearted apology after 24 hours not talking and me calling her out. No remorse for lashing out physically. Not sure what I should do"
17,"My[20M] girlfriend[27F] just told me she is pregnant


We've been together for about a year. I don't know what to do. Last night she told me she is pregnant and I was shocked. She is on birth control and we initially used condoms until we were in a committed relationship and both tested. She told me it's fairly unlikely that she'll be able to conceive naturally because of this medical condition she has so I thought that combined with the birth control, we'd be good to go. But we also talked about what would happen just in case she did get pregnant and we both agreed we would want an abortion 

Now she doesn't want an abortion, even though just a month ago she brought up our ""just in case"" abortion fund. I don't know what to do. Obviously it is her choice whether or not she gets an abortion but I can't help but want to change her mind. I suppose that isn't ethical? I can't even think straight. I've never even wanted kids and I didn't go to college. How could I ever support a child if I didn't go to college. Just worked after high school because I know what I want to do with my life and my salary is plenty for me but I don't think I would able to give a baby a very happy life with it

This morning she posted that she was pregnant on facebook and she made it seem like this great news. I \*just\* found out and I woke up to a bunch of calls from my parents asking wtf was going on. A couple people asked if we're getting married. Girlfriend is now mad because I didn't prepare anything for her for mothers day

I'm trying to keep it together, and I'm trying to be understanding with. my girlfriend because I'm sure she is just as freaked out as I am. But now everyone knows and my entire life is changed. I just don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice for me, thank you

TLDR: I got my girlfriend pregnant, she doesn't want an abortion anymore, told all our friends/family, and I'm freaking out"
18,"I [25F] broke my ankle at my friend's bachelorette party and my friend kicked me out of her wedding. I'm really upset and not sure how to respond.


So last Friday was my friend's bachelorette party and I'm a bridesmaid in the wedding. First of all, I'd like to say I wasn't drinking and I was being responsible, just clumsy. I wanted to point that out because I understand that could change things a bit.

After dinner, we were leaving the restaurant and I missed some steps and hurt my ankle. Immediately I had intense pain, bruising and swelling, but I could still put a little pressure on it. Some bridesmaids each volunteered to drive me to the ER but I declined because I didn't want to put a damper on things and take anyone away from the celebration. It was my friend's night. I hobbled around the rest of the night for as long as I could, but after a couple hours decided to take an uber back to the hotel when it became unbearable. I apologized for leaving but I couldn't tolerate the pain anymore.

The next morning when I woke up, my foot was much worse. I couldn't put any weight on it and I couldn't walk without the help of two of my friends. Everyone seemed really concerned except the bride. She seemed pretty annoyed if anything. I went straight to the ER where x\-rays and an MRI confirmed I broke it in two places and tore some ligaments.

The day after that was my friend's bridal shower. I was in A LOT of pain, even with my ankle propped up and when I'd go to walk with crutches, as soon as I put my ankle down, it hurt so bad I'd almost be in tears. I basically could only tolerate getting myself to the bathroom and couldn't imagine leaving the house yet. I was also taking a lot of pain meds at that point. The bridal shower was over an hour each way and even if I got a ride, I just didn't think I was up for it. I called my friend and apologized profusely but explained to her what was going on and I wouldn't be making it. I think this is what really upset her. She basically just said ok, cut me off and then hung up on me.

I texted her after and apologized again and asked how it went. No response. Then this morning she texted me a long message, saying she was sorry but didn't want me in the wedding anymore. She didn't think I could perform bridesmaid duties with my injury or give her wedding the proper attention. She also said it would be difficult to accommodate someone with a cast/crutches during the ceremony and reception. The doctor told me I'd probably be in a boot and able to stand/walk by then anyway but whatever.

My feelings are extremely hurt and I don't know what to do from here. It's her wedding and she can do what she wants, I'm not going to argue with her or beg to be in her wedding. But I haven't responded because I don't know what to say. I am really upset with her, but part of me thinks maybe I'm being unreasonable. I am a bridesmaid and close friend and I did miss her shower and leave before breakfast following her bachelorette party. I'm not sure if I should text back and tell her that's ok, or if I should text back and tell her ok, but state how hurt I am. I'm also not really sure I want to even be friends with her anymore, honestly. Am I being unreasonable?

TL;DR: I broke my ankle at my friend's bachelorette party. I missed the shower 2 days later because of the pain. She was upset and kicked me out of the wedding party stating I couldn't fulfill my bridesmaid duties and it would be hard to accommodate me at the wedding. I'm extremely upset but am not sure if I should be or if I'm being unreasonable."
19,"I [27M] have never seen my girlfriend [26F] without makeup


Using a throwaway because I don't want this to appear on my regular reddit account.

I've been dating ""Chelsea"" for almost 2 years years now. This might be a stupid issue but it recently occurred to me that I've never seen her once without make up.

She's very much into fashion and beauty. Even tried to start her own make up channel on Youtube a while back, although that didn't work out. So she wears make up every day and as far as I can tell she's quite good at it, albeit maybe a bit heavy-handed, idk.

Anyway this hasn't really bothered me before, but recently we've been having discussions about the future, potentially marriage and kids. She was asking me about it and I jokingly added ""Well I can't marry someone whose face I've never seen."" she asked me to elaborate and I added ""Well you always have an inch of make up on."" which I realise was the stupidest thing I could ever say. She was very hurt afterwards.

I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. She's very careful about not letting me see her without makeup. I'm pretty sure she doesn't have any scars or anything, it's just that it would be nice to see what she looks like naturally.

Reddit any thoughts or advice on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated!

tl;dr : Girlfriend guarded about letting me see her without makeup and I would kind of like to if we are considering marriage and kids"
20,"Wife [30/F] won’t put her foot down with her parents [71/M &amp; 68/F] and it’s destroying our family (Me [29/M]).


My wife moved to the States when she was 18 to go to university and his lived here 12 years. I’m from New England and she’s from India, from a relatively major city. She came here to study to become a computer scientist but wound-up becoming a nurse. We met in our 3rd year, got married just after graduation and had an accidental pregnancy while I was in graduate school. We had our daughter [5/F] and then decided we could afford another and have a son [2/M]. My in-laws were never crazy about the idea of her marrying a non-Indian and although we’ve come to détente, it can still be pretty rough. 

My father-in-law worked for many years as an engineer and has a bit of money saved up – good by Indian standards but paltry by US standards. About a year and a half ago, he fell ill and after recuperating, he came to stay with us. He and my MIL never left. At first it was pretty rough, but over the course of the last year, it’s become intolerable. They only leave long enough to be able to re-enter the country and that usually means we have to send them with several thousand dollars (which we really can’t afford) that they use to live high off the hog in India. The 5 or 6 thousand we’d be using to cover our own expenses go to them.

When they’re here *they’re in charge*. Meals are to be Indian meals, eaten at Indian times and the food MUST be made to the standards of spice as they expect. Our daughter absolutely hates it, I find myself running to the bathroom frequently and our Son is much closer to my parents than his Indian grandparents – my wife’s family is incredibly strict and when my wife and her parents are home (without me), it’s like some sort of medieval monastery in the house. Children are not to be seen or heard, must be ready to serve the needs of their grandparents and if the 5-year-old fails, she has been slapped. I had to threaten my FIL that I’d have him barred from the country if he ever touched our daughter or son again, but I can’t guarantee what he’s doing while I’m at work. 

Since their arrival, my wife no longer works. I work for a bank and often work late. When I get home, our daughter is usually in her room silently waiting for me and our son is elsewhere. When I reiterate to my wife what is going on, voice concerns and ask her to talk to her parents, she gets upset and says she can’t do anything, she’s “powerless.” I’ve got no problem going directly to her parents to lay down the law but she becomes inconsolable, freaks out and begs me not to do anything. 

I honestly cannot continue like this. My wife’s siblings (both men) (one of whom lives in London and the other in Canada) have told me that their parents are difficult, my BIL joked that it was “better you than me” and that I should ship them home, but jokingly warned me about sending them to England. 

My wife is really unhappy with the situation and often cries when she thinks no one sees her. I am at my breaking point – is it fair to go around her and just speak with my in-laws and put an end to their shenanigans? I’m tired of funding their life, dealing with their attitude and reordering my life for them. Our 5 year old goes to my parent's place to catch a break, watch cartoons and play with my parents. Our son does the same but it's harder. When he leaves my parent's place, he has a full on meltdown. My parents found it heartbreaking, so we've made those trips more regimented. 

I'm about to lose my shit. I need ya'lls advice. 

---
tl;dr my in-laws from India boss everyone around, are mean to their grandchildren and are ruining my marriage. My wife feels powerless and won't put a stop to it. I want to go around my wife and to them directly, but am worried about making a bad situation worse.

21,"I [24F] can’t get over that my boyfriend [24M] had sex with his best friend [24F]


I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3.5 years now. Sorry if the title is misleading, he didn’t cheat on me. My boyfriend has a best friend that he’s known since high school, and she is now a lesbian and has a long term girlfriend. Before he met me, him and his best friend hooked up once. Just the once, he said it was terrible, and we’ve never spoken about it since. 


Fast forward to now. My relationship with my boyfriend is great, and I have accepted that his friend will always be in his life. I’ve never suspected anything between them - he’s really gone out of his way before to have us all hangout, have me get to know her etc. Because, like all of his other friends, he wanted us to get along and get to know each other. 


My issue is not that they are friends. My issue is with MYSELF. Every time we all hangout and she is there, I get really horrible intrusive thoughts like “her and my boyfriend have fucked. She’s has had him inside her” and really out of the blue thoughts like that. A few weeks ago she came round to visit after work, and we were just sitting chatting in the kitchen, and I had an instructive thought “wow both of us here have fucked my boyfriend” and it just gives me this really weird twisted feeling inside. 


I don’t get this way AT ALL regarding his two ex girlfriends. I’ve even met his ex before and that stuff never crossed my mind or bugged me. It’s just this ONE FRIEND that this affects me with and I just know it’s unhealthy and I need to stop thinking like this but I don’t know how. 


The three of us are going rock climbing tonight and I just know these stupid fucked up thoughts will enter my head and I have no idea how to get over this. Any advice? 

TLDR - BF had sex with his friend before we met, I can’t seem to get over this fact at all "
22,"Husband (27m) spent my (25f) entire savings without my permission.


 I was recently laid off(end of November ) and I was planning to use my tax return and 401k money to go back to school (about 8000 USD). My husband and I had several conversations about this plan. He said his income alone was enough to cover our monthly expenses and I would not need a job. I could focus on going to school full time using our savings (his 2000  USD plus my 8000 ). I am currently going to a community college, the savings was supposed to be for school expenses and emergencies only.

I let him have complete control over our finances because I feel I am  an “overbearing wife” and thought allowing him to have the responsibility would compensate for that. It was foolish, I understand that now, but he had a better history with money and I thought I could trust him better than myself with our money. I only found out the money was gone when I asked about our savings after an emergency involving our water happened. I feel hurt. I told him I want a divorce but my school issues and state law means I’m bound to him for at least another year. I also come from an abusive background and this is bringing up other emotional issues. 

I’m sure I spent the money just as much as him but he knew I didn’t know how much money we were blowing through. I very rarely use my card or buy things with out talking with him first.  He wants to work through this but we also had infidelity issues (7 and 5  years ago he left me for another woman twice) and I don’t know how many giant fuck ups I can accept from one person.

TLDR: I am a unemployed student and my husband didn’t tell me the money for school is gone. We already had issues. I’m hurt. I’m confused. 

"
23,"I'm worried (25f) because i cant get over the way my fiancé propsed. (26m)


my fiancé and I have been together for 3 years. we have (had) a fantastic relationship - he's sweet, silly, caring, affectionate, and hardworking. he hasn't had the easiest life but he's doing so well for himself, and I'm very proud of him. I love him more than anything. 

things have been quite rocky since then and I'm beginning to think it's because I might be holding onto some resentment about his proposal. 

he ""proposed"" in December. he got me a ring from an antique jewelery shop in our city. he hid it inside one of my Christmas gifts. I was so excited I cried like a baby. but then...he didn't say anything.

so I asked him what the ring meant. i don't want to say it was awkward but it sort of was. I said something like, ""this is an engagement ring..."" and ""are you going to say anything?"" he eventually said ""I want you to be my wife"". it was very sweet and I was very happy, but something didn't feel right, because I felt like I had forced him to say it. 

he also said something about wanting a ""soft engagement"" then and there, which I didn't understand and still don't to this day. 

the next day we went to breakfast and I ended up crying and saying I felt insecure because I didn't really know if he *wanted* to propose or if it was supposed to just be a promise ring. i wanted to know for sure before I started telling people. he assured me he wanted to be engaged.

he also hadn't told anyone in his family or any of his friends, they were all surprised, which unfortunately contributed to my suspicion.

after a couple of months I found out the ring was fake when my finger turned blue. he didn't lie about it or anything, I just never asked how much he paid for it. i know he doesn't have a couple thousand to spend on a ring, so I didn't think it was super expensive, but I didn't think it would be that cheap. I wasn't happy, especially because he wanted to buy himself a camera lens that was 4x the cost of the ring. he bought me a diamond ring from a secondhand jewelery store/pawn shop. it's beautiful, but he picked it out in about 5 minutes.

anyway so here we are. we've been arguing a lot lately, mainly over nothing. we've been having communication issues. we've been snapping at each other. neither of us feel appreciated, and it really sucks. he just started a new job and he's stressed. I feel like he's been acting different lately. he's more sensitive and quiet and he's been less affectionate.

I'm getting worried that I might resent him for this whole proposal thing and it's projecting into the way I communicate with him. or maybe he really is acting different for another reason, or maybe the honeymoon phase is just over. I don't know what's going on.

we've talked about the proposal a few times, and he says he was just nervous and didn't know what to say. he's assured me over and over that he wants to marry me, but I can't get it out of my mind. what do I do? 

tldr - my fiance's proposal to me planted seeds of doubt in my mind that he didn't really want to be engaged. are my concerns legitimate, or am I overreacting and overthinking? "
24,"My [20F] sister [23F] is so elitist and it's driving me insane


My sister is better in school than I am and my parents decided to send her to this fancy boarding school for high school where everyone goes to ivy league schools. Of course she got into this fancy ivy league college and now she looks down on people who go to colleges that have acceptance rates higher than 20%. She goes to an ivy league law school now and looks down on people more than ever before. This includes the college I go to, which she considers to be ""absolute trash."" She refuses to visit my college because she thinks people there are 'dumb scum' and when she finds out where people went to college she says after they're out of earshot that they went to shit schools. She also thinks that I'm a moron because my grades aren't that good and I didn't get into a good school. I almost don't want a relationship with her anymore. What do I do?

tl;dr: sister is a snob"
25,"I [21M] gave sex-ed material to my cousin [16F] and gave her money to get condoms. Now I'm being blamed for her having sex by everyone.


Last month I heard from my mom, with dissatisfaction, that my cousin Laura was dating for the first time. Knowing our religious extended family and from my own experience I knew she wasn't getting any sex education from them or from her Christian school beyond ""don't have sex before marriage"" and figured it's my responsibility to give her at least her very basics.

We had a quick chat about sex and I gave her sex-ed videos to watch. These are the same material that they use in normal schools. They covered stuff like pregnancy, sexual health, education about STDs and protection, conterception, consent and other related stuff.

I also gave her some money (small amount, enough to get condoms). I didn't do it to encourage her to have sex but to make sure that she has some money in her pocket so that in case she decided to have sex, she has the means to get condoms quickly from anywhere. I did this because I knew her parents don't let her carry more money than absolutely necessary. 16 year olds could get stupid in the heat of the moment, as happened to a friend of mine (and didn't end well for him and his girlfriend).

I also told her that if she ever wants to have a judgement-free conversation about anything, I'm here for her. And I offered her a 24/7 no-questions-asked ride service in case she wanted to get out of a situation. This is exactly what my half-sister did for me when I was 16. I figured I should do the same for my cousin.

So that was the extent of my involvement here. Yesterday, I got an angry phone call from my uncle blaming me for her daughter having sex. Apparently she told her friend that she had sex with her boyfriend, who then told her mom, who told my aunt and they found the videos and condoms and after interrogating her they she had to tell them that she got them from me.

I don't know what to do now. Looks like my uncle/aunt expect apologies from me for taking their daughter out of the so-called righteous path (whatever that means), my own parents are on their side too, expect me being remorseful and promising that this wouldn't happen again.

I feel bad about my cousin and she must be under a lot of pressure. I don't think I'll get access to her to offer any support, maybe unless I apologize and promise them that this would never happen again, but there are no guarantees.

How do I help my cousin at this point?

26,"Five years ago I (30sF) told my best friend (30sF) that if anything happened to me or my husband I wanted her to raise my child. She's now morbidly obese and I've changed my mind but she's not taking it well.


Throwaway because we both Reddit. 

I've known my bestie since I was 14. We've been joined at the hip since then and I adore her as if she's my own sister. She's married but has no children and can't have children, so when I asked her about naming her as guardian of my child in my will in case anything ever happened to me or my husband, she said yes without hesitation. I feel very blessed and fortunate to have a best friend like that. 

That was five years ago. She was always a heavier girl, but lately her weight is out of control. She confided in me that her weight is up to 400lbs. She still works, but she's always complaining about pain in her knees and feet. She doesn't exercise or do anything physical because she becomes winded very quickly. Much of her time is spent in her house with her husband, eating, to the point where her own doctor says she's at risk of developing diabetes. 

We're updating our will, and the subject of guardianship came up again with myself and my husband. He gingerly asked if maybe we should consider changing guardians considering that my friend isn't exactly the healthiest and our daughter is so young. I considered it and agreed, but said that I wanted to tell her first. 

I told her and the conversation did not go over well. My friend feels that I'm being critical of her weight. While I see how it could come off as that, my main concern is her health, and whether or not she'd be able to care of my child properly/live well into my child's older years. If something happens and she loses us, it'd be too traumatic to have her lose someone else too soon. I want a guardian that will be there for her in many, many years to come.

My friend has now cut off communication and is venting her frustration on Facebook and trying to make this into us coming for her over her weight. That's not it. I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I've tried to explain, but she's hearing none of it.

Is there any way to help her feel better about our decision? Is this decision even the right thing to do? I'm conflicted.

tl;dr: Five years ago I told my best friend that if anything happened to me or my husband I wanted her to raise my child. She's now morbidly obese and I've changed my mind but she's not taking it well."
27,"[21M] Mom Watches Me on Cameras


I'm 21 years old and going to college. I have a 3.82 and have Florida Prepaid. I suffer from anxiety and depression. My parents have threatened to stop allowing me to use my college plan because of arguments in the past and it makes me scared to confront them about anything. My house has cameras in every single room. I have lived with a camera in my bedroom since 6th grade. They use TMobile FamilyWhere to track my phone when I leave the house. I get notifications whenever they check. My mom gets upset whenever she sees me drink alcohol, and she tells my dad that I'm becoming an alcoholic. She involves my girlfriend in arguments between me and my mom. She has told my girlfriend things that I wasn't ready to talk about with her. My girlfriend has expressed how uncomfortable these situations make her feel. I feel that it is making me constantly paranoid and I now have trust issues with my parents. My grandpa on my dad's side passed away this week and my parents had me take care of my brother with downsyndrome and our 4 dogs. While they were gone my mom constantly watched me on the cameras and critiqued me on every action. She asked my grandma on my mom's side to come and help because ""he's not taking care of the dogs."" I love my dogs and I take care of them even when my parents are home. It really offended me that she talks about me the way she does. I feel guilty because I don't like my mother. I feel like she's ruining our relationship. Is it okay for me to feel this way?

**TL;DR My mom constantly watches me on security cameras. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and I feel guilty for not liking my mom.**"
28,"[UPDATE] Me [21F] and my boyfriend [23M] have been arguing lately. he went to go hang out with the person we have been arguing about and never came home when he said he would.


 [Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r21sy/me_21f_and_my_boyfriend_23m_have_been_arguing/)

Hello everyone, first and foremost I want to say thank you so much to everyone who commented on my post and sent me messages regarding the situation I was in. 4 years later is kinda long to wait for an update but here I am. 

To continue where things left off, I made my post around 8AM, and was coming to the realization that everyone commenting was right, I knew that things were over at this point. Back then, I was very closed off, and he was all I had, so the situation was made worse because I literally had no one to go to or talk to about this. But you were there for me, reddit. Thank you.

He ended up showing his face around 11AM that morning. I had called hospitals in the area, checked online for vehicle accidents and contacted everyone I knew asking if they had heard anything. I will from here on out refer to him as ""B"". 

So B shows up at 11AM, I had not slept the entire night. I was sitting on the couch when he walked in and all I could do was cry when I saw him. I was relieved that he wasn't hurt or dead on the side of the road somewhere, but just the look on his face when he came in told me everything I needed to know. I knew we were over at that point. I asked him if he was with her and if he spent the night with her, he sat down with me and started to cry and said that he was. He told me that she saw me calling and ignored it all throughout the night. He said that he loved her and wanted to be with her. I asked him how this all happened and he said he didn't know. He said that he felt disconnected from me recently and felt that I didn't have time for him because I worked during the days \(he was unemployed\). Honestly, a lot of the time I was too tired for sex, and too tired and drained from working 60 hour weeks at a horrible office job, to stay up and play games or watch movies with him. I always apologized for this and we always made plans for weekends but this was not enough for him. 

Anyways, he continues on telling me that he loves me but isn't IN LOVE with me, and basically says he wants to marry this girl and that we are over. I'm going to be honest here, I cried and begged him to see what he was throwing away. I suggested going to therapy, moving away, just ANYTHING at all to rectify this because I was not ready to let this go. This all happened so suddenly that I felt like a prank was being pulled on me and I was waiting for him to smile at me like he used to and say he was kidding. But he didn't. I looked him in the eyes and asked if he was 100 percent sure that this is what he wants and he said yes. So that was that. 

At this point I was in complete shock. Thinking about what happens next and where I should go and do. We lived in a small apartment together but all my belongings were there and it was all very overwhelming. After locking myself in the bathroom, I called my sister. She lived about 45 mins away at the time and we weren't on the best terms but I called her because I had no one else. As soon as I heard her voice I just lost it and cried and cried. I literally cried until there weren't any tears. She comforted me and told me that she was going to leave work to come pick me up and to wait outside for her, so I did. I went out into the living room where B was on his phone, texting her I assume, and I told him that my sister is going to pick me up and I'll be back later to talk about what we do next. He said okay and I went outside to wait for my sister. I also want to add here that ever since he came home that morning he was unbearably kind and sweet to me, telling me how sorry he is and how much he is in love with this new girl. It was the hardest, most painful day of my life. 

My sister showed up and I just cried in her car with her. We actually spent more time talking about us and our family than B and the things that he had done the night before and it made me feel better. I explained everything to her and then she took me to see my mom at work. I had also not been on the best terms with my parents but when my mom saw me she knew immediately what was going on and told me that I can come home and stay with her as long as I need to. So that was my plan. My sister did not want to take me back to my apartment but I insisted that I needed to start gathering my things and sort some things out with my job. B was the one who drove me to and from work every day since we shared a car so I needed to make sure that I would be able to get to work on time living back at home and that my mom and dad were okay with me bringing my two ferrets with me. 

I get back inside and he is in there and gets up to greet me as I walk in. I do not look at him, and explain that I am moving back home and that I was going to finish out this week at work so that I can move out all of my things this weekend. He was fine with that. I was relieved that I had some time to take everything in. I made myself a little bed on the floor in our storage room and stayed in there for the rest of the day. He never tried to talk to me or come in the room at all. I was relieved but also crushed. I was hoping he would come to his senses and admit that he messed up and wanted to try again, just anything like that. But I got nothing. I believe it was Wednesday when all of this went down, so I only had 2 more days of work before I was out of there. I had to get things ready and my mom said that she was cleaning out my old room so my ferrets would have enough room as well. I was fine staying there for another 2 days.

The next morning my coworker picks me up and I head to work. Work goes by as usual, I'm very stressed and sleep deprived. I get home and when I walk in, all my belongings are stuffed into black garbage bags sitting by the door. I was going to spend the next couple days packing everything up into actual boxes so when I got there I was furious at this. Everything was just jammed into bags. All my clothes, my bathroom stuff, just everything. I asked him what on earth he is thinking and he informed me that his new lady friend wanted me out so she could move in THAT DAY. Take note, this is only ONE DAY after all of this happened and I'm basically being kicked out. I held my ground and said no. I am staying here until I have everything in order and he and her can go screw each other at her house if they were in such a hurry. He insisted that I leave because she is on her way over. I am just shocked beyond words at this point. Not only am I being kicked out of a place that I PAY THE RENT FOR, but she is also on her way and the thought of seeing her literally made me feel homicidal. I can't explain to you how angry I was. I can't even explain to you how hot my ears and face felt in that moment. I felt like I was on fire. I yelled at him, screamed at the top of my lungs at him for ruining my life and all the plans we had made. I just screamed and cried and although I'm not proud of this moment, I got in his face and pushed him as hard as I could and he fell down. He just got up, told me to leave and went into his room and locked the door. 

I immediately called my brother, who was 18 at the time and still lived at home, and asked him if he could come get me before I do something I will regret. My brother comes right over I grab the 2 garbage bags with my stuff in them, and grab my ferrets, ferret supplies, and my computer and loaded it up in my brothers car. He took me home. Everything else of mine there didn't matter. I just needed to get out of there. I left without saying anything and slammed the door on my way out.  My brother talked to me and told me that everything would be okay and I believed him. I moved the few things that I had back into my old room and helped my mom finish cleaning it out. She told me not to worry about anything I forgot and that it could all be replaced. I felt better, for a while anyways. 

I was so shook up over everything. So filled with rage and just hurt beyond words that  I stopped showing up for work and so I got fired from my job. My parents were worried but supportive of me and said I could stay there as long as I need to. The next couple weeks are a blur. I spent most of my time in bed, stalking B and his new gf on social media. Seeing pictures of them together decorating ""their new place"" with new furniture and posting pictures of them kissing and drinking, despite B never drinking or being that into celebrating things or decorating. I felt bad about myself. Felt like  despite trying my hardest, I wasn't enough for him. I felt like I was so damaged that at this point there's no one who would want me. It was the darkest, loneliest time for me. The next couple months were much of the same. I didn't even try looking for a job, I developed an eating disorder, I spent all my money on things trying to make myself feel better, but nothing helped.  Then, something happened that changed everything. 

A couple months go by and I get a message from B from a new facebook account that he made saying what a horrible mistake he made and that he needed to talk to me as soon as possible. At this point I was not over him in the slightest so of course I asked him what he wanted. He said that things between him and his new gf were not working out and he has realized what a horrible mistake he has made. As soon as I read this I felt a lump in my throat. I thought about everything I had been through, thought about the hatred I felt for both of them. I wanted to say so badly that I love him and forgive him for everything but my fingers just wouldn't type that. Instead, I asked him to please never contact me again and that I never want to see his face or think of his name ever again, and I blocked him and deleted my facebook too. I was so proud of myself for not giving into him. It gave me the motivation I needed to get out of the slump I was in. I got my number changed shortly after and closed all my social media accounts. Started using a new username on everything and thought that this was the only way to allow myself to get over this because I could not continue to live like this. Months go by as I try to reconstruct my life. I ended up getting a new job in a clothing store, getting my license finally, and also meeting a new guy online that I really liked. A year had passed. 

This new guy, we will call him P, was the complete opposite of B in every way. He made me feel beautiful and was into the same things I was. He had a full time job and went to school. We would talk every day over text and he would call me every night before bed and just talk about my day with me. I felt myself thinking about B less and less. Some days I didn't even think about him at all. I felt like I was finally healing. I felt like I could sleep again, eat again, and just live again, without being tied down to someone. I got back to a healthy weight and felt better than ever. After talking for several months, P decided to come visit me and meet my family and hang out for a week. He was going to be staying at a hotel nearby me and we would plan out our days and do fun stuff for the week he was here. He lived several states away, it was a 10 hour drive for him, but we planned it all out and the day finally came. He arrived at around 11PM and I met him outside. He was very tired from the trip so he said he was going to go check in, he just really wanted to meet me. I met him outside of my house and hugged him and gave him a kiss. To be honest I didn't really feel a spark or anything when we first kissed, I mostly felt awkward but chalked it up as nerves.

While P is in my town, we spend time together each day going to different places around my town. I showed him all my favorite places and restaurants. We would hang out in his hotel room and eat snacks and watch workaholics and play video games. On one of his last days here he met my friends and they were all in love with him. We had sex several times while we was here. I felt completely numb through all of it. I kept thinking about B. On his last night here we went to a concert a few cities away. It was one of my favorite artists. I danced the whole night. I danced and cried and screamed into this giant crowed of people. P was standing against a wall the whole time. I felt weird. I felt like this whole trip was a waste of time and money for us both. We had sex that night when we got back to his hotel room. I had to stop half way through because I just wasn't turned on and wasn't feeling it. He got upset and told me that the entire time he was here he has been talking to another girl back home that was willing to put out for him at any time. I felt a rush of feelings coming back that I thought were gone. I grabbed my purse and left the hotel and went back home where I cried and cried and even though I am not religious, I prayed to god and asked why all of this is happening to me. Why can't I just have my memory erased. Dying would be easier than feeling this way. P went back home, he talked to me here and there, still wanting to somehow remain friends, but we stopped talking. Another year goes by.

During the time after P, I try my best to consume my life with work and friends. I start seeing a therapist and making plans with my friends as much as I can. I grow closer with my family and went on several dates with a couple nice guys. I hung out with my best friend all the time, we played games and he helped me get back to my old self. I felt things becoming easier to do, living was enjoyable again. My friends and family got me through the darkest time of my life and I'm eternally grateful for that.

Then, one fated day, I get a message from someone on a gaming platform. It was an old mutual friend of mine and B. He messaged me saying that B really needed to talk to me and that I should give him the time of day. At this point, I'm upset. What more could there be to possibly say about what happened years ago. I knew nothing about B or his life and made it a point to avoid him in every aspect of my life. I blocked the person who messaged me and went on with my day. The next couple days, the town that I live in suffered a natural disaster. Homes were flooded and the water level was rising. It was terrifying to hear people evacuating and screaming outside. I live sort of on a hill but the water was rising fast after days of constant rain so we were told to evacuate. I was absolutely horrified that this was the end and that everything that I had done and lived for was about to end. We evacuated to the gym of my old school and stayed there for several days. During this time, I thought about B. I thought about what he wanted to tell me so desperately and thought that if I was going to die in this stupid flood, I wanted to know what he wanted to tell me. Because I still loved him despite everything he had put me through. The circumstances of our breakup were just too weird and so unlike him. I thought that he would finally give me some answers. 

After weeks of cleaning our town, most of our things and belongings were unscathed. We went back home and I felt a calm over me. I felt grateful for all the things that I had. I was happy to be alive and realized how trivial everyday problems seemed after the flood. I promised myself not to take anything for granted anymore. I called B. 

When B picked up the phone he was shocked that I called. We made small talk for a while, I found out he still lived in the same place and that woman no longer lives there and hasn't for more than a year. He apologized for what he put me through and I felt myself becoming comfortable with the conversation so I asked him what he needed to speak to me about. He told me that during the time when things were rocky between us, he had stopped taking his medication. he was prescribed several medications for his anxiety and depression, and one day he just decided to stop taking them. He felt that these medications were weighing him down and that our relationship would improve without all these chemicals affecting his brain. To his surprise, it did the exact opposite. He was stupid and stopped taking these meds that he was on for months cold turkey. He said that he was stupid and should have told me that he stopped taking them. What was also weird, was that he could barely recall what he said and did during those 2 couple of months after I left. He said that the new girl took him to the hospital several times because he would black out, or wake up and not know where he was. He said he would call her by my name, thinking it was me, and he would wake up panicked all the time asking where I was. Apparently the medication not being in his system anymore affected him negatively. After telling me all this, he said that he loved me and he had went to the doctor and got proof of what had happened to him so that I could read up on it. He begged me to believe him and of course I didn't. The sincerity in his voice stuck with me though, as I hung up the phone and went about my life. 

A couple days later I went to my therapist and I asked her about this. She told me that he could very well be trying to pull the wool over my eyes but certain medications also known as SSRIs, which is what he was taking, could definitely affect someones life in the ways he had described. Especially if he had been taking them for as long as he had been \(close to a year\) on a high dose, and quit cold turkey. I did some research on my own as well, which she advised I do, and I found out that what he was saying was totally possible. But I also realized that what he was saying could be a total lie and he just wants to get back with me. During this time, I chatted with B often. A year had passed since that day that I called him and he would occasionally check up on me. He told me that he has not seen or been with anyone since the new girl, and he had also gotten a very nice paying job, started seeing a therapist twice a week and started exercising and doing what he could to move on because he never thought he would speak to me again. We continued to talk and catch up for the next couple weeks. 

We are chatting one day and I ask him if he wants to hang out and he says yes. He comes to pick me up and gives me some cds and movies that I left there. While we were in the car together we showed each other a bunch of new music that we had both found, and just talked for hours driving around. I suggested we go get some food and he said he would make me dinner, so we went back to the apartment. After not being in there for several years, it was kind of emotional for me when I stepped back in there. It was very clean and organized. I suggested we make dinner together and he agreed. I sat on the couch for a second and he sat down too and we completely forgot about dinner and talked all night. Talked about what we had both been through and talked about how things are better now for us both. He apologized over and over again, telling me how stupid he was and if I was willing to, he wanted to stay friends. I said that I was and he smiled the same smile that I fell in love with. 

Another year has passed since that day and I see him every weekend. I spend the weekends with him in that apartment that is different but I still love. We have both decorated the place and threw out anything remotely familiar of that horrible time in our lives. I now work a job that I love and he does too. We both still see our therapists regularly and have both gone together multiple times. No matter what I do or say I cannot imagine my life without this man. We have gone through so much in the nearly 10 years we have known one another and despite it all, I have forgiven him. I have forgiven him and finally feel peace in my life for the first time. I still live at home, we are taking things slowly, but I can say now that I know that we are in a better place. I am more happier in my life than I have ever been. 

I know a lot of people are not going to like this update and may think badly about the decisions I've made, but this is the path I want to go down. I trust what he tells me and we have set boundaries that we are both comfortable with. If I get burned again, that's on me, but I have never felt so secure and safe with another person. I feel the same way I did way back then when I met this amazing guy and he changed my life. Its really incredible to fall in love with someone all over again. I've learned that forgiveness and acceptance are vital to any form of recovery and I'm happy with the choices I've made thus far. 

Thank you so much to everyone who commented on my previous post. I can honestly say that I would not be here today if you all did not talk some sense into me. I had no one back then, but now, I feel like I have so many people that want the best for me and I have never felt so full of love. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

TLDR: We broke up, spent years apart. After some time, we reconnected after we were both in a better place in our lives. Taking things slowly but excited for a future together. "
29,"My (29f) BF (30m) left the front door open. My dog got out and was hit by a car. BF didn't apologize.


This afternoon, I was in another room and heard my boyfriend come in. Moments later I heard him yelling at my dog then a loud yelp. I ran to the front room to find that my dog had been hit by a car. Apparently BF was carrying stuff in and didn't close the door all the way in between trips. Dog let himself out and ran into the street. 

We ran the dog to the vet immediately. We were very very fortunate that there weren't serious injuries. Dog is expected to make a full recovery. Thankfully.

But something has really been bothering me. BF did not say he was sorry to me. Did not acknowledge his part in this accident. He blamed the driver for going to fast. He blamed the dog. He blamed the door. 

I'm not angry with my BF. I understand it was an accident, not something he maliciously did. I am mostly upset with myself. I should have boundary trained the dog not to go out the front door. When I was single it was OK, because I always put the dog in a sit stay when going in and out the door so there was no bolting, but BF isn't really good at controlling the dog or giving him commands so I should have done more to prevent this. But still. With all the times I have told BF to be mindful of the dog when going in or out, or that I routinely crate the dogs when we have lots of stuff going in and out the front door, I feel like I should have gotten a sincere apology from my BF. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend left front door open, my dog ran out and got hit by a car. Boyfriend never apologized for leaving the door open. "
30,"My (21M) dad (37M) is sleeping with my ex girlfriend (26F). I don't want to speak to either of them at all. I just found out that my ex is pregnant by him, and that they are keeping the baby. Not sure how to feel.


Went out with this girl Alice for 10 months. I liked her... but it turned out she was cheating on me with other men, and so I dumped her. 

My dad... well is an eccentric guy. He was a model, and a coke addict for a while, was a relatively successful actor in a bunch of plays and did a few roles in movies and television shows. He has always been unbelievably promiscuous and wild, with both men and women. I mean he would just go to other countries and party the entire time, leaving my mom to raise us. He would tell her they were in an open relationship so it was 'okay', but I think she just stayed with him for the money. I've always kind of hated him as a dad. I was known as being the guy with the 'hot dad' to all my friends, the weirdo eccentric dad, the dad who walks around in just his underwear while I had friends over. I am actually pretty positive that he did sleep with a friend of mine one time when my friend was sleeping over that month (got kicked out of his house).  

So obviously, the last straw which broken the camels back (more like brick) was when I found out he was sleeping with Alice a month after I broke up. She just straight up told me, because she felt it was weird that I didn't know and she didn't want it to be some secret. I got into a huge, huge argument with my dad, just went right to his house and flipped a shit. He just kept on acting so blase about the whole entire thing, like it was totally normal to do that because sex should be a free spirited thing and we shouldn't be tied down by social expectations and blah blah blah. He always brings up how in his country (france) its totally normal to have relationships like that, and that I am just an american who doesn't understand sex. I was furious, honestly, this was literally a month after they broke up. I just decided, that's it, I am done here. Not speaking to this guy. 

5 months went by of no contact. The alice thing was the last straw, but it was really a build up of him being a complete and utter asshole my entire childhood. Then, I find out through her facebook, she is literally pregnant. By him. She wrote all this stuff about how she is in love with him and everything and that she wants to spend the rest of her life with him. No plans of marriage, I am SURE he struck that down right away so that he can cheat on her and have an excuse to leave any time he wants to go to brazil and fuck around 5 times a year. 

I don't even know how to feel about this. I mean... that would be my brother/sister. Fuck. 

How do I deal with this? Start talking with them again, and just leave this all behind me? Alice is in NO state in her life to raise a kid, she does way too many drugs and has barely any education. My dad is gonna be a terrible father, possibly even leaving the kid. I just have all these emotions about this. Not to mention, my mother of course is ecstatic about this and constantly wants me to talk to them. She is not 'with' my dad anymore, but she keeps in contact with him consistently and they live in the same building on different floors. She keeps saying ""I would love to have another baby around!"" as if its gonna be her baby lol. 

TL;DR - - Dated a girl, she cheated on me. Then started to date my dad. Now she is pregnant. "
31,"I (33F) found out some disturbing information about my friend (32F). Don’t know how to proceed.


This is long, sorry. 

As a backstory, I met Jane four years ago. We had both just ended long term relationships and were starting over. We had a ton in common, and she was bright, talented, funny, and always up for adventure. 

We got close really quickly and spent a lot of time together. So much laughter and warmth and fun. She was there for me through some really tough times and made me feel appreciated and loved. We started a writing project together that we won an award for and is still in progress. About six months after we met she started dating Max. I actually came along on their second date along with a few of his friends and I hit it off with Max and his friends just as much as with Jane. 

A small group of us became de facto family, to the point that about a year and a half later Max and I became roommates with another friend, and Jane lived in the apartment below us. 

Things were great for awhile, and then they got bad. Jane always liked to drink, but living in such close quarters exposed how problematic her drinking was. Jane didn’t know her limits and she had a habit of getting antagonistic when drunk, starting dumb arguments with whoever happened to be around. Max broke up with her (a big reason was her drinking) when there was still 5 months left on the lease which made things very tense and her drinking only got worse. I tried to talk to her a few times about it but she was defensive and dismissed my concerns. 

I ended up just pulling away from her. Spent a lot less time with her and more time on my own. It was awkward because I was still good friends and roommates with Max, and I know she felt very alone but I didn’t know what I could do except try not to flaunt when Max and I spent time and had fun together. When the lease was up we all went our separate ways. 

I still spent time with her when I could handle it cause I still cared about her, but after she showed up at my new place for a game night blackout drunk, I wrote her a letter about her drinking and told her I needed to step back from our friendship. She accepted that, although she was hurt. 

She stopped drinking and started therapy about a year ago. Over the last few months I have tentatively spent some time with her to see if we could salvage a friendship. We’ve been writing together again which is great and once in awhile do a fun non-drinking activity together. It’s been nice having my friend back. 

So last night I ran into a friend of mine who also knows Jane. She told me that a good friend of hers is dating Jane’s ex from four years ago. She said Jane was physically abusive to him. 

I don’t usually immediately believe unsubstantiated information. Jane had told me her relationship ended because her ex had been cheating on her for months, gave her an STI, and moved his mistress into their place the day she moved out. I had not reason to doubt her but now I believe there could be more to that story. 

You see, about a month ago, Max told me the final straw with his relationship with Jane was when she punched him in the face, splitting his lip. He said he didn’t tell me at the time because he didn’t want to kill my friendship with her too.

I actually remember him having a split lip and asking about it and him not really answering. 

So I believe it’s possible she abused her first ex too. 

I feel so conflicted. I know she is actively seeking help and isn’t drinking, but it makes me look at her differently, knowing this was a pattern and not a one-off.

We are supposed to get together to write next week. I don’t know, I feel like if Jane was a man and I found out he beat up his ex girlfriends I would probably just end the friendship. But maybe since she’s getting help then I should not write her off? 

I’m not sure how to handle this. Advice is appreciated. 

TLDR: Found out my once best friend was physically abusive to multiple partners, don’t know what to do. "
32,"Me [23 M] with my fiance [24 M] of three years. I went to the hospital for a week. He agreed to take care of my pets, didn't.


I just got home from a week at the hospital and I'm honestly still shocked this even happened and need an outside opinion.

I was rushed to the ER a week ago, and knew right away I wouldn't be coming home for at least 5 days. I made arrangements with my fiance on how to take care of our pets (A leopard gecko, a ball python, a baby corn snake, two cats, one betta, 12 rats - I breed them).

 My fiance lives with me, and although most of the pet care is usually mine anyway since they moved in with me about three weeks ago, I was sure he'd been around me enough to understand the care for them. I made him update me each day with what he'd done, whose bedding was changed, if my betta got her medication, if the rats were doing alright, if the gecko's shed was coming along smoothly, etc etc. He insisted everything was going just as I instructed.

Well I got home last night.

And barely ANYTHING was touched. The gecko's water was old, the baby snake clearly hadn't been misted at all. All the reptile enclosures were cold. The rats hadn't had their bedding or litter changed whatsoever. I thought I was being paranoid and tired at first, and maybe everything just looked worse than it did, but then I realized the betta's infection meds the vet had given me the morning I went to the ER were still unopened.

He tried to lie and say things were done at first, but when evidence piled up he admitted he hadn't done any of it, but said that I was a jerk for calling him out, and that my hospital visit had been hard on him too.

He hadn't cleaned up anything from the accident either. The coffee I spilled was still all over my floor and there was blood smeared on the wall. Granted, I didn't ask him to do this - and we do live in separate rooms (we live in the south US and are in his parents basement - don't judge too hard). So maybe he didn't notice?

It was stressful coming home and having to clean up my entire bedroom of the mess that sent me to the hospital in the first place, but when I tried to ask him to do it he stormed off.

I was so upset at the time that I called up some friends of mine who'd offered to give me a place if I broke up with him in the past. I thought they were exaggerating or kidding, but one of them offered me their basement immediately. The support was overwhelming, and honestly, it weirded me out that they had a whole plan ready already for getting me out. I was scared to tell my fiance because I didn't want things to implode, so I figured I'd wait til closer to the time I could get picked up on.

This morning, though. My fiance did a complete 180. He sent me a heartfelt letter explaining that he understood he'd been selfish and narcissistic about the whole thing and was going to talk to 
his therapist on monday about the whole situation. Last night he berated me for all of this and denied any wrong doing, and this is giving me whiplash.

I want to believe that he was honestly just stressed about my visit to the hospital and lashing out, but I was so furious and heartbroken that he broke my trust like that. And my friends have never liked him and really jumped onboard me moving in with them, I'm not sure how to tell them I'm staying if I choose to.

Is this still break up worthy if he apologized? 

How do I tell my friends I'm staying with him if I do?

tl;dr: fiance neglected my pets while I was in the hospital and berated me for calling him out on it, I thought I had a wake up call and my friends were going to help me move out. This morning he apologized and I'm worried I jumped the gun"
33,"I (32F) started a relationship with a widower (41M) whose wife was my best friend. A few friends have shunned me as a result.


My best friend “Jen” was killed in a automobile accident over 3 years ago.  She was married to “Matt” for 4 years at the time of the accident \(together for 2 years before that\).  I was really close to Jen; I was a bridesmaid at their wedding; I was that annoying best friend who tagged along with her and Matt on many nights out.  

After Jen died, Matt kept a really low\-profile.  He would mostly hang out with his friends every now and then, but for the most part, he kept to himself.  It wasn’t until last November that I and several of Jen’s friends would see Matt fairly regularly again\-\-holiday parties, birthday parties, random happy hour, etc.  It was around that point that Matt and I began hanging out quite often by ourselves, but only as friends.  We both love movies\-\-I had gone to the movies with Jen and Matt frequently\-\-so we resumed that practice.  Eventually, I began developing some feelings for Matt.  He is thoughtful, respectful, intelligent, ambitious, and good\-looking.  I decided though that I wasn’t going to make any moves and keep it platonic.  For one,  I didn’t want to appear as if I was disrespecting Jen.  Secondly, I’m pretty self\-conscious about my appearance and figured Matt would never be interested in me anyway.  Matt is really handsome and in great shape, and Jen was quite beautiful.  I don’t consider myself ugly or anything, but I could stand to lose some weight, and the truth is Jen probably could’ve modeled if she wanted to\-\-I’m nowhere close to that looks\-wise.

So, imagine my surprise when Matt kissed me after he walked me home from the movies one night.  I had wanted to keep it platonic and I still had a few reservations, but after he kissed me, \*I knew\* I couldn’t deny it any longer and I wanted to be with him.  I researched whether it was in poor taste to date a deceased friend’s spouse, and found that it was actually very common.  Also, 3 years since Jen's death seemed like enough time where dating Matt wasn’t disrespectful to her.  We had our first official date on Valentine’s Day and the last 3 months have been really wonderful.  I’ve had a poor history with men for one reason or another \(my longest relationship had been 4 months to someone emotionally abusive\), and Matt is the first man to actually tell me he loves me and thinks I’m beautiful.

Unfortunately, several people we considered really good friends have been judgmental and no longer speaking to us.  Matt felt obligated to notify Jen’s family and we thought that’d be the main concern, but her parents and siblings were completely fine with it.  Most of our other friends don’t have any issues with Matt and I dating.  However, it had gotten back to me via a mutual friend that Jen’s best friend from College thought I always had a thing for Matt and was waiting for the perfect opportunity to swoop in, everything of which is completely untrue.  Another good friend of mine that I met through Jen didn’t invite Matt or me to her housewarming, which we thought was odd because she’s invited us to everything for many years, and she’s completely ignored my texts for about a month.  Matt has noticed a couple of Jen’s friends have deleted him on Facebook\-\-people he’s known for 9 years and has been friendly with.  A few people I’ve met through Jen deleted me also, but nobody I’m particularly close to.  Normally, I’m not bothered by people’s opinions of me, but I must admit the actions of the college best friend and and the friend ignoring my texts have been hurtful because I considered them really good friends.  

I want to reach out to these friends, but I don’t know particularly what to say, but I’m also wondering if these friends are even worth and I should just cut my losses.

tl:dr  Began dating the spouse of my deceased best friend 3 years after her death, a few friends are turned off by it, wondering if I should reach out or just ignore them"
34,"[35/m] I just found my wife's [31/f] instagram and she has been posting suggestive and near naked photos of herself for the past year


I've always thought of my wife as more reserved and shy, even when meeting new people she is usually very conservative. Recently one of my co-worker mentioned he saw someone on instagram who seemed like my wife, and after a bit of investigating, it indeed is her as she has been posting very suggestive photos of herself on her instagram account. She uses an alias on her account and has been posting pics of her butt, boobs, legs, in her lingerie/thongs with many are near naked and with very suggestive captions as well.

It was very odd to see her get likes and comments from guys that are saying all these vulgar and suggestive compliments and also suggesting that they may have been dming eachother etc.

I haven't confronted her about this yet and have been checking her instagram for the past few days and she is still active and updating, and when I get home from work everything is all normal. It's very surreal. I don't really know what to think or do at this point.

tl;dr - found my wife's instagram account and she has been posting suggestive and sexy photos of herself"
35,"I [22F] have an embarrassing disease, and I don't want my future roommate [23F] to discover it...but should I talk about it to her ""preventively""?


Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for your help! I feel completely in panic.

First of all, a bit of context : I'm a ""normal"" student living a perfectly ""normal"" social life, and on the outside no one can guess that I have an problem. But unfortunately that's the case, because I've been dealing with a health issue for 3 years now ; it's called ""overactive bladder"", and it's more an elderly-problem than a student-problem...but well, despite having tried numerous medications, there's no healing in sight.

Basically, it's not serious/life-threatening at all, but it's really embarrassing : while most people can control their bladder properly, I'm getting random and very sudden ""urges"" that I'm only able to hold for 2-3minutes. When I'm home it's OK, but when I can't rush to the bathroom immediately it's a disaster. So at the ripe old age of 22, I wear diapers and it's as awful as it sounds.

Of course, nobody knows it. I'm deploying huge efforts to hide it at all costs, and you can trust me it's really tiresome...but now I'm facing a situation where I guess it will be impossible for me to hide it to one particular person ; next week, I'll have to follow a collective internship in an autrian lab, and we'll be 2 students/room in a dorm. I've just learned the name of the person with whom I will share my room, and I barely know her...but let's say she's probably the last person I would talk to about my issue : she's quite immature, likes gossip, loudmouth etc.

Now I'm counting days and I really don't know if I should try to hide it, knowing that the task will be quite difficult (tiny room, etc.), or if I should talk to her before the departure. It may seem like the most logical solution, but I've already heard her talking disrespectfully about a friend's weight issues, for example...so she really doesn't inspire me confidence.

I know it's a dumb question, but...what would you advise me to do?

Have a nice day and thanks again :)

TL;DR : because of a bladder disability, I must wear diapers. I don't want anyone to discover it, but next week I'll have to share a room with a fellow student who doesn't inspire me confidence. I'm in panic..."
36,"Dad(50m) wants me(24f) to change the location of my son's (1m) party.


Ok, so backstory. My parents divorced when I was 7. They didn't really speak after that but since my brothers and I are now grown they will say hello to each other and small talk about their grandchildren if we are at family events. After the divorce my dad went MIA for a while and due to this my brothers and I have a lot of unresolved issues that no one ever brings up. We all still spend time with him and take our kids over to spend time (but our kids are not that comfortable around them) Also, my dad remarried when I was maybe 13? And my mom is technically single but has a ""friend"" that my brothers and I see as more of a father figure (we call him first for money problems, car problems, advice, etc.)

So that's a little backstory, if there are any other family dynamics I'm missing please ask.

Now to my problem. I had a son last year who will be one in June. My husband and I currently live with my mom as we are saving to buy a house and hope to be out by the end of the year. Since my son will only be turning 1, we didn't want to do anything big and thought we would just have a small party at the house. It's free, there will be a/c and my son is comfortable there of course.

So I told my dad the plans and he immediately told me ""When your parents are divorced and they each have significant others it is proper etiquette to have events at a neutral location."" A part of me knew this would happen as he did the same to my brother a few years back and they ended up having his son's party at Chuck E. Cheese. I don't know if I should give in though. 

When I told him it would cost to have it anywhere else he said that's what grandparents are for. So to appease him I looked for other places and saw that I only had two options. I could rent a room in a venue or a pavilion in a park. The problem with that is we planned to have some water activities for the kids in the backyard and people could go inside to the a/c if they wanted. With these options I can only have one or the other. I refuse to have a party at a place like Chuck E. Cheese or any other kid places because my son is one, he will not remember, and it will cost too much. 

What's weird to me about this is my dad has been in my mom's house before and his wife has been there by herself before. So I'm not really seeing the issue. Also, it makes me angry that even if there was a problem that he can't put it aside for a few hours for his grandchild. He can sit on the screened in porch and not even have to come in the house if he doesn't want to. 

I should note that no one but him has a problem with him coming. I'm very tempted to say whatever he just won't come and have the party the way I want.

Reddit, please help me. Am I being crazy? Unreasonable? Should I change the location? Are there any other locations I should consider? I really need an outside opinion. 

TL;DR Parents divorced. Having son's party at my mom's house. Dad wants me to change the location."
37,"My [16F] step brother [27M] hit his girlfriend [20sF] in front of me and he has no idea, she also wants me to keep quiet.


Hey. 

Last night I stayed the night at my step brothers house as it's closer to my school and I catch a ride with his girlfriend in the mornings on her way to work. 

We had a nice roast dinner that Alyssa made and shortly afterwards I went to have a shower after I helped clean up. Just before I got into the shower I realised I left my toothbrush in the lounge room in my main bag \(I sleep on the futon in the lounge room at their house when I stay with them on weekdays\) and ran with my towel wrapped around me to get it. I'm quite light so I don't make much noise when I'm running, but I definitely wasn't sneaking or anything. 

When I got my toothbrush out of my bag \(it was just kind of sitting out of the pocket on the side\) I heard a bit of a scuffle coming from the kitchen which is directly behind the lounge room, separated by a wall. I popped my head around but didn't say anything, only to see my step brother backhand Alyssa hard. She didn't flinch but her face kind of turned to the side and her eyes closed as soon as she saw me over his shoulder. I didn't make a noise and tiptoed to the bathroom, shutting the door silently and hopping in for a couple of minutes. 

After I finished up I sat on the toilet contemplating whether or not I should text my mum \(my step brothers biological mum\) or keep it to myself until I talked to Alyssa. I went to sleep without seeing either of them again that night, but kept my door slightly ajar in case I heard anything I needed to call the police for. I have anxiety so I was overthinking the possibility of having to call them because he started beating her. I decided, after remembering a post I read on FB about not confronting the situation if you don't think the victim is in a safe spot, to keep quiet and not let on anything until I got her alone the next morning. 

My step brother leaves early for work, so I didn't see him the next morning. I saw Alyssa in the kitchen and tried not to stare at the caked on makeup, but it was obvious as to why she had done it. We didn't say anything to each other until we got in the car, where I assume she felt safer. She turned to me as soon as I shut the door and said, ""please don't tell anyone."" I stayed silent for a few minutes as she took off until I got the courage to ask if this was the first time he'd done it. Since she pulled over and started crying her eyes out, I assumed it wasn't. We were on a busy road so she turned to me, I'm guessing so no one else could see her crying, and told me she loved him and that he has a temper but she understands. She made me promise then not to tell anyone, as he was angry she'd lost their baby due to trying heroine one time with him a couple of months ago.

I couldn't concentrate at school at all, and I got back to their house a couple of hours ago. It's only my brother and I here, Alyssa went to her friends for dinner. My brother is still unaware that I know anything, but I'm seriously considering telling our mum. The only thing is, Alyssa and my brother live together and I'm INSANELY worried for her safety in all of this. 

Please help me. What do I do? 

TL;DR Step brother hit his gf and doesn't know I saw. She told me not to tell anyone, says he's mad she lost the baby they were expecting a couple of months ago due to abusing heroine one time. Haven't told anyone yet, and am worried for her safety. "
38,"My[f24] boyfriend[30] was mad at his parents. I told him my honest opinion it really hurt him. Can we recover?


English is not my first language but please bear with me.

Earlier this month my boyfriend received a call from his mother saying his grandmother passed away. She died one week before but his mother didn't told him at the time because she wanted to ""protect him"". 

It was the first time a family member had died and she thought he wouldn't be able to handle the funeral (his family live in another city 2h distance). 


That's f*ed up right? 

He got really mad at his mother (and his father for getting along with it). I did my best to comfort him and be there for him...and I kept my mouth shut not saying what I was really thinking. 


Fast foward to 2 days ago. He was still angry saying his mother was trying to get in contact with him, he asked what my opinion was. I said something like: Honestly, your mother treats you like a child, I told you that before, but this's the first time it really affected you in a negative way so you're blaming her for doing what she always do. 


I know I'm probably being an as***** but I'm also right. When his mother comes to visit she'll go to his house see if he needs new curtains, or sheets or furniture. She buy clothes for him. And he won't do those things without her (and it's not a money issue). She'll cook for him. She stays a week she washes his clothes and cleans his things. It's embarrassing. 
One time I wanted to move some furniture around his house so he could keep the window open and have more fresh air, he said he didn't like to change things his mother arranged. We had a small fight I let it go. 
He also made me buy a very expensive gift for her on the first time I went to meet her. It was so wierd. 


So now he's really hurt with what I said and I feel horrible. I feel I kicked him when he was down.
He said he's sorry I never had a good relashionship with my family (that's mostly true) but that don't give me the right to shit on his family. 
I don't know if he'll be able to forgive me. And I can't promise I won't be bothered about all that again in the future.
He's wonderful responsible hard worker guy most of the time but shifts drastically when his mother is around. 

Tl;DR I told my boyfriend his mother treats him like a child, he's hurt."
39,"I'm [34M] invoking a long-standing rule in our open-relationship for the first time ever and my wife [33F] isn't taking it well.


We've been together for 10 years, in an open relationship for 8 of those. From the very beginning we've had two rules: we can't spend more nights elsewhere than at home (never even came close to violating this), and we can veto a date, no questions asked. This second rule we have never actually had to implement. I've never felt the need to veto one of her partners, and vice versa. Until now.

My wife recently reconnected with an old friend. They've been hanging out a lot, both alone and with me. He's a nice enough guy and they're really good friends. I don't have any issues with him personally. 

My wife brought up the possibility of sleeping with him. He knows about our relationship and expressed interest. I can't fully explain why, but this bothered me for the first time ever. I told her no, I didn't want her sleeping with him. She accepted this but a few days later asked me why. I told her to the best of my ability why it bothered me and she wasn't super thrilled about my answer. We got into a bit of a fight about it but eventually (I thought) came to the agreement that fighting over this wasn't worth it and we need to express one another's wishes. 

Since then, though, things have been weird. She hasn't been as affectionate and has been more irritable. Then a few nights ago we went out and I had planned to go home with someone else. I was talking with a girl and my wife just came up to me and told me we needed to go home. I did, no complaints, but as the night went on it kinda seemed to me like it was some sort of retaliation for me saying no to her friend. 

I've asked her if she's upset and she always starts out with no but then launches in to an ""I just think..."" justification. This whole issue is really worrying me. We've never had any problems and it bothers me that this guy is causing such an upset. What do I do? 

**TL;DR**: I vetoed my wife sleeping with another guy and she's been in a weird mood ever since. I don't know what to do."
40,"Ex-husband newly “rich” and treating his stepdaughter to different luxuries than our daughter.


This is my first time posting, please tell me if there’s a more appropriate place to post. 

Don (43) and I (40) got divorced 5 years ago. Our daughter, Ashley (12) is very good friends with his new wife’s daughter Taylor (13). We all get alone fairly well. We live in the same school district and since the girls are close in age, they often hang out and sometimes have same friends. Don recently got a promotion and a salary jump. I don’t know how much it is (hence why I put “rich” in quotes) but I do know in the last year, they’ve started household renovations, bought a new car and been treating Taylor to new goodies. The salary increase lined up with Taylor starting middle school, so she got to “re-invent” herself and now owns some luxury items like a Luis Vuitton pouch, nicer brand backpacks, etc. Ashley got none of these and she’s also now in middle school. There is a visible difference between Ashley and Taylor’s dress and belongings. I wouldn’t mind, except for the fact Ashley is feeling isolated, less loved and resentful towards both me and her father.

Ashley says the kids ask her why their father doesn’t get her the same things and she no longer enjoys being around Taylor because it makes her feel bad. She asked me to have her class schedule changed so their lunches don’t match up because she feels inferior. She became increasingly less social and spent more time online instead of going out (again with mutual friends of Taylor’).

Ashley still lives well and obviously expensive goodies do a child is a little questionable but when you have 1 father, 1 biological daughter and 1 stepdaughter and the stepdaughter is being treated better, you can’t blame a child for feeling bad. We also live in an upper middle class neighborhood so brand items aren’t uncommon among schools and when you have then you’re more “popular”. So one sister having them and the other not is also causing a change in how they’re both treated. I told don this and he told me “Ashley will get her turn” and told me to stop pressing the issue. I cannot afford these items for her alone. 

I don’t know how to handle this or even bring it up to Don. Don’s new wife is a teacher so it certainly isn’t her income that’s allowing for these treats. I’ve mentioned before to “not forget about Ashley” when it comes to treats and goodies and he says “of course” but then doesn’t really deliver.  How do I console Ashley / justify his actions to her other than he loves her less (her words)? How do I speak to don about it? 


TLDR: ex-husband giving more expensive items to stepdaughter than to biological daughter. How do I console Ashley / justify his actions to her other than he loves her less (her words)? How do I speak to don about it? 

"
41,"My (41F) son (10M) is attached to his twin sister (10F) and get anxious and nervous if they’re separated. She doesn’t but feels bad that he feels that way. My husband (43M) want to send him to a summer camp for 5 days but I have a feeling it’s a bad idea.


I have 4 children.  The middle two are twins, a boy and a girl.  They’re personalities aren’t all that similar but they look so similar that if they were the same gender they’d be impossible to tell apart.  They constantly talk at the same time and it’s pretty common for the boy to accurately warn us about 5-10 seconds before his sister calls to have us pick her up from a friend’s house.  They’ve been separated in school in different classrooms before, and although the girl seems to do alright her twin gets very upset and can’t concentrate or focus.  He’s more reserved and empathetic towards people and relies heavily on his sister and older brother (13M) for company as he doesn’t make friends easily.  I’ve talked to the school and everyone in his class likes him and the teachers love him as well he’s simply just shy and doesn’t like to approach people.  His sister on the other hand is very brash and outgoing, the type of kid who will climb on top of the slide while her brother frets at the bottom about her getting hurt.  Our other two kids (13M &amp; 8F) are very similar to the girl and enjoy playing outdoors and pushing their limits.  Our 13-year-old calls his younger brother the “mom friend” of our family.  

Anyways, the summer is coming up and the girl twin wanted to go riding her bike the other day after school with a large group of friends (this isn’t uncommon for her, she has a very large friend group at school).  After she left, her twin spent the next hour fretting and trying not to cry, consistently worried that something bad would happen to his sister (she did fall and scrape her knee but she’s had a lot worse falls and was fine).  The girl twin admitted to me that she feels guilty leaving the house without her brother because she knows he’ll just worry, but she shouldn’t feel guilty about hanging out with friends, it feels like she’s missing out on social fun because she feels bad about making her brother worry.  

My husband’s solution is to send the boy twin away for 5 days over the summer to an outdoor adventure camp.  He went when he was a kid and loved it and insists that getting the twins their own space will make everything much smoother.  He also mentioned that this might get him to “loosen up” and “stop being such a worrier”.  I don’t think it’ll work.  I think it’ll make it worse or our son will hate the camp as it really doesn’t sound like something he’d be interested in (high ropes course, hiking, archery, etc.).  Our son’s the type that would prefer staying home all day if he could.  My husband thinks he **needs** to be pushed to go to these things and enjoy himself, and I’m at a loss.  How do I help my son?  Is the camp a good idea?

—-
**Tl;dr**:  My twins are very close but one of them is overly anxious and stopping the other from having fun.  Husband wants to send him to an outdoor camp for 5 days but I think it’s a bad idea.  What should I do?"
42,"My [25 F] FWB [45 M] fell for me, blew up his life because of it, and is now furious at me for ""leading him on""


er too.

-----

So right now, I don't know what to do. I don't want to keep blocking new numbers, and worrying that every time I pick up the phone he'll be calling.

I'm also worried because he knows where I live, and where I work, and where I go for my hobbies. 

I think it would be a good idea to get in contact with his wife and give her an apology, but I'm worried that'll make him madder. I don't know if I can do that without him finding out.

Tldr - My FWB lied to me about his relationship status. His wife discovered he was cheating. He blames me for ruining his relationship for nothing, by leading him on. I'm a little worried for my safety."
43,"My [25F] partner [23M] allows his friends [20sM] to think I’m a controlling girlfriend to save face.


I’ll keep this short.

We live together and have two children [5F and 7mo] (eldest mine, youngest ours).  

He has a group of friends from school who, up until we moved in, saw each other very regularly, 2/3 times a week (for nights out, gym, sports etc). We moved in together half an hour from where his friends live. His one friend, D, still regularly asks him to go play tennis after work. 

I am quite happy for him to go when he wants to, which he rarely does, I encourage him to spend time with his friends. He rarely asks to go. I just want to point here that we both ask if we can go out with friends, because it impacts the other as they would have to put the kids to bed, etc (it’s a courtesy thing, we would rarely say no).

My boyfriend often doesn’t want to go due to not being able to see the kids that evening, or being tired from work, or just that he wants to spend time with me. However I’ve noticed a few times when he says he can’t go he will phrase it ‘I need to stay home tonight with ——- and help with the kids’.

Recently on a night out his friend made a sarcastic, and pointed, comment to me about whether my boyfriend would be ‘allowed’ out to play tennis the next week and whether he would be ‘allowed’ on a night out after the liverpool game on Saturday. As though I forced him to stay in. 

I see two issues with this;
1) My boyfriends phrasing implies it’s my responsibility by default to look after the kids and not his. Therefore his friends take from that, that I am forcing him to help me. As if he isn’t SUPPOSED to help me every day as the father.
2) I resent the implication that I am the one asking him not to go! Which is never the case. I feel like he does this to take away the responsibility from himself and means his friend cannot keep bugging him to go. If he blames me, his friend will have to leave him alone.

I feel like he should make it clear to his friend that he is a father first and a friend second, and therefore he shouldn’t give him grief or make comments to me! Also I resent his friends thinking I’m controlling and therefore I feel he should make it clear he doesn’t want to go of his own volition. My boyfriend says it doesn’t matter and he just says it to save his friend badgering him.

Am I right here? Should I just accept the controlling girlfriend roll?

TL;DR my boyfriends friends infer that I am a controlling girlfriend, from things my boyfriend says. I feel it’s unfair and don’t want this reputation."
44,"My [36F] sister [44F] only buys two of my three kids birthday presents


**tl;dr**: Wealthy sister only buys birthday presents for two out of my three children. I don't want to accept presents for the other two any more, if she keeps not getting anything for my third. How should I go about this?



My sisters and I always get each others' kids birthday presents. Nothing crazy, but we usually put thought into them (asking each other what each kid wants, at least). A book, a toy, a set of cute clothes, that kind of stuff. 


My sister's fairly wealthy. Think multiple vacations every year, but still drives a Ford. They drop money on expensive things all the time, and it doesn't appear as if it's a front. Or at least, not enough of a front to explain why she only gets my first two kids birthday presents.


Three years have gone by with her forgetting my third kid. The first year, I figured it was an accident, and was like, ""Hey, shit happens."" Second year, I was like, ""...wow, that's...huh..."" Third year, and I'm assuming that this is just what's happening from now on. No card. No call. At least this year she posted that it was their birthday on facebook, so...as soon as my kid has a facebook account in 10 years, I guess that'll be something. 


I haven't said anything to her about it. I don't know what to say.


But now my other two kids' birthdays are coming up, and I don't really want to accept gifts for them when their sibling doesn't get anything. It's not fair. But how should I go about this?


For reference, she has two kids, and I get them gifts every birthday. I've never forgotten. I will not stop getting them gifts because their mother's stupid: it's not their fault, and I love them."
45,"I (19f) found a lot of porn on my boyfriend’s (19m) likes on Tumblr but he is against me looking at male actors in movies during their shirtless scenes.


My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. He’s made it very clear that he does not like me looking at muscular male actors during their shirtless scenes (ex: Chris Pratt in GotG) or any of that. I have respected that so far. 

However, while scrolling through his “likes” on Tumblr, I happened to find endless supply of pornographic videos and images of females. Also, I get it...it’s almost impossible to escape porn on Tumblr but knowing that he intentionally liked them to save them for...later, made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Especially since he’s so against me looking at a male torso, but apparently he can look at every possible angle of another female body. 

I’m confused, don’t know how to bring it up, and don’t know what to do. 

tl;dr  My boyfriend is against me looking at muscular male actors in films but I found pornographic videos and images of females on his tumblr likes. I don’t know how to react and bring it up.

They will be here for a one week vacation and wants us to have dinner at my home. He asked if I could cook dinner. Is this normal? From what I know Korean parents are picky when meeting parents or family of people they are not familiar with.

47,"I (69M) fear losing my (59F) wife through illness and not sure how to cope.


Hello everyone, I am not sure if I have followed the format correctly but to be sure I am a 65 year old man in England with a 59 year old wife with me in England but born in India.

We have been together for the last decade. We met each other around five years after my first wife passed, and she helped me cope through it all as she was my rock. My sons and grandchildren all accepted her and we have had a very happy time together, a loving marriage that has gotten us through financial difficulties and other problems along the way.

I am from a time and family where we do not express our feelings very openly and so I am finding this difficult but after being directed here by my grandson I feel this would be a good way to get other viewpoints. My wife is not very well, she has the beginnings of dementia and it is becoming a very big concern for us all. I worry most about her safety and health but there is also the concern regarding medical aids and the costs of hiring a carer for when I am not around. I do not begrudge the costs whatsoever but I worry I will not be able to provide enough when it is most needed.

I fear that I will not be strong enough, and I absolutely fear the concept of losing another person so close to me. I want to be strong and make everyone feel at ease but I do not know how to best cope with the situation and how to deal with the feelings that come with it. I appreciate from reading that most of the readers and commenters here are younger than myself and may not have experienced this situation, but I would still appreciate any feedback. I have put off counselling for too long, and I will look into that, but I do want other opinions too. Thank you for reading.

tldr too long didn't read - I worry that I will lose my wife to dementia and that I am not strong enough to cope."
48,"Husband (29m) dislikes my (30f) parents (60s m/f) has a blanket ban on stories from my childhood


So for the longest time, my husband had this idyllic picture of my life growing up. Mainly because I truly feel that way; my parents loved us, and I’d do just about anything for them. I worked on the family farm pretty much constantly from age 12 to 25, when I finally moved out. 

The circumstances surrounding my leaving weren’t awesome, and it was what first tipped my husband off about my family life there. He’d assumed my parents would be supportive in the situation we found ourselves in; I knew they’d be shocked, horrified, and angry, and I didn’t want to tell them I’d fallen pregnant. Keep in mind I was 25 at the time and with my committed partner, but my parents’ reaction was pretty much what I’d anticipated it to be. 

From there, it was all pretty much downhill. As a prime example, I’ll relate something that happened pretty recently. While watching a popular television show in which two naked people attempt to survive in some inhospitable wilderness in some remote corner of the globe, we both winced in sympathy when the female participant displayed legs absolutely forested with bug bites. 

At first, my skin crawled, and then I reconsidered. It wasn’t that bad, honestly- I used to get a rash of bites come summer time when living with my parents because the outdoor/indoor cats would catch fleas. It was always a little while before the flea medication took effect, and especially before it was discovered, my body was a minefield of flea bites. Blankets and carpets would be black with the little fuckers, and it became standard procedure to nuke all bedding in the drier. 

When relating this to my husband, i mistakenly assumed this was a common experience. His family were also farmers, and his mom had an abundance of (poorly housebroken) cats. While at first disbelieving, and then revolted when I continued my insistence, he told me that no, it was not common for one’s house to be a hotbed of fleas and the people therein to suffer themselves to be covered in bites. 

This sort of thing has happened periodically over the course of our relationship. I’d mention something in passing, get a disgusted reaction, and now I’m wary of offering any stories of my former home. 

The real problem is that it hasn’t helped my husband’s opinion of my parents. He hasn’t liked them since I moved in with him, and their actions (coupled with my sister’s) hasn’t seemed to help. I guess while it’s normal to me, it isn’t for him, but I still love my family regardless. 

Is there some way I can try to mend this? 

**tl;dr: ** My husband really doesn’t like my family from my stories I tell- which are told factually and even fondly, because I love my family. I feel like my life growing up was lovely and peaceful, and I don’t consider things like flea bites to have ruined anything. Can someone explain why he’s upset so I can fix it?"
49,"There is a seven year age gap between me and my husband (22F, 29M). It wasn’t a problem at first, but now it’s really starting to affect our relationship.


I met my now-husband, Seth, when I was 18 and he was 25. We met in an online game, became quick friends, and eventually developed feelings for each other, which (after several visits, of course) led me to move across the country to be with him. After a year, we got married. At first, I wasn’t too keen on the whole getting married so young thing, but he asked me to be his wife, and I figured I loved Seth more than anything and didn’t see myself being with anyone else so why the fuck not. We got married in a courthouse with his close family. (My family wasn’t too happy about the whole thing and my relationship with them still hasn’t fully recovered.) So, yeah, 20 year old bride with a 27 year old husband. 

I always tease my husband that he’s an old man, that he’s my sugar daddy, that I’m his young trophy wife, etc. etc. but the age gap never actually bothered me. I never felt like there was an age gap. We like the same things and share the same core principles and life philosophies. Besides, it’s not like there’s a huge generational gap. It’s not like I’m married to someone’s grandpa. He doesn’t look older than me. He doesn’t really act older than me. So, no problem, right? And it was no problem, until somewhat recently, where our age gap has started to take a toll on our relationship. 

Seth wants kids. I do too. But, I don’t want to have kids right now. I feel I’m not ready yet because I still have a lot of growing up and finding myself to do. I’m only 22. I’ve only been able to legally drink for like a year. Seth’s argument is that he’s almost 30 and wants kids sooner than later, because he doesn’t want to be too old. He also wants to settle down and get a house together, whereas I want to travel and have fun before pooling all my money and resources into a house. I want to go out and party a bit, but he’s over that whole thing and I wouldn’t feel right going out without him. He wants me to have a long-term career instead of working as a secretary like I currently do. He’s even mentioned careers he’d like me to have. It’s like he’s planning my future for me and it’s suffocating. 

I tried talking to him about it, but he just gets frustrated because I don’t think he expected this to be a problem either. Just the other day, he told me to “Grow up a little”. And it’s not like this is like the first few months of our relationship, we’ve been together 4 years and married for 2. Our relationship is otherwise great, we’re best friends, the sex is amazing, and, without a doubt, we love each other immensely. But it’s now obvious we are at different points in our lives and those points don’t have a lot of overlap.

I don’t know what to do other than just give in. But I don’t want to just throw away my youth. How do you compromise on major life decisions like this?

TL;DR: My husband is 29 and I’m 22. He’s ready to settle down with a house and kids, but I’m not quite there yet and it’s straining our relationship and causing a lot of arguments."
50,"Neighbour [30?F] seems to think my son [1M] and I [30F] are a threat to the neighbourhood kids [4-10, M and F].


TL;DR My baby made some friends. One of their mothers responded with hostility, and I’m not sure how to handle the situation without either keeping my son indoors all summer or upsetting her further.

I live in an apartment complex with my husband and newly one-year-old son. My son isn’t quiiiiiite walking by himself yet—he’s capable, but unwilling to let go of my hand/sleeve/pants. As it’s been nice outside, I’ve been taking him out every day this week to practice walking in the grassy courtyard outside our apartment.

There’s a group of older kids (aged about 4 to 10) that play outside in the same area. One of them lives with his mom in the apartment directly across the yard from ours. This kid is the youngest, and has taken a particular interest in befriending my son. He and three other boys are always excited to see my son, and are always trying to make him laugh and smile.

The kids play all over the neighbourhood, but all our interactions with them have been in the courtyard, clearly visible (and audible) from the windows of many apartments, including the one in which the aforementioned kid lives with his mom.

The other day, the youngest boy was rolling a ball back and forth to my son when his mother opened the window and yelled at him to leave us alone. I explained that it was fine and they were making friends. She smiled at me and I figured we were cool, and then my son pooped his diaper and we had to run. She watched me go inside my apartment, which I didn’t think anything of.

Today, we encountered the full group of kids. The four boys were happy to see my son, and were talking to him and playing with a ball again. Suddenly, the mother of the youngest yelled at him to come in for a time-out, and that she’d told him not to play “over there” (meaning, near my apartment). Then she yelled at me to leave all the kids alone, and said she was going to tell everybody not to let their kids play with my son anymore. (She’s been here longer than us and knows most of the other neighbours; we know the four in our building but generally keep to ourselves.) I apologized and tried to explain, but she slammed the window shut before I could.

Later, when my son was looking out from his (closed) bedroom window, she saw him and made an obscene gesture at us.

Fair enough if she doesn’t want my son making friends with hers, but I’m not sure I can stop all of them from running up to my son when we go outside. I can play with him on the other side of the building, but those kids play all over the place, and are bound to encounter us again. My son will be heartbroken to hear them playing outside every day and not be able to interact with or play with them. He loves looking out his window (whether there are people outside or not), and now perhaps I shouldn’t let him do that anymore?

I’m not sure what I did wrong to get my son blacklisted from playing with the neighbourhood kids—I’m new to this whole my kid playing with other kids thing, and not sure what the protocol is or where I breached it. I have one visible tattoo on my arm, but I’m otherwise a very basic-looking 30-year-old mom. I have a bit of hormonal acne from breastfeeding my son—maybe she thinks I’m a meth-head? Should I have introduced myself formally before talking to her kid? He was playing (ostensibly) unsupervised, in an open area where he plays every day, and came up to us...so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. How do I fix this?

I feel like I can’t play outside with my son anymore, or even have my blinds/windows open or look out the windows. I don’t want to upset my neighbour any more than I already have, but I don’t want to shut my son up indoors all summer with the curtains drawn just to avoid potentially upsetting her, either.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? What should I do?"
51,"I[26F] caught my boyfriend [29 M] sending intimate photos of me to his friends. We got into a fight afterward and he pushed me.


I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years, and we've never had any problems in the past. He is kind and caring and protective and always makes me laugh. We do fight somewhat regularly, but I don't think it's any more than any other couple I know. We had friends over for drinks this Saturday, and I dropped my phone, and it stopped working. After everyone left, I asked if I could borrow his phone while he was showering to text a mutual friend and when I opened the thread I saw my name, so I scrolled up and saw that my bf has been sending him nude photos of me. 

After I saw this, I went and looked at his other texts, and he's been sending them to several guys. I'm so hurt and violated. I am a very private person, and I feel like I can never look any of these guys in the face again. I decided I had to confront my BF so when he got out of the shower, and we got into a huge fight. He yelled at me for invading his privacy and said I never told him not to share them. I thought this was ridiculous and told him so and he pushed me. He's never been violent with me before, and he immediately apologized after. I told him I accepted his apology but it was honestly really scary. He is over a foot taller than me and at least 100 pounds heavier. I'm not sure what to do, I love him so much. 

I don't want to throw away 6 years together. We have plans to get married and have kids, but I'm not sure how to move forward and build trust again. I really don't know what to do. 

tldr: my bf has been sending nude pictures of me to our friends without my permission. When I confronted him he drunkenly pushed me. How do we move forward from this?"

So, here's the deal with me and weed right now. I have every second friday off. A buddy of mine I go to gym with get together and blaze after our workout. I have a pretty good home theatre setup and he is a big movie/tv buff. He watches a lot of Indy content. Him and I get home maybe 20 minutes after my partner leaves for work. He brings some weed and we blaze, maybe listen to music, chat and play games or whatever.  From here, he'll watch the more Indy stuff on my tv, whereas I'll get onto my cleaning routine. We're both cool with this, we hang other times too.

In my high state I find I really enjoy cleaning. Put my headphones on and get it all out of the way in one go thoroughly.

I will clean the entire home 

- dishes and clothes clean and put away
- bathrooms 
- vacuuming
- lawns and yard (not much) 
- throwing out rubbish as it gets collected that day 
- windows
- dusting
- groceries (but done night previous) 
- do any other random things (paperwork/pay bills/errands) 
- Also during this time I'm put some baking and dinner on, maybe some cookies for the munchies and some meat and veg on for our dinner later on that night and some leftovers into the weekend. 


the whole place is sparkling. I have a very effective and efficient time routine for how I do all of this. Whole thing takes maybe 4ish hours. I even write down new things I look to do, like buying those toilet pod things that clean it everytime you flush, that's my most recent one. 

This 'one time all at once clean' also keeps the place looking pretty good up until the next time spare friday comes around. I only need to clean up a bit when I make the next dinner, or it's just one pile of rubbish/washing and not multiples, for example. Any work done in that day is meant to minimise/eliminate work outside of that day. 

Once it's all done, I sometimes have one more blaze. Just as a 'everything's done now' blaze kinda thing. 

My gf appreciates this, and regularly takes credit for it. Her friends will come over and be 'you've cleaned so well' and she'll say thanks even though she did nothing, hell they'll even eat the cookies I bake and tell me I'm lucky she's a good baker and she'll nod along with it all. I don't really care about this. She literally has little to no household duties to do, even her own clothes etc, and now that I'm writing this out just realise doesn't take much initiative herself with chores and I have to ask more than once for whatever infrequent stuff does come up, and it's then done half ass like not rinsing a plate before putting it in dishwasher then food goes hard on it etc, but whatever.  
She knows I used to smoke. But dosent know I currently smoke every now and then. 

So, this past Friday, i decide to have one last blaze after everything was done and wasn't expecting my partner home for another two hours. Well, as im a few puffs in she walks in the door and sees me high with the pipe in my mouth. 

AND SHE BLOWS UP. eg: are you smoking drugs!? Are you a drug addict! What are you doing getting high all day! Is this what you are! You need help! What else are you doing?

Ever since then she's been given me silent treatment and saying I need help and she's not sure of us anymore, talking about her friends bf's that aren't 'drug addicts' (even though some of that social crowd have gotten themselves into various significant troubles with alcohol) 

I can't get a word in. She doesn't even want to have a conversation about it. 

Some info
- I've been doing this since before I was with current gf
- my buddy is a stand up guy. Can't fault him, not dodgy or anything. Think his relative has a medical thing he gets hooked up.
- my house, paid off
- no weed is kept in house, my buddy brings it and takes it all. 
- I don't have drug testing at work/roadside testing or anything like that. I'm progressing in my career 
- we split bills 50/50
- were both pretty good with each other's separate lives/hobbies
- we get along with each other friends/families
- I don't need to smoke, many times I don't do the above routine on my days off. I've taken extensive breaks numerous times. I can take it or leave it. I don't and haven't used any other drugs and maybe drink if the occasion calls for it. As I said, it's a reward thing..... And I don't mind being productive on it. 


Tl:dr I get high and clean my home thoroughly. Gf doesn't like I get high to clean.

53,"Me [35F] with my husband [41M] and son [4M], neighbor [60sM] tagged along on family vacation and is ruining it


Husband (""H."") and I have been planning this vacation to a major city (""City"") overseas for years. City was on the top of the travel-to list for us before we got pregnant with our 4-year old son (""S.""). We've been wanting to travel to City for well over five years and finally felt that our son was old enough to travel without fussing or holding us back too much. Plans to stay there for nearly two weeks so we have time to appreciate the city.

About a month ago our neighbor (""N."") -- who is a little socially awkward and lives alone -- became a part of these plans too. Long story which I won't get into here. The important thing is that the vacation plans to City now include H., S., N., and myself. 

The drama started with the Airbnb rental. We changed from a two bedroom rental to a three bedroom rental to accommodate N. We suggested splitting the bill for the upgraded room three ways: three bedrooms and three adults, so each adult is responsible for one-third of the cost. N. would only have paid one-third. Not good enough for N. He insisted that since he was going to be around and could help clean and look after S. that he shouldn't pay anything. (As an aside, we are planning to fully look after S. without N.'s help, and N.'s help was never a condition or term of his tagging along.) We countered by offering that N. could pay only 1/6th of the total Airbnb cost, which he only reluctantly agreed to pay when my H. threatened to downgrade the rental to make it affordable for us. That whole debacle should have been a red flag but we went forward with the planning anyway.

Next came the flight. We bought our tickets months ago on a comfortable major airline with nice international flight amenities. However, N.'s buying a plane ticket for the same flight would have cost N. a lot of extra money because it was so close to the date. We suggested that he could just take a more affordable flight and arrive a day or two later but he insisted on everyone traveling on the same flight. So we cancelled our own family's plane tickets, ate the cancellation fees, and rebooked with a budget airline that arrived a whole day later (with a layover) than originally planned. The whole thing was annoying not only due to the money, inconvenience, and rudeness, but also because the budget airline didn't have TV entertainment or electric outlets to keep S. entertained for the flight.

We've been in vacation City for about a week now and this is where things get really out of control. I can't really organize this into a coherent structure so I'm just going to wall of text everything. First, N. is a total slob and refuses to clean after himself so either we have to clean up after him or tolerate dirty dishes and such laying around. We've asked him to help keep things clean but he keeps blaming S. even though we know 100% it is N.'s mess. Second, N. really likes museums and keeps insisting that we go to them. It's the reason N. wanted to go to City in the first place. However, H. and I like to visit restaurants, parks, pubs, and such when we travel and take in the real local culture. I suggested that N. could go to museums on his own during the day but he rejected that suggestion so we've been stuck going with him everywhere. We have had two afternoons of doing what H. and I want, but I hate having to find consensus with N. on everything. It's very exhausting. Third, H. and I have a dietary restriction that N. does not have, and N. keeps insisting on going to restaurants that serve food without said restriction. The really annoying thing about this is that N. *could* eat our food, but just insists on going to restaurants with both options even though in practice that does not leave H., S., and I with many options on the menu. Fourth, H. is really mad at me for the circumstances surrounding my allowing N. to join us on the trip so we keep fighting in private. H. keeps asking me to stand my ground about things like restaurants, museums, and money, and getting frustrated when N. forces me to find consensus on those issues. 

I don't have any control over N. and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. We have one more week left of this. I feel like the vacation is ruined so far and I can't imagine the rest of this week going any better. What do I do? Is this hopeless?

**TLDR: Our neighbor tagged along on a family vacation. He is incredibly overbearing and oblivious, and is just ruining the vacation for everyone.**"
54,"I [25F] don’t want to pay for my future husband’s [26M] parent’s retirement. Is this a deal breaker?


 I considered posting this on r/personalfinance but at this stage I feel like I’d prefer advice from this sub as it’s more of an emotional issue.

My significant other \(AJ\) and I have been dating for 3 years and are serious and talking about engagement. We both grew up as only children and both of our mothers are about 40 years older than us. We come from different “classes”. His parents are working poor while I come from the lower middle class. To be very clear, I don’t care about having lots of money, but I dream of a day that I won’t be worried about money. 

AJ’s parents are nice people now. They have been nothing but kind to me. But they have a tumultuous background. BOTH of AJ’s parents come from very well\-off families. But they were free spirits when young, I am unsure if either of them graduated high school. They got into hard drugs. They were homeless for a while and were eventually taken back in by their parents and got clean. At some point throughout this AJ’s father went to jail for a few years, he has anger issues. AJ does not know what the crime was and his father won’t tell him. His parents chain smoke all day long, and are doing poorly from it. In fact his mother smoked while she was pregnant with AJ. His father has some other internal health issues. They live in an apartment and always have. His mom is a waitress, and his father a janitor. They don’t have savings, understandably. 

The other day **AJ’s father announced he was retiring this year**. Just done, no explanation, absolutely NO regard or plan about retirement or money. AJ immediately went into planning mode and tried to find a mobile home park where his parents could live more cheaply, but even that with buying/renting the land and mobile home was too expensive. He has tried to come up with other plans. Most involve him spending money/loans on buying them a living arrangement or potentially living with them.

AJ are I not well off. Although he has an engineering degree, and I just finished a job\-focused masters in a hard science both from a top 10 university… combined we make less than 70k a year. I already feel like giving up financially in our personal lives. We have student debt, and rent to stay near the city where our jobs are is the second most expensive rent in the country. Rent takes about 50&amp;#37; of our paychecks if not more. We are very frugal and I actually still have some savings because I worry about money so much. 

Long story short, I am worried as hell that if I agree to marry into AJ’s family that I will become financially responsible for his frankly irresponsible parents. His parents live in the same very expensive state as us.  We can barely afford to live ourselves let alone save to have our own home or family. I feel resentment that me and AJ worked hard and sacrificed and will end up paying for people who make poor health and life decisions \-even if we may love them. His parents may have made stupid decisions, but of course I wouldn’t want to put them on the street. Oh god I don’t want to have them move in with us either. And of course, if the tables turned and my parents needed help I’d want to help them \-which is hypocritical. 

I guess I am looking for advice on how I am thinking about this \-am I acting spoiled because I am from low\-middle class and not working\-poor class? Do I not realize I am being unreasonable? Should I be strong willed or flexible in discussing this financial opinion with a partner who is adamant about helping his parents? Do I pack my bags and cut my losses even though I love my significant other dearly? Any similar stories would also be appreciated. 

TL;DR: AJ’s parents are financially irresponsible and AJ wants to go 100&amp;#37; in on helping/housing them. We are poor/in debt and I don’t want to spend money on his parents. I want to hear other people’s stories and know if it is a deal breaker that we don’t agree on this before we get married. "
55,"My [35m] Son [8m] is about to go through his first Mother’s Day without his mom, looking for advice.


So long story short, my sons mom died about 7 months ago, we’ve been divorced since he was like 1, before he could ever remember us together... she and I got along well enough, I have (had) primary custody since the beginning.  In Oct ‘17 she passed away, accidentally, but not unexpectedly to those who knew her.  My son was mostly insulated from any of her issues, save for the last month of her life when it got bad.  

He’s doing amazingly well, all things considered.  He’s been going to play style therapy nearly weekly since it happened and occasionally some family talk therapy (which we’ve slowed down on as he wasn’t interested in it), and he’s very very open and communicative with me, most of the time.  The school has been fantastic too, his teacher all the way through the principal.  However sometimes he gets in funk and shuts down for an hour or two or you could just tell his brain / heart is still trying desperately to process what happened.   

It kills me to see him so sad and be so helpless to fix it. 

I’m super affectionate and playful (hugs, wrestling, frisbee, etc) and try to always be there whenever he needs to talk, and he does... random questions, about what she had been doing the last month to thoughts about spirituality and everything in between.  Personally, I’m not religious, in the slightest, but whatever gives him comfort at this time is fully endorsed by me.  He currently believes she was reincarnated into an eagle (his favorite animal).  I do my best to give honest, but age appropriate answers, or encourage him to process through “I feel weird” to try and dig out what’s really happening inside of him.  

He’s already told me he’s really “nervous” about Mother’s Day and knows he’s going to cry.  I, of course, told him that’s totally ok, and we can do whatever he wants that day, even if it’s “un-Mother’s day” like go to the movies or the park or whatever.  He expressed that he’s worried he might start crying in public.  I told him I’d have his back and swoop him out of any situation he felt uncomfortable in.  My plan is just take it minute by minute and just let him call the shots.  He hasn’t flat out lost it in public since about a week before Christmas, but there’s been times when it’s been close, or I can see something trigger him and he’s fighting tears.  

A slight twist is I am remarried, my now wife has been in my sons life since he was 3!  However she completely understands that we may just have to “scrub” Mother’s Day this year to help let him heal.  My son and wife are close, my wife is super involved, always has been, but my son stays a tad aloof with her, but always had, which I think was an influence of his mom.  However now I think there’s this pronounced loyalty to her (his mom) and he’s pulled back from my wife.  (We’re letting him just be himself, and only encouraging but never pushing or punishing)

I swear, honestly I wish I jump to like 15 years in the future and sit down with him and talk over a pizza and some beer and just know where I came up short and what he needed that I couldn’t see.  This kid is my world. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to just keep helping him through Mother’s Day and beyond?

I’d be really interested to hear from some people who’ve had the unfortunate experience of going through what my son is and what you wish your family knew that could have made a difference.  

Thanks

**TL;DR** My son is about to have his first mother's day since he lost his mom, how can I help make it better for him."
56,"Me (30F) and husband's (35M) parents (60s) staying in our home frequently, we're tired of being treated like a hotel.


My (30F) husband’s (35M) parents (60s M&amp;F) come to visit and stay in our town frequently. For the sake of avoiding redundancy, let’s call my husband T. We’ve been married 6 years this year, and if the parents had their way they would visit 2-3 weekends a month to see T’s nieces and nephews who live 15 minutes from our house.

When T’s brother got married, his wife set the boundary immediately that the parents would not stay in their home, even before they had children. Once they had children and before T and I started dating, T would have his parents stay in his house since he lived alone while they were in town to visit the grandchildren. Now that we’re married, his parents still expect to stay with us often, sometimes as frequent as every 3 weeks throughout the summer. I love my FIL; my MIL and I have a strained relationship due to severely conflicting personalities. She is very conscious of appearance and in the past has made both passive-aggressive and outright rude comments about our appearance, weight, health / diet needs and choices, our home and pets. There have been moments where she is very pleasant to spend time with, but over the last few years it has become very obvious that we are an afterthought to them both, as they’re only in town to see the grandchildren.

My in-laws are somewhat taxing guests to have; between using or taking our toiletries / groceries without replacing, saying they need a key so they can let themselves in and out whenever they want and expecting us to entertain them when they’re finished visiting the grandchildren, my relationship with them has become incredibly strained and exhausting. T sees this conflict and tries to be a shield for me to his parents, but that inevitably makes me feel terrible for not making effort to spend time with his family &amp; instead just being reclusive. I’ve talked with T about having a conversation with his parents about no longer staying with us, but he doesn’t want to tell them that out of fear of fracturing his relationship with them irreparably. 


Since I don’t want to force T to make a decision against his family, what else could we do to foster a better, healthier relationship with T’s parents?


tldr: husband's parents lack self-awareness and stay with us too often, it's causing strain in our relationship with them and we don't know how to set boundaries after 6+ years of being their hotel."
57,"[Update] Mom [66f] and bf [25m] of 3 years expect me [26f] to visit them every weekend, all weekend.


My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8fjwn0/mom_66f_and_bf_25m_of_3_years_expect_me_26f_to


I'm thankful to everyone who commented, you helped me stand my ground and do what I wanted. This is not a life changing update, just some small stuff.


So I wrote that post a week and a half ago, I read all of your comments and decided to stay at home.


I felt much more relaxed in the weekend because I didn't have to hurry everywhere. That was pretty awesome. Could be better because I had a job interview I was excited about and I was preparing for it part of the weekend (I'm trying to find a better job). I played video games and cleaned and relaxed :) My boyfriend didn't come to visit me in the weekend, but he visited me a couple days before the weekend, because we were having our anniversary.


My mom was sad for one day but didn't try to convince me to come, just said she's having a bad day. Then after that she had a great day, played the piano after a few years of not touching it, did a lot of errands and cleaning and ecen made food that I dislike and she loves. She half jokingly tried to convince me to come eat some tasty food she made, but of course I refused.


Btw about the suggestions of my mom visiting me, she doesn't drive and public transport is kinda horrible here. She could visit me of course but it's not easy for her in her age and with health problems she has.


My boyfriend didn't come over to my place on the weekend. He had a not-so-close-friend's birthday. He was kinda offended at first and said he doesn't understand me. He didn't pressure me to come. After a while he said I should do whatever I feel is right for me (not in a passive aggressivene like it sounds in text lol).


We had a talk about his plan for the future, which he thought about for a couple of days. His plan is to finish his university studies in 1-1.5 year and move in with me. If he doesn't finish or if he fails a course, even one, he told me he'll quit and that he has other options, much easier and faster to acheive than university, for alright paying jobs. I'm not going to write them here. It sounds possible to me. If that doesn't work out either, he said he'll just work at a simple job that doesn't have high requirements. I'm ok with that. I hope he will really make decisions according to this plan.


This weekend I'm going to Small Town. I miss my mom and my boyfriend. Next weekend I'll see what I feel like doing.


Thanks again to everyone!


TL;DR:


Stayed my first weekend away from bf and mom. Mom was fine, enjoyed her free weekend from me. Bf was offended at first but fine later. Told me his future plan for education/work."
58,"My [24F] boyfriend [27M] of a year told me yesterday that he will always be in love with his ex-girlfriend (who's also extended family), Do I break up with him over this?


Hi Reddit, me and my boyfriend just celebrated our first anniversary. Things haven't all been smooth but we love each other a lot. He is in city X \(for work\) and I am in city Y \(for work\) for about two months now. It's a 10\+ hours of flight to see each other, along with an expensive ticket. He made it a point to come see me asap and he came last week for the anniversary and he is staying for couple of weeks. 

I couldn't be more happy about that. I have been looking forward to it. However I noticed some things in his behavior. He gets annoyed with me really fast. Like we were taking a stroll in the city and I saw a public toilet and I asked him to wait while I use the loo, and he replied in an annoyed tone. I didn't understand why. We were getting snacks later and we sat on this particular table which was in a sunny and windy location and I asked him if we could switch to a less windy location \(less than 20 ft away\) and he responded ""sure love, we will do what you want"" in a really really annoyed tone. By now, I was walking on eggshells. I later lightly asked him if I am annoying cause he's been very annoyed lately and i told him the instances. He said he had been annoyed but very unnecessarily and that it has nothing to do with me. But even after that he didn't stop. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we were doing a grocery trip to the nearby shop and walking back and he starts humming this song and then proceeds to tell him how this was the song he danced with Clara \(let's say\) first and fell in love with her. 

\(Some background for Clara: She is a cousin's cousin, so not family in a traditional sense but extended family. When they were about 14 and met on a family get together, they had a crush on each other and because they were in different countries, they started staying in touch through hours long conversations and all that. But they grew up and drifted apart and nothing ever happened there. Later in 2014 or something, Clara also had a fling with my boyfriend's cousin. Now she's in relationship with this guy \(who I don't know much about except that my boyfriend doesn't know what Clara sees in him\). I have only met her once very briefly at a party. She is beautiful and comes from a very privileged background \(as my boyfriend's entire family\). After that brief encounter she added me on her insta so I keep seeing what she's upto. Boyfriend said that it was teenage love and there is nothing there so I never worried about it.\)

Cut to yesterday: so boyfriend says he danced with Clara and fell in love with her. I was a bit confused as to what am I supposed to say here so I just said ah yeah, you are gonna make a move on her as soon as he's single. Boyfriend says, ""I will always be in love with her"", I don't even know what to say to that, I try to play it off and say ""why are you with me then?"" he responds, ""Cause I love you more."" that was that. I didn't say anything after that. 

Later in the night he asked me what's up with me and I bring it up and he says he was only kidding and I am making a big deal out of nothing. He says ""She is very important to me and I care a lot about her but that's it."" I ask him if he has any feelings for her and he says he doesn't but then he proceeds to tell me that, he likes her a lot but he can't spend time with her cause there's all this tension. I ask him multiple times what kind of tension, he says sexual, emotional, all kinds. I don't even know what to say at this point, I say all of that? sounds like you have feelings for her but admitting that ruins your idea of what kind of a person you are, so you are in denial. He says they don't even talk at all. Only through Insta stories like twice a month and even then it's dry conversation, if I want he can show me. First I said no need to show me but then he keeps speaking about how he doesn't communicate with her in any inappropriate way so there's nothing, so I say okay so me. 

The last text she sent him was a heart. He says 'she sent it not me'. As we scroll up it's all hearts and kisses and him saying ""I miss you Clara, We need to meet soon"", her saying ""I will text you as soon as I am back in town"" and her saying "" I miss you"" and him saying ""then see me"" and ""haven't seen your face in a long time"" and him sending hearts and what not. I stop reading at this point I am so disappointed. \[However that was as ""inappropriate"" as it was\].  I just tell him I need to sleep I have work tomorrow. I know he wouldn't cheat on me but to me, it feels like him sending flirty text only means one thing that he is saying basically ""Clara, no matter who I am with, you will always be the one above any girl in my life"". 

He is then all like it didn't mean anything. He loves Me, and he sees his future with me and he would not prefer to be with anyone else no matter what. I tell him I need to think about what to do here because she's not going away as she's family and if I am okay with seeing her in family functions and knowing that this is the woman my boyfriend has a thing for. He says he doesn't. He will stop his behavior. I just need to tell him what to change and he's upset that's it's a whole thing now. I am like, you are a grown ass man I shouldn't be needing to tell you how to talk to other woman when you are in a mature relationship. Wtf?

I am not the kind of person who'd go for ""me or her"" approach. It's his life, he can give whatever place to whoever he wants. I shouldn't be telling him who to talk to and how to talk to. He is just going to resent me if I am the reason he cuts contact with her. He hasn't yet. Now he's offering but there's no way he means it. I think he is just scared to lose me. They have a tightly knit cousin's group and maybe soon every body will know that I am the reason he isn't talking to his puppy love Clara. I just don't want to be that person and I hate that he put me in this position. 

I don't know what to do here. Do I tell him to stop talking to her? Tell him it's Me or her? Or Do I walk away? I don't feel comfortable with the third option that ""to let it be"". To watch him have these deep feels for this other woman. Maybe I am over reacting. Please give me a perspective on this. 

TLDR: Boyfriend says he will be always be in love with his ex but later says he didn't mean it but somehow admits that he still has feelings for her. What do I do here?"
59,"Me [27f] with my husband's [28m] cousin [23?f]. My child ruined her dress by accident. Should I insist on paying for it despite her claiming she does not want me to?


Hi reddit! I have a problem regarding my husband's family. We attended a family gathering some time ago with our 3 year old daughter. Everybody tried to look nice and so my husband's younger cousin was wearing a cute dress that had two layers of fabric - the ""outer"" layer was all lace. Let's call the girl Lacey then.

Lacey is a very nice girl and she likes children a lot, so she quickly started playing with my daughter, but unfortunately at some point my child lost her balance while on Lacey's lap and grabbed the lace-part of the poor girl's dress, tearing it OFF at the knee lenght. The dress is ruined - since it's lace it's gonna be difficult to just sew the torn piece back and I don't think it will be easy to find new lace fabric with a similar color and pattern.

I apologized of course and immediately suggested that I either pay for a similar new one or take it to a tailor and pay for whatever he needs to fix it.

The girl flat out refuses to accept it. She's all flailing her arms around and saying that she was going to get rid of it anyway and that it's no big deal and ""come on [my daughter], let's make you a hat out of the torn piece"".

I even suggested to go shopping with her for a new one and paying, like a little bonding moment or whatever, but nope, not a chance. She just laughs and waves her arm like ""please just stop"".

I feel incredibly bad. Of course, accidents happen, but I am responsible for my child and therefore for any damage she's unwillingly causing. I know we don't have much money and most of it goes into the child's well-being, but Lacey ain't no millionaire herself and I've seen similar dresses lately for half of my country's minimum monthly wage. I doubt that Lacey had this exact one - she probably got something cheaper, but still it may have been quite expensive for our (mine and hers) standards.

I thought about simply putting some amount of money into an envelope and dropping it by her place, but 1) I don't want to force it onto her if she claims she doesn't want me to 2) How can I be sure that I put the right (not too small) amount of money if she won't tell me how much it costs?

She's a good girl, chances are she doesn't want to make me pay because she knows money is tight lately, but I have some savings and there are exactly for that kind of expenses - something gets broken or someone gets sick.

So, what should I do in this extremely awkward and guilt-inducing situation, please help Reddit.

**tl;dr a family member, who is a student with very little money of her own, won't let me pay for her dress that my small child accidentally ruined. I don't know what to do, I feel like I should pay for the damage.**"
60,"How do I [24m] deal with a girl friend [27F] who frequently asks for kind of favours and advice one should normally only ask from a SO?


In a pickle here. I have this girl friend, who is in a long distance relationship, and with who I have no intentions of becoming anything more than being just friends. Her boyfriend works in another town 100km away, and they only see each other during the weekends.

I think she is getting quite out of line- and I feel like she is morally cheating on her long distance boyfriend with me for the following reasons;

1) Constantly chatting and checking in with me on Facebook. Asking for advice normally one should ask only from an SO. Like- what to eat for dinner, what to wear, asking me for rides and ""date like"" meetings (Wants to go to the movies,concerts,theaters with me on work days etc.) She has even sent me a couple of pictures of her in her new lingerie asking my opinion of it....and it was, well very revealing. When she runs into problems, she starts complaining to me about it on Facebook, It gets really annoying;

2)The wierd part is, that Ive never actually met her boyfriend. I know they only see each other on the weekends and then she totally ghosts of me, as if she does not want her boyfriend to know about me and our weird friend level-relatsionship. She only talks to me on work days and quits talking to me Friday-Monday morning, until her boyfriend goes back to work. During the week, the chatting and checking in is constant, I feel like im in a relationship with her;

3) Hinting sex and then and quickly changes her mind. Last week I was chatting with her before bed time and she goes something like this- ""Im so loney, I just want to cuddle...you know what?"" Me- ""What?""....""You know, me and you we could cuddle."" Me- ""Eeeeee, you sure, I think it might feel very weird, like cuddleing my sister"". ""Never mind""....Wanted to go to sauna with me alone at her house...Its like she is probing me to see If im willing to sleep with her or not;

4) Asking me to come over to her house to help her with basic chores- like mowing her lawn, carry heavy bags of pellets for her, for food.

TL;DR I feel like she is using me as an emotional sponge and Im getting really tired of it. I like her as a friend and would like to keep it that way. But she is getting well over the line and I feel as if she is morally cheating on her boyfriend with me and I feel bad for the poor man. How can I make her stop behaving that way with me, while still enabling us being friends?

61,"I [29 m] just want my wife to have a good 30th birthday and I feel like I'm failing her as a husband


My amazing wife works her ass off for our 3 year old and I. In addition to that she watches her friends autistic 3 y.o.  son 6 days a week. Since she was a stay at home mom before this, they originally agreed on $3 per hour (incredibly low I know but they have been friends since they were 10 and she wanted to help her single mom friend).

 This is important because when this all started, it was only gonna be 3 days a week, so my wife would get to help her friend and bring a lil extra money in since we struggle on my single income.

 Her friends job lost a few servers and she has now been upped to 6 days a week. My wife doesn't like to make waves and she likes to contribute to the household but the amount of time she has to spend working to help a child with special needs is killing her mentally and physically and she's not even being compensated fairly for the work she's putting in. This is a separate conversation we need to have with the friend at some point, but its put my wife in a position where she feels like she cant care about herself. 

Her 30th birthday is in 2 days and I've tried asking her what she wants to do or eat or ANYTHING and she's been avoiding it. She doesn't want to do anything on her actual birthday cuz its a Thursday and she'll have to get up at 4 am on Friday for her friends kid to be dropped off. 

Her mom offered to sit for us on Saturday night so we could go out, but she doesn't want to do that cuz sunday is mothers day and she wants to wake up with our daughter on that day, because those moments are important to our kiddo. I understand that but I just wish she could think about what's important to her for one day.

 I've tried to talk to her about not forgetting her needs and that it's okay to think about herself one day of the year. She is just spread so thin and exhausted that she feels like she cant care about her own well being. 

I just feel like 30 is a big birthday and even tho she says she doesn't care and doesn't need or want anything or cant make it fit in her busy schedule, that I should be doing more to help try and work something out. 

Sorry if this is overly wordy, I just want to help her out and dont know what to do for her or what to get her to make sure she has something that makes her 30th memorable.

**tl:dr - My wife is going crazy with how chaotic life is and I want to help her have a good birthday**"
62,"My boyfriend [29 M] and I [21 F] are arguing because I told my friend [21 F] she should report her ex and all his friends for possession of child porn.



My friend Jess told me about how her ex had pushed her to pose nude when they were still together, and then after they broke up, spread her nudes around to his friends. That had happened years ago, but she was reminded of it because one of the guys from her high school made a gross joke about it recently. One that implied he and others still had the photos.

She mentioned that this happened in high school, and I asked about the specific ages. She said that she was 16 and he was 17 when they started dating, and when they broke up and he spread the photos around, she was 17 and he was 18. And the guys who he sent her nudes to ranged from 17 to 19 when it happened. 

(Now, everyone mentioned is 21 - 24 since this happened years ago) 

I asked her how she found out her nudes were shared, and apparently some of the guys who received them texted her at the time, harassing her. She also confronted her ex over text, and he admitted to sharing them in text. (She still has the old phone with those texts somewhere)

I said ""So your ex, as an adult, posessed and shared child porn? And the photos are still out there? You could go to the cops over that.""

She said that she wasn't sure if she wanted to dredge up her humiliating past again, it had made her last few years of high school awful and she wanted to be past it. Also she was worried she could be in trouble for having taken the photos in the first place. But she also kinda wanted to go to the police, she wanted closure.

I said that it was totally her choice, but if she needed help or support with anything, I was there for her.

She thanked me, and said that she'd think about the police report, but it wasn't something she was ready to jump into without more thought, and research, and consulting with a lawyer.

----

Afterwards, I was telling my boyfriend Tom about the situation, and he basically told me that my suggestion to report the ex and all his friends who have or once had the photos to the police was fucked up.

He said that the recipients didn't do anything wrong, and I said that some of them harassed her or spread the photos further. And if any of them really did just get the picture, then delete it and not say another word, they could say that to the judge.

Tom then said that it was so far in the past, they were all high school kids, and it would be shitty to destroy lives over it years later. 

I said that her ex boyfriend shared the photos after his 18th birthday, so in the eyes of the law, he was an adult. And some of the other high schoolers were also legal adults

We kept arguing about this for a while, and I got more and more disgusted how my boyfriend said stuff like ""If you take nudes, it's just a risk you run, that they get leaked.""

And he got more and more upset with me because I was willing to ""Destroy 10 or 15 people's lives because of something they did when they were kids."" And ""Sic the police on people""

In the end, I said that it wasn't my decision if a police report is made, it's Jess's choice. And I'd support her whatever she chose, I just wanted her to know her options.

----

Anyway, I can't stop thinking about the stuff Tom said about the situation. Maybe I'm way too protective of my friends (I've been called the mama bear of the group) but he just seemed so callous.

I honestly wouldn't shed a tear if Jess's ex and his friends went to court over this, I saw firsthand how hurt she was over it.

And I don't know how to work through things with Tom. I'm disgusted with his opinion on this, and I think he's upset with how ""vengeful"" I'm being.

----

TLDR - My friend told me that her high school ex shared nudes taken when she was 16. I suggested she report it to the police, and she's undecided. I had a huge argument with my boyfriend over whether it's wrong to report the ex and the photo recipients for possession of child porn.

63,"I [21F] broke up with partner [22M] after 2 years for stealing from me


I'm sure loads of others will have been in this position over the years, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others have done to try and get over this situation. I was with my partner for 2 years, and we got caught up in a fast romance that led to us moving in together and opening joint accounts etc. We were young but I really thought I'd found someone special and that he was 'the one'. I started noticing money disappear from our account, amounts that didn't ring alarm bells at first but when combined they were significant. He'd always say he'd take money out only for emergencies and bills, but our bills went unpaid for months without me realising. He never had a drug or drink problem, no interest in gambling, but loved to game and was spending our money on that.

He then lost his job due to not turning up on time too often, and kept that from me, leaving in the morning to pretend to go to work only to sneak back in after I left for work and game all day. I only found this out from a ridiculously huge iTunes bill that proved he was home buying music and movies on my card when he was supposedly at work. I confronted him about it and ended up in a huge argument over what to do about our relationship, and he promised to see a counsellor of some kind.

The counselling lasted 2 days. He then decided to take everything he owned out of our flat, and stole my purse and cards, while telling me I'd definitely taken my bag to work and must have lost it there. He was stupid enough to use my card at an ATM so his picture was saved and the horrible truth came out.

I've never felt so sick and used by someone I loved before, and beyond the shock and regret I really don't know what else to feel. I've given up trying to get the money back as it's now been over 6 months and even threatening legal action didn't lead to anything, and truthfully I don't want to get him into major trouble, despite being a thieving scumbag. How do I get over this?! It's severely jaded me and left me with a really cynical view of the world which I wish I didn't have, I just don't know how to deal with it.

tldr: partner stole from me for length of relationship, don't know how to get over it"
64,"My [22F] boyfriend [27M] told me his family and friends would always be more important than me


We’re out on vacation and yesterday night he was on his phone texting way too much. I got upset over it &amp; he said it’s his brothers wanting to know what’s going on, and said that I can’t make him stop texting them.

I said I should be more important since I’m with him right now &amp; he shouldn’t text. A huge argument ensued. Told me his brothers will ALWAYS come before me, or any future wife of his. Told me I can’t talk badly upon any of his friends because I supposedly can’t determine what is a brother and what isn’t to him, so his friends ALSO come before me.

We have been together 3 years. I have a family but I’m not close to them because they turned a blind eye towards my abuse by my late father. I love my mom but she never put me first, always my abusive father. for once I want someone to put me first. When I have a husband I will put him first before anyone else. 

I think him saying that was a deal breaker but he’s telling me I’m crazy for thinking that way, that I’m selfish and it’s not reasonable. I don’t know if he’s right or not, is he? He’s considered my best friend and my family but I’m not considered the same... 

**TLDR:** Boyfriend of 3 years told me I’ll never be as important to him as his brothers are, or his best friends are to him, even if we are married. I don’t like that but not sure if I’m being rational about it because I don’t know what having a family of being very close to a friend is like. "
65,"(Update) I (27/M) think my girlfriend (27/F) has settled for me. I'm thinking about breaking up. Thoughts?


Thanks for the advice last time guys. 

Orginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8h2ukq/i_27m_think_my_girlfriend_27f_has_settled_for_me/

So I decided to talk to my girlfriend about this. I ended up asking her about the guy what what went down during that time because I have been hearing rumors. At first she accused me of jealousy which I ignored and persisted. She eventually admitted something to the effect of it being a lot of fun and stuff and how she wanted to be with him but he broke her heart or something like that. She sort if have admitted evasively that would have preferred him over me but tried to back tract and say ""that she grew to love me"", ""that you make me feel comfortable, I did all those things for him because I didn't want him to leave "" etc.

I then asked if she wanted me to leave. She gave me a look and asked why I was saying that. I  pointed out that it seems like you aren't really invested in the relationship and how I put more effort in. I cited examples but she focused on the sex giving the whole ""entitlement"" speech (which wasn't the point). I said it was more about an over arcing trend and that I wanted to quit at this point. I suggested that maybe it's just that she didn't find me exciting which is fine and now she can find someone who does or at least makes her feel love or passion or something. 

She cried quite a bit (which exactly surprised me) saying that what he had was deeper than what she had for the guy. I told her that I think it's honestly for the best even if I wanted to stay. I told her that I can't be on the back burner and that after this it will always be in the back of my head. Worse my friends now know it as well and I'll look like a fool. I promptly left. 

So i broke up with her. I'm not mad at her and I don't blame her. She didn't want to be alone and settled with this relationship. Even though we broke up I wish her the best. 

Tl;dr:(Update) I (27/M) think my girlfriend (27/F) has settled for me. I'm thinking about breaking up. Thoughts?"
66,"My (25f) ex (25m) died. I no longer had him on social media, but did go to his wake and his family likes me and I talked to him on the phone until the very end. I reactivated my Instagram and found my old phone and have many pictures and some videos of him. Would it be weird to share them?


I have pictures and videos of my ex who died exactly a week ago (who was dating somebody else recently) and I was wondering if it would be either good or inappropriate to show them to his family and friends. His mom aunt and sister said they were glad to see me so his family was still on good terms with me despite him breaking up with me four years ago.

I miss him so much. He was also the best friend I have ever had and probably will ever have. My old phone also had voicemails from him and I miss hearing his voice and I keep replaying them. I’m heartbroken.

Tl;dr would it be inappropriate or a good thing to share pictures I have of my deceased ex maybe on Instagram or send them to his family on Facebook. Would they like to see these pictures and videos or would that be weird?"
67,"I [29F] dont like my BF [31M]'s cooking, he is a good cook, but we have opposite tastes, dating 7months.


I just don’t seem to like my boyfriends cooking: he is a good cook, we just have opposite tastes.


My boyfriend is amazing, he loves doing things for me, is very romantic and likes cooking too. I am a bit particular about food. I really hate anything with a black burn mark even if it’s not otherwise burned. The most I go to is a golden brown, he really likes that char-grilled taste. He likes the opposite vegetables as me (his favourite are carrots, they’re my least favourite) and we have different cooking styles (I dislike boiled/steamed vegetables and love stir fried or baked). He likes more watery soupy food (miso/pho), I like thick stews.


I come from very food focused family. I have really liked cooking together in previous relationships (ex and I had similar tastes and we both got a say and could alter things to our preference) but my current BF really likes being alone in the kitchen and serving me food. He doesn’t want to cook together – he thinks it’s easier for one person to do it, rather than get in each other’s way – it’s also a small kitchen.


Every time I try to even sit in the kitchen he ushers me out, I just want to flip things before they get charred so it’s at least bearable to me. He will say “I got this” if I suggest checking on something on the stove. He genuinely likes those flavours which I just don’t. I’ve spoken to him about what I like and I feel like only some of it seems to stick for a week or so and then It goes back to the same.


I don’t know how to fix this?


**tl:dr BF trying to be romantic by cooking for me, but his food makes me miserable.**

68,"Me [35 F] with my husband [35 M] 6 years, He never helps out and then wants to hang on me all the time.


We have known each other for 8 years, married for 6. We have a 3 year old and a just under 1 year old and we both work full time. He works 10 to 12 hours shifts 4 days a week and I work 8 to 4pm M- F. His work isn't really physically demanding but mine is moderately physically demanding. I teach a preschool class at an expensive private school. I have a bunch of two year olds on me all day. Because of my schedule I am also the primary care giver. I take the kids school in the morning ( we can't afford tuition at my private school so they go to one down the street), get them after work. Then home for play, dinner, bath and bed. I get hung on all day. Someone is constantly touching me or needing me to touch them all day -- guiding hands, shaking hands, other people's fluids on me, hugs, etc. It gets exhausting. It starts at 5/5:30am when the kids start waking up and doesn't end until my husband goes to sleep and I wiggle out of his arms and finally get to lay untouched on my side of the bed. 

My body doesn't feel like it belongs to me and it gets to me. Now I can't tell the kids not to hug mommy. And I don't want them to ever think I don't want to hug them because I always do. My problem lays with my husband who seems to demand to constantly have access to my body or needs to be touch from the time he gets home until he goes to bed. 

Example: I will be blow drying my hair after a shower and one comes in (usually my husband) and followed after him come the kids. And they all want my attention and my touches and to lay on my body. I just want a minute to finish my hair. 


It is the same when I take a shower or am sitting on the couch. The minute my arms are free here come three bodies wanting to lay on me.

It has gotten to the point where it is physically hurting me. I have to take medication for all the pain. My husband is not a small man and I am a small girl. 

I enjoy cuddles as much as the next person but to have someone constantly on you is exhausting. 

I can't even pee without three people rushing in. And my husband know better. I get my 1 year old doing it but I need my husband to help keep them away when I need to do things but he says they all just want to cuddle me. "" Can it not wait until after my shower, Jon?"" 

Anytime I say that he gets really hurt. He literally pouts but this is ridiculous. I cuddle them all the time. All the time. I just want to cook or use the restroom or blow dry my hair or watch a show without a grown man throwing himself on me all the time. 

I might be being a bit mean and I really need some perspective. I love that they love me so much but he (not the kids) has to give me some personal space here. He could cuddle the kids alone for a minute. I know he use to just having me to himself to cuddle whenever he wants but now he has to share my space with 2 other people and I only have so much space. 

I am also running into the problem of him not helping out with the kids. It ties into the cuddling thing. He can't be alone with them. If he is, they all 3 come find me. They can't sit and just watch a movie together while I make dinner. They have to be around me in the kitchen. He will come find me in the shower and the kids will follow. He will follow me to a room I am trying to clean and the kids will follow. I have to be with him with the kids at all time. I am trying to think of a time he spent time with the kids alone and the one time was when I was really really sick and the baby couldn't be around me so he put me in a room for 2 days and everyone left me alone. 

He refers to me when they want something too. ""Can I have a cookie?"" - says my 3 year old. "" Oh go ask mommy?"" Can he not make an executive decision regarding their care while I am indisposed? 

I am scared he is extremely co-dependent or maybe just scared to be alone with the kids? I don't know. He pretty much just looks defeated and deflated every time I bring it up. 

Don't get me started on the sexual affection he gives me. He grabs my breasts when he knows they hurt ( I just recently stopped breastfeeding/pumping), constantly touches my butt even when I doing something important. He once grabbed me at a park with kids around and bunch of other parents. I get he was trying to be playful but come on. Parks, disneyland, the grocery store. I can't escape his hands. He says he just wants me to feel appreciated but it doesn't make me feel appreciated at all. I feel like a toy for him or  a pillow. It isn't attractive when you are holding a little baby trying to wrangle a toddler for a grown ass man who isn't helping you to grab your butt in public.

A nightly routine will go like this:

I have kids on me all day

We come home at 5 and make dinner and play

He comes home at 6:30 and needs his ""decompression time"" until 7:30. ( I never get that) 

Kids go to bed

I clean and pack lunches

I sit on the couch for a minute to just breathe and he lumps over to me to ""cuddle"" with me (and usually fall asleep on me) for an hour

Then bed where he has to cuddle me again until he falls asleep

If I ask for any space to sleep whatsoever he gets his feelings hurt because I use to love to fall asleep holding each other. Then I feel the need to apologize and he makes pout faces all night because I must not love him. 


He also wants praise for every little thing he does around the house and with the kids. I asked him to call and make an appointment and he did which is great. In a response text I wrote thanks because I don't get a ton of time at work to text. He was so hurt that I hadn't thanked him more. When he takes out the trash it is like he needs  a medal. Getting him to do anything around the house is like pulling teeth. 

He was never like this before the kids. He was tidy and kept his own place, he wasn't so physically needy, he helped out, he didn't assault me in public spaces, he never pout faced like a child at me. 

I have tried talking to him about it but like I said he just pouts. How do you approach a grown man with a serious issue who pouts? His response is always"" you don't want me to love you."" 

I am physically exhausted. I am very close to leaving him because my body just cannot take it. I need my body back. If my husband would just back off a little bit and take some of the burden off me I could breathe and we could have real cuddle and intimate time where we could BOTH enjoy it. 

Can I explain that without sounding selfish? Also, should I keep praising him for doing stuff around the house? No one thanks me. "
69,"I'm [17f] a waitress and a lot of women are generally rude towards me. Today a girl accused me of flirting with her boyfriend. I'm lost


So for starters, no I wasn't flirting with her BF. In fact he wasn't even attractive to be worth flirting with. I'm very pissed off but I need an outsiders' perspective to know if I'm in the wrong.

I got a new job as a waitress and while I've met a lot of pleasant people, I've also met all around horrible ones. The rude behavior usually comes from women. I don't ""flirt"" because that's not my job, and because I'm not interested in doing that at work, and because I'm not dumb. Even if I WAS interested in a man I was serving, whether or not he was with his SO is irrelevant because I am at work and nothing would come out of it. Not to mention I'm fucking 17. 

But today a woman (girl? she looked young) approached me and told me that I should ""quit"" flirting with her BF, and that I was lucky she wasn't going to ""waste her time"" talking to management. I WASN'T FLIRTING WITH HIM, for God's sake. I attend everyone virtually the same way. I'm pleasant towards everyone. I actually tend to be slighly more open towards women. And like, if your BF is oogling a 17 year old, that's not my fault? I could put a transcript of the way I acted but I was definitely not flirting with him. I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone been in this situation before?

tl;dr: there are lots of women who are kind of rude or straight up unpleasant towards me at work, I don't know what to do anymore."
70,"I [23M] broke up with my GF [22F] of almost 7 years after she confessed making out with another man.


I previously wrote about my problem on this subreddit a few days ago but I deleted my old post because I was getting upset while re-reading what I wrote. I tought a lot and come to terms with myself and what happened.

My GF of almost 7 years cheated on me. She confessed pretty much immediately but that doesn't change anything. She made out with another man for minutes.

I thought she was the love of my life. I loved her to death. All my dreams are shattered. Our future kids, house, gone. Even our dogs name was decided. But she exchanged all of these 30 minutes of fun.

I broke up with her. I just had to. I STILL love her to death but I can't trust her anymore. I can't build a future with someone who I can't even trust anymore. Nothing can repair the damages of infidelity. I gave her my love, I've been always loyal and truthful. I did not deserve this.

The thing makes me so upset is, I also lost my best friend. We grew up together. Literally everything reminds me of her. She was my first love. She gave me my first ever kiss. We've done so many things for the first time together.

All I am trying to do right now is looking at the positives because that's the only thing I can do. I'm still young. We weren't married yet, had no shared assets, no kids etc. I'm just glad that I discovered what she's capable of, before things get more complicated.

Did I do the right thing right? Will the pain eventually go away?

TL;DR: I broke up with my cheating GF, now I'm trying to justify my decision make the pain go away."
71,"I (F22) can never hear my boyfriend (30)


I’m deaf...with a little ‘d’ not Deaf. So while I do have a lot of hearing loss I can still hear, and I don’t sign. 

My boyfriend is very softly spoken, and I often struggle to hear him. Usually I just ask him to repeat himself and it’s not a problem but we travelled away together recently and it proved to become quite an issue, for example, he told me to walk in one direction but then said something about himself having to walk around the other way, I misheard so walked the opposite direction and he got quite annoyed at me. Little things like that happened a few times and I just feel they could have been avoided if he’d just speak a bit louder and be more considerate of my deafness. I can’t wear traditional hearing aids btw but next year will be able to have consultations about cochlear implants. I feel like because I’m not visibly disabled he doesn’t really appreciate the impact it has on me. 

It may sound like a stupid question but how do I make him understand? I have asked him before to speak up but sadly it falls on deaf ears. Pardon the pun, it just makes me feel quite sad sometimes.

TLDR: I’m deaf, really struggle to hear my softly spoken bf and it’s very disheartening, I have asked him before to speak up but he doesn’t, how do I make him understand? "
72,"My (39M) in-laws (60s M&amp;F) have been extremely disrespectful to my fiancée (38F) and as such I do not want them seeing my kids/their grandkids (6M/8F). Am I going too far?


Apologies for the title gore. I’ll try and be succinct. 

My first wife died shortly after giving birth to our son. It was very unexpected and difficult, and her parents (she was their only child) were extremely helpful in the following years. I am forever indebted to them for their help during this time. I just refer to them as my in laws but I’m not sure if that term is appropriate anymore. 

Three years ago, my kids and I moved to a new city (away from the grandparents) for a new job. Our new city is ~3 hours away from the old one by train, so the grandparents still visit regularly (once/maybe twice per month). Soon after moving in, we met “Jenny”, our neighbor. Jenny welcomed us to the neighborhood, and my kids took to her very quickly. So did I. I dealt with a lot of guilt since I hadn’t seriously dated after my wife died but I worked through it with a therapist, and Jenny and I have been in a relationship for the last 8 months. We introduced this to the kids slowly, but they are obsessed with Jenny. She is amazing with them and will be the best stepmother. 

Visits with the grandparents have decreased in the last year or so because the kids’ grandma had a nasty fall, and I’m not able to take them up to our old city as frequently due to work. They are acquainted with Jenny, especially since my kids would incessantly talk about her, but they aren’t aware that we’ve been together and plan on getting married (not for a while, it’ll be a longer engagement). It was Grandpa’s birthday this past weekend, and so we went up. I wanted Jenny to come with but she wasn’t able to due to work. After the party I broke the news to the grandparents and they basically lost their shit. My MIL was sobbing, asking how I could do this to her daughter, my FIL said that Jenny would never be a real mother to my kids because she doesn’t look like them (Jenny and me/my kids are different races), she looks like a thug because of her tattoos/piercings (ironically Jenny is an attorney), just on and on. I was furious and immediately left with the kids. 

I spoke to Jenny about this and while she’s upset she doesn’t want to be the reason why the kids don’t see their grandparents. I am disgusted by their behavior and don’t want them in my kids life if they will espouse such hateful behavior. Please help and apologies for rambling, I’m a little shaken still. 

TL;dr My dead wife’s parents have been incredibly disrespectful/racist to my fiancée and I don’t want them to see my kids if they’ll behave like that"
73,"We [14-18s] are being blamed for the break up of our sister [22f]. How to stop feeling guilty?


14m, 16m, 18f and 7f . My big sister's boyfriend was driving us home a few nights ago when he started getting into a fight with our sister (over the phone). I [14m] don't really know what they were arguing about but it was something about another man. We've never seen him get that hysterical, usually he's a very calm person and doesn't yell. But he was yelling, cursing, and driving all crazy. Our little sister started crying because of it and that only made him more irritated. Eventually, he said, ""oh, you want to see what will happen huh?"". He pulled to the side of the highway and told us to get out. As stupid as it was at this point we were all scared so we got out with no argument. Then he left.

We were walking on the side of the highway at night. We were calling our sister and mom, but no-one was answering. About maybe 15 minutes later our sister called us back. When she found out what happened, she was beyond pissed. She came and picked us up and dropped us off, then left. The next day we woke up to chaos. Our sister called us and told us sorry, and that we don't have to worry about him again. But for some reason some members of our family are blaming us, saying that we caused their breakup. That we should have handled ourselves and not stir up more issues. We are really confused as to what we did wrong. They really liked our sister and her bf as a couple and are devastated. I don't know how to stop feeling guilty about this? 

**tl;dr**: Sister's bf threw us out the car and sister broke up with him. How to not feel guilty"
74,"I (34F) am jealous of my SIL (31F of 10 years) and want her life


I (34F) got pregnant very young with my now husband (34M) after we had been dating only a very short time. We had really rough years at first. I didn’t do any baby announcements. We eloped at the courthouse when our son was 4. We told everyone in our Christmas cards that year. I feel like nothing has been made special in our life to share with friends and family.

I can’t complain because I have a good job, my relationship with my husband is good now, and we have a great son. 

My SIL (31F) is the complete opposite. She had the most beautiful and expensive perfect wedding. Her bridal shower was perfect. She recently sent out announcements that she is pregnant. She has beautiful pictures of herself pregnant. I only have one picture of me pregnant because life was so insane for me during that time. 

I know I should be happy for her but I look at my life and I want hers. I want to go back in time and get married first with a beautiful wedding. Then I want to have a planned child and share the joy with everyone instead of people asking me if I was going to have an abortion or do adoption. 

How do I get over this? 

Tldr: my SIL has the perfect life and I wish my life had been like hers. I don’t know how to get over being jealous. I really love her and want to be so happy for her. "
75,"Me (35M) with my wife (33/F), being married to her is affecting my career and my life. I am numb to all this.


TL;DR: My wife has done multiple things that have caused my work life to be far more difficult than it should be.
_______________

I've been married close to 8 years to my wife and have a 3 year old daughter. 

This morning, when leaving for work, she got mad at me for because she wanted to discuss getting a new puppy for me. I had to leave for work and told her I couldn't talk right now and had to get out of the door. 

My wife has a hair trigger when she gets upset. This has lead to arrests, multiple stays in psych wards, and a complete alienation from her family. This started about 1.5 years ago. While she is getting help for her anger, it's not sticking with her. 

Today, she just tossed hot coffee all over me. It was surprising, but I guess not unexpected. Burned me pretty good. This caused me to be late for work because of her outburst as I had to change clothes. This is the 3rd time in 4 months she has done something to cause friction at work. Today was the first time in my career I've been written up and I got chewed out by my boss for being late to an important morning meeting. 

I don't know why I'm even writing this. I'm not going to do anything about it. I have no more backbone to stand up to her. My wife is well taken care of and clearly doesn't care about her actions having consequences. I'll just keep taking her back because my daughter loves her. I guess I just need to write all this down so I can advance my day forward. 

Cautionary tale y'all. Red flags were evident before we got married. Those red flags are now serious situations with a kid involved. To anyone who is in their 20s and reading this....if you are seeing major red flags in your partner (everyone is to blame for their problems, anger over little things, physical abuse etc.), please don't ignore them like I did. 

Male or female, it doesn't matter. I know you think you'll be able to fix them when you are in your 20's, but it's probably going to get a lot worse. "
76,"Me (38M) and my wife (37F) let her brother (27M) stay over 6 months ago and men with guns broke into our home and beat him up because he owed them money. Now he is homeless again and my wife wants to let him stay, I say absolutely not, she is mad at me.


6 months ago, my wifes brother stayed at our home. He was down on his luck. He also involved himself with my wifes families business, which was mostly crime related. After 5 days of letting him stay, men broke into our home, holding me and my wife at gunpoint and asked where he was, when he came from the basement where he was staying, they beat the shit out of him horribly. It was overall a traumatizing experience for all of us. We kicked her brother out right away. I didn't fully understand what the men were saying because they spoke in Russian, but the brother told us in the hospital he owed them money. We told the cops everything to no avail, never caught the guys. 

Fast forward to 2 nights ago. He says he has nowhere to stay again. He calls us and asks if he can stay for a few days, I said ABSOLUTELY NOT. My wife however wanted him to come, saying she feels bad for him, and that he isn't a bad guy, and that he is family and all this shit. I told her over and over again, last time this happened, men with guns broke into our home to find him. If he is homeless, that's on him, I am not risking my life like this for some bullshit that he is involved in. We argued constantly, and she ended with saying that I am prejudiced against Russians, and that I view them all as criminals and that just because her family is fucked up does not mean he is. For one, he is APART OF HER FAMILY, not just by blood, but by business and all that. He's been to jail 3 times, once for a year, for all that bullshit. I kept saying it has nothing to do with him or her or her family being Russian, it has to do with the fact that I don't want some gangster in my house especially considering he has a history of bringing armed men into our home just so they can beat the shit out of him. 

I seriously cannot comprehend how this isn't getting through to her. I get she was raised in a... different environment, where maybe this stuff is just everyday, casual stuff to her, but it isn't to me, and it isn't to most people. This isn't the first time we have had problems like this, she seems to let absolutely everything go. Her dad brought a fucking prostitute to dinner, he was wasted out of his mind, and smacked her in the face one time in front of us, my wife acted like it was not that big of a deal. Her other brother has like 10 fucking illegal guns in his house, she just laughs it off and jokes around when he gets a new one as if its a new toy. Her cousin? We went to dinner with them when he emigrated here a while back, he was doing cocaine in front of his 17 year old son, and smacked him around a bit. Once again, my wife barely flinches, all of that? Totally normal stuff to her. 

I get she comes from a fucked up family and a fucked up country and these things might seem normal to her. But we aren't there anymore, and I am not apart of her family in that way. She almost looks down on people who live sheltered lives and don't experience that stuff. Sometimes when I say how fucked up that shit is, she just smiles and says ""thats just how it is, you won't ever get it"". 

I've been married to my wife for 13 years. I love her, more than anything. Its wild how its been 13 years and I still am wildly in love with her almost like the first week we met. I've been with her long enough to know that we are a good match and I really do love everything about her... except this. This specifically freaks me out. It always has. How casual she is about these things. We don't see her family THAT often but like... how can you be okay with this shit? 

And like, I am okay with her being okay with that shit to an extent. Except this specific situation involves me, and our home, and her brother staying here is out of the fucking question after last time. 

what do I do? How do I get over this argument? I mean, her brother staying here is NOT HAPPENING, but how do I get her to understand WHY its not happening? 

TL;DR - - Wifes brother stayed here 6 months ago which resulted in men breaking in and holding us at gunpoint. Now she wants him to stay over again. "
77,"My (14/F) daughter is turning into me. (32/M) I don't want her too.


And I don't know how to help her. I don't want her to be like me. I'm a HS dropout that ruined his life. I struggle everyday to get by. I don't want her to be me.

Ever since she started 9th grade she's been acting outwards. Her grades are slipping, she's been in trouble at school and even alienated her old friends. It gets worse as i've caught her sneaking out late at night to go ""party"". The cherry on top was me catching her getting physical with her stoner (drug addict possibly criminal) ""guy friend"". I honestly don't know what to do. I swore I'd never let her become me, I'd raise her right like what my Parents never did.

I often said she was the only good thing I've done in this World. She wasmy Precious;my jewel. She was so sweet and caring she would ride her bike to my work after School just to wait for me to get off. We did everything together, ride bikes around town, talked. Where did I go wrong? I expected her to rebel a little during these years but, not like this.

I'm not just being an overbearing dad. This is the same shit i did as a kid. She's my spitting image from looks, to personality. I don't know what to do. My Parents are no use, they were against me ever raising her in the first place. If it were up to them they'd of given her up for adoption.

I'm at my end. I love her so much but, don't want to see her fall into this pit i did. She has a chance, I never did.

**tl;dr**

Daughter is following in my footsteps and becoming me. "
78,"My wife [34f] and I [36m] are having a fundamental disagreement about religion because our son [6] wants to go to Mass


My wife and I are both Jewish. I am a non practicing secular Jew (after spending years as a practicing Jew) and my wife falls somewhere between reform and conservative. When we got married I agreed to raise the children Jewish and we both respected and were at peace with our respective religious commitments/convictions. 

We have 2 kids, a 6 year old boy and 4 year old girl.

Our son is really good friends with a boy who lives down the street whose family are practicing Catholics. We all get along well, and the boys spend a lot of time together.

Earlier this year, we invited the family over for Passover Seder. They seemed to have a really good time, and said they would love to come next year. 

When it was time for Easter this year, they asked if they could take our son to mass, and then to what is apparently an amazing egg hunt. We said of course, and our son went and had a great time.

Such a good time, in fact, that our son said he wanted to go to mass again because “the building is pretty and the songs are pretty”. 

And this is where my wife and I are in disagreement. 

My wife thinks we should start going to synagogue more instead (we go for Shabbat maybe once a month or so and to a couple Saturday services for bar and bat mitzvahs) - but when we asked our son if he’d instead like going to synagogue, he said it wasn’t as nice.

Personally, I don’t care if he goes to mass. Their church is objectively more beautiful (I love stained glass) and I’ve heard the choir is pretty incredible. 

Contrast that to our synagogue which is in a pretty run down building and smells like a retirement home. 

I mean, I kinda get it. Our son understands that he is “jewish”, and I’m not really getting the sense that he wants to be Catholic - I think he honestly just enjoys the service and spending more time with his friend. 

My wife has basically said this is a red line for her, and that she is thinking maybe the boys shouldn’t be spending so much time together.

She also has now said we should start eating 100% kosher in and out of the house, and I saw on some open browsers she’s looking into Jewish day schools. 

We’ve talked endlessly in circles about this, but it keeps coming back to this intense fear (or shame?) that our son would renounce his heritage...

This just all seems to be an intense overreaction to some childhood curiosity, but I think it is important we don’t ruin our sons friendship. What’s the best way to navigate this mess?

Tl;dr: Jewish son wants to go to mass with friend because the church is pretty and the songs are nice, wife is now having a personal crisis of faith.

79,"My [40 F] sister [29 F] who has an intellectual disability, no job, and no independence is pregnant.


My sister has an IQ of about 55, history of mental illness, and lives with our mom [69 F] because she can't live on her own.  My mom is a deadbeat who is about to keel over from self-inflicted medical conditions due to a lifetime of not taking care of herself.  She was a terrible mother to me (I was taken out of her custody when I was 8, fortunately) and has been a terrible mother to my sister.  They both live entirely off of public assistance because neither of them work (my mom has hardly ever worked in her whole life).  

I have a terminal degree, a successful business, and a family of my own.  My husband and I are comfortable financially and have long-term investments.  There has always been an expectation that I would help my sister once our mom dies given that she can't really take care of herself, and my husband and I have always planned to do this (to some extent), but now she's pregnant and planning on keeping the baby.  I know that somehow I'm going to be made to feel financially responsible for this.  My mom is always trying to guilt me into taking care of both of them financially, and I was happy to commit to helping my sister (once our mom dies), but I feel like this is too much and not my responsibility.  How can my sister take care of a child when she can't take care of herself, and why should I be expected to take care of both of them?  

They live together in a cat-infested hoarder's paradise - the air inside their apartment is so acrid with cat stink that I can't even go inside; the other day we drove my mom to vote and I nearly vomited because she smelled strongly like a cat litter box (her odor has been getting worse and worse).  My husband has offered to help them clean their apartment so that their landlord can rip out the carpets and put down linoleum, but I know my mom, and because this would require her also putting forth some effort, I don't foresee this ever happening (she is a hoarder, to boot, and a massive purge will need to take place to even reach the floor).  If the awful living conditions persist (and they likely will), my husband said he will have to call child protective services on them (I'm not opposed to this).  I've offered to arrange to have friends who've been on both sides of the open adoption process talk to my sister, but I haven't actually talked to my sister in months, and though I relayed the message through our mom, I suspect my mom is encouraging my sister to keep the baby (they'd get more allowance for housing and food stamps, etc.) and probably never even told her that I'd made this offer.

I guess my question is, what do I do?  I've made it clear to my mom that I will not help financially (she's already asked us to build an addition on our house for my sister and her baby), but her assurance means nothing - I know they're going to be knocking on our door looking for money.  What do I do when our mom dies (which seriously could be any moment)?  How can I be figuratively - not literally - supportive of my sister, especially knowing that she can provide nothing but a life of misery for this child?

tl;dr - My sister is incapable of living on her own but is having a baby, lives with my mom who is a mooching deadbeat, in deplorable conditions unfit for a baby. I fully expect them to ask me to help out financially even though I've said I won't, because I have my own family to take care of."
