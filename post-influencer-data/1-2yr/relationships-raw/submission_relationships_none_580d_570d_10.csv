4,"My mom [63F] is mad at me [21F] for losing ""too much"" weight.


Hi all,

About 1.5 years ago, my weight topped off at 170 pounds. I am a 5'0 female, and that's just not healthy. 

I have since lost 41 pounds and am at a happy and healthy 129 pounds. My resting heartrate and blood pressure are perfect, I'm not sore anymore, etc. All good stuff. 

The issue is that my mother will not stop pushing me to gain it all back. She frequently says things like ""You look sick."" ""I can see your collarbone too much."" ""You look terrible because you're too skinny."" 

This is the first time in my life that I love how I look. I'm tired of her knocking me down for being healthy. I eat a healthy amount every day, and my doctor has no complaints. 

How do I tell my mom to back off with this? 

Tl;dr: I lost a lot of weight and my mom bullies me about it. How do I handle this? 

Edit: WOW this got busy. I will get back to all of you who have asked questions as soon as I can. Thanks to all who have replied, as well as to all who have congratulated me on the weight loss. I appreciate it! :) "

6,"My [27/F] sister [19/F] brings her baby [6wks/M] everywhere; she's upset that bringing her baby to laser tag was a disaster


To begin, we have *all* offered my sister childcare. We've pooled our money to get her a sitter, we've offered to stay home and watch her son. We have done everything in our power, and she throws a fit each time and says we're just trying to isolate her baby. I get it, new baby rabies is a total thing, but she has no limits. Even her boyfriend will offer to stay home with their baby, and she'll *insist* it's ""child abuse"" to leave a young baby home without it's mother. And it's not like we force her to come, either. We'll say we'll miss her, and she'll be all, ""Oh no, I'm coming!""

I got my tiny rant out of the way. My sister had a baby 6 weeks ago with her boyfriend of a year. They met at college, and they both go to school nearby enough that I see them often. Recently, a couple of family members about my same age were in town, and we all wanted to go play laser tag, as is family tradition. The place we go is loud, it's in a mega-arcade. There's kids running around, screaming, lots of bright light and flashing light. My boyfriend has a 2 year old daughter, and I would *not* bring her there, and I don't think I'd bring any child of mine there until they're at least 3-4. It's just so much stimulus to me. Also, there's no where to put your kid. At least one person would have to stay out to hold the baby, and we articulated this very plainly to my overenthusiastic sister, under *no* false assumption we'd be watching her baby. We told her about how loud and bright it would be, how there would be no where to leave her son. My mom offered to watch the baby. We offered to pay for a sitter. And she insisted. Almost immediately, it was overwhelming her baby and she was complaining about how bad the noise would be for his ears. She sat outside in her car, and only came back in when we texted her that we were going to start playing. She demanded that one of us hold her baby while she played, and when none of us obliged, she got upset and stormed out.

We all got a text later on saying that we don't appreciate ""the struggle of motherhood"" enough, and that none of us care about her or her son. I've been in my boyfriend's daughter's life since she was a few months old, and she calls me her Mama and I call her my daughter. I think I know the struggle. When she was 9 months old, we went to play laser tag when family was in town, and she got left with a sitter. I don't find any excuse for my sister, honestly. I get the age gap between 6 weeks and 9 months, but it's the same principle. That baby couldn't handle it, but she brought him anyways and has the audacity to be mad at us about it. It's been this way ever since she had her baby. She brings him everywhere. It's just so frustrating to me. How do I casually tell her to stop bringing her baby places? We have other stuff planned this week, and if she brings her son, I'm going to flip my lid. I don't think there's a lot of places she can bring a baby that young to- we're going to the movies, museums, going skiing. But we're happy to hang out with him at home. We just don't want him freezing his little butt off on the slopes. Even when we express this to her, she still just brings him. How can we get the point across without freezing her or her son out? We don't want to be the asshole family members that make him feel unloved and unwanted by family. We just don't want him being dragged along to places he doesn't need to be taken to.

TL;DR: My sister keeps bringing her baby to everything we do, even to our family laser tag. It made her mad that he was upset and we didn't want to watch him instead of playing."

8,"[UPDATE] I (18F) am holding a grudge against my older brother (23M) and don't know how to get over it.


Original Post found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ttb0i/i_18f_am_holding_a_grudge_against_my_older/

I met with my brother yesterday after school.  We met at a diner about 20 minutes out of town.  I can't go much further than that as my parents check my gas usage and get suspicious if I use too much.  It was a mix of awkward and emotional to say it best.  He was really jumpy and insisted he sit where he could see the doors at all times.  We had a long discussion about why he left, how I felt, and how I wanted it to change.  There was a lot of stuff going on in the house that I didn't know about that caused him to make the decision to leave.  We had a pretty steady conversation, lots to talk about including him graduating college and me getting ready to graduate high school.  We both agreed that the other is taller than we remember.  

There was one point where a car pulled into the parking lot that looked a lot like our parents old one and he got really quiet and tense.  When I told him that a few years ago that car had been totaled in a crash and our parents had a new one he demanded to know what the new one looked like.  We talked about ways I was saving and plans of how to move out after high school.  He only stuck around for a little over 30 minutes before he had to leave, he didn't like being too close to our hometown.  

We're planning to get together again in a couple weeks, somewhere further away from where I/our parents live so we can talk longer.  He made me promise not to write down a time or date or anything so our parents won't accidentally find it.  He seemed like he was doing okay and he was overjoyed I contacted him back and wanted to meet.  It's gonna take a while until we start getting close to where our relationship was but it's getting there and I'm glad he's back in my life.  I can't tell my parents (obviously) or many of my friends in case it gets back to my parents somehow, I don't want to put him in danger.  So I figured I'd tell you guys!  Thanks for all the tips and love, you guys are amazing.

  ---   
  **Tl;dr**: You guys pushed me to meet up with my brother after 7 years and I'm so happy I listened.  We're planning more times to meet up and it's going to be slow but so nice to have him back in my life again.  Thank you r/relationships !"

11,"My mom [53F] and my sister [15F] got in an argument this morning and then my mom started sobbing and screaming


I [20F] woke up at 6 am.  Around 7 am my sister [15F] came downstairs and started arguing with my mom about taking her to get her drivers permit. They argued for a while and my mom was angry that my sister had cut herself on Saturday like she used to do, so she told my sister she should just be an anorexic if she wants to hurt herself because that would be better. My sister was understandably very offended and yelled some more. My mom said she liked that when my older sister had an eating disorder she kept it quiet. My mom also had an eating disorder. Then she left for school.

My dad [50sM] came downstairs and started taking to my mom who said she thought my little sister is bossing everyone around and being rude and demanding. My dad said I was probably listening at the top of the stairs and my mom said she knew and didn't care. My mom said me and my sister are ""running the house"" and ""unnapreciative"" and ""privileged."" I was sent to a psychiatric hospital in December because I tried to jump off a bridge and before that I told my dad I wish he would say something to my mom about her behavior and the things she says.  My dad did more than that, and literally repeated the exact things I said about how *I* wish he would say something to my mom instead of just correcting her.  This infuriated my mother.  My mom was also angry I was lying about secretly going to therapy.

What I was talking about was that my mom sometimes acted in upsetting ways to me and I'm not sure so deserved it.  Examples:

* One time my mom took me to a restaurant for final exams when I was 18 and I said ""I'm coming"" with too much sass in my voice I suppose, so my mom started ranting that she was tired of me, telling me I'm ""mean, rude and nasty"", called me a bitch, and said she couldn't believe I'm her daughter.  Inside she called me a freak when I wouldn't stop crying and then left me crying eating my food. She came back to get me after a while. I know this makes it sound like I'm some demon child, but I wasn't purposefully being rude to my mom and even if I was it seems a bit like overkill.

* Another time in eighth grade I had a panic attack about going to school so my mom screamed at me to get up and forced me into the car and as I cried on the way to school my mom kept saying over and over again how I'm ""going to shoot up a school"" and ""knows I'm the next school shooter.""

I have lots more examples and even if I did something wrong I think it's probably not okay to do that to other people.  I have many more examples and am kind of traumatized by these numerous incidents.

So that's the kind of stuff I meant.  My mom started sobbing and screaming about how she was this close to just leaving and couldn't take it anymore.  My dad came in my room and sat with me in silence and tried to hug me.  I know this makes me sound like a terrible person but so promise I'm not and mainly just keep to myself. Also, a lot of people seem to like me okay and support me.

What should I do to fix this?

Tl;dr: My mom was screaming and sobbing she couldn't take it anymore after arguing my sister

14,"Me [21 M] with my wife [21 F] 3 years, I think she cheated on me last night.


I'm not doing great right now so I will just jump right in.

I've been with my wife for roughly 6 years, married for 3 of those. She has always been the type I would describe as ""fiercely loyal."" Which is why I'm having such a hard time coming to terms with what I believe is happening.

Whether she cheated on me or not, I've known something was up for a few weeks. I know her better than anybody and I'm very good at reading people in general. I pick up on slight personality changes very easily. Onto the story:

It started a few weeks ago when she started hanging out with one of my best friends [21 M] (We can call him Mark). We live in the same apartment complex with him and his wife [22 F]. When they would meet up, it would typically just be the two of them over at his apartment. I know some people aren't comfortable with letting their SO be alone with members of the opposite sex, (or at least where I'm from) but I honestly didn't mind because like I said fiercely loyal and I didn't feel like I ever had anything to worry about.

The first thing that tipped me off was when she started getting secretive. I started noticing she was always texting someone, which in and of itself isn't out of the ordinary because she makes at-home appointments with her clients. But what tipped me off was her body language while she was texting: very reserved and almost always facing towards me so I couldn't see the phone.

To preface this next part, her iPad is linked with her iPhone so everything she gets shows up on both, including texts. Now I want to say I have never snooped and I don't agree with it. I think constant snooping with no reason other than paranoia is bad for a relationship in the long run. But I noticed some texts coming from Mark and they were definitely not things appropriate between two married people. But this alone isn't enough to convince me anything happened. They weren't sexting per say, just talking about sexual topics. (If it will help, I can go into more detail about this.)

At this point I think she realized I was onto her (whatever it is she's up to), because that's when all texts from him stopped. But I knew they were still in contact because she would still tell me of conversations they had while not together. I found out they have been using snap chat's chatting feature to talk. And I have no way of knowing what they are talking about or anything because snap chat deletes everything after you read it (I think. I don't really know how snap chat works other than sending pictures and chatting, and even then, I rarely use it).

Ok so all of this has been happening but I still didn't think anything happened between them. I trusted her and yeah maybe some of it was inappropriate, but we have a very open relationship and are extremely honest with each other. I figured if anything would have happened that would give me cause to worry, she would have told me. And then yesterday happened. We both worked until 8 last night and then after she got off work she headed over to Mark's place.

Note: She has a good alibi, I've seen texts from Mark's wife inviting her over. So I know that his wife was, at the very least, in the apartment when she went over.

Now at this point I have given up on my no-snooping rule because something is definitely up. So I started going through everything I could last night to try and figure this out. I ended up going through our google account history and that's when I saw it.

A bunch of google searches basically saying: 

""bleeding after being fingered"" 

I DIDN'T FUCKING FINGER HER LAST NIGHT. We haven't had sex in weeks. Mostly because we really are both busy people but even when I tried to initiate over the last week she kinda just blew me off.

This morning I checked the history again and there were more searches about it ""i got fingered last night and got scratched and its still bleeding.""

Now I haven't said anything to her. I'm sure she knows something is up with me, she can read me just as well as I can read her. And out of the blue this morning she says that she was doing a salt scrub (she's an Esthetician so this isn't out of the ordinary.) and it scratched her. I never broached the subject or gave her any reason to think that I know, so she told me this of her own volition. The weirdest thing about this morning and the only reason I'm still trying to hold on to trusting her, is that she acted perfectly normal this morning. She was lovey-dovey and sweet and it makes me want to thing that this is all in my head and I'm crazy.

Guys I don't know what to believe anymore. I so badly want to give her the benefit of the doubt and believe her, but at this point I don't know what's real and I don't have any solid proof that anything happened. And I don't know how to bring it up to her because at this point she can just deny everything and then I'm the bad guy for not trusting her.

I really just need some advice on how to handle this situation. I never thought I'd be dealing with this because of the amount of trust we have had in each other through out our marriage.


edit: I feel like I should clear this up. The only way she was masturbating, was if it was at Mark's house. She went straight over there after she got off work last night and I was with her after she got home until she went to work the next day. And I didn't sleep last night so she didn't do it in the middle of the night either.

At this point I am just waiting for her to get home from work. I still haven't decided how I'm going to confront her, but it's definitely happening tonight.

edit 2: Still waiting for her to get home. But I do need to say that I really would be absolutely floored if Mark's wife had anything to do with it. Anything is possible, but I feel like I know them pretty well. (But then again I thought the same about my wife, so who the fuck knows). My honest guess as to what happened is that the wife invited her over, but as it got late, went to bed and left my wife and Mark alone. But there's only one way to find out. I'll try and give an update after it's over.

2 years ago we were 2 months into the relationship and I was curious of the challenges that would be placed in front of us due to our age gap. Since then there hasn't been any real issues on that front. **She wants children, as do I**, and that comes with a time limit for healthy children due to her age. 

After a while of living in separate apartments and the constant want to be with each other it became awkward for me to be at my place on my couch and her to be at hers. Of course this feeling crept between us only a few months after she signed a 12 month lease on a small 1br1ba apartment. So we stuck it out for the remainder of her lease by staying at each other's places and working it out. 
 
  
  It was the end of June last year when **we moved in with each other**. It took a while to a hang of our schedule and the responsibilities around the apartment, but we have since figured it out. The longer we lived together, the more frequent the hints came about getting married, so on **December 9th 2017 I happily popped the question**. I couldn't imagine my life without her. She is such an amazing person. I know she will make a great wife and an even better mother. 
 
   

Our wedding is scheduled for August of this year. Since, she is so clever and a planner, she wants to have a baby in the beginning of her summer break from teaching in the high school. So doing the math backwards leads us to **getting knocked up before the end of the year**. I love it. I can't wait to have a baby with her and spend the rest of our lives together.

 Thank you /r/relationships for the sage advice. 

TL;DR: 2 years ago /r/relationships gave great advice about dating someone older and it paid off. We are getting married in August and couldn't be happier. "

The first post didn't get much attention but i'd like to update - who doesn't love updates, ya'll. 
Anyway, Moon and I broke up. 
Its painful and confusing. I still don't understand half of it. Moon continued to insist that I'm an abusive partner - unable to define the relationship further. Unable to say what it is i am (or am not ) doing. In the weeks since the first post (and months since she told me) I have read books on the subject, tried to talk to her, but never seemed to get anywhere. Things only became steadily worse and my life began to teeter on eggshells; every nice/kind/thoughtful action on my end was met with scepticism as this was proof in the eyes of Moon to my manipulative nature. 
Any wrongdoing was regarded as proof of my abusive nature. 

We've broken up now and i'm still digging relentlessly though sources and the past to find the abuse. I almost wish i could see some. I have been seeing a psyche who continues to suggest the abuse is not there. 

I know this post is not so much about the conclusion of Toe - but something may come of that. who knows. 

Moon is distraught, broken and believes it to be real. I don't want to discredit her experience but between this and her previously terrible mental health, I am now very concerned for her, namely her mental well-being and sanity. 

I find myself, now flicking between concern and anger, for being labelled as such among our peers in engineering. 

I do not mean to reject any blame for the situation - perhaps i'm just blind to potential evils that iv'e committed.

  tl;dr : We broke up at her insistence that i'm an abuser. still trying to work it all out. I hope she's okay. "
21,"Me [25F] with my boyfriend[27M] of 2 years; broke my laptop and won't replace it unless it's with a non-Apple model.


First of all, I'm very much aware that some people aren't fans of Apple products. That's fine, that's dandy, that's their decision to make. I, however, prefer them. I don't tend to use my laptop for more than writing, email, research and surfing the internet. The most important features to me about a laptop is that it's easy to take with me on the go, is familiar for me to use, and can synch with my other devices (especially when I'm writing while traveling and need a quick way to get my iPhone/iPad/Macbook to share information with one another seamlessly). It's what I'm used to, it's what I prefer.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, hates Apple products. He says it's because of the 'hive mind' mentality its users have, and how nothing is customization, etc. They all seem like really superficial reasons, but he feels very strongly about it and complains often.

This past weekend (Sunday night), he broke my Macbook Pro. It had been sitting, open, on the counter in my kitchen when he came by to pick me up for dinner and a night out. I went upstairs to change, and from my room I heard him let out a shout, followed by a crash. 

Apparently, he'd been leaning over to read an article I had pulled up on the screen, and accidentally knocked over his glass of water so that it spilled into the keyboard. In his panic, he swung his arm to try and knock the glass away before it spilled, hit the laptop instead, and knocked it to the ground. I'll be able to rescue things from my hard drive, but the screen is fucked and there has definitely been a significant amount of water damage. I'll have to replace it.

Immediately, he offered to replace the laptop...with anything other than an Apple product. It's definitely not a case of money, since the option he pulled up to show me was more expensive than just replacing the model of mine that he ruined. In the moment, I told him thank you but no thank you; I have some savings that I can use and, if worse comes to worst, I can take advantage of a payment plan through Apple. I have excellent credit and no debts other than some low-balance student loans.

This was when he started getting over-the-top annoyed about it: bemoaning about how I would rather 'go into debt' than let him help me, asking why I wouldn't finally switch away from an Apple device now that 'fate stepped in'. It's been a few days, and he won't get off my case about it even though I feel like I should be the one worked up here as I'm the one who lost a rather expensive computer that meant a lot to me.

Am I being unreasonable here? How can I get him to back off and stop complaining, without making him feel like I'm rejecting his offer to help right his mistake? I've already told him that it's my laptop so it's my choice and that I'm happy to replace it without his help, but this is the only thing he's talked about for days and it's grating on me.

24,"Me [40 M] with my wife [30 F] 6 years married....social media is ruining our lives


We have been married for a little over 5 years with 2 year old daughter. This happens every Valentines day (or any occasion where presents are involved..Christmas, birthdays...etc).

I work for a tech company, an engineer, very practical and laser focus on goals in life. My wife is all about looks and social media, it is more important to her to post what presents she got from me than about the occasion itself or the good times we have during these occasions. 

In the beginning of our marriage she noticed that I don't pay much attention to gifts and gifting in general, to me a Valentine/Birthday is about the time we spend together, where she is the complete opposite. To her an occasion is the presents (and how expensive) these presents are.

I have been trying to be more mindful of her likes, and started getting flowers and presents on birthdays and valentines, but she is never satisfied.

On the day before her birthday she starts asking, ""what surprises are you preparing for me tomorrow? look what my friends husband got her for her birthday on facebook. Look at the candles he lit...etc"" These remarks always get on my nerves although I always expressed to her that I don't want to ever hear about her friends social life....she never listens.

Last night I finished work at 7pm, rushed to the store and got her flowers and a 200$ ear rings....I wanted the rings to be a surprise for today, and gave her the flowers last night...she thought that the flowers were the only thing I am gifting her so she complained, she started sending me pictures on my movie what all her friends are getting for their Valentine.....I could have given her the ear rings, but this whole thing felt wrong....what should I always prove to her my love with materialistic things? Why I always have the feeling that in case I couldn't gift her anything she would turn my night into hell???? Why do I feel that I have to ""buy"" peace of mind and love from her with gifts and surprises?

I understand that she is coming from a wealthy family who are used to gift their kids on every occasion...but that is not me...and I have been trying!! 

In the first years of marriage her reaction to not getting her anything on Valentine was ""even one rose would be enough....just to feel loved"".....now a full dozen of roses are not enough, and she wouldn't even wait till Valentine day to see if I got her anything....

She always says that her dream husband would have filled her life with surprises and gifts, and that she did not expect to live this kind of ""practical"" life....She says these thing last night, but then this morning she asks what surprises I have for her today!!!!!!!

There are so many issues in our marriage because of our incompatibility....but I am trying to hold strong and compromise only because I want my daughter to have a normal life and not split between divorced parents.

please advice me what to do....I am at the verge of breaking up...we did not have a child I would have split a long time ago.

---------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: Coincidentally after I read so many comments on this thread I got a call from my wife and it went like this:

Her: So what surprises are you preparing for me tonight.

Me: What are your expectations?

Her: Well, I am expecting that you would go to the mall and surprise me with a gift from my favorite store (channel).

Me: Well how about I gift you something that I prepare myself, something I would actually spend time doing that shows you what you mean to me?

Her: like what?

Me: Well maybe cook up dinner tonight and light candles, you dont have to do anything.

Her: Well can't you do both? The gift from my fav store and the dinner?

Me: But why it matters to you if I get an expensive gift or not? Just to post for your friends on FB?

Her: Well, all my friends are posting pictures what they got on Valentines day and yes I want to post what I will get.

Me: But does it really matter that much to you showing others what gifts you got? Doesnt it matter more to you that we spend good time together and that I do something specially for you that doesnt have to be expensive?

Her: Well, friends...facebook.... 

(at this point I lost my mind and asked to end the conversation since I needed to get back to work.)

-----------------------------------
UPDATE 3:

It is really really unfortunate how things turned out tonight. I am writing this and my heart is breaking down because I am finally realizing that there is no solution to this but divorce.

I had already bought ear rings for 200$ but hid them from her. And I also got her a shirt (just like her gift for me). She first said that the gift doesnt matter anymore and that she would love for us ti cuddle and hug. I did like that very much and was about to tell her that I really got her a gift....but she promptly started telling me what her friends on facebook got for Valentines day and on and on and on.....so I stopped her and told her that we are cuddling and this should be our time together and not talk about other people.....but she started crying and asked me why I did not get her something nicer and pricey......so I started telling her things I picked from this thread...""why would she equate materialism with happiness"" ""why does she care so much about impressing other people in facebook...etc"" but she kept saying that this is her and I should know her by now that she only likes expensive gifts as a token of love. The scene became so dramatic with her saying that her parents offered to send her a gift because she expected that I wont get her anything....she then decided to get off bed and sleep in another room but I kept asking her to stay and just focus on ourselves for just 10 minutes without talking about others and their gifts....she refused but then suddenly said ""are you willing to give me 500$ in cash now""?.....I was shocked....Is this my wife that is asking for money or a fucking slut that I picked from the street that will stay in bed only if she got paid!!!!!!!

I got very frustrated and asked her to leave the bed....she started crying and sobbing and all that because I did not get her a nice gift for Valentine!!!! are you fucking kidding me????

I said fuck it, let me give her the gift...so I did....

She smiled, wore the rings and said they look beautiful...she did not say thanks but just left the room....I followed her and she then said...it is amazing that these ear rings are so beautiful but still cheap....I was WTF??? she said, yes they look 90$ or something....i told her they are 200$...so her smile got bigger and hugged me saying ""my god thank you so much"". I honestly felt like a jerk, that I made the worst decision of my life marrying this human. I looked at my daughter sleeping and died inside knowing that the days ahead will be so tough on her.

I appreciate everyones advice for me trying to get therapy which I honestly considered. But after what happened tonight, this person I can never live with....someone who values people based on how they dress...or value love based on how much you gift. I am talking to a lawyer tomorrow.

29,"[UPDATE] I [M28] was told I was touchy with a girl by male friend while girls disagree


[so couple days ago I posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7wou6f/i_m28_was_told_i_was_touchy_with_a_girl_by_male/)

I decided to follow everybody advice and not dwell on it and just be more cautious in general.

I brought my issue to another girl in our group causally, regarding my behavior as me being touchy or something  (I did while we were messaging and shit talking about our jobs/coworkers and said something that coworker hinted that me being touchy )and she said she never found me creepy or doing anything unappropriate at all.

I felt much better thanks for reddit and confirmation of some of my friends.

Anyway today my friends wanted to schedule a trip which I declined as I'm busy with work and basically crunch time in the company I work with.

seconds after I said I can't come, my phone started ringing and it was my friend who told me that I was being touchy.

He talked that I been withdrawn the last couple of days and when we hanged out last time (the time he told me about being touchy) and asked me if something happening at work or my personal life.

I said since he told me I was being touchy I felt guilty and I have been replaying all my interaction with all my friends who are 
girls trying to know which one did I screwed my interaction with.

He basically told me I won't as it is in my nature as a sensitive person, and kept talking about how I'm liked by our group and time where I don't have time to hangout they ask about me, and nobody had complained about my behaviour at all.

this time I wanted to press him for info, I  wanted a direct example of who I made uncomfortable and why.

He assured me nobody complained at all, and for my actions he became vague again, I pressed him again and he said in general like ""shaking hands"".

the word handshake kinda set me off as I don't linger my handshake and it is pretty normal.

When I wanted him to clarify what he is talking about regarding my hand shake.

he said the following:
""You are like my little brother and I care about you, I was like you, casual in my interaction and I got told off by woman for doing what you were doing and it is better to come from me, because it was real shock when woman said that to me, there are women who don't like to be touched""

At this moment I was kinda speechless, I said ""Okay dude I get you, thanks for looking out for me, I would be more cautious from now on""

and I hung up.

So I guess Reddit was true, I'm pretty sure there was nobody complained and he said so himself and all of that is coming from him and him sensing that girls being uncomfortable.

Just wanted to update to say that You were right reddit.
 
**TL:DR: There was no girl and my friend got  reprimanded for doing what he thinks is the same thing that I do so he told is better to comes from him instead of a girl**"

33,"My [26 M] girlfriend [26F] is considering breaking up with me because I don't go out with her friends


My girlfriend and I have been living together for 3 years, because we both found a job in the same city, and as both of us had to move there anyway, we decided to move together. It has been wonderful, we really enjoy our time together, and we have had very few problems regarding living together. 

I don’t really like what you would consider “usual Saturday night plans”: going to a club or a disco to drink and dance. I would rather watch a movie, play board games or just talk with my friends in somebody’s house. My girlfriend is not really into that, and she usually goes out with her friends (from work). This has never been an issue for me, we spend a lot of time together during the week, and I thought it wasn’t a problem for her either: she told me multiple times that she preferred this kind of relationship that the type where you’re doing everything together. 

I want to be clear: even when I don’t have a plan, I don’t go out with her friends, it is not about choosing between my friends and hers. If I have nothing to do and she asks me if I want to come with her to a club, I decline. I’m introverted and I don’t like meeting new people, and I really struggle to make new friends and enjoy my time in those situations. 

So, after almost 3 years of this, she told me last week that she was having doubts about our relationship. She told me that she enjoys our time together, but that she really wants me to go out with her friends and to socialize more. She didn’t ask me straight to change, because that wouldn’t have been fair, but she thought I had to know how she felt. I didn’t know what to do, so I asked my parents (they are no longer together, btw). 

My mother told me that I’m just like my father (regarding going out and socializing) and that was the reason they broke up: because she felt alone and thought my father was being selfish. She told to make an effort for my girlfriend if I really wanted to stay with her, that there’s always one partner that loves the other more, and that I had to try to make her happy and enjoy doing so, because that is what relationships are about: making your loved one happy. I told her I was not sure about it, but she told me to at least try to see if it works out. 

With this in mind, I talked with my girlfriend and I told her I would try to go out with her friends more, and she was really happy about it. It’s not 100% solved, but we were almost guaranteed to break up before that, and now it seems we’re fine.

The day after, I talked with my father, and he told me the exact opposite: that two people only have to be together if they both enjoy how the other person is, and that there’s no point in trying to force yourself into something you’re not, because it won’t last. Both my parents are remarried with other people, btw. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I know they both have a point. I know you need to try to make your partner happy and that you can’t be self-centred all the time. I also know you need to be yourself and your partner need to be happy with that. 

So, what should I do, reddit? Am I being selfish? Am I making a mistake by trying to change my behaviour for her?

37,"My (33m) oldest sister (37f) ignored my little sister's existence (18f) all her life and it is destroying my family.



English is not my first language.

My family consists of my oldest sister (37f), myself (33m), twin sister (33f) and little sister (18f) and parents (60s f/m).

When we were teenagers, my mother told us she was pregnant. It was a surprise pregnancy but my parents were happy. We weren't but my twin and I accepted it. My oldest sister never did. 

My oldest sister said she would never consider the baby a part of the family, because my parents were ruining their lives (not being able to travel or enjoy their life like they planned) and they wouldn't be able to help us financially in college and they would also have economical difficulties. The house was already small and the baby added noise and chaos to a very difficult situation.

We all move out eventually and most of us learn to love our little sister. She grew up like an only child with the house to herself and a better economy like we did. My twin and I have an excellent relationship with my little sister but my oldest sister doesn't even acknowledge her existence.

My oldest sister doesn't come to my little sister's birthday, have her blocked in Facebook and social media and when she comes to my parent's  home, she doesn't even say hello to my little sister. 

My little sister always tried to get my older sister attention, since she was little and my older sister rejected her everytime.

My little sister invited my oldest sister to her graduation through my parents. My older sister told them she doesn't consider her family and they need to get over it. My little sister cried when she found out and ran away briefly. My older sister reacted telling them she is tired of the spoiled brat.

My oldest sister got married and invited us all to the wedding, except the little sister. The oldest sister has a child that my little sister doesn't know and the list goes on. 

My twin sister and I want to cut contact with my oldest sister, since she hurts our little sister too much. My parents don't agree and are fighting to keep the family together. I think my oldest sister needs to go away with her poison.

TL;DR Oldest sister hates little sister. We want to cut contact with the oldest. Is it wrong? What should we do?"
38,"My (28F) strictly plutonic friend (early 30’sM) sent me horrible text messages and now I want him out of my life and need help politely unaccepting an invitation to his wedding


About a week ago, my friend (we’ll call him Chris) sent me the following text messages 


Chris - “you out whoring around or at home?” 9:57pm

Chris - “out slutting I guess” 10:09pm

Me - “home! Was working and now I’m about to go to bed! (Side eye/eye roll emoji)” 10:12pm

Chris - “night off from whoring.....very good.” 10:12pm

Me - “uh, it was one night of “whoring” out of months of none.” 10:13pm

Chris- “[my name]. You are the definition of a whore. Accept it.” 10:13pm

Me - “that’s not very nice.” 10:14pm

Chris- “I know. You should stop doing it. Lol” 10:14pm

Me - “wtf” 10:14pm

Chris - “seriously!” 10:15pm

Chris - “it’s like you lost respect for yourself. It hit me today. You deserve better than [ex fiance] and [other guy I very very very occasionally see, haven’t seen him in 18 months] and all these guys that are just using you.” 10:17pm

Me - “that’s enough” 10:18pm

Chris - “stop it!” 10:19pm

Chris - “I want you to be happy kid.” 10:19pm

Chris - “you need to be married with babies and all” 10:20pm



The “one night of whoring” was (I thought a joke at first) a dinner date I went on with my ex fiancé. We are still good friends and, um......., enjoy each other’s company from time to time. I’ve literally been on three dates in the last four months, each with said ex fiancé. 


I am the first to admit this guy has always had a crush on me. He has hit on me and tried to get me to agree to have sex with him more times than I can count and I should have ended the friendship years ago (we’ve been friends for about 6 years). He even went as far as to pull his cock out in front of me (while we were alone in my house) to try to convince me by “showing [me] what [I am] missing.” 


I grew up in a narcissist household and so my boundary enforcement has been lacking in the past but I’ve been in therapy for the past several months and I have a shiny shiny new spine. Those boundaries are now solid! 


My friend got engaged a few months ago and I accepted his and his fiancé’s wedding invitation. I was actually a little relieved because i *hoped* his blatant sexual harassment would stop. As you can see from above, it did not. 


I have to “work” with this guy at a volunteer organization we are both involved in so I don’t really want to cause any drama or anything between him and his fiancé. I just don’t want him to be a part of my life anymore. 


Since those text messages he has reached out twice with phone call (unanswered &amp; no voicemail) and a couple of texts basically wondering why I won’t respond. One saying “are you still pissy at me?” And the last, and my favorite, “Whatever. I just tell it like it is.” 


No apology. No nothing. Just him justifying his behavior. 


So, Reddit, what is the politest way to get the fuck out of going to their wedding? Coward it out and text him the day before saying “sorry, I’m so sick! Cough. Cough!” And send a gift? Send a hand written card apologizing for a family scheduling conflict and send a gift? Send the fiancé a dozen balloons with the transcript of her fiancé’s texts and a peace sign?


Tl;dr - my friend was in inexcusable Asshole and I need help getting out of going to his wedding politely.



Ok - edited to add: I am not, and never was, worried about hurting *his* feelings.  “Polite” seemed to be confused with kindness towards him. Nah. All about making my life as easy as possible moving forward while not causing any waste on their wedding’s part. (And, my mother deeply ingrained etiquette, I received and RSVP’d yes to a wedding invitation, I’m pretty sure even if I had died and hadn’t been able to attend my ghost’s one act of haunting would be to send them a gift. Well, specifically *her* a gift. Fuck my ex- friend)


I am on the fence about sending her the messages. I think it is *the correct thing* to do,  it I’m not sure about it being *the right thing*. Or maybe those are backwards. Regardless, my stomach gremlin is telling me to be carful doing that. However, my stomach gremlin also decided *this* was where to draw the line. Not him showing me his cock, not him pulling me into his lap and not letting me up until I “really deeply kissed him to see if I could really not feel anything,” not any of the 10 million times he’s asked me to screw him “just to see what it’s like.” It’s clearly a defective gremlin.


The volunteer org I am a part of is about 30,000 people all in the same city and our big event is all next month, both of them are on my team and there is literally no way I could avoid both of them if I tried. Which is the main factor my insistence of “polite.” However, their wedding is 3/24, so I need to decide quickly. 


As of right now I am leaning towards a hand written card wishing them the best, resending my acceptance, and never ever speaking to him again. "

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 13 months now and as a joke, she put up an ad on craigslist to sell her used underwear. She goes out and meets these guys alone and gets cash for it. I'm not particularly comfortable with the whole thing and I worry for her safety especially after reading some of the messages that she has shown me.

The other night I confronted her on it telling her that I wasn't comfortable with it and we got into a lowkey argument that ended with her basically saying she doesn't like doing it but the money is nice and so I told her that if she wanted to continue doing it I wanted to be there in the area just in case something goes wrong which she agreed to.

The next day, two days ago as of writing this, we made a drop off. I'm still pretty uncomfortable but I got to be there so at least I was a little bit at ease knowing that she was a little safer. However, today in the evening it turns out another guy wants to make a buy which I have class during and she agrees to go. I tell her that I'm not comfortable with it and ask her about our agreement that we made just three days ago but it is almost like that agreement didn't happen and she is changing it to most of the transactions rather than all. I'm not sure what I should do, she says she doesn't like doing it and if I tell her to stop directly she will but I'm not sure if I should let it continue or not. 

And now to top it off, one of her clients is offering to be her sugar daddy. He offered to pay for anything for her even tuition for school, which currently is already covered. He said there wouldn't be any sexual interactions involved just hanging out and back rubs and maybe cuddling. He didn't go into super big detail but it seems like she is considering it since it could be a lot of money and there wouldn't be anything sexual involved but I feel like this guy is not telling the whole truth on the matter. I don't want to come off as controlling but this is really off-putting to me and I'm not sure what to do.

With the underwear selling, I left off the weird fetishes that some of the guys ask for added on to it. 

edit: The ""weird fetishes"" part was asked about and so as quick edit, one guy who has become a ""regular"" asks for her poop in a container and pays like $150 just for that, one asked about period blood, a couple have asked about panties being worn for over a month constantly, and then many for socks. These are the ones off the top of my head.

45,"My [29F] husband [30M] says that I need tone down the way I speak (""intellectually"") around his family [10-80M/F], because they think I'm a snob. Is this reasonable and if so, how do I do this?


To start, I really don't think that I am an overly pretentious communicator. I'm not someone who will say ""in a fortnight"" when ""in two weeks"" will do. I will try to write this question as close to my typical manner of speech as possible, though admittedly I am a bit self-conscious now.


My husband and I come from two completely different backgrounds. I was raised by two highly educated, socioeconomically advantaged, white collar executives who spoke to me like an adult from a young age and expected me to follow suit. I more or less did. In almost every way, this has been a boon to my life, both academically and socially. College and grad school were godsends.


However, my husband's critique is actually not the first time that I've been given a hard time about speaking beyond my years. The last time was when I was 13 and the kids called me ""Big Word [Name]"" because I used the word ""ostentatious"" in a presentation about Liberace (don't ask). Kids get too much credit for their creativity, honestly. But I feel like I should add that since maybe it indicates that it's not coming from completely out of left field.


So, on the other hand, my husband comes from a poorer background and many of his family members don't even have high school diplomas. I feel like I shouldn't even have to say this, but many of them are wonderful people who I have good relationships with (or at least I thought I did). 

Until recently, I always felt embraced and loved,  and tried to be as loving back to them...until I found out that I had been cut out of the family group text. I asked my husband what the hell was going on and he told me that they feel like I'm a snob because of how I speak to them.

I've certainly never intended to come across like I think I'm better than them and even more certainly don't feel this way, but this the reality of the situation, I guess. Apparently, his family feels like they are playing The Vocabulary Game when they're with me and get frustrated trying to ""keep up."" They think that I changed my husband and I'm trying to make him ""white"" (so yes, there are cultural issues at play, but not ESL). 

I'm hurt, but my husband says that if I just make an effort to show that I can ""flex"" and speak more plainly, then they'll get over this insecurity. When I asked how I could do this without being condescending, he got defensive and said that I obviously don't know how to ""code-switch,"" which is key to interacting with his family. But when I asked for more concrete examples of how to change, he couldn't really answer. 

Honestly, I'm kind of flummoxed because it feels totally out of the blue and I'm not even sure that how I speak *can* be toned down (I hesitate to say ""dumbed down,"" but that's also how it kind of feels?)

Except that I've gotten this kind of critique before. By young teenagers, sure, but it's been said nonetheless.

Any thoughts or words of wisdom appreciated. Is this reasonable? If so, how the hell do I go about it? I've come a long way with social awkwardness and I feel like that kid standing in front of my peers, unknowingly giving them fodder to mock me all over again.


  ---

50,"My [29M] wife [28F] changed her mind about going back to work after giving birth


Basically what it says in the title. My wife and I have been married for three years, together for nine. She gave birth to our first son two months ago. After he was born I was able to take 2 weeks paid leave and she was planning on taking 12. The plan was for her to go back to work and our son's time would be split between her mom and daycare during the work day. From the time that we started talking about having kids, we were in agreement that we’d both work. 

On Monday, my wife told me that she doesn’t want to go back to work. She wants to be a stay at home mom at least until our kids (our hope is to have two eventually) are in elementary school. 

I was kind of blindsided though maybe I shouldn’t have been, since she has never LOVED her job or been particularly ambitious. Prior to baby, she liked her job okay, but admitted she wouldn’t do it if she didn’t need the money. 

Financially we could afford her to stop working but it would be a definite hit, which makes me nervous when we just added the huge expense of a new baby. I also never pictured myself being the sole provider for a family, with kids and a stay at home mom taking care of everything in the house. My family growing up wasn’t like that at all. 

I know that a lot of women have to go back to work before they’re ready and I don’t want to do that to my wife when we don’t need her to survive. But finances and the HUGE change in what I was expecting make me really really nervous to agree. I basically told my wife this when she brought it up and said I needed to think about it. She hasn’t said anything directly but has mentioned what a great day she and our son have had every day this week. Admittedly, this makes me feel kinda left out, even though I do a lot when I’m at home. 

I've thought about agreeing to her taking off a year and revisiting the question as a middle ground (I’d be a lot more comfortable with that than agreeing to her not working until both kids are in school, which could be like, 8-10 years depending on when we have number two) but I’m worried that we’d just stay where we were at that point out of habit. Is there another solution I’m not thinking of? Do I just need to get over myself and agree?

52,"My [25F] boyfriend [30M] wants me to name our baby after him if we have a boy as it's his family tradition, how do I tell him no?


Our baby is due in 2 months and we don't know the gender. At this point I'm really hoping we have a girl just to avoid any baby name conflict! 

My partner (who we will call Will before this gets really confusing) really wants us to name our baby William if we have a boy. This is because it's one of those names that's passed father to son in their family and has done since the dawn of time. Seriously, they have been doing this since the 1800s as far as we can trace back. The only issue is... William is also my own family's 'boy name'. Sit back and take this in guys...

Partner and his dad are called William. Partner's both grandpas were called William. Partner's cousin is called William. Partner has a separate uncle William too. AND: My brother is called William. So was my own Grandpa. And two of my cousins. And my uncle. Oh yeah, and my brother William also called his son the same, so my nephew is a William too.

That is a shit tonne of Williams already and that isn't even all of them. I have already had to tell my partner Will that I can't bring myself to say his name during sex even though he requests it because well... that's my brother's name. Weird. Now he wants our son to be called William too? I've already tried saying no because, well, there are already far too many Williams to a point where we need to describe them as 'brother William' 'uncle William upstate' and 'grandpa William with the labrador'. It's ridiculous. 

My partner says that although he can see why I have misgivings that he really does want to honour his family tradition in passing the name father to son and that it means a lot to his family. He really doesn't want to be the one to break this, and won't settle for William as a middle name even. I explained that his brother could also call his baby William but he just says it's not the same. I even suggested we could have a variation (Will, Liam etc) but he says if we're going to do that we may as well go the whole way and still keep his legal name as William.

My partner's face glows with absolute pride and excitement whenever he speaks about naming our baby this if we have a boy but... this is my first born child and I wanted to pick something unique so that he doesn't just blend into the family William soup that's going on here. Plus to be honest the name doesn't really appeal to me. Sorry if any Williams are out there reading this. What do I do?

I didn't intend to spend the night at my boyfriend's place last night. It was a long miserable day topped off by losing my key to get into my house at work, and there's nothing I can do until the morning short of breaking my own window. I know I should have hidden a key. I've heard it 5 times so far from different people. 

My boyfriend let me stay the night at his place. It was a fun evening with him and his daughter. His daughter knows we're dating or as much as a 2 year old can understand. She's almost 3 in April. I think she thinks I'm a special friend to her dad. She and I met each other for the first time in December of 2017. My boyfriend was anxious about having me sleep over when she was there. We normally do it on Friday and Saturday when she goes to her grandparents. The mum is not in the picture. 

In the middle of the night we were woken up to crying and her calling for my boyfriend. She had a nightmare about a big hairy monster in the garden. She said she wanted to sleep with her dad in his bed. I opted to take the guest room because I felt a little weird about sleeping in the same bed as his daughter. He seemed fine with it. 

I'm wondering how to handle things like this in the future, because he did say I could sleep with them. Did I handle this right? And how do I become more comfortable with this?

56,"Me [39 M] with my wife [34 F] of 10 years, she wants me to forgive her friend's alcoholic husband


My wife's good friend has a husband who recently stopped drinking. He went to a brief rehab and is now 30 days sober or something like that.

My wife wants me to forgive and forget all the inappropriate things he did when he was drinking. More specifically, he spent a ton of time trying to get my wife in bed. He would say things to her and about her. He had friends who did the same. He would make serious propositions. He would also ask stupid favors that were sexual but also ridiculous.

I decided to avoid him a long time ago, at least 3 years ago, because of this. My wife chose to ignore it all or laugh it off to maintain her friendship with his wife. I avoided him for my mental health and also to keep from becoming violent with him.

For everyone, it was excused that he was a drunk. He did a lot of stupid things and it was all chalked up to that. He said things occasionally to other women, but my wife seemed to be the constant target. I think this is because she spoke to her friend, this guy's wife, about a rough patch we had 5 years ago and her brief temptation to see another man. She didn't do this but I believe it gave the wrong idea to him and his friends. His wife seems to have always thought that I am the problem, that I judge him unfairly and that if he's after my wife it's not his fault.

Now that this guy has been sober for a brief time, my wife wants me to bury the hatchet, start hanging out with him and pretend like it all never happened. First, I don't want to. Second, I think he'll be drunk again before long. I am not saying I want him to fail, but I assume he will and I am not ready to just forgive and forget.

Am I being unreasonable in assuming I should just keep avoiding him? Can I remain distant permanently even if he does pull it off? Or is there some point that passes when I should say, ""okay he has changed"" and then consider hanging out with them again? 

This guy has been drunk so long I don't even know what his sober personality is like. And I have trouble seeing ever sitting down with him and his enablers and pretending he hasn't done all this shit for years.

  **tl;dr**: My wife's good friend has an alcoholic husband who spent years chasing my wife when he got drunk. I have avoided him for a long time for that reason. He is now sober for a time and supposedly has given up drinking for good. My wife wants me to forgive and forget."
57,"Update: I [22F] strongly feel like my boyfriend is having an affair but no matter how much or what I ask he denies


Edit 3: I didn't expect getting so many responses. I just wanted to let it out somewhere. Thank you everyone for everything you've said. It really! Really means a lot. 

Here's the old post. It didn't get much attention but I just had to say something somewhere. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7vz039/i_22f_strongly_feel_like_my_boyfriend_24m_is/?utm_source=reddit-android

I found out he has been with this other girl for as long as we were together. He started talking AFTER we did and decided it was okay to be in two relationships at the same time.

Because it was ldr I told him to end it in the beginning so many times and he'd say no we'll work it out and never let me go. Did things for me that made me believe he does love me.

So I talked to this girl and it turns out he has been doing almost the same thing with her. And they've met a couple of times and were going to, in March.

I feel like shit and an idiot. Despite having a very hard life myself I gave everything I had to offer. Supported him through his difficult times, everything. He talked to the both of us every night. Along with work, gym and friends/family.

He called me and we talked probably for the last time and he was crying I think I don't know but he said he does love me and it was a mistake getting with her but he ""didn't know how to end it"". That I was amazing and there's no comparison between me and her or anyone. That I was way too good for him and after all this he could never even look at me, after hurting me the way he did. But I think it was all just to make me feel a little better. 

Me her and him talked on call to clear things out and she asked him to choose who he wants. I didn't want to do this because he doesn't deserve anyone but she did and he chose her. And kept saying it's only because we live far away and it's difficult for us to be together. And that girl, kept telling me to go, he's all hers now and don't ever talk to him again. I won't but it sucked so bad my heart just died when he said he'd choose her. And she kept threatening him with this guy friend of hers that she'll be with him when he was defending me from her, from the way she was talking. So he told me he's with her because I don't deserve him and crap.

Edit: I told him in the heat of the moment that I'd tell everyone in his friends/social media circle about what he did to make him feel ashamed. But then when he called later I told him I won't do anything to hurt him, in any way and that I forgave him. He'll probably think I'm too weak to do anything but I don't even want to have to hate him anymore. Idk if that was the right thing to do or not, I did. And we didn't even get to say goodbye :)


Edit 2: he had deactivated all social media because of the doubts I had seeing her tweets. I just saw he's back everywhere and it hasn't even been a day. I feel furious and I want to be mad at him!! 

Sorry if it's not in the right format or the wordings. It just happened and I'm still not okay at all I just had to get this out 

Tl;dr: ldr boyfriend has been with another girl all the time he was with me and is very sorry for it all but chose her in the end because it's difficult for us to be together, living in different countries. Kept saying she is nothing not even close to being as good as me but that's probably bullshit. "

59,"My boyfriend [22/M] wants me [22/F] to stop participating in my favorite sports


My boyfriend and I have been dating a year now. I think we’re really dissimilar, but we make it work really well. He’s a lot more involved in art, and I’m into athletics. When we first started dating, I made my interest clear to him and he was enthusiastic. I’m not Olympics good, but I hope to be before it gets too late. He said he wanted to support me, and he was willing to try some new sports and stuff with me. Of course, right at the start of us dating, I wrecked my leg and our first few dates were spent doing puzzles and crosswords together, watching movies while I was buzzed on painkillers. He was awesome. It really solidified that he was the person I wanted to spend my life with. He took great care of me, and I loved to spend time with him and learn about what he enjoyed. He set up some paints in my living room so he could paint while we hung out, and I have so many paintings of me, my cat, my house plants. They’re all so incredible. I love what he does.

After a lot of PT and recovery, I finally got the chance to start snowboarding again! Really late into the season, but I was able to! I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to come with me, and he wasn’t up for it the past few weeks. I’ve been having a lot of fun going on my own, but I do wish I had him with me. I asked him one last time if he wanted to go with me as sort of a romantic Valentine’s thing, then we could go get dinner and have a night in- he’s been trying to teach me to paint, so I figured we could do a bit of that. He said he didn’t want to, and then decided to cancel all our plans. I felt really kind of hurt. I asked him if he was okay, but he just shut me down. We’ve been watching the Olympics together, and he’s just not at all engaged. He shushes me when I get excited, and just leaves if he’s not interested in the event. I feel a little disrespected. I watch him paint for hours on end, I ask for the technique, I try to learn. I go to the museums with him, even when I think they’re boring and tedious. He doesn’t have to love it, but he could at least show some interest. Today, I just felt a little fed up and asked why he wouldn’t go with me and why he was so upset. I feel like I’m really respectful of his interests, but it doesn’t seem like he cares about mine. So, I confronted him. He told me he feels like I’m going to get hurt again, and it just comes off as a waste of time to do stuff like that. He says art is more permanent, and something like sports doesn’t last. 

Well, fuck me for liking it, right? He said he’d never go do that sort of stuff with me, but told me he still loves me, he just wants me safe. I told him I appreciate the sentiment, I just wish he showed more respect. He said it wasn’t fair for him to pretend to like something he doesn’t, and then told me I should take up something less dangerous. He said he’d support me more if I did running or tennis or even golf. I told him I’ve got a limited window, and I want to keep pursuing this. If something happens, it happens, but I want to at least make an attempt. He told me it doesn’t matter, that he can’t support me doing this. I’m so frustrated. Is this break up worthy? Or can I reconcile with him? Is he right?

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants me to stop participating in my favorite sports."

My girlfriends dog passed away in October a bit before we started dating and I know she misses him quite a bit still. I'm a art student, looking to go into animation/illustration, so I thought it'd be nice to maybe draw him for her as a little doodle to have for Valentine's Day this year, along with other drawings of our shared times together. Do you think this might upset or offend her? Other drawings on the page include my kitten (who she is like a second mother to) her favourite type of lizard and glaceon (her fav poke) 

TL;DR : would it be bad to gift my girlfriend a drawing of her dog that passed away in October as part of a Valentine's Day gift ? I don't want to upset or offend her 

Thank you!

EDIT/UPDATE : I ended up giving her the drawing I did and she really liked it a lot! She said she was going to put it in her room. Although she seemed a bit sad, I'd say it was more bittersweet and she kept hugging me and thanking me so I think she really liked it ❤️ thank you for your advice Reddit!! "

//www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mp0fs/i_20f_am_worried_about_my_boyfriends_23m_dieting

Original post above. 

It's been a difficult couple of months for us. Sorry this post is kind of a word vomit, but it does have a conclusion.

Shortly after that post, my boyfriend decided to change his routine up. He decided that he would keep his workout routine, stop fasting and eat 2500 calories every day. I was really happy because he seemed to finally see what he was doing was unhealthy. 

After a couple weeks he started gaining weight and things started going downhill again. He was saying that he let himself go and that he looked disgusting, despite the changes barely being noticeable. No amount of reassurance helped. I also didn't notice at first, but he started exercising even more. He used to do this a couple times a week before, but he started getting up every morning at 6:30 to go for a run. Then he goes to work, and then gym for at least three hours after work. He goes for a run weekend mornings as well. He always tries to push himself as hard as he can, and every time he comes back exhausted, aching and faint. Yet he still woke up to do it again the next day. I didn't know what he was eating anymore, because he stopped sharing his diet and fitness plans with me, I guess because he knew I would disapprove. He also stopped taking his shirt off in front of me, at first I thought this was because he was embarrassed of his weight gain. I decided to leave him be for the time being, because he seemed healthier than he was before and he would occasionally eat dinner with me, whereas before he would never have done that.

About two weeks ago we went for a walk together and stopped at a café on the way. I was starving and ordered a bacon sandwich. He ordered a black coffee. I said something like ""oh I thought you were eating properly now"" He said that he was, but he'd already planned his food for when we got back. I started trying to playfully feed him little bits of my sandwich and he actually tried it, and reasoned that he could treat himself today on his day off. He ordered a bacon sandwich, a chocolate muffin and a milkshake. I was pretty surprised. He ate it all really quickly and then I could tell he started feeling guilty and anxious. He went to the bathroom and I'm like 99% sure he made himself throw up cos i could smell it on his breath, but he completely denied it and acted like I was crazy. I think he may have been doing this sometimes when we ate food together as well. 

After this I kind of noticed something about him, he never allows himself any form of pleasure anymore, and when he does he has to punish himself with increased exercise. He makes himself tasteless food that he doesn't enjoy, he forces himself to get up when he's only had a few hours sleep, he doesn't allow himself to sit down and relax, he exercises until he's in pain every day. 

He always seemed to be irritated with me and we basically stopped being intimate. One week ago I caught him shirtless looking at himself in the mirror. It was the first time I had seen him without a shirt in about a month and I was shocked. I could tell by his face that he wasn't putting on weight but I didn't expect him to look the way he did. He still had a decent amount of muscle on his arms but his veins were prominent all over his body and he looked emaciated. I could see his ribcage and his stomach was sunken in. I knew I had to get him help right then. I cried and cried and told him he had to come see a doctor with me the next day. He really didn't want to go, but eventually I got him to agree to come just for a health check up, probably just to prove me wrong. 

He started off by telling the doctor that he knew he was healthy, that he ""ran 15 miles the other day"" and he ""ate a balanced diet"". The doctor listened to me describe his problems while he just rolled his eyes and denied everything. Although his BMI was not quite underweight, the doctor said that his body fat was unsustainably low. She also found his blood pressure was too low. The worst thing was that his heartbeat was arrhythmic and very slow, and she said that he was at risk for cardiac arrest. They decided that because his health is in immediate risk and his mental health history (he has a very prominent scar on his body from a suicide attempt) that he should get inpatient care. 

He was diagnosed with anorexia (which he disagrees with and is very embarrassed of) and has been in hospital for a few days now, though I know he hates it and thinks he can get better on his own. We had a long talk and he ended up breaking down and telling me that he felt like he had to make himself suffer to be a better person, and he didn't deserve to enjoy himself. He said that he didn't deserve to have NHS money wasted on him and he wished he could just die in peace. I knew he was hurting but I didn't know how much and it broke my heart. I love him so much but he is severely mentally ill and I've literally spent nearly the entire relationship worrying about him. From his drinking, drug abuse, multiple arrests and now this. 

I've done everything I can for him but I wonder if it's ever going to be enough. Sometimes I want a partner who can support me as well, and although he is kind and listens to me, he has too many issues of his own. I'm not going to leave him though, I love him too much and he really needs support right now. I'm really glad he's in hospital. I think it's where he needs to be at the moment. I know this is the start of a long journey but I believe in him. 

Tldr; boyfriend got worse and is now in hospital, diagnosed with anorexia. Cautiously optimistic for the future."

67,"How can I (31M) be a better gift-giver? My wife (29F) is upset with me yet again.


My wife and I took that five love languages quiz a while ago and hers is gifts. Which makes sense because she always gets me thoughtful stuff. But I always seem to strike out. I will admit a lot of the time I don’t think about the gift giving occasion until it’s too late and I have to scramble, but this year I didn’t do that. 

I have been trying to actively listen and pick up on what I think are hints, because my wife has told me that she doesn’t like having to straight up tell me what to get her, for her that ruins the fun of gift giving because at that point she could just go buy it herself. Which is true. 

So yesterday was Valentine’s Day. I thought that a digital picture frame would be a good gift because we have a 7 month old son and she’s always taking pictures of him. I stopped and got one after work. When I got home and gave it to her she seemed less than enthusiastic but said thank you. When I asked what was up she said she was just sad because of the news of the school shooting that happened yesterday. 

Later I noticed she hadn’t taken it out of the box and asked if I’d screwed up again. She just sighed and said that it didn’t seem thoughtful. I told her that I thought she would like it because of all the pictures she takes of our son, and this way she wouldn’t have to always be getting them printed to hang on the walls, she could just have one photo frame that would cycle out all the pictures. 

She replied that she appreciated that, but that I also didn’t wrap it or take it out of the box that it came in, didn’t load any pictures on it, and went an hour out of my way to go get it when what she needed today was for me to come home and take our son so she could shower and ‘get cute’ for when I got home. She said that there are tons of digital picture frames on Amazon that I could’ve ordered if I planned ahead, which she said it seemed like I didn’t. I thought I did, but I guess not enough. 

She also said that the frame doesn’t go with any of our other home decor (which is true, all of our furniture and picture frames are white and the frame is brown) and that she actually does enjoy putting pictures of our son into frames and hanging them up around the house.

I can definitely see all of her points. She also says that she knows she should just be grateful, but that she feels like she’s had this conversation with me so many times and at this point she wants to just tell me I’m off the hook for gifts. I don’t want her to say that because I know that gifts are important for her and now I’m really trying, I just don’t know what I’m missing. I guess what I need is tips on how to be a better gift giver because even when I think I’ve gotten her something she’ll like, it always turns out that I’ve misread her. 

Also for more context, this past Mother’s Day she was upset with me because I didn’t get her anything or plan anything, and she was pregnant, and I also screwed up her birthday and our anniversary, I didn’t get her anything at all for her birthday and for our anniversary I got her an exercise ball because I read that it can help pregnant women when they’re trying to go into labor. She didn’t appreciate that at all.  

I realize that I completely screwed up by not getting her anything on her birthday or planning anything, and I guess I didn’t think to get her anything for Mother’s Day because our son hadn’t been born yet. But I see now why that was wrong of me to think. 

Her favorite gifts that I’ve gotten her are one of those sonic face-washing brushes (I noticed she’d been looking up reviews on them and had said she’d been thinking about getting one) and a typewriter I found on Etsy because she had said she used to play on her grandmother’s typewriter when she was a little girl. 

I don’t want to give up on this because my wife always does things for my love language, which is words of affirmation. She is an awesome mother and a good wife and doesn’t ask for much, so I really do want to get better at this. If any guys have gone through this same thing and turned things around I would appreciate that perspective as well. Thanks. 

Tl;dr  I keep ruining giftgiving occasions for my wife whose love language is gifts and I want to do better"
68,"[UPDATE]Me [28 F] with my friend(s) [28-33F] since childhood. I'm no longer the hot mess of the group and it's creating resentment, I think. Need perspective.


 [Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7rmx7h/me_28_f_with_my_friends_2833f_since_childhood_im/)

Hey! I want to thank everyone that took the time to leave me a thoughtful reply. I sincerely appreciated every last message and read and reread your comments to really internalize some of the advice and mull it over.

A lot has happened in the last few weeks. The weird thing is that most of it is incredibly good stuff, but I’m not feeling great about any of it or myself and I need some more insight. I’m going to describe the events that transpired, but first I want to describe my general mood around them in hopes someone can explain why I might be feeling this way: basically I’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety, sadness, feelings of guilt, feelings of unworthiness, a lack of motivation. Things associated with depression, but I don’t think I’m clinically depressed. I keep playing out fake conversations in my head with Katie on a loop where we reconcile or argue. I recognize this to be destructive.

After the awful series of text messages Katie sent me, I took some time to relax and write out a thoughtful response to her that was not accusatory or shaming. 

This is the message I sent:

*""I'm sorry that you're upset and hurt, but you need to understand that my memory of that night is different from yours. We were all together at the bar, talking and having a good time. I didn't realize you were too drunk to take care of yourself. I didn't realize anything I had said was the reason you left. There were dozens of other friends there spread out across multiple rooms and we were all catching up and chatting and celebrating a birthday. When I did realise you had left, I didn't consider it odd since you live so close and had mentioned several times about getting to bed. I'm sorry it was not a good night for you.*

*With that said, waking up to a slew of text messages accusing me of horrible, untrue things was a terrible start to my day and completely inappropriate on your part. I could barely get out of bed after reading all of that. I'm not sure what's at the root of this, but I feel like you're taking out some anger on me that I cannot even pinpoint. I'm going through a lot of things myself and under a lot of stress -- just like you, just like everyone else -- and if I haven't let you in on that fully, I'm sorry, but it's not because I want to keep anything from you but rather because I feel ashamed and embarrassed a lot of the time at the way my own life has gone in the last decade. You're my best friend.*


*We've been through everything together. I love you and always will no matter how much time passes or where life takes us. I'm always here for you no matter what. I'm working on letting everyone in more, but since my shitty childhood and the burden of responsibility I needed to take from far too young of an age, it's been tough for me to ask for help or reveal my vulnerabilities. None of that is an excuse, but hopefully just an explanation. If you want, let's meet up for coffee at mine or yours and discuss this further when I'm back from vacation.""*

Her response was a few lines about her ""just not caring anymore and me not realising my own selfishness."" I didn't bother responding at this point and just went on vacation.

Well my boyfriend ended up proposing on our vacation and becoming my fiance. One of the happiest moments of my life. 
We took a couple days to just enjoy our new status before FaceTiming our immediate families to deliver the news, messaging friends, or posting about it on social media to let the rest of our friends and family, especially our numerous overseas aunts/uncles/cousins etc. know.

Except that ended up not happening. 

This is when those bad feelings I described started because the first thing I thought about was Katie and her potential reaction. My stomach sank. There was a knot of anxiety in my chest that I'm experiencing again even as I type this.

A few people had commented on my previous post that my new life improvements might be bragging on my part or insensitive so I wasn’t sure if I should tell her? And if/when I did, how? 

My core group of childhood girlfriends has a group message that we use to chat and keep in touch. I opened up that chat, and there were a bunch of new messages from Katie who (yet again) had had another horrible date and was on a tirade against men. 

It didn’t seem like the right time to announce my engagement so instead I sent her a silly picture of me on the beach with the msg “Babe I’m SO sorry but honestly it’s good you figured out after the first date that he wasn’t as great as you hoped and remember in just a few weeks this will be YOU happy on the beach!!!! You won’t even remember his name by then!!!”

Katie responded a few minutes later: “I guess so but I won’t have your beach body hahaha.”

Ok whatever. 

Bear in mind: Katie looks great, she isn’t struggling with her weight or fitness or anything. 

So anyways I couldn’t tell that group of friends I was engaged. I decided to leave it alone for the time being. My boyfriend and I FaceTimed our immediate family about it but that was it. He was struggling to understand my reticence, but was largely supportive, patient, and loving. As usual.


The next big thing was a launch party related to my career that just happened. I’ve been secretly working on a side business in an area I’m extremely passionate about. The risk of failure is high so I'm super nervous but excited, and I’ve also been lucky with the support of Fiancé and government grants and mentor support which will give me a fighting chance of success. Only fiancé and my brother knew about this. It goes back to my fears about disappointing people and never being good enough. I needed to wait until I had something more concrete than an idea and dream to show for it. 

The days leading up to the party I spent sleeping badly and feeling worthless. I would just kinda stare out the window with this impending sense of doom picturing Katie sneering at me if I failed and mocking me at the party. I wasn’t even sure if I should invite her since we didn’t actually talk through or reconcile really from the events that happened in my last post. But of course I had too.


I had a private room booked, and an invite list of 100ish, mostly friends with some industry peers. We still hadn’t officially announced our engagement and thought maybe the launch was the best way to do it after I revealed the whole business I’d been keeping so secret. But then Katie’s reaction was haunting me. Was it okay to do it there? Was it being insensitive to her feelings? I didn’t even want to do the party anymore. My fiancé encouraged me to go ahead as planned.

I wasn’t really enjoying myself at the party even though the turnout was amazing and everyone was just so happy for me regarding the secret business. I felt too nervous. Katie showed up late, which was fine, and drunk/high shortly before my speech. She was being passive aggressive and weird. Resentful I hadn’t told her what is been working on. I pretended not to notice and changed the subject by introducing her to a peer who she then (as usual) began to aggressively flirt with in an inappropriate way. I was internally freaking out. 

Went up to make my speech. Thanked everyone for being amazing and made some jokes about my hot mess days. Told the room I had kept the business a secret because of my fear of screwing it up. Proceeded to congratulate two separate friends who had also recently become engaged and then used that as a segue to thank my incredible fiancé and to finally announce our engagement and put my ring back on. 

Katie left at some point without congratulating me or saying goodbye.


This is getting long --  but a couple days later a friend revealed to me she had been doing damage control with Katie the whole night from the start of the speech. Katie had been making fun of me apparently to anyone who would listen. She insists I’m a gold digger and social climber. And apparently I should have told her about the engagement straight away. She’s mad I didn’t tell her about the business and etc. She had a freak-out at the guy who wouldn't go home with her. etc. 

At this point I don’t want the anxiety of her at my wedding and just want to elope to avoid it. 

I don’t know what to do next. I don't know what to say. I don't know if my behaviour is fueling hers or what to believe anymore. But the thought of ending a 20+ year friendship is devestating. 


**Tl;Dr:** I’m not handling things well with Katie who is growing incredibly passive aggressive. Not sure how to curb this."

71,"[25 M] I feel like dating as a “nerdy” black man is significantly more difficult than it should be.


This might sound strange and maybe it’s just me but I noticed being a combination of black and nerdy, dating seems way harder than it should be. I’m in my mid twenties but struggle to even get a date.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like girls expect me to fall under a certain stereotype and since I don’t play into stereotypes they aren’t interested.

&amp;nbsp;

Being a software engineer I’m pretty much the archetypal nerd. Strangely i noticed girls when they ask me what I do for a living and I tell them they seem less interested guess there’s some sort of stigma attached? I’m also interested in things like gaming, anime, sci-fi, and worldbuilding. I do have some non nerd interests like hiking and I’m a Christian.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t put emphasis on other people’s race or hobbies but for some reason girls seem to make a big deal about my race, hobbies, or job. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway I noticed most black girls I met aren’t interested in dating nerdy guys and the super rare few who are into nerdy guys in my experience seem to prefer white guys (not all but decently high percentage). Like one girl I wanted to go out with she was attractive into anime, hiking and other stuff I liked but told me she was only interested in White guys. Which I thought was odd but regardless of her reasoning no date for me. Or in another situation I’m talking to a girl and mention I like to play video games and she tells me only little boys play games not grown men. 

&amp;nbsp;

White girls open to dating black guys aren’t interested in dating a nerdy guy. White girls interested in nerdy guys aren’t interested in black men. Even had girls tell me straight up they could never date a black guy.

&amp;nbsp;

And from my limited experience with Asian girls their families or the girl in particular aren’t too fond of black people. I could be wrong but that’s my experience.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences? Or is this all in my head?

73,"My girlfriend (19F) of a year refuses to pay rent (24M) instead pays off her mom's debt


Girlfriend moved in with me 8 months ago. It started with a toothbrush and then clothes, you know how it works. 

I was living ok. I make 50k a year and pay 1215 in rent. All bills combined I pay about 2,200 with car payments and phone and everything else. I suggested that she should start paying rent so that eventually we could look into buying a house, or just to have money in savings. 

She was offended that I even asked. Saying that she's been buying groceries so she's already putting in her fair share. 

She makes about 35k a year, and has no bills to pay. She often spends her whole check the day she gets it and random things like pictures and pillows and all new clothes.

Yesterday I found out her mom had a lot of debt. And my girlfriend has been giving her $1000 a month to pay it for her. 

Her frivolous spending has made me feel like she's been a burden to me. I'm getting stressed about finances for months now. 

I budget myself weekly to make sure I can save every dollar I can. But she just spends it with no worries about the value of a dollar. 

I don't plan on breaking up with her. Shes a joyful person. But just financially I can't depend on her.

**TL;DR girlfriend doesn't pay any rent, but pays her mom's extreme debt. Can't be financially dependable.**

Edit: thank you everyone for your suggestions and advice. We're sitting down tonight to discuss my concerns. Hopefully it goes well.
