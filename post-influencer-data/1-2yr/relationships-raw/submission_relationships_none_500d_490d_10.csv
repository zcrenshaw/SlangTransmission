0,"UPDATE: I (19F) am falling in love with my best friend (also 19F), but I'm super nervous about telling her


My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8fgsfr/i_19f_am_falling_in_love_with_my_best_friend_also/) didn’t get as many replies as I had hoped, but the few pieces of advice that I did get helped me to be less nervous about doing what I had to do for my situation. And now I have an update in case anyone cares to read it (spoiler alert: it’s a happy one).

Today I hung out with Katherine (which is her real name; I called her Katelin in the op because it’s close to her name but not quite the same, but she’s fine with me using her real name in this post). It took me a few hours to mention anything related to my feelings for her, but I decided I’d start out by telling her I’m a lesbian and see how she reacted, to determine what to say next. As soon as the words “I’m a lesbian” left my mouth, Katherine smiled and said “I know, Taylor. I’ve known for years now.” We both paused for a few seconds because I was nervous about how to respond to that, but then she helped me out by asking me “any girls you’ve got your eye on right now?” and then she winked at me, as if to suggest that she knew exactly what else I wanted to tell her. 

So I said “yeah...you” and she started rubbing my arm with her hand (as I mentioned in the op she always does), and after another brief pause, I directly asked her “will you be my girlfriend, Katherine?” Her response: “it’s about damn time, Tay” (which I keep reimagining in my head while smiling uncontrollably). Then we kissed a few times (I have no words for how amazing it felt to finally kiss her), and we cuddled in her bed for the rest of the time before I left her house.  

I’ve never been happier in my life than I am right now. But for the time being, Katherine and I are going to keep our relationship a secret from most people we know in real life, until we can figure out the best way to come out to our parents. We’re a lot less worried about how hers will react than we are about mine, but we don’t want either of them to find out about our relationship from anyone other than us. So I could still use some more advice on how to come out to my (very conservative) parents, along with what exactly I should plan to do in case they don’t take it so well.

Tl;dr: Best friend has known about me being a lesbian for a long time, and feels the same way about me as I do about her. We’re dating now, but keeping our relationship a secret until we feel comfortable each telling our parents (which I could still use some advice for)."
1,"Me [28 M] with my wife [27 F] 5 years together, I cheated a long time ago the other woman sent me a letter. [UPDATE]


[original post](https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8f58qc/me_28_m_with_my_wife_27_f_5_years_together_i/)

So I kept waiting until I was finished with work but it felt like forever and I wanted to get home already. While I was driving I kept going over everything that happened and everyone's advice about it and I calmed down and just bit the bullet.

I came home she made dinner for us, after we were watching TV and I told her I had to show her something. I showed her the letter and she looked a little hurt but I knew it would bring up bad past feelings.

She opened it and read it and than showed it to me, it was basically the other woman asking if we could get back together and that she felt something so I must have felt something as well.

My wife did stop reading because it was starting to go into detail of what we did. She asked me if I had any contact with her which I haven't and also asked if I felt anything for her which again, I don't have any feelings for the other woman.

So we talked about it more and while it was uncomfortable for me I imagine it must have been extremely hard for her. I answered all her questions and she did say she appreciated me showing it to her and us reading it together, that it felt like we were a team.

It was a very productive conversation and she said she's starting to trust a little bit again. It was still early so I ended up getting us some ice cream, in the end it worked out fine she felt good and I feel like I'm making progress its slow but worth it.

Thanks everyone for the advice.



TL;DR: I showed the letter to my wife it was just the other woman asking if we could get back together, we talked about it and she appreciated that I showed it to her.

2,"[UPDATE] Me [28F] with my best friend [30/F] and her husband [32/M] I'm caught in the middle


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8dbdsl/me_28f_with_my_best_friend_30f_and_her_husband/)

Original Post TL;DR-- My best friend's husband is my supervisor. He kept flirting with a co-worker. Best friend most likely has postpartum depression but won't deal with it and started getting paranoid. I was in the middle of the shit storm.

&amp;nbsp;

Hello, Reddit! A few people have asked for updates and things have kind of settle down enough for me to provide one.  

I finally had a serious, sit-yo-ass-down conversation with Ross (best friend's husband/my supervisor).  His flirting has become very obvious and I basically did the one thing I swore I wouldn't do, which was to spy on him. I wrote down all the things I noticed throughout the day along with context and time because I was sick of all this and pissed to no end.  Not gonna lie, I was feeling a little vindictive because he kept gaslighting me and saying I was seeing stuff that wasn't there and misinterpreting other co-workers' comments about him and Kate (co-worker he kept flirting with).

&amp;nbsp;

I told him that I needed to talk to him and we grabbed lunch.  I told him point blank that he is flirting with Kate, there's no way for him to deny it, Nancy suspects that he's cheating and it's destroying her. Unexpectedly, I think my voice quivered and I got teary-eyed when I got to ""it's destroying her,"" because I think it suddenly dawned on me how true that statement was and how actually serious the situation was.  I think the same realization dawned on Ross at that moment as well.  Before Ross could say anything, I also just listed all the flirtatious things he and Kate did that day because I was just really tired of dancing around the subject. I don't want to hear him even try to deny it, it's a waste of time (dude, we only have an hour for lunch).   He was clearly defeated, admitted that he had a crush on Kate, and just kind of... I dunno. Emotionally crumpled?? He told me that the baby changed everything about his relationship dynamic with Nancy.  A lot of the typical things of Nancy pushing him away because she doesn't want to be affectionate, both of being exhausted and cranky all the time, etc etc.  He also said that Kate reminded him of Nancy before she had the baby (!!!!) I told him to never, EVER say that to Nancy EVER, even if he was coming clean with everything to her. I urged him to just sit down and have a talk with Nancy.  He felt guilty about wanting Nancy's attention and affection when she was so busy with the baby, so he kinda bottled that up.  I told him that it's OK for him to WANT those things.  He shouldn't make Nancy feel about it (which I suspect he may have but I'm not sure) but at least communicate with her about it.  It's so strange because before the baby, Nancy and Ross were fantastic at communication and were just a freaking dynamo couple.  It really felt like I was looking at two completely new people.  Ross promised me that he'd clean up his act and that was that. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple days later, I hung out with Nancy.  I told her that while her current situation is difficult, her paranoia is beyond what one could consider normal and that she needed to see someone for her postpartum depression as well as a couples therapist.  Again, I was just so sick of dancing around everyone's feelings so I just straight up told her that I can't do this anymore and that both she and Ross are destroying their marriage by pretending that all of this is normal.  With her, the conversation was pretty short. I said ""just fucking talk to him for christ's sake"" and left. It was not one of my most tactful moments.  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway... It's been a couple of weeks and things are going well.  Ross' mom was visiting one weekend (this was already planned, unrelated to this whole ordeal) so he and Nancy asked her to watch the baby for a day and just spent a day talking. I'm not quite sure what went down, but apparently Ross told her about the crush, apologized profusely, and promised that he would only interact with Kate in the normal, professional manner.  He showed her all of his texts and described the office flirting.  Shockingly, Kate basically reacted with ""That's it?!""  I guess she was imagining something waaaay worse. Go figs. She told him not to feed that office crush but was actually pretty cool about him having one (she said it's normal and she has had office crushes in the past, too).  We all agreed that Ross was absolutely inappropriately feeding the crush and that it was bordering on cheating. He'll have to grovel a while for that one to go away. But all in all, they seem to have a really good day together and kind of regained the momentum they had before.  Nancy has started seeing someone for her PPD and they are in couples counseling.   Nancy still has bouts of weird, depressive episodes but I'm sure it'll get better with time.  I hate to say it, but their baby IS kind of a nightmare.. Super cute but will not eat or sleep properly.  Ross has COMPLETELY changed his attitude towards Kate (basically how he treats everyone else in the office) so I truly believe they are in the mends.  I'm really happy to see them fix things, but I told them that I'm a bit burnt out with our friendship and need some time apart. They apologized and agreed that they'll keep their distance from me until I contact them first.  They're getting back to their old selves, so I'm sure we'll get over this hump and be good friends again. 

&amp;nbsp;

Kate, however, is not taking this whole thing well.  She shouldn't be trying to cheat on her bf, but Ross was also kind of the driving force behind this so I am a little bit sympathetic.  She continued to try to flirt with Ross, but it clearly wasn't going anywhere. She then started openly flirting with another MUCH older married director (I'm guessing in his 50's???).   Dude seems a bit confused but isn't really shutting it down either.  A couple of days ago, she approached me and asked if I thought Ross was being kind of weird towards her. Kate and I are not friends and we barely interact, so this was definitely out of the norm. She knows that I'm friends with Ross, though.  I did NOT want to get involved again so I basically gave her a very quizzical, surprised look and said ""Oh, I have no idea. I haven't noticed anything."" I noped the HELL out of there as quick as I can.  Sometimes you gotta be smart and play it dumb. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, that's about it. Thank you so much for all your advice! I think the general consensus was ""Talk to Ross but don't mention his flirting to Nancy"", which seems to have worked out beautifully.  You guys are great! 

TL;DR- Told Ross to quit his bullshit. Told Nancy to see a therapist and counselor. They're doing much better now but Kate seems to still be going down a dark path. I don't care.  "
3,"My coworkers blew me away


I'm posting this here because it is kind of relationship-y. It involves work relationships.

Anyways, 9 months ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Im a single mom and only 28 and a student, so I already didn't have the best financial situation going into this. I have had 7 surgeries, 4 months of chemo, and now I'm starting another few months of radiation.  I was initially out of work for 3 months, I came back for a few weeks and started chemo but chemo decimated me. It was like an atomic bomb going off in my body. 

I couldn't walk due to muscle weakness, and was in excruciating pain. It got so bad that I could barely open my eyes and after I stopped showing up for work one day due to sickness, my boss called my parents to make sure I hadn't died.  I couldn't go to work anymore because I was so messed up. I'm still so messed up. My boss has been super accommodating, offering me all sorts of light duty, work from home options, etc. 

I do get long term disability through my work, but it only pays 60% and now I'm drowning in medical bills for cancer treatment. I've been largely ignoring my worsening financial situation because I just can't deal with everything at the same time. 

I got an email this week from HR telling me that my co-workers collectively donated 150 hours of their own PTO to me. This is an entire months worth of full pay that they have me by cashing out THEIR OWN VACATION TIME.  

I'm drafting a thank you letter but I am literally at a loss of what to say. I know how to thank people for tangible gifts and thoughtful gestures, but how do you even thank people for something as big as giving up their own vacation? They are paying my bills and keeping my daughter and I afloat for an entire month and every time I try to write my letter I just start crying. 

I wasn't even there for very long, 7 months maybe before my diagnosis. And we have multiple shifts so I know a good chunk of these donations are coming from people who worked opposite shifts and rarely interacted with me. 

Guidance? Direction? How do I convey my gratitude? I don't want it to sound like some canned thank you note. I'm crying even right now as I type this.  

Tldr: co-workers cashed in their vacation time to help pay for my cancer treatment. "
4,"My [24M] mom [55F] invites my Fiance' [24F] and I for dinner at least once a week. She gets sad if we're unable to attend.


I love my mom dearly but she's always been easy to upset and is quite emotional (she cried when we said we're discussing moving an hour away in the next couple years). My Fiance' and I lead busy lives - most days we get home from work around 5, head to the gym, get home and make dinner, and finally finish cleaning up around 7-8. Take our pup for a walk and then watch a bit of TV before bed. 




My mom invites us over for dinner at least once a week. For us it's a little bit much - she's amazing but spending an entire night from 5-9 at her house once a week is a little bit much. Whenever I decline because we're busy she fronts taking it well but my dad has explained it upsets her and she's sad over it. I don't know how to find a middle ground here.




**TL;DR:** Mom invites us for dinner once a week. We're busy and that's hard to do. She gets sad if we say no. How can we find a middle ground?"
5,"My [29F] best friend [30F] of fifteen years is siding with the woman [30sF] who assaulted me at her bachelorette party this weekend. How do I move on?


tl;dr I was assaulted at my best friend's bachelorette party this weekend and left with serious injuries including a broken wrist. My best friend has sided with my attacker because they are coworkers and she wants to ""focus on the good and keep her career safe."" I am devastated.

Chloe and I have been best friends since seventh grade. We have been close the entire time and have considered each other sisters since our children were born one right after another. We have never had a significant argument and almost always see eye to eye. In the rare instance that we do disagree, we are excellent at communicating our problems and resolving them immediately.

Chloe's bachelorette party was this weekend. There were about fifteen girls around the pool at the hotel and we were all having a great time. There was alcohol available but I can't drink in excess because of a health condition, so I had one mimosa early and called it a day. About an hour after the event started, Chloe's coworker Marissa arrived with her twelve year old daughter Daphne. Daphne was not invited; in fact, children were explicitly prohibited because of the nature of the event.

Chloe is a very nonconfrontational person and the rest of us didn't want to sour the day, so we did our best to keep Daphne entertained. Because I was the only sober one, I ended up being the one that was looking after Daphne while her mother began to drink heavily so that she could ""play catch up"". While I was irritated, I didn't want to make a scene. At this point, it had been about an hour since Marissa and Daphne had arrived and I realized that Marissa had disappeared. I told Chloe that I was going to find Marissa because we were supposed to be playing drinking games and had a stripper planned for later, and those are obviously not activities that I wanted to be babysitting an uninvited minor for. Chloe agreed and I left the pool.

I found Marissa in one of the cabanas at the complex's other pool with a man. I told her to finish up and come get her daughter because it wasn't my responsibility to babysit and she told me to fuck off, a response that I was expecting given how drunk she was. I waited for Marissa outside of the pool to make sure she actually came and when she appeared again about fifteen minutes later, she was clearly angry. She crowded me back against the fence and started yelling at me to mind my own business. I told her that I had had every intention of not getting involved but that it wasn't my job to parent her child at my best friend's bachelorette party.

That's about the last thing I remember. I must have triggered some deep seeded rage because the next thing I knew, I was flat on my back with people crowded around me. My ribs are deeply bruised, my face is rashed up from the pavement, and most seriously of all, my wrist is broken and will probably require surgery. Marissa left with Daphne before the police arrived and I was taken to the hospital in the ambulance.

This was two days ago. The police reports have been filed, DCF has been called by another member of our party because Marissa was slapping Daphne and pulling her hair on the way back to the car allegedly, and my life has been completely turned upside. My body feels like it was hit by a Mack truck. I cannot work (I'm a barista). I cannot clean my house or take care of my children or walk my dog. 

Worst of all, however, is how Chloe has responded to all of this. Not only has she treated my injuries as if they're not as serious as they are, she has sided with Marissa and agreed with her that I shouldn't have ""gotten into her business,"" and that is wasn't my place to decide what her daughter did or didn't need. She's also gone on to say that she thinks me pressing charges is selfish and the fact that I would endanger Marissa's career over ""a drunken spat"" is ridiculous,

Reddit, I don't know how to process this. My best friend has always had my back. She has always loved me and taken care of me. I am a clear victim here. Even if it wasn't my place to tell Marissa that she needed to watch her own child, attacking me is a crime and an insane response to being confronted. I know that this relationship is over. I know that the worst moment of my life is something that I'm going to have to remember without the knowledge that my best friend was there to help me through it. Every other girl that was there is on my side and completely in defense of me. When Marissa inevitably goes to jail for this, and subsequently loses her job, what do I do?

I can accept my fault here. I should have put my foot down from the start. I shouldn't have confronted Marissa. I shouldn't have been alone with her after she had been drinking. Why is this happening? What happened to my sweet, gentle, kind best friend?

Thank you."
6,"A guest (late 30s) coming over for dinner tonight is the most obnoxious ""intellectual"" you could ever meet. My (28m) wife (29f) wants a peaceful party, do I keep quiet or call him out on his rudeness and BS?


Where to start on this...

My wife loves entertaining is a good place to start. I'm already pretty introverted so having people over feels like a real invasion of my space. Even without this guy coming over, I'm already filled with such anxiety I can hardly sit still and I won't be able to relax until everyone is gone. So I have my shortcomings as well. 

So all the attendees tonight come from our kid's swim team who my wife wants to get to know better. One of the invitees is also a dad with a kid on the team and he's a professor at the state university in our town. It's hard to describe him but I'm sure everyone reading this has met someone just like him. Despite being a professor he's as dumb as rock but absolutely loves to intrude on everyone else's conversation to give his ""expert"" opinion. 

For example I was talking with another dad about wanting to go bow hunting. We were very much minding our own business and weren't intruding on anyone else. I also think we were highly aware that shooting animals with a flying projectile is not great talk for a kids swim lesson so we were well away from the other parents and kids having our conversation. All of the sudden the professor comes up to us, listens for half a second and then goes into full lecture mode about the evils of the ""robber barons"" of the ""animal flesh corporate complex."" I told him that actually that was one of the reasons I wanted to hunt was because factory farming kind of grossed me out, he actually held his finger up to me as if to say ""shoosh"" and said ""I'm sorry but I'm an expert in this field"" (I don't know exactly but I believe he's a sociology professor). I was stunned and truly speechless, he began to lecture us about how evil our intentions were and thank god maybe two minutes in the head coach called for all the parents to come around him for a discussion on the upcoming practice schedule. 

At practice today, I sat next to this professor but wasn't part of his group and I could here him talking about the evils of professional sports, even though he'd been to a pro-baseball game the night prior but instead of the rest of the people who will there as fans, we went to ""research the human condition as a impartial observer."" There are certain ""hipster"" parents who also have kids on the team that are just in awe of this guy but I wanted to puke, it was perhaps second only in douchiness to ""animal flesh corporate complex.""

Whats even worse about what this guy is says is the fact that it's clear that he's not there to discuss, he's there to lecture and for the most part the parents who are interested in what he thinks, just sit there taking it all in. 

So this guy and his wife will be in our house tonight. I am dreading it, I mean physically dreading it. My wife is working very hard to make this dinner successful but I don't know how much I can take of this guy. 

If he starts getting insulting towards me and other people at what point do I speak up? Do I take it to a full fledged argument if need be? Or do I just keep my keep quiet, letting him dig his own grave and most people recognize his douchiness for what it is...and maybe even giving and having an argument is exactly what he's looking for?


**tl;dr: we are having an incredibly douche know it all over as part of a dinner party. I am wondering do I speak up and argue with him or do I honor my wife's request to have a polite party and let him make an ass of himself?**

7,"[UPDATE] My (22m) girlfriend's (24f) ex (23m) wants to meet up with her for closure


Previous post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8gszes

To summarize, this is my first relationship and my girlfriend met her ex at a party. We have been together for 6 months and she introduced us. He invited her to coffee with another mutual friend and she went. Then he text her asking to meet up to talk so he could have closure over their relationship.


I told my girlfriend that she should do whatever she felt comfortable doing and that I supported her. I asked if she thought he might be trying to rekindle things and she said no. I told her that if she wanted I could bring my laptop to the same cafe and study from there, so that if she felt uncomfortable I could come and diffuse things. She said she didn't think that was necessary, but that I could if I wanted to. I decided not to because I don't want to be in a relationship where I feel like I can't trust her.


She met up with him and apparently his issue was that being cheated on by his recent ex had led to a crisis of self-esteem. In their relationship, he had felt like he wasn't good enough for her because she had a 'good girl' reputation and he had a past filled with women and he felt like he wasn't good enough which was one factor contributing to their break up. She said that he basically wanted confirmation from her that during their relationship, in her eyes, he was a person worth caring about, to try and combat his perspective that he wasn't. They talked for about an hour, and then they were joined by the mutual friend who he had invited (she didn't know that) and they all got food. He invited us both to a barbeque party him and his housemates are throwing next weekend. He sent me a facebook friend request and invited me to the facebook event this evening. My girlfriend came home and detailed the conversation to me. She said she thinks the two of us will get along well as we are quite similar and her ex liked me when we had met.


Guess I didn't have anything to worry about after all.


tl;dr: girlfriend met up with her ex. He wanted reassurance that he was a good person, as this belief had been shaken by his recent girlfriend cheating on him. He didn't try anything with her, and has invited us both to his house party next weekend."
8,"Me [44M] with my daughter [15F] with diagnosed antisocial tendencies. I am burnt out, frustrated and overwhelmed.


My daughter Iris, has displayed some worrying signs for many years. Initially I took her to the experts and they gave me strategies which have worked well in deescalating her behavior, but she keeps showing it on and off.

Her mom, my wife, died when she was 5 years old. Her aunt (mother's sister) took on the role of a mother figure and they still see each other frequently. She's part of her life and a good influence.

Iris started doing worrying stuff around 8-9. Burning plants, paper, cardboard folders, plastic, violent drawings (I did them too at her age so this wasn't necessarily abnormal), lying to the kids around the neighborhood, playing with matches and lighters (including burning full boxes of matches for fun), blaming said kids when she was caught doing something wrong with them, being cruel to animals (scaring them away, cornering them and shooting them water out of a hose, throwing rocks at dogs who got into our yard). She got in trouble in school for shoving girls and boys, biting them, stepping on their feet, she cut a chunk of hair from a girl with scissors, burned a boy¡s arm with the tip of a silicon pistol, and other things.

This was all over the course of several months. I finally took her to pediatrician and then a child psychologist and psychiatrist. They had sessions where she told them she found the kids from her class irritating and dumb, and didn't feel bad for hurting them, but she also lied to them about several things, which caused confusion and made it more difficult to treat her.

With help from them I really hammered down how hurtful it was what she was doing and made it a serious matter every time she misbehaved. She slowly started behaving better and apologizing to her classmates, even if grounding did little to deter her.

Over the years it's gotten better but Iris is still irritable and hasn't completely stopped being on and off terrible to other people.

On a summer camp she pushed a girl to the pool. Another summer camp she brought home a stolen Game Boy. She was grounded and I mailed the Game Boy back to the family. She invented a hard luck story to tell her aunt so she would side with her. Her aunt got extremely angry at her and that was a bit of a wake up call for Iris, but hasn't stopped her completely.

She's gotten in trouble for rudely correcting teachers and classmates, fought over sports during the break, acting like a smartass. She was dragged into the bathroom and bullied months back. The following day she hit one the bullies across the face with the edge of a metal food tray. It broke the girl's nose and Iris was given community service. The girl's parents made the bully ""rat"" the other girls and they got community service as well, but less than Iris. I put her back on counseling and she's receiving a session every two weeks. Her privileges have been mostly revoked and slowly won back, her fun time with her aunt reduced, and if she's caught lying to the psychiatrist, she'll be brought back to square one.

I can honestly say I'm pretty burnt out from dealing with her behavior for 6 years. She's a very talented painter and drawer, a good student and generally intelligent, but her temper goes off the rails in a heart beat and says hurtful things she knows will affect me, no matter how many times I shut her down. She once visibly made me cry with a hurtful comment. Later she apologized and cried herself asking me if she had crossed a line and begged me to not hate her for what she said.

She does have a genuine vulnerability she shows very rarely, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, her mother's birthday, or when her aunt is in bad terms with her because she has a remarkable ability to be unbearable. I cherish the moments when she hugs me on her own and wouldn't change her for anyone in the world, but her impulsive behavior and general lack of interest for other people's emotions is a problem no one has been able to erradicate in 6 years, and I'm very frustrated. She has tried and has definitely improved, but sometimes months of progress go out the window because she explodes unexpectedly. She could very well gotten in trouble with the police for her extreme retaliation to her bully, luckily for her the parents seemed more concerned in making their daughter receive consequences for what she did.

It's so discouraging and scary that she could end up arrested for her violence. She's all I have in terms of close family, and I could lose her because she can't or won't control herself.

Sorry for writing a novel, but there was a lot to cover. I guess my question is, what can I do to contribute to Iris being a more empathetic person? Have I somehow failed her for not being able to make it go away completely? Have I done everything I can? This post was more of a rant and a way to vent a lot of the feelings that come with all the stress of dealing with her, but I'd really also like to know from other people who raised a child like Iris, whichever advice they might have for me, or people who *were* a child like Iris. Thank for taking your time to read this whole thing.

**tl;dr:** My daughter has for years been a troubled child and formally diagnosed with antisocial behavioral tendencies. I am burnt out, frustrated and somewhat overwhelmed by her behavior over the course of the last 6 years. What else can I do to contribute to improving their behavior? Have I somehow failed her?"
9,"Boyfriend (25M) frustrated with me (23F) for his snoring that's making me sleep in another room.


My boyfriend and I have been living together for about 2.5 years, this past week we got a new mattress and for some reason that's opened the portal to some really bad snoring. Now he's always snored and it's never been that bad just a light casual snore that I can handle. However this new bed has unleashed a terrible loud snoring that has caused me to sleep on the couch 3 times this week. Anyhow, I can't shuffle him or wake him because he gets really upset and blames me that he can't get back to bed because I woke him up. When I go to the couch I figure I can not disturb him but he also has been pissed off at me and being short/not speaking to me when I do that. I started a new job where I work at night so now I fall asleep after him aswell. 

This is something that's a slight deal breaker for me and I know he wouldn't get a sleep test done no matter how much I asked. should I feel bad for not sleeping in the bed?

**tl;dr.** boyfriends snoring is horrible after we got a new mattress, I try to sleep in a different room but he is upset if I do that."
10,"My (22f) husband (28m) of one year is showing increasingly controlling behavior after I landed a job


I apologize for the length, I needed to get a lot off my chest apparently. I'll post a TLDR at the top! Thanks.

**TL;DR: My husband has went off the deep end since we got married and I got a new job. He's controlling, possessive, doesn't let me live my own life. It's always ""us"" as the priority even when it comes to small things such as socializing outside of work, my own hairstyle and dress, or any free time I may have that doesn't include him. I think we need counseling, or he does, as he seems mentally ill.**

I've known him since I was 16. We worked together and became fast friends. We definitely crushed on each other back then, but nothing ever happened because of the age gap.

After graduating, I moved away for a couple of years. We still texted and skyped, we both love gaming so about once a week we would hang out on skype and do that. Still just friends as I was seeing someone off and on until I was 19. 

Well I encountered some personal issues at college \(mostly anxiety, panic attacks\) and came home to study closer to home where I had a better support network. It was great to be around family and friends again \(including him\). He helped me get back on my feet emotionally. He also helped to get my old job back as he's in management there, and we picked up right where we left off.

Long story short, all the old feelings were still there for both of us. We started dating a few months after I got home and have been together ever since. We got married last summer. I got my degree and landed a job somewhere else and that's where the problems started.

I work in a fast paced work environment, where you're definitely super dependent on your coworkers, little down time, etc. I'm on my feet all day and and the hours are long and sometimes unpredictable. I love my job but it definitely gets stressful at times. 

My husband hasn't been understanding to say the least. I had never really taken him for the jealous or controlling type, but maybe that's because we always previously worked together? Anyway... He doesn't let me go out with my coworkers for a beer after a hard shift. If I'm texting them about scheduling, he has to read the convos after. When I'm home all I want is a hug, maybe a foot rub and a glass of wine and Netflix. But no. He's looking through my phone to see who I texted/called throughout the day, looking at my coworkers' FB convos, etc etc. While giving me 20 questions about who I talked to, what I did, why didn't I call him on my lunch break? 

*On a side note*, he approves my work outfits every morning. If I am wearing too much makeup he makes me take it off. This has led to me doing it in the parking lot as I want to look professional. I take it off before the drive home.

If I \(god forbid\) want to eat lunch with my coworkers, he goes off on a tangent for 20 straight minutes that night, asking me why I prioritize them over him, he's my husband and he loves me and worries about me. He tells me how he sits at his desk waiting for my call. I've stopped even texting him on my lunch break if I'm eating with them, because if I do a courtesy text to let him know, he will spam call me until I pick up and have to leave the group to go calm his nerves for the duration of my lunch break. So on top of that I was skipping lunches for him...

One day I was feeling like I needed a change, so after work I went and got my hair dyed and cut, and a manicure. Nothing major...It's pretty similar to my old color and length \(just a few layers and a trim\). I've never dyed it my entire life and usually cut it myself at home. I thought I looked pretty spiffy, if I do say so myself. I didn't tell him because I wanted to surprise him! Well... I walk in the door and his jaw literally drops. He grabs a fistful and asks if I did this for \(insert male co worker's name\). 

This was the last straw for me. I called him on his bullshit and told him the surprise was for *me,* as well as for him! I want to be able to look goddamn nice for once. I told him to trust me a little bit and that I love him! His reaction? ""Give me your phone.""

I didn't want to because I sent a pic to one of my girlfriends at work to ask her opinion. I knew it would set him off for some reason...

Well he grabbed it from my purse after I told him no, and he went and looked anyway \(we have each other's fingerprints on our phones\) and he yelled at me for not  coming to him first, why did I value their opinions above his? He said he hated my new hair and that I looked like an ugly pixie. 

I went off crying after being berated and called names for what felt like an eternity, but was probably like a half hour. I locked myself in the bathroom and seriously contemplated just chopping all my hair off. He eventually came to the door and coaxed me out with sweet words and a hug and profusely apologizing and how I was beautiful and how he didn't deserve me. We both cried and hugged and made up.

He does this a lot. After making me feel worthless he makes it up to me with kind words and sex.

I feel like I'm walking on a tightrope and one more thing is going to send me over the edge. I love this man but I never saw this side of him before. We got married and he completely went off the deep end. Should I suggest counseling? When he's not upset \(in a neutral mood\) he admits that he has jealousy issues and is quick to anger, and tells me he will do better. But then a moment comes where he can't control himself and always ends up with me forgiving him because I know this is not him. I think he's mentally ill. Please I would appreciate any words of advice, thank you."
11,"UPDATE: My [23F] boyfriends [25M] dad [47M] screwed me out of $2,000. What do I do?


ORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/85euf3/my_23f_boyfriends_25m_dad_47m_screwed_me_out_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb&amp;_branch_match_id=519662280599440765


Hello and thank you to everyone who commented on my original post.

In two weeks it’ll be two months since the car was taken away. The day before it was to be auctioned, my bfs dad scraped up $3,000 (+ $500 in storage and towing fees) from who knows where and went to get the truck out. My boyfriend refused to let me use it because he was furious with his parents, and a week later I bought myself a new car. His parents took away the keys to the truck from me and “gifted” it to his sister who has no job, license or permit. So since she can’t drive it, it’s been sitting in the driveway for almost two months now UNTOUCHED. 

Now, it’s been almost two months and his dad hasn’t given me my money back. I have asked for it every Friday since the 20th of March with no avail. His dad said he would be able to get it to me a week after, but that same Friday his moms family came to town, and they spent all the money they were going to give to me on taking out their family and going to go gamble instead. (We live in Las Vegas.) I told them I needed it to pay for my registration since my hours at my second job got cut back since I was in the hospital with pneumonia, and they told me they didn’t have anything to give me because it was all going towards their bills. Two days later the internet / WiFi/ tv service gets shut off, and my bfs phone gets turned off (he’s on the family line) because his dad didn’t pay the bills. 

They have ignored me and have given me excuses, until I blew up at them this last Friday. I told them that they stole $2,000 from me and I wasn’t going to let it go. I gave his dad a deadline until this Friday to give me back every cent that I gave him or else I would take him to small claims court. My boyfriend told me he stands behind me and he is disgusted that his parents did this to me and the fact they have avoided me at all costs even though we live under the same roof. His parents won’t kick me out because my bf said if they did he would never speak to them again, but we move into our own place on May 23rd, and I told them I would not be leaving this house until I got my money back.

So, let’s see what happens this Friday. I have a demand letter already written and notarized.

TLDR; My bfs dad took $2,000 away from me by selling me a car he didn’t have a title for and refuses to pay me back. I gave him until this upcoming Friday to give me back every cent or else I will take them to court."
12,"My [29f] boyfriend [29m] of 3 years wants to record our conversations/ arguments in order to check who said what - way to success or devastation?


Hi reddit,

my boyfriend and I frequently disagree on who said what and in what manner in a conversation or argument.

He's said 'we should have a recording device rolling' multiple times now, whereas I've said 'do you *hear* yourself?' on multiple occasions.

Today, he wanted to follow through with the recording.


Actually, I think it *might* benefit us, but at the same time I'm deeply hurt and don't even know why.

So I'm looking for opinions or experience from you on this matter. Has someone tried this? Do you think it's a good way to handle this problem? I don't know what to think.


TL;DR: BF wants to record conversations to determine who said what, any experience/ thoughts/ better ideas?



Edit for clarification: We both have mental health problems and work on ourselves very hard, so while this is *somewhat* about who's right, it's more so we can improve our conversations. I'm not sure this is the right way though. "
13,"How can I [20M] stop feeling embarrassed that my girlfriend [21F] wears the pants in our relationship?


I'm shy and pretty soft-spoken and before we were dating, me and my girlfriend were flirting but I was too scared to make a move and one night she kinda just grabbed my face and kissed me and told me she really liked me. She also initiated our first handhold and the first time we fucked. She still takes the lead and she plans most of our dates and stuff. Because i'm shy she ends up speaking up for me to strangers, including waiters and stuff at restaurants we go to. I also lay my head on her shoulders way more than she lays on me. She also takes the lead when we have sex and usually takes off my clothes and is on top and i control during sex. I really really like our relationship this way because I'm shy and it turns me on a lot when she's in control of me. I just feel embarrassed about it when people can see it because I feel like I should want to be in charge since I'm a guy and everything. I don't know how to stop feeling this way.

--
tl;dr: how do I not feel embarrassed that my gf wears the pants?"
14,"My [33 F] BIL [35 M] wants to reconnect after a very volatile falling out. I don't think he deserves it, but I'm feeling pressure.


Two years ago, I had a very bad falling out with my BIL, who I will call John. My husband and I have had very limited contact with him since, only running into him at a couple family funerals but never speaking to each other. He has sporadically texted my husband asking if he's ever going to get over things and text him back and get over the fight. My husband never answers. Here's what went down two years ago:

My husband and I had a young infant, and we brought him over to John's house so his family could see him. When we get to his house, he repeatedly made comments about my baby being a ""fatass"" and I finally told him I had enough and it wasn't funny, and he had to stop. In response, he got drunk in a corner and sulked. My baby had severe acid reflux and had already thrown up through two outfit changes. I didn't think it was good to hand him over to John's pre-teen children while he was projectile vomiting. My baby eventually had a massive meltdown and it took my husband and I at least a half hour to get him to calm down and sleep. So obviously John thinks that's the best time to get out an acoustic guitar that he doesn't even play and starting fucking around with it trying to wake the baby up.

My husband and I left thinking ""thank god that's over"" but really nothing else about the night. Until 6 am, when John starts a barrage of texts to my husband about how I'm a psycho who's obsessed with my kid; I need to be medicated and hospitalized for my ""sick obsession""; how everyone in the family actually hates me; insinuated that I sexually abuse my son; said if my husband doesn't ""straighten me out"", he will; said everyone in his family thinks I have a sick obsession but he's the only one with the guts to say anything; and a host of other lovely things about me. My husband was at work at the time, and I knew nothing about it at that moment. I learned later that John told my husband he was going to tell me all this stuff because I deserve to know. My husband warned him that if he texted me, any relationship between us would be forever gone. So of course he texted me.

At 7 am, I start getting texts rolling in. John tells me that my infant son is a ""sissy"" who might as well be homeschooled because he'll never have human interaction skills, said he's already a failure at life, and made rude comments about his looks.

On top of all this, in the following weeks, he made up crazy stories about that night and told them to everyone who would listen. If he didn't like the response he got, he would up the ante and make up more stuff. I know this because I heard all the different versions of the story from different people. He told my MIL that I ""abused his daughter"". He called my and my husband's friends. This is all super psychotic stuff. Meanwhile, we didn't retaliate. We didn't smear his name. If anyone asked us what really happened, we told them. But beyond that, we cut him off and moved on.

That doesn't mean that I don't hate him with every fiber of my being. I have no desire to rekindle any sort of relationship whatsoever. I will never be able to sit next to him in a room without fantasizing about stabbing him with the closest sharp object.

SO....yesterday, my husband confided to me that his dad told him that John was ""determined to make things right with me"". At 6:30 pm, my husband got a text from John saying ""Yo are we ever going to squash this shit and go have a drink or something?"" He didn't respond. 20 minutes later, I get a Facebook message from John's 13 year old daughter saying she misses us soooo much. Honestly, I'm 99% sure that's not even his daughter and it's actually just John who created that profile so he could snoop because I have him blocked.

My husband thinks I should finally let go and forgive him because everyone says stuff in anger sometimes. His dad wants to have all his sons together again. This fight has been a bit of an issue between my husband's family. We do have to plan separate holidays because my husband and I do not want to be around him. I feel pushed into forgiving him for family sake, but if I do, I won't mean it. I don't think he deserves it. I don't want to be around him and I don't want my kids around him.

So what should I do here? On one hand, it might be good for my emotional wellbeing to let it go. On the other, he doesn't deserve my forgiveness. 

TLDR I had a massive falling out with my BIL after he made psychotic accusations about me and said terrible things about my child. I hear that he wants to ask for forgiveness soon. I don't think I can ever move past what he did. "
15,"I (M 30) feel like I can't deal with my wife's (F 30) depression anymore.


I have been with my wife for nearly 10 years now, and I feel like I am running out of support and patience for her depression. I feel like an asshole typing this up, but I just can't shake it.

We have been married for almost 10 years and have a 3yo together. She was diagnosed with depression several years ago, and it has affected our relationship.

She has tried solo therapy, and hated it. Never opened up. Never followed the therapists' exercises. She does take medication, but that is about it. I just recently insisted we do marriage counseling, but she still just doesn't want to participate.

What really gets to me is that she never touches me. Yes we will be intimate sexually, hut she is not a big hugger. Doesn't like kissing. And she never initiates anything. No physical touch at all. My love language is strongly physical affection. I brought this up many times, and she just says ""I just don't think about it."" And nothing changes. Or she says, ""I feel like it is never enough.""

I feel unappreciated and that she just wants a friend, not a romantic partner.

She is also just so down on herself. She hates how she looks. She hates her job, and feels qorthless because of it.

We do have good moments, but even then there is no romance. I am craving someone to initiate something with me. I want to feel like someone wants me. I don't get that with her anymore.

I don't want to leave, but I just feel like there is this hole in my life and she is refusing to do anything about it.

I guess this is part vent, but part advice. I need to have physical affection and romance. I can initiate, and it will sometimes happen, but she never does.

**tl;dr** I always initiate romance, but never receive. My wife's depression gets in the way."
16,"I (40M) won't ever forgive my former addict mother (64F) for the abuse she did to me. How do I get my siblings (21F, 18M, 17M) to understand this? They constantly beg me to reconnect with her.


grew up in a slum in north Philadelphia, one of the heroin capitals of the northeast. My mother was an alcoholic and a heroin addict, father was in jail for home invasion and robbery, then died in prison. 

My mother was *viciously* abusive to me. I can't even begin to describe it. At the time I knew it was bad, but she kept making it seem as if I deserved it, and that I was a sinner and a bad kid. She would beat me nearly daily, she would make me rob other kids at my school for money so that she can take it, and if she didn't get her money she would beat me. She was a prostitute, and she would often take me to the place she worked at when I was 14-16 and ask around if anyone wanted me. Luckily, nobody did. She used me for insurance fraud, making me run in front of cars so she could get money, leading to multiple hospitalizations (nothing TOO serious, I dislocated my knee one time though) in which she would then proceed to beat me because of the hospital bill she would get. She would heat up metal spoons and burn me on the back with them to the point where I still have a huge scar from when she heated it up too much. I brought home a girl that I was seeing, and she took the girl and beat her and then robbed her for her purse in our own home. She was just an absolutely horrifying women. She was drunk 24/7 and did heroin nearly every day. I honestly remember being shocked when I *didnt* smell alcohol on her breath. 

And then I got taken away and put in a foster home. I never reported any abuse, I was too scared and naive, but they found out she was on heroin and took her away. And the foster home was also abusive (not nearly to the same extent) and so I ran away and just lived on the streets for a bit in D.C., mostly sleeping in abandoned homes with a few other people I met. Anyways, I got my shit together. 

Anyways, then, out of the blue, my mother got sober. And then she remarried, just a year later. She kept trying to reach out to me and I just didn't respond to her texts or voicemails or anything. Then she had a kid, michelle, then 2 other kids later on, aaron and pablo. 

I decided I wanted to connect with the kids, so I reached out to them 3 years ago. They knew about me and apparently heard all about how great I was from my mom, but it was OBVIOUS they never knew the actual extent of what she was like. She never told them. Me and them became closer and closer, I would see them maybe once a week. 

I had quite a few run ins with my mom where kept apologizing and crying. I just... didn't care. There was zero empathy there. Blank face, walk away, ignore her pleading to let her back into my life. 

The kids though... they constantly tell me I should connect with her, and that what I am doing to her is making her sad and that no matter how bad she was, people should have a connection with their mom. They plead and plead with me, telling me to just constant her or go for coffee with her. 

They still don't really know the extent of how bad she was. I have said that she was abusive, but never went into details of the severity of it. We are puerto rican and in a lot of puerto rican households abuse is pretty common, and they keep bringing it up like ""oh all puerto rican moms are like that!"" and I just keep telling them no. Whenever they bring it up I just go blank face, its fucking awful to even hear anything about her. 

It recently got bad when I took them to six flags and they just KEPT bringing it up. I told them please, drop it, over and over again. 

The older one, michelle, she gets it a bit more that I don't want to talk about it anymore, but the two younger ones constantly argue with me that I should reconnect with her and that she has changed. 

Should I just tell them the extent of the abuse? All of that horrifying shit? So they finally get it? I keep feeling bad whenever I say she is abusive, because I don't want their image of her ruined... I mean, if she is really a good person now to them, and it seems like she is, it just feels unfair that they should know that. One of them saw the mark from the hot spoon my back and asked where I got it, I just didn't have the heart to tell them it was from his own mother. If I can't even say that, how am I supposed to tell them the other terrible stuff. 

What do I do ? 

TL;DR - - Mother was extremely abusive, I left, she got sober, had new kids. Kids want me to reconnect with her. I dont want to. "
17,"Me [27 F] with my husband [28 M] married 2 years, told me he’s going to pay his parents [60s] back for the expense of raising him


Yes, this is something we should’ve talked about before we got married. I knew he planned on paying his parents back for college tuition. I don’t think he made the decision to pay them back for everything else until fairly recently. 

My husband and I started dating 8 years ago, while we were both college students. He was always upfront with the fact that his parents expected him to pay them back for his college tuition. While I personally disagree with this and would never ask my kids to pay me back for college, I get that this is not all that uncommon and don’t have an issue with my husband paying his parents back. I think it’s important to not that his parents are not struggling financially. They own multiple houses, drive luxury vehicles, and never have a problem paying for anything. I don’t know what their income was before retirement or how much they saved, but they seem to have enough money to live comfortably. 

When my husband and I started dating, they cut him off (except for tuition) because he was “no longer their responsibility.”  They said that I could cover his health insurance, car insurance, food, etc because I worked part-time and had savings. This pissed both me and my husband off, but we didn’t really feel like we could argue that they should continue to support my husband because he was 20 and they weren’t obligated to continue to pay for his stuff. My husband got a job to help cover his expenses, much to his parents’ disappointment (they felt that he shouldn’t have to work while in college). We managed. 

A couple years ago we got married. As far as I knew, we were on the same page financially. We talked extensively about finances and the idea of him paying his parents for anything other than college tuition never came up. 

About a month ago, my husband’s parents presented him with a bill for the cost of raising him including food, clothing, extracurricular activities, toys and entertainment, etc. THEY KEPT TRACK OF ALL OF THIS THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE LIFE. It’s an absolutely massive amount of money. My husband and I were furious and agreed that we would not pay it and that we would cut off communication with his parents. I thought we were in agreement. 

A couple days ago, my husband sat me down and told me that he wanted to pay the bill. He said that he didn’t want to lose his relationship with his parents over this. I told him that his parents treated him poorly and that I didn’t think it was worth preserving that relationship. I told him that this would affect our ability to have and pay for our own kids. I was a little bit harsher that I should’ve been and the argument ended with us not talking to each other. We haven’t spoken for the last 24 hours. 

What do I do? Am I wrong that it’s completely ridiculous for his parents to ask this of us? Do we pay them? How do I talk to my husband about this without things falling apart?

TL;DR: Husband’s parents have always been weird about money. Recently, they asked us to pay back all of the money they spent raising husband. Husband wants to pay them back. I feel like I’m living in crazy town. "
18,"UPDATE: (33F) Nervous to Reenact Punishments with my (36M) Husband


Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8dxm6j/33f_nervous_to_reenact_punishments_with_my_36m/

So after some chardonnay courage last night, I opened up to him.  We were starting to get into ""play"" mode and I stopped him and told him I wanted to try something new.  I gave him a very specific scenario with very specific language and scolding I wanted him to do.  His response - ""this is sort of hot but what's the deal?""  So I couldn't lie and told him... pretty. much. everything.  He was certainly surprised to say the least.  By his reaction and concern about me, it reinforced that he is the sweetest person on the planet and truly my soulmate.  He kept coming back to - ""are you sure you won't be triggered?""  I honestly didn't know how to answer that.  We decided to let this craziness sink in before acting on anything and we're going to talk about it again tomorrow night to see how we both feel after we both give it some thought.  I feel like a huge weight is off my chest but I'm curious to see what he's going to bring to the table tomorrow as far as next steps/questions/concerns.  He didn't seem distraught or pissed off but more surprised than anything.

tldr: Told my husband about my bizarre fantasy.  He reacted very lovingly and we're both giving it more thought before we act on anything."
19,"I 28[F] was recently diagnosed with infertility and am taking it hard. My mother 60[F] knows this, keeps talking about the children I will have, and won't stop no matter what I do.


Hey Reddit,

Throwaway since this is such a personal issue. I've considered myself childfree my whole life, which is why this is so confusing for me. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with a chronic disease that causes infertility. While it is theoretically possible for me to have children, it would require significant medical intervention and by no means guarantees I could have a child. This diagnosis has hit me hard \- while I still don't picture myself as a mother, I'm about to get engaged to the man of my dreams. If I was going to have children with someone, it would be him. I feel as though the choice to have children has been taken away from me, and having plumbing issues has really shaken my identity to it's core \- I'm a woman but I can't even perform the most basic biological function of a woman? It feels so wrong. I'll get through it though, like I said, my mind isn't made up yet on whether I even want children or not and it's still possible, if difficult.

Which brings me to my mother. My grief for my fucked up ovaries has given her hope that I really will change my mind about having kids, and that coupled with my impending engagement has sent her into full JustNo overdrive. She is always mentioning my future children, touching my stomach, and talking about when I ""conceive"" \(shudder\). I have grey rocked her, told her repeatedly how painful this is for her to talk about and how intensely private this is, and have even walked out and gone home after we've met for coffee. Nothing seems to be working. I know the usual advice is cut her off, but she has some significant medical issues and requires my help. I love her and I don't want her out of my life, but I really need her to shut up about babies. What do I do?

tl;dr: childfree and newly diagnosed infertile, for some reason it's hit me hard. Mother thinks this means I've changed my mind and keeps talking about the future children I will somehow have. This is really really painful. Help?"
20,"My(21M) best friend (21M) started dating my ex (21F) less than a month after we broke up.


To be honest I'm not really the kind of person that would go on Reddit and make a post like this. If anything this is more of way for me to document my own thoughts and for my own sake. Forewarning, as I'm typing this, I'm realizing this is going to be a lot longer than I had originally thought, so I thought I better go back and make a note of that. But anyway; So my ex had been dating for a little longer than a year a half before we broke up. The break up I saw coming about a 2 or so months in advance. It was just one of those things where I realized that things weren't the same as they used to be, and that we had grown to be different people. I thought that it was fairly clean, and the night we finally ended things, for the most part. it felt clean and that it was mutual for the most part. We had both agreed that we have had a falling out in the last two months and that we realistically didn't seeing it working in 10 years.

Even though I understood why we broke up, it still was hard on me. It's difficult to go from, talking to someone every single day, and having a companion you know you can rely on, and transitioning to nothing. On top of that, her and her best friend took a trip to Florida about a week and a half after the breakup. Me them having a good time on social media didn't exactly make it easier. I of course had ""the bros"" my roommates/good friends who I knew that I could rely on as a support system.

Anyway, fast forward to where I am now. My ex and I broke up on the 14th of March, and this all started happening on the 29th of April. I woke up about 10:30 or so to a text message from my ex's best friend \(the one that she went to Florida with\). The text read ""Hey OP, how are you doing?""

Some background on the best friend; her and I haven't always gotten along, and have several disagreements that have caused some stress on my ex's and her friendship with each other. But, because of this the best friend and I had the understanding that we both cared for my ex, and that we should kind of compromise. In short, we didn't dislike each other, but at the same time we never really liked each other either.

So back to the text; When I see who the text is from my mind automatically goes to the idea that the best friend is just snooping for info for the ex. The conversation for the most part went something like this, and I'll to make it as clear as I can. 

Her: Hey OP, how are you doing?

Me: Hey I don't wanna sound like an ass or anything, but I'm assuming you're asking for \(ex\) since you've never really talked to me in the past.

Her: Nope, I'm not asking for \(ex\). I'm asking because I want to know that the right thing was being done in this situation.

""right thing was being done in this situation""

""right thing was being done in this situation""

""right thing was being done in this situation""

I think I read that line about 10 times. I knew there was something that I didn't know. But anyway the conversation followed as,

Me:  Right thing in what situation? Seeing how I'm doing after the breakup?

Her:

...

I'm Speechless right now

You still don't know?

As soon as I had read that, my heart sunk. My mind immediately went to the worst thing that could be happening. I didn't want it to be true, but at the same time, I had a feeling in the back of my mind for a week or two.

Me: What isn't fair

\*15 min later\*

Can you just tell me please? I need to know.

Her: I am trying to decide if I should give them one more chance to talk to you.

Me: Can you just tell me please?

Her: OP, who is your closest friend

After that I just become livid and send her

Me: Are \(best friend\) and \(ex\) seeing each other or not??

After that she goes along the lines how her and my ex had an argument regarding the whole ordeal. The best friend, not only did she think it was impulsive, but It wasn't fair to me, and didn't support them seeing each other. From the time she had texted me, she said that she told \(ex\) two or three weeks ago that someone needed to tell me.

Three. Weeks. Ago.

I am. I was, and to some extent still am, in Shock. MY BEST FRIEND, who I have known for almost 4 years, and roommates with for 2, had been going behind my back, dating my ex.

I mentally shut down, had to call out of work, you name it. I met with the best friend for dinner around 6:30 which was a few hours after my mental breakdown.

Keep in Mind, I still haven't said anything to my best friend. The only thing that I had texted him was,

Me: Hey \(bestfriend\) texted me out of the blue asking me how I was doing?

Him: Haha she's so random. btw, i have something that I need to talk to you about. I'll be home around 9.

But anyway, I met with the best friend \(who I am just gonna call Kayla now cause Im sick of typing best friend\), to try and get a few more details.

My ex and Kayla left for their trip around the 22nd of March, so a little over a week after we broke up.Kayla had said \(ex\) and her weren't really getting along most of the trip, and that she had been texting my best friend NON STOP the entire trip. She said towards the end of the trip while she was in the shower, she read some of their text messages, and had been calling each other, ""boo"", ""hun"", ""babe"", all those kind of nicknames. She basically told me at dinner that she didn't support \(ex's\) decisions with this, and to think about who else you could be impacting by going forward with the relationship. She acknowledged that It wasn't her place to tell me what was going on, but at the same time it wasn't fair to for them to be keeping it a secret from me. She basically said that morally, to her it was the right thing to do. She ended by saying that I should confront my roommate/best friend about the whole ordeal.

I get home around 8:45 from dinner, he gets home about 30 minutes later. He comes into my room. He looks at me, I look at him. He knows that I know.

I open the conversation with

Me: So what did you want to talk to me about?

Him: Wellllll, I'm not sure what Kayla told you, but I'm sure that she blew it out of proportion knowing her. What did she tell you exactly?

Me: \*I'm thinking, great, he's gonna try and lie\* and just respond, No, I wanna here your side.

He basically goes on this long drawn out bullshit that I can honestly can't even remember because I was trying to hold myself back from breaking his teeth in. But the TLDR of that conversation was that, he knew it was fucked up, he knows that by dating my ex that he is hurting me and put our friendship at stake, but he was gonna do it anyway.

I've been typing for almost 45 minutes now so I'll try and wrap it up. But now I am in a position where I am questioning everything. I find it very hard to believe that him and her had developed something within the short spam of a week that we had broken up. I have no reason to trust him, and have no timeline of how things ended up with the two of them. I do not support it, I am still personally getting over the breakup, and to have this bomb dropped on me that my best friend and ex have been dating for what could be as late as a week after we broke up is just a slap in the face. Feeling of inadequacy are sinking in. Did I mean anything at all to her that entire time? I know I wasn't perfect as is everyone, but I don't understand how those two could go about dating, and are willing to destroy literally every other friendship that they have to do so.  

So whats your opinion Reddit? To be honest this isn't something that I would expect from either my ex, or my best friend, so all in all its a bit of a shock. To be honest, I am still deciding if I even want to associate myself with him anymore. He is my best friend and all, but I'm not sure If I could be friends with someone that would act with such disregard to my own feelings and standpoint.

TLDR: My best friend/ roomate started dating my ex of almost 2 years a week after we broke up and lied about it to me for almost a month until a third party member filled me in on what was going on. "
21,"My [20F] mom [40s F] is trying to make my sister [17F] attend an expensive college where she will come out with $100k student loans because of her ego/bragging rights


I don't want to spill my life story but my parents are immigrants, like to brag about their children's accomplishments and my sister was never the straight A, heavily invested student they wanted. My sister didn't take applying to college seriously so she has three options. 

Accounting at one private university (expensive), nursing, which is what my mom wants my sister to do at another college (very expensive) and community college &gt; transfer to a university. My mom says it's shameful for her to go to CC, but I keep arguing with my mom that it's not about what others think, but about the burden my sister will have with student loans. 

I myself will graduate with $25k in student loans and I couldn't imagine having $100k. My mom is arguing with me because of a stupid reason. I really worry for my sister.... what can I do? :(

tl;dr: title"
22,"Husband (23m) wants to have a baby. I (23f) don’t think it’s a good idea. Every time we talk about it we argue and it gets really awkward. What do I do?


We have a one year old daughter already. I am currently in school full-time and he is working full-time, while my mom takes care of our daughter whenever we need. He works 50-60 hours a week and I am at classes/doing schoolwork the majority of the time. 

We used to talk about our plans and it always included having 2-3 kids really close together so they could all be buddies. I have a bunch of siblings, and I’m only really close to the ones within 2-4 years of my age, so I know from experience how the older age differences are harder to relate to. He only has one brother who’s a year older than him, and he agrees. 

The problem is that I didn’t realize how damn hard pregnancy and motherhood would be... pregnancy WRECKED my body. **TMI WARNING AHEAD**:

My stomach looks like a deflated balloon. It’s like a fleshy raisin. I have stretch marks all up my stomach/sides/back that are so bad they’re like little canyons on my body. There’s new fat in places I never gained weight before. My boobs are either engorged to the point of feeling like they’ll pop, or grandma boobs that dangle to the floor. My nipples haven’t been soft in a year. 365 straight days of diamond hard nipples. Bras? HAHA they do nothing now. Except prevent a super soaker full of milk from spraying passers-by. 

And don’t even get me started on my lady bits. Sex is a nightmare because it’s a 50/50 chance on wether I’m going to suddenly scream in agony from the pain. Wanna know why? Because I have a lump of hardened tissue *inside my vagina* from the *stitches* I got during labor when my *vagina ripped in half*. The doctor said it was like a “T”, I ripped to the left, to the right, and right down the middle. I lost a lot of blood, too.

**TMI WARNING OVER**

So pregnancy alone eff’d me up, but mother hood is an adventure, too. Even with my moms help I’m still miserable. I love my daughter, but is it really worth it to wake up a billion times a night just so a toddler can bite my nipple and scratch my boob? I haven’t had a realistic night of sleep in a long time. Even when she sleeps through the night on the rare occasion, I’m still awake paralyzed with the inability to sleep because *what if she starts to suffocate in the night and I need to be there to help her*, which I know is unrealistic. I have constant unchecked thoughts of her horrifying and preventable nightly death that keep me awake. I am talking to someone about this, too, but it’s a work in progress. 

ALL THAT TO SAY, motherhood suuuuuucks. I totally love my kid, she’s the best. I’ve never loved something more in my life. All the strife is totally worth it in the end just to see her smile when I get her out of bed in the morning. 

But I’m not gonna willingly get another one lmao. This year has been TORTURE. I’m okay with one baby for now. I’m 23 years old damnit, I don’t have time for babies. I have plenty of fertile years left. And even if I don’t, there’s always adoption right?

WRONG!!!

My husband is TOTALLY against adoption...unless we get an infant and the baby’s parents are dead (so they can’t come after us to get their kid back) and the baby isn’t from a rough home. And no siblings, he only wants one but would feel too bad about splitting up siblings. 

So no adoption. 

I’ve been the primary caregiver (along with my mom) over my husband. He is only really here for the fun parts. I’ve tried showing him the stressful parts of parenting but he just gives up and has me/my mom take over. 

He wants babies NOW. We just had another argument about it because he wanted to start trying for baby 2 ***tonight***. I began to have chest pains and had to sit down because the thought gave me so much anxiety. He thought I was being dramatic. I have had panic attacks before, I know one was coming. 

I hate to just say “no”, but...no! My body cannot do it again! My brain cannot handle TWO! He wants the age gap to be 2-3 years, but that means getting pregnant THIS YEAR!! I HAVE TWO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL HOW WILL I COPE WITH THAT??!!

I hope this makes sense. I’m typing this while I breastfeed my daughter to sleep because I need to do homework and my mom isn’t available and my husband is at work. So I’m a little distracted. 

Tl;dr how do I talk to my husband when he wants babies NOW and I don’t want any more any time soon. We argue every time we talk about it. "
23,"Me [26F] with my SIL [26F]; SIL stopped talking to me after she found out DH [31M] and I are trying for a baby.


Dear Husband and I have been together for 5 years (married 1 year). He is obviously the older brother to my SIL in this situation. Sister-in-law and I were really, really close; she and her husband even hosted us at their house after DH and I were in a bad car accident a few years ago. I considered her my closest friend since that happened.

She and her husband [married 3 years] are also trying to conceive but are having troubles. I have been very sympathetic and wouldn't bring up anything about it since it is a touchy subject for her. However, my DH and I don't want to wait to start a family with his age, and with us being newlyweds SIL even took the time to set me aside and tell me that even though she and BIL are having trouble trying to start a family, ""don't be afraid to bring up having a family in front of me. I understand.""

Hearing that meant a lot to me and it gave me some relief; I didn't start spouting off by any stretch, but 4 months later I did let it slip one night over dinner and drinks with DH, her and BIL that we were trying to start a family. 

At this point, SIL puts her beer down to double-check, ""You're *trying*?"" I was caught off guard with that question, but told her that yeah, we were.

She was pretty quiet the rest of the night but it was a busy evening so I didn't notice much until the next time we saw her at a family event. We used to hang out side by side and chat away whenever we could, now she was standing opposite side of the room refusing to look at me. She has been like this since. Other family members are coming to DH and saying that she is upset that we are trying, SIL and BIL have both angry-texted DH and told him something along the lines that 'I am young and should wait' (for them to have a baby first, I assume?). I haven't pushed any conversations on her, I don't want her to resent me or her brother in this, but I am between a rock and a hard place.

**TL;DR:** SIL and I were best friends. SIL and BIL are having fertility issues. SIL tells me she will understand if DH and I start trying for a family too. I tell her we are trying. She and BIL don't look at us unless we are within a 3 foot radius, and if we are face-to-face, they hardly say hello.
"
24,"I [22M] anonymously deliver greeting cards to my grandmother [77F] from my deceased grandfather. I feel guilty about lying to her about it. Should I tell her the truth?


Hi. First off, I want to say that I’m not trying to brag or draw attention to my good (at least that’s the intent) deeds. I’m having some turmoiled feelings about this. 

A couple of years ago, my grandfather passed away. His widow, my grandmother, lives alone, doesn’t receive company often, and doesn’t have any non-relative friends other than a scratch-off ticket machine down the street from her house. She often brings up the fact that she is lonely, and that she misses my grandfather. 

After Grandpa died, I went through his garage to see if any of his personal belongings had sentimental value to me. He gave me the go-ahead to take whatever I wanted before he died. My Grandpa was a mild hoarder and kept *everything*--case in point: bills from the milkman in the 1950s and every pair of shoes he ever owned as an adult. 

Buried deep in the garage, I found a box full of greeting cards, all of which are addressed to my grandmother from my grandfather, written at various points in time throughout their 50 year marriage. Since making this discovery, whenever Grandma's birthday or their anniversary rolls around, I pick out one of Grandpa's cards and place it in her mailbox when she is away from the house. She enjoys reading these cards again all these years later--she has explicitly stated as much. 


Grandma is deeply religious and believes that this is Grandpa's way of communicating with her from Heaven. **Note:** she understands that these cards aren't materializing from nowhere. She understands that there is a living human being behind this; she just thinks Grandpa is sort of arranging this by ""motivating"" the person (me) and providing them with the means to do it. She does not know that I am the one orchestrating this. 

Every time I do this, it clearly makes her happy. She calls everyone she can think of to tell them about it. However, she also asks if they are the person that left it. This invariably includes calling me, and I lie to her every time. She wants to know who, but I don't want her to. 

I just feel that taking the curtain away would detract from how special it is to her, whether she knows it or not. I feel like revealing myself would be to make the act about me and my good nature, and not about Grandpa and their love for one another. I hate that thought. In my head, I'm doing this to make her happy and to honor Grandpa (I know with certainty that he would have loved this idea). But I do feel guilty every time I lie to her about it. 

The only people who know I'm the one behind this are my dad and a close friend of mine. My dad thinks it's great, but my friend said I'm toying with an old woman's emotions and need to stop. I don't see it that way. Am I wrong?

I plan to keep doing this anonymously, but I wanted to hear your input in case I am in fact ass-backwards on the matter. 

• Is it morally wrong for me to do this card thing altogether?
• Is it okay to continue retaining my anonymity?

————————
tl;dr: I found a box full of cards my deceased grandfather wrote to my grandmother. On special occassions, I anonymously deliver a fitting card to her house. She likes this, but wants to know who’s behind it. I refuse to reveal myself. Is this wrong for me to do?"
25,"My [29M] wife [27F] is upset that I did not surprise her with a vacation for her birthday. I instead gifted her a week anywhere in the world. How could I have handled this better?


So my wife and I have been married for 6 years and up until now we haven't had any major issues.  Back at the beginning of April I started asking her what she was going to want for her birthday(4/19) and she said she wanted to go on vacation somewhere, but didn't specify where or when.  I press her for more details in the weeks (days) leading up to her birthday and finally when I light heartedly say ""Well I can't take you on a vacation if I don't know where you want to go."" 

Boom goes the dynamite. 

She immediately starts crying hysterically saying that she told me she wanted a surprise vacation for her birthday and now it's too late to make reservations for travel/stay somewhere, and that it's won't be as special if it's not *ON* her birthday.  At this point I'm so surprised that I don't know what to say.  I start asking her whats wrong, and telling her it's O.K., I can still take her somewhere within driving distance or have a weekend at a nice hotel downtown.  She cries for a bit longer, saying she is disappointed, and that she wanted to do something special *ON* her birthday.  I'm finally able to get her to calm down when I tell her we can stay at a fancy hotel downtown for the weekend but it'll be $1500 just for the hotel, then another $400-$500 for activities OR, still go to dinner / date on her birthday, then spend the money we would have spent on a local hotel on a big vacation anywhere in the world for a week but at a later date (this was my original gift idea).  She finally agrees but is still mopey for the rest of the night.

Her birthday rolls around and we go out, the whole time she makes little comments here or there.  Things like, ""Oh I bet they are here on a vacation"" or ""I wonder if it's her birthday"", I power through, put on a smiling face, and have just an O.K. time.  Since then she's made little effort to actually plan a vacation and has been in an overall miserable mood.  I've tried to have conversations around it, explaining that even if I had known she wanted to be surprised with a vacation, I wouldn't have had enough notice to take time off work, plan everything, and keep it all a secret.  Also, I only get X hours of vacation time a year, and that we'd have to shuffle something else out if we want to take an ""extra"" vacation (we already travel pretty regularly throughout the year).  It usually ends with more tears and frustration.   

I'm not sure what to do at this point to make things ""right"" again.  Should I just surprise her with the ""big"" vacation earlier than she thought it'd be?  What could I have done in the moment to make things go more smoothly?  I love my wife and I want her to be happy, it really hurts me to see her like this.  Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR; Misunderstood what my wife wanted for her birthday, still sleeping with the dogs.

26,"Me (26f) with my mom (60f), how do I tell her she can’t leave her personal care home?


Hi. I will try to make this as short as possible. My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson’s about 4 years ago. She has lived alone for about 2 years. I should also say i am my moms financial POA. Around Mother’s Day last year, she fell and hit her head, and caused a brain bleed.             
             
In October, she fell and broke her hip. She was placed in a nursing home for rehab, where she fell again and broke the same hip within a month. She has not walked since October. My boyfriend (who is a saint through all of this) and I researched and visited different personal care homes to place her in because the nursing home was negligent and felt a nursing home isn’t the appropriate place, and we also can’t afford it.           
           
I should mention that in no way can she live with me, and I cannot live with her. She was very abusive to me since my early teenage years. I do the best I can to help her now but I cannot sacrifice my adult life to help her that much. Also, hiring even a part time care giver is too expensive because my moms mortgage payment is $735 and she only makes $1.9k a month.           
           
We found a perfect place for her, only $2.2k a month, the lady who runs it is so nice, my mom loves her roommates, the house is decorated in a way that should make my mom feel at home. She has been there since December. At first, we told her she would only be there for about 2 months until she got her strength back. But she’s been doing rehab and the lady who owns the home  is a retired RN, they both said she cannot walk and shouldn’t be alone.          
           
Somedays she can barely get in the car to go to lunch. She has been in her wheelchair since December, she makes no effort to really try. I understand, I’m sure it’s very difficult and my mom was always the type to stop when the going gets tough.              
         
The problem is, she has been flip flopping on going home. Sometimes she says she wants to stay at her personal care home forever, sometimes she asks when she can leave. The issue is, we haven’t paid on her mortgage for 3 months. I’m already in debt because we were paying until February thinking she could go home. In my state, they can forclose after 4 months. She cannot go home in this state she is in, and we cannot afford to pay the personal care home and the mortgage.               
             
She is also very emotional. The lady running the home has changed her depression meds, so she’s less crazy crying now, but if she hears something she doesn’t like, she will scream at me to shut up until I leave. My boyfriend has more tact than I do with my mom, and she really loves him, so I wonder if he can tell her she has to stay and the house is gone? He says he can try but we have no clue how to phrase is. I thought my brother could step in, she always favored him, but he has only come around 5 times since she first fell, and two of them he fell asleep during.                
               
Does anyone have advice for how to tell my mom what is happening?            
            
**tldr my mom is sick and can’t go home, she has been in a personal care home for months, and her house is ready to foreclose, how can I break this to her?**"
27,"UPDATE: How do I (23/F) be okay with my boyfriend's (26/M) relationship with his sister (24/F)?


Link to old post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8b5kpd/how_do_i_23f_be_okay_with_my_boyfriends_26m/

I came here to extend my deepest gratitude to all who reached out and replied. I felt very (for lack of a better term) ""crazy"" as I felt so bothered by the situation but he made it seem so... normal, and something I should get over asap. You were all so validating. I cannot thank this community enough.

We broke up for a myriad of reasons a few days ago. For the best, I know, though I did love him deeply despite this concern and others.

To close the loop regarding how this specific issue was brought up - him and I were talking a week ago and he was expressing his concerns with the relationship. Very long story short, his issues were 1. I don't eat meat, 2. ""we don't debate enough"", and 3. his sister and I have a strained relationship, and he doesn't like that. 

In response to #3 I countered with ""I understand that can be difficult but you need to understand that is 100% on her, not me, and should not be reflected as an issue of mine."" To which he replied, ""Yeah, I know she can be a bitch, and you're not wrong, but she's my SISTER!"" Then something to the effect of ""yeah she didn't like you dating me but she's not going to push away other girls, right?"" 

TL;DR: I broke up with him."
28,"Not sure how to handle in laws (61M, 62F) asking us (33M, 31F) for money.


Not sure if this is the appropriate forum for this or not.

My wife and I have done well for ourselves. Both of us are in our early 30s. We both put ourselves through school and grad school. Paid our grad school loans off quickly (400k) The only debt we have is our house (100k debt). We have a daughter due in a three months. Combined income is 530k a year.

Anyway, my wife's parents were at our house and saw a bank statement on our counter a few weeks ago. We've worked really hard to not let them know what we make bc they are generally terrible with their money.

They approached my wife yesterday to ask if we would consider purchasing a new car for them. They had a paper showing they had a quote for an escalade for like 80k.

Then this morning my wife's sister called saying she needs some money to repair the roof on her house.

I just honestly feel blown away with all of this. I don't have a problem helping people out that truly need it, but im not about to buy an escalade for someone when I drive a Camry. I'm also not about to set a precedent that we are working to just support my wife's family.

Am I wrong for feeling put off by this after we've lived well below our means to get to this point only to have her family come in and act like blood suckers trying to siphon money off our hard work?

I'm trying to formulate a plan on how to approach this. Both of us are against providing any support for these frivolous expenses, but I'm afraid my wife will feel ostracized by her family without helping them out. I don't think she realizes they are just going to keep asking for money until we tell them no.

Any advice on how to approach this, tactfully?

TL;DR Wife's family found out we make good money and have started hitting us up for it. "
29,"My [23F] Dad [70M] does not respect my boundaries and is emailing my personal information to strangers.


Members of my family use Reddit and I have to try to disguise some things, so sorry if some things sound weird or odd, it's probably because of that.

I currently live with my parents while finishing grad school. I am in my final year of grad school and I have plans to move out and get my own place once I find a job. I've had a difficult time getting a job, though, probably because of the bad job market. 

My Dad works in this field but I can't say he's particularly popular with a lot of people. I've told him repeatedly, and in no uncertain terms, that I prefer to make the job search on my own and that I don't want his help with it. This is because he has ""helped"" in the past and I've found it to be very stressful and not fruitful. 

I learned today that he has written up a ""resume"" for me based on the pieces of information I've given about my internships and other employment, and has been sending it to people he sees as potential employers in the state—some big ones. I learned this when I talked to a potential employer and they were familiar with my name because of the ""emails about me"" they've gotten from [my dad's name]. I was very upset about this and did something I shouldn't have done, and searched up my name in his work email (which I have access to for unrelated and somewhat complex circumstances). I saw many weird emails he sent where he talked about me, sent this resume, talked about weird personal stories about me, and said things about my job search and emotions that I shared with him in confidence. 

I found out from my Mom that he also wrote several people at my school, which he has donated to in the past. They had meetings without me present and discussed my grades, personality, and everything. These people discussed information with him about my grades, academic performance, and interviewing skills, like an after-school conference. They apparently knew that I wasn't aware of these meetings and didn't want him to have them, and met with him anyway. 

I confronted him about all of them and he screamed at me that I ""always keep him out of the loop,"" that I don't know ""how to defer to his seventy years of experience,"" and that he is on my side and I'm always acting like a jerk and not sharing any information with him. 

I'm feeling very, very upset about this and completely out of control. I'm very upset especially that he met with people at my school and they talked about my personal information. I can't talk to my family or friends about it and I am completely lost.

tl;dr: My Dad is sending out emails with my personal information and academic information in them to employers without my knowledge or consent. He's met with people at my school without my knowledge, consent, or presence. What do I do? Please help. "
30,"My [22f] brother [20m] seems to be screwing my boyfriend [25m, together 1 yr] on a deal that was meant to help my brother out. Don’t know what to do.


I’m really confused and upset by my brother’s actions here and I’m not sure what I can do.

So my brother recently got his first full-time job. Being young and kinda dumb, one of the first things he did was run out and buy a car he couldn’t really afford. The predictable result was he fell behind on payments.

Once the car was being targeted for repossesion by the bank, my brother was desperately texting everyone he knows looking for a way to offload the car and get out from under it. It’s kind of hard, because my brother did not take very good care of it and the car is not in very good shape right now.

Enter my boyfriend. He works on cars for a living, and he offered my brother a way out. Basically, my boyfriend offered him the cash to bring it current and prevent repo, then boyfriend would head out to where my brother lives (one state over), then buy the car for the price it would cost my brother to pay off the loan. Boyfriend didn’t really need a new car, but he lokes tinkering on things and figured he could fix it up and find something to do with it.

My brother agreed to all of the above very enthusiastically. Boyfriend was slightly concerned about putting up the cash to bring the car current (several hundred dollars), but I vouched for my brother as he has always been trustworthy. Silly me.

The car was brought current, my boyfriend caught a cheap flight out to finish the deal and then drive the car back home. Aaand, my brother suddenly went incommunicado.

They were supposed to meet yesterday, but my brother never showed up. He is ignoring calls and messages. No one is sure what his deal is now. My boyfriend can afford to hang out a few more days, but he has to be back at work no later than Monday.

So as far as we can tell, my brother took the money to keep the repo men away, but is flaking on the rest of the deal he agreed to.

My boyfriend has been pretty patient, and even sent him a final message saying that he would be willing to consider the cash he already put up as a loan if my brother promises to pay it back when he is able, but he wanted an answer one way or the other so he can at least head back home if that is what my brother is doing.

Still no answer. I feel humiliated that my brother would do this after I vouched for him. I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend has had the patience of a saint so far, but that is rapidly running out.

What can I do here?

TL;DR: My boyfriend offered to help my brother out from a car he cant afford by buying the car for the payoff price of the car. Brother took the cash to keep the repo men away, but flaked before finishing the deal he made. Don’t know what to do now."

The next thing I know I am awake and someone is knocking on the front door, not really loudly but like enough to wake me up (I am a light sleeper too.) Sometimes my neighbor forgets to lock the downstairs door, okay a lot of the time, so basically anyone can walk up to the apartment doors. 


So I start freaking out because it's like 1:30 in the morning and I have no idea who is at the door. I was scared to ask who was there because what if they are some psycho who is gonna break in if they know a woman is home alone?  I know it doesn't make a lot of sense but this has never happened to me before and I was freaking out. So I ended up locking myself in the bathroom and calling the cops. I was just like, there is someone knocking at my door and I have no idea who it is. So they send an officer out to check on me, I tell them about how you can just walk up the back stairs. 


The officer gets there and I hear him talking to whoever is in the hall and I recognise my BF's voice so I open the door and I am just speechless. My BF is really drunk and he is like ""oh hey there you are, I was coming by to say hi."" So I tell the officer that everything is ok and thank him and he goes away. To BF I am like what the hell. He tells me that he missed me but didn't want to wake me up???? so he thought he'd just ""knock gently"" and see if I was awake. 


Anyway I tell him I am going to bed and I am angry and he is being super drunk and obnoxious, so I put him to bed on the couch and go to bed myself. In the morning we talk and he is now mad at me for calling the cops. I explain to him that what he did was insane, and as a woman living alone, really terrifying to me. He left in a bad mood saying that I ""over reacted"" and he ""just thought it would be fun to surprise me"" to which I was like ""you know I go to bed early."" 


I really don't know what to do. He's mad at me, now I am starting to worry if I did over react, but like that's how women get murdered sometimes, they open the door to strangers. I was just trying to protect myself from what was really terrifying in the moment and now my boyfriend is calling me uptight and a drama queen. I kind of want to break up with him over this because he just seems so inconsiderate, but I don't know, maybe I am overreacting?  I like him a lot, we've been dating about six months and this is out of character for him. But this has really upset me and I don't know if I can go back to the way things were. 


TLDR; boyfriend thought it would be fun to visit me on the way home from bars closing, I thought he was a murderer, called the cops, everything turned out fine with that but now BF thinks I overreacted, and I think he was inconsiderate and am upset that he is not able to see how terrifying what he did was for me. Don't know if I can resolve this, kind of want to break up. Looking for advice on how to handle this/get him to see my POV. "
32,"My [23m] dad [50s] was accused of sexual harassment, and now he is pissed because I refuse to attend his wedding with a much younger woman. Help?


I'll get to the point.

My dad was accused of sexual harassment by a woman who claimed he kept asking her on dates repeatedly, sending her unwanted gifts and bothering her to no end. She said he was manipulative towards her. I do not doubt it for a second.

Now, my dad is engaged to this woman who is 21 years old. I'm pretty sure what their marriage is about but none of my business. I refuse to attend it, however, and he is super pissed off and saying I should support him, as his son, ""on the next step of his life"". I think this is a joke, but he won't leave me alone about it. Help?

tl;dr: dad accused of sexual harassment and marrying a 21 year old, insists i attend his wedding."
33,"UPDATE: I’m (39M) strongly considering ending engagement to my fiancee (31F) due to alcohol and temper issues


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8g0rvu/im\_39m\_strongly\_considering\_ending\_engagement\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8g0rvu/im_39m_strongly_considering_ending_engagement_to/)

To summarize the original post, my fiancee's \(""Amy""\) alcohol and temper issues had me considering ending our engagement. She's been the legal guardian of her niece and nephew for the past two years. Amy's mom was baby\-sitting both kids last weekend, at which point I decided to discuss with Amy the future of our relationship. I received a lot of good advice in the original thread \(a few posters didn't like me, and well, I guess they're entitled to their opinion\). I was back and forth all week on whether to end the relationship or try to fix it. Ultimately, I decided to chat with Amy about saving our relationship. We talked for pretty much all of Saturday.

I starting by telling Amy that the angry outbursts toward me and subsequent apologies were taking its toll on me mentally, and that I've reached the point where I'm walking on eggshells and overly cautious of everything I say or do in order to avoid the next outburst, even avoiding talking on some evenings. I asked her in the future that we discuss differences of opinion in a more rational, respectful manner and to avoid yelling because it's not really healthy for either of us. She was receptive of this, and after more discussion, she acknowledged that she needed to see a therapist. She had been to a therapist some years ago when we were just friends, but stopped after a few months because her therapist wasn't very good, and the medication she was prescribed wasn't working. She seems determined to make it work this time and has already scheduled an appointment for tomorrow with a very reputable psychologist.

I didn't harp on the drinking too much because we already had that discussion a few weeks earlier after the drunk driving incident, but I agreed to go sober with her for 30 days. She'll probably have to avoid alcohol in the future anyway if her doctor puts her on any anti\-depression medication.

I also asked in general what we could do to make our lives easier at the moment. We had planned on hiring a nanny when the school year is over for the 2 days a week I work in the office, and I would watch them for the 3 days I work from home, but we realized that in an effort to save money, this was foolish. We are hiring a nanny for 5 days a week during the summer months because it would've been impossible for me to get any work done at home. We've hired a cleaning lady for one time to deal with the current mess in our house, and agreed to work together to keep the house cleaner in the future. We're also going to prepare more meals in the future that'll last multiple evenings, and order out a little more frequently.

Amy also delved into other things that had been bothering her as of late. I forgot to mention this in the original post, but she has been dealing with sexual harassment for a few months from a douchebag at work, and she's about ready to go to HR. She's also down on herself about her weight; she has gained about 50 pounds in the last year; whereas I've gone the opposite way and have gotten in really good shape since January, and, despite how much she said she enjoys it from a bedroom aspect, it has left her feeling more insecure. We've also agreed that we're going to try and eat a little more healthy. Upon reflection, I also acknowledged my comment about laying off 3\-4 glasses of wine a night in order to lose weight was insensitive, so I apologized for that.

The last thing we discussed was the wedding. With all of the adjustments we're making in the next few months along with the stress we're currently undergoing, **we decided to postpone the wedding and are looking at May 2019** as we work through our issues. We mutually agreed to reschedule it now before it got too much closer and before we got too deep into wedding planning. It was going to be simple ceremony with 30 guests at most, so it's not too much of a hit. Actually, if anybody has advice for handling the inevitable questions as to why we're rescheduling the wedding, I'd love to hear it. She also told me that she really wanted this relationship to work out because she couldn't imagine loving anybody else, and that she couldn't imagine a better father\-figure for the children, which after typing that has me a little emotional, to be honest.

Finally, spending most of the day talking, we decided on a romantic dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, the first we've done so in months, and just having an easy\-going evening reminded me why I fell in love with her to begin with. It may not have come across too well in my original post because of frustration, but after talking with Amy on Saturday, we still love each other and are determined to make it work.

**tl;dr** Fiancee' and I had a discussion determining the future of our relationship, we decided to remain together and make some lifestyle changes, but also postponed the wedding until next year, any advice dealing with others' questions on why the wedding date was pushed back is welcome"
34,"How can I(24,M) even tell my sister (37,f) to stop leaving her kid with me without asking?


So my sister is divorced, and the ex husband is a piece of shit. He isn't expected to do much for their shared kid, a 7 year old boy we'll call Y. Because of this, and the fact that my sister works full-time (for the record, so do I) my sister has relied heavily on our parents and me to... more than babysit, essentially co-parent her child. 

My sister doesn't live with us, but I live with our parents since I work closeby and am saving for an apartment (I pay rent weekly to our parents for this). 

The main issue is that my sister no longer even asks if me, or my parents can babysit. She assumes we will.


She has done things like drive to our house, let Y out of the car, and drive away, without so much as texting me to let me know i'm expected to babysit. I have been forced to cancel plans because of this. It's been going on like this since Y was born, but I've been finding it harder lately since I work now, and no longer have the flexibility/escape of college. I love my nephew. That's not the issue. The issue is that I want to be his uncle, not his father.  


Additionally, I pay a weekly rent to our parents for the use of the ""spare"" bedroom. When Y stays over, he must sleep in the bed with me. This happens 2-5 times a week. It's at the stage now where it feels like a luxury to me to be able to sleep alone in my own bed.


When I have previously tried to set boundaries, such as recently asking if Y could stay in his other uncle's house for a night instead of sharing with me, I was told ""yeah, of course"" by my sister. Y then said ""I don't want to stay there,"" (the reason is because he uses the computer here, and there is no computer in Other Uncle's house) so my sister said ""oh then you don't have to,"" and never even asked me or our parents. She just drove off, leaving Y with me.


To be entirely honest, I'm furious at her actions. I pay rent here, and it's not low. It's actually the exact same amount I used to pay when I lived away from home in an apartment (As an aside, my mother and I were working out how much rent I would pay and were agreeing on a figure, when my sister said ""Oh that's way too low"" and named the new price, which is a third of my weekly wage. This is the rent I now pay. I would just move out, but I don't drive yet, and because I live in such a small, rural town, there is no public transport, or apartments currently for rent) 


I have no children myself because I don't want them, and I have never wanted them. I'm furious that I have raised my nephew more than his father has, and I am furious that my sister will ASK her ex if he can babysit his own kid, but TELLS me when I must. Because of this rage, I can't tell if I'm being over sensitive. 


This post was something I've wanted to make for some time, but it was triggered earlier when my sister told me ""You will have to babysit tomorrow night. I know you don't like to share the bed with Y... So you will have to take him up to my house and babysit him there."" I have work. Y has school. I don't drive. I don't entirely know why that conversation made me so angry, but it did. 

tl:dr: my sister assumes I'll always babysit her kid, to the extent where she no longer even asks, she just tells me when.
 
I guess my question is; am I overreacting? Do I need to set boundaries, and if so, HOW?"
35,"Parents(45F,53M) constantly berate me(19M) for having curly hair and dark skin, it has wrecked my self esteem to shreds and they just don't stop even after I have requested them countless times.


We're Indian, and for some reason every Indian is *obsessed* with Fair/white skin. My parents are just like that. My Mom is mostly just as dark complexioned as I am, but my dad is really fair. Both of my younger brothers are as fair as milk too. It's just me who looks like a burnt piece of coal. 

To top it off(No pun Intended) my hair is curly and is difficult to manage. Combing my hair is totally useless. It just wants to be free, and there's nothing I can do about it. I just focus on keeping it healthy, so I use products targeted at my hair type and oil it once a week. To be fair, my hair is healthy. But it doesn't necessarily look good on me I guess. My mom's hair is **the same.**

Both of my younger brothers take after my father. They fair skin, wavy and beautiful hair, and are much more confident and outgoing than I am. They don't get blasted at for being the way they are. Ever. They're allowed to grow their hair. 

All my life I've never been allowed to keep my hair longer than an inch. I was actually completely unaware of the fact that my hair is curly until I let it grow, and that was when I was 18. Everybody seems to like my hair, but my parents don't. Also, they've applied all sorts of fairness creams and oils on me. I've had horrible allergic reactions to those, and I still have marks. They applied it all over my body so I have boil marks/patches on my chest, back, stomach and even on my thighs and butt. 

They have always been so fixated on my appearance. I hate it. I've never had any confidence in the way I look. When I was 17 I was even afraid to look at a mirror because I would become depressed and it was horrible. It was only when I met my first girlfriend that I actually considered the notion that I could be attractive too. 

They are both always making off sided comments at the way I look. Things like, ""We have a homeless person with us"", ""We can't take you because people would think that we're poor"",""You look like a beggar"" and so on. A fair amount of racist comments have been directed against me too. I have been compared to coal and crows among other things. My brothers get, ""You're handsome"" and I get, ""You were beautiful when you were a baby"".

Over time I've tried not to let these comments get under my skin. But it only goes so far. I've had multiple conversations with them telling me how hurtful it is. They stop for a while, then start again. My youngest brother does it too, but he's too young to comprehend how it affects me. Right now, they're on me to make me cut my hair short. It's not even long, just around 2.5 inches as of now. They just don't stop, it's just constant. Whenever they see me they have to make some sort of comment about how ugly I look. These aren't things that I can change, and I'm sorry that I look like I'm from a lower social class, but I have started to embrace the way I look. 

I'm moving out by June/July, I just need another months pay slip to afford an apartment near my college. I just have to bear with this till then. I'm so tired of this, but I have to keep up with this. I just want to know of any way to get them to stop. 

TL;DR :
Parents(45F,53M) constantly berate me(19M) for having curly hair and dark skin, it has wrecked my self esteem to shreds and they just don't stop even after I have requested them countless times. Now they want me to cut my hair, and I don't want to. Please tell me ways to cope with this."
36,"Am I [30F] too uptight about my husband's [31M] distaste for doing things the ""normal"" way?


My husband and I have been married for almost 4 years, together for many years before that. No kids yet, and overall we have a good relationship. We *usually* communicate and resolve conflict well, but there is one area where we don't.

I'm at a bit of a loss how to put this pattern into words, but will try my best. I feel like this makes me sound like such a judgmental b-word, but sometimes Mike will get set on doing things ""his"" way, and I feel like ""his"" way sucks. Ok hear me out. I am generally completely fine with people doing things in the way that works best for them, even if it's not how I would do it. The thing is, I think that sometimes he gets so stuck on figuring things out himself and *not* doing it conventionally, that he gets kind of blind to the fact that the way he's doing it is *not* working. Now this is fine when it's just his own hobbies or whatever. But when it's a project for our house or an activity we're sharing together, it gets frustrating.

I don't consider myself someone who is particularly bound by tradition or the ""correct"" way of doing things in general, but with Mike I often wish that he would look up the ""normal"" way to do something and then riff from there, rather than just making up his own thing.

The other aspect to this is that I am usually pretty tentative/open about my methods for things, frequently asking other people ""how should we approach this?"" The only time that I will confidently suggest a way to do something is if I have researched it or have extensive experience with it. But whenever I say something like ""I think it goes like this"", he will act like I just made it up on the spot (like he does) and treats it as ""just my opinion"" on equal grounds to his opinion. Like I know that everyone is entitled to their own viewpoint, but I swear sometimes he just makes up counterpoints for the sake of having an ""equally valid opinion."" About stupid stuff like driving laws that are easily referencable, things my doctor told me about my health, etc.

So my question is two-fold: (1) Do I just need to lighten up about this stuff or does it make sense that this bothers me? And (2) how to approach this issue with him?

Examples:
* Cardboard recycling (lol): His parents never recycled paper products. When we moved in together, he decided that the way to recycle large cardboard boxes was to cut them into 2-inch wide strips *with a small pocket knife* and pour them into the same bags that other paper goes into. I told him, ""I'm pretty sure we can just collapse the boxes and tie them in a bundle."" He tells me that I'm wrong, and the garbage collecters would never pick them up if we just left them out on the street like that. I download our city's recycling instructions, and show them to him. I also show him other cardboard bundles on the street on garbage day. He doesn't care, he says he likes doing it his way. Ok fine, not the end of the world. But now whenever we're getting chores done, he has to spend 30+ minutes cutting up the boxes, which takes forever and ruins his knife, and he lets boxes stack up on top of each other in the kitchen until he gets around to disposing of them his way.
* Tree pruning: We had a small pine tree growing next to our house. Some of the branches (just a few at the very top) were hitting an electrical wire and he asked me if I'd mind if he trimmed them, to which I said ok. He ended up cutting ALL the branches off the tree (all of them, it's a trunk with NO branches on it), leaving them all over the yard. So now we had a dead, awful-looking tree right in front of our house, plus branches all over. I asked him if next time he could please do some quick research into how to prune branches away from electrical lines so we could see how much of the tree we could keep. And he basically said, ""no I like doing it this way."" I also INSISTED that he not leave the branches lying all over our front yard (this has also been a pattern- he'll do an optional project and then leave a big mess for weeks/months). And I told him, our town's yard waste guidelines say you can just tie them up into bundles and leave them on the sidewalk on pick-up day, you can just do that really quick. Well just like the cardboard, he at first insisted on cutting up the branches into tiny pieces so they fit in the yardwaste bags where we put grass clippings, etc. After like an hour of doing this he has barely made a dent, and I ended up asking him in a pretty frustrated tone, ""Can you PLEASE just tie them up, so we can move on to the other things we have to do today?"" He did, but was pissed about it. This happens a lot, where I feel like on the one hand, if I want something done a particular way I should do it myself, and on the other hand, I resent the idea of stepping in and cleaning up a mess that he left doing a ""home improvement"" project that wasn't helpful.
* Cooking rice. He insists on never following the directions on the package. Which is fine if the rice comes out good. Well, he adds way more water than it calls for and frequently takes the lid off while cooking *and then always complains that the rice comes out too soupy.* So (only when he is complaining), I say ""Well why don't you try following the directions?"" Which he usually dismisses away by either saying that his way works *sometimes* (it does, to be fair), or just saying nothing and getting huffy.
* Painting: We were painting some wood pieces for a DIY project. He was roughly dragging the brush back and forth with too little paint, and commented in frustration that his brush was losing too many bristles, cursing it as a cheap, awful brush, etc. I commented that if he paints a little smoother in one direction he wouldn't lose as many bristles. He said ""no that's not how I do it."" I noticed at that point that the part he was painting had a lot of bare spots with wood showing through, and that he was actually roughing up the surface of the wood. I asked him if we could talk about our methods so we can make sure we're getting the look we want, and he said he just wanted to do his half his way while I do my half my way. When I was like, ""no, this is getting permanently installed in our living room and I think we should have a plan so it doesn't look crappy"" he said his way is better and I should leave him alone. I reminded him that this was how my contractor friend had shown me how to use house paint (whereas Mike has never painted anything like this before, which I did not mention). We eventually got through it and we touched up the bare spots and removed the bristles he lost. Afterward he was all huffy and his eyes were a little misty. I asked if he was mad and he said that he just thought I was painting the wrong way and doesn't see why we couldn't do it his way.

Now, he's aware that he does things unconventionally and that it often doesn't turn out well. When he is in a good mood, he makes jokes about it, like he'll say ""hey, you want me to do [xyz thing]? Don't worry I'll do it the real way and not Mike Way."" And we have talked about this numerous times. I will explain that he can do whatever he wants for things that don't directly affect me. And he does have a VERY unconventionally laid out music room, and his smart phone has ALL internet functions turned off, and he folds his laundry and organizes his belongings Mike Way. All of this makes no sense to me but doesn't bother me. He also will go on experimental journeys where he'll just Mike his way through a craft, like for example he was making furniture for a couple years, and he readily admitted that some of his earlier pieces were pretty ""wack."" Some of them turned out pretty cool and we use them, and I do think it's neat that he explored this on his own.

However we keep running into this on house projects, major purchases, etc. that have consequences for me. I find myself asking time and again for him to look up how something is done before he jumps into it - not even to follow the directions per se, but just to be AWARE of them and make his decisions with that knowledge. When he is in a certain mood he gets *very* defensive about it. I constantly feel like I have to nag him or be a controlling harpy, which I certainly do not enjoy doing. I also end up citing sources and over-explaining so many things that I feel would be obvious for most people. (Like *why* I want to have branches on the trees in our yard.) So I would like some input on if I am being too uptight and need to share the reins a bit more, or if it's reasonable to take issue with this, and if so, how else to address it?

**TL;DR: Husband likes making things up as he goes, I like looking up standard methods before jumping in. We both mind our own business for personal things, but butt heads in situations where the results affect us both. Do I need to lighten up? How to approach him (again) about this?**"
37,"I'm [37F] 7 months pregnant and no longer want to have a baby; my husband [38M] of 6 years desperately wants a baby


This probably isn't the kind of question for this sub, but I'm panicking. I'm scared, and I feel this is the only place to go because I have some shred of anonymity.

My husband and I have been married for six years, and we've both wanted kids like nobody's business. We started trying right after we got married, but I kept experiencing issues. Then, his mom got sick, so we put our plans on hold. When we started to try again, we didn't have any luck. We tried to adopt, and we got really close, but at the last second the birth mother changed her mind. After that, we decided to call it quits. It was sort of written in the stars for us. Then, we decided to just try one more time. Of course, that one more time was \*the\* time. We've been watching this pregnancy like a hawk, no chances taken. I was so excited. Our nursery has been ready for years, and I spend all my time in it. I loved to talk to my baby, I wouldn't shut up about how much I loved our child. And my husband has been overjoyed, he tells everyone he knows. I'm seven months pregnant right now.

And I'm not excited. Like, a week and a half ago, I started realizing that I can't do this. And it's not the normal panic of being a mom, it's real dread. I was looking at the ultrasound the other day, and I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to just push the baby out right then and there, then run for the hills. I just felt paralyzed with that feeling of ""I can't."" I can't picture myself feeding my baby, or rocking them to sleep, or changing their diaper, or tying their shoes. I don't even want to. I feel ready, I feel prepared, I know the whole deal\- but I feel like I just don't want to. All the excitement is gone, I can't feel anything but anger towards my baby. I feel like it's going to ruin my life, and I'm going to hate it, and it's going to hate me.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should tell my husband or hope it goes away, because I know it would just crush him and everyone I've spoken to says that they've gotten those nerves before having their baby. And I want it to just be nerves, but it can't be. It just can't be. Everytime I think of being a mom, my insides just turn and I want to punch something. And I know that something's wrong because I've wanted this since I was a kid. I've wasted half my savings trying to do this. And now, I'm here and I feel like this and it's not right. Do I tell him? Will this go away? 

TL;DR: I'm panicking because I don't want to have a child anymore."
38,"I [28m] kicked a creepy guy [30m] out of my club, but he's sorry and wants to make things right. Should I give him another chance?


I am the leader of a social club in my city, I'll edit the specifics and say it's a rock climbing group. We have casual meetups once a week, and several weekends a year, some members travel together to nearby cities for rock climbing competitions. Anyone can join our group, I just handle organizational things like signing up for competitions, lodging, and transportation. The ""core"" of our group is pretty close-knit, while we have other more casual members, and I like to think we are accepting of everyone.

So last year, this guy ""Ralph"" joins the club. He's married, new to the area, and looking to make friends who share his hobby. Great! My first impression was that he was a nice dude, a little overly-friendly at times, but can't fault him for that.

After a few months, two of the women in the group approach me to complain about Ralph. They say he's been extremely rude to them, and say he's being very negative and criticizing them about their climbing for no reason. I was shocked, as I agree this behavior is totally unacceptable for a fun meetup group.

So I told Ralph to knock it off or he would no longer be welcome in the group. Ralph was extremely apologetic to me, said he was sorry for the negative attitude and said he was going through a lot of personal issues. He told me this sob story that he had just started a new job, and thought his wife was going to leave him, etc. I felt kinda bad, so I said just apologize to these women, don't let it happen again, and you can stay.

So a few more months go by, and this girl ""Alicia"" stops showing up to the group. She is a college student at the nearby university, 19 or 20 years old, and doesn't show up all the time anyway (for school breaks, finals, whatever). It's not like I take attendance or anything, so I didn't really notice right away that she had left.

After a few weeks one of the other women in the group reaches out to Alicia and tells me why she left. Apparently, Ralph had been acting inappropriately to her: after every meetup he would pressure her to let him drive her home, would invite her out to dinner, and made inappropriate passes at her. She kept rejecting him but he wouldn't take no for an answer, which obviously made her uncomfortable enough to leave.

I wish Alicia had talked to me or someone else in the group instead of just leaving, but I don't blame her. 

So at the start of our latest meetup I tell Ralph to go home, he's out of the group, and I don't want to see him again. This was already his second chance, and his behavior towards Alicia is strike two and three. Ralph breaks down and tells me he's ""so, so sorry"", says he'll apologize to Alicia and it won't happen again, and again goes on with the story about how he and his wife separated and he didn't mean to make Alicia uncomfortable. He's begging me and begging me to reconsider, as he's made friends with other people in the group (not the women obviously) and it's his ""only source of happiness"". He says he's ""determined to make things right"". I said I'll think about it, but still kicked him out of that meeting.

So at this point I'm conflicted. On one hand, I'm done with Ralph's bullshit, but on the other hand, he seemed genuinely remorseful. It's true he has become close friends with two of the guys in the group, and I know they will be disappointed I kicked Ralph out. 

I just need some outside perspective. Do I give this guy one more chance? Or is it just not worth it?

tl;dr - Guy in my rock climbing group repeatedly being toxic toward women in the group. Begs for another chance, citing personal issues. Wants to make things right. Should I let him back in?"
39,"I (22F) nursed bf (26M) back to health after devastating illness, only to find he's been messaging strangers on reddit for sex. What do I do?


I'm having the worst weekend of my life, please forgive my shitty writing.

My boyfriend and I have been through hell the past 6 months. He was diagnosed with an incredibly rare and dangerous illness, and for a long time we didn't know if he was going to make it. I stayed with him every single night in the hospital, I took care of him while he was at home, I patient\-advocated for him like crazy when the doctors weren't looking after him properly. I spent every hour of every day researching this illness, getting him to specialists, washing his fucking balls because he was too weak to move. I was a modern day Florence Nightingale for this guy. During this time it was just he and I in the house, but when I left, he would lock himself in his room like it was dungeon. He stopped brushing his teeth, getting out of bed, doing anything except playing video games. He's since recovered fully, and is back to work full time, even going to the gym again and taking me to dinners. It's been amazing.

Cut to this weekend \- we had the most wonderful overnight stay at a beautiful place we'd been looking forward to visiting for ages. We talked, laughed, made love multiple times... I was in heaven, as I usually am with him.

Then I find out \(not by snooping\) that he's been writing his incredibly toxic ex\-girlfriend. I confronted him, he lied about it. I showed my evidence, he apologized like crazy and let me read the messages. Nothing flirty, nothing sexual in the slightest. The conversation was there in full, he didn't delete anything. I was hurt/confused about his lying, and why he'd want to reach out to her in the first place, but the last part I can understand after his near death experience and maybe wanting some closure. But the lying? No. We had a big fight, I told him he was breaking my heart with each lie. He proceeds to write her a very dramatic message about how he lied about their convo to me, and how he betrayed my trust by lying, and how he cannot jeopardize the most important thing in his life \(me\), so he is unfriending her. Now, I never asked him to do this. I told him I was hurt about his lying, but I never asked him to cut her off.

A few days later, things have cooled off. We spend another amazing day together, I'm seriously so fucking in love with this guy. But late that night, I get a nagging feeling in my gut about his phone. I'm looking at it, he's asleep, and I grab it. Never in a million years did I expect to see what I found. The same day he was begging for me to forgive him, messaging his ex about how he can't live without me, etc., he reached out via reddit message to a cuckold couple that posted looking for a third, explaining his interest in having his first experience in that community. This coming weekend. Something he's never once mentioned an interest in \- and we have \(had?\) a very sex positive relationship.

WHAT THE FUCK.

You guys, I'm devastated. Crushed. He's been telling me all day that he's mentally sick, he's addicted to porn, that that message was rock bottom. He's saying the near death experience fucked him up in ways he's just now beginning to comprehend, and that he'll go to therapy and do anything to fix it.

I need some outside help \- am I as big of an idiot like I feel like I am? I watched this man nearly die, nursed him back to health, put my life on hold for him. And I never stopped loving him with all my heart, not even for a minute. I feel like a bomb has been dropped on my life once again, but instead of an illness it's him doing this to me. What do I do? Do I give him another chance, work through therapy, keep putting my life on hold for him? We're supposed to be moving in together in a few months. I'm sick over this. Any advice would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** \- Nursed boyfriend back to health after horrific illness, only to find that once things got better, he started looking for cucking communities experiment with behind my back"
40,"Bf (24) of 4 years kissed my sister (23)


So my bf of 6 years just woke me (24) up at 4 in the morning crying and kept saying sorry. I freaked out and asked him what had happened. We had got in a big argument earlier and he left mad to go drink at my sister and bro in law's house. He said they got plastered and when my bro in law fell asleep my sis and him stayed up watching youtube videos. Apparently he leaned in for a ""hug"" as a thank you because she was giving him advise and they both started kissing. He said they both pulled back right away.  I'm in shock rightnow because he's never given me a reason not to trust him until now. I've kicked him out and idk I'm just in total shock. 


TL;DR: Please somebody give me advice.. I just rly need someone to talk to rightnow. "
41,"I'm (24M) concerned about my girlfriend's (20F) apathy towards the pain she's experiencing when we have sex


So some background: We've been dating for about two years. I love her and aside from the normal frustrations of a relationship, everything is great. The one real problem is our sex life, or lack thereof. When we do have sex, there is always a risk of her encountering pain, sometimes so much so that it causes us to stop. She describes it as almost a stabbing sensation, and it may have something to do with the physiology of our respective bodies, but we both believe there is certainly another underlying problem at work. She has been to the same gyno for a few years now, but everytime she goes she doesn't feel as though they are helping her at all. I suggested she go somewhere else and get a second opinion. She was receptive to that, and said she would call an office she found. But after a few weeks it was apparent that she wasn't making the effort to call somewhere else for that second opinion. She seems resigned now to the idea that there's nothing that can be done about the pain even if she sees someone else. 


So now flash forward to the other night. We havent had sex in a few weeks, and only a few times (maybe 4, still with stoppage from pain) total in the last two months. We're making out and things are going so well. I'm super turned on and into it, and so is she. I start to finger her a little, and she's still into it. I'm excited because usually this is a good sign that things are going to work sexually. But then she gets a quick feeling of pain and pushes my hand away. I get the usual ""oh no am I hurting you"" sensation that I'm used to and immediately am turned off. She still wants to make out but I don't want to because I'm not in the mood.

 This hurts her feelings and she gets mad, but I'm only being honest about my feelings. I tell her that I'm not trying to hurt her feelings at all, I just ask her to see where I'm coming from. She's not receptive to that and is just upset. I'm so sexually frustrated because I feel like she's not doing everything she could to try and fix it, she's gonna go to the same gyno and nothing is going to be fixed.


She doesn't like to give blowjobs that much and doesn't really do anything else sexually in the meantime. She has the attitude that its not fair for me to get off if she can't. But she can't because she physically can't, but its not the same for me. I don't see how that makes any sense?? I don't know what I should do. I don't want to seem gross about it, but I'm a very sexual person and the lack of physical connection with her is driving me insane. I'm masturbating way more than I want to, because its the only release I can get. She doesn't really even seem to think about the effect that its having on me, she just gets mad and says ""thats just how it is for me."" 

Please, I'm so stuck with how to approach this situation. I love this girl so much but it just doesn't seem like a problem she's trying to deal with and I can't take this level of inactivity and frustration if she's not gonna make it a priority.


**tl;dr** : my girlfriend experinces pain that causes a massive reduction in our sex life and seems resigned to the idea that ""that's just how it is"" causing me great sexual frustration"
42,"I (23f) finally met my boyfriends (27m) family. I could hear his sisters saying I'm a downgrade from his ex wife.


I've been with my boyfriend for half a year, and just met his family. He has an older sister and a younger sister. I met them and his divorced parents.

My boyfriend has an ex wife and I was afraid of being compared to her but really hoped that I wouldn't.

He showed his family pictures of me, and from what he said they all thought I was pretty and his younger sister commented that I was prettier than his ex.

His ex is more pretty whereas I am on the cuter side. I'm not sexy or beautiful or hot, but I get told I'm cute often so I guess we are more opposite.

After meeting them my bf took a call outside, so I decided to go to the bathroom. I could hear his sisters, especially the older one, making comments.

""She's way prettier in her pictures"" ""I thought she was prettier than that."" ""He's downgrading big time."" ect ect.

I feel kinda sad tbh. Like yeah it doesn't matter what they think, they aren't dating me. But this obv isn't stuff I wanna hear. 

I brought it up to my bf later and he was super pissed off at them and said he'd talk to them and beat their (insert A word here) and he kept apologizing and saying not to listen to them. 

Now though, all I can think is.. What if *he* feels like he downgraded, but because he likes my personality he'll deal with it? I'm so super insecure now and don't know how to handle it. Cuz he says all the good stuff, but what if secretly he thinks I'm ugly too? 

Tl;dr; overheard bfs sisters saying I'm not pretty, they thought I'd be prettier ect. And said he's downgrading from his ex wife. Now I'm insecure and worried secretly he thinks this too."
43,"One of my (26/F) coworkers (26/M) keeps trying to get a Jim and Pam situation going with me, and I’m beginning to feel a little bit uncomfortable around him.


So for those of you who haven’t watched The Office, the characters Jim and Pam worked together at the paper company, and were really good friends, always joked around together, etc. Pam was engaged at first, to another man, but she and Jim quite obviously had romantic feelings for each other and eventually ended up together. 

I’ve got a similar situation going on at work, except I don’t have feelings for this guy. I love my fiancé. 

I’ve only ever seen him as one of my friends at work. We used to get along really well before all of the jokes turned into flirtation on his end. It felt innocent at first like he was just trying to be funny, but I never flirted back, and I kept my fiancé informed. He’s met the guy and thinks he’s a good person. When I mentioned that he was flirting with me a little bit, obviously my fiancé changed his tune. The problem is I have to work close with this guy. In terms of our where our desks are and just in general.

Basically, he waits for me to leave so that he can walk me to my car everyday, something that I thought was just a nice gesture before as there was a woman who was attacked just a few blocks from our office shortly before. I’ve told him that he doesn’t have to walk me, and that I’m perfectly capable of getting to my car on my own. He took it like I’d slapped him across the face or something, and then stopped for a few weeks, only to start again. Now he does it once or twice a week. I really didn’t want to be mean about it, as there was a good chance that he was simply trying to be nice. 

But he also buys me coffee all the time even though I told him not to, is always trying to get my attention at work by making funny faces, leaves notes at my desk with jokes on them that I used to find funny before he failed to take the hint, and refers to me as his “work wife.” 

I get that it doesn’t seem that bad. But when you add it all up, it’s at least a bit strange. The fact that he has continued to do all of this even after I’ve asked him to stop. I find myself avoiding him as much as I can now. Do I think he means harm? No. He just seems like the kind of guy who watches too much Netflix and thinks real life works the way shows do. Plus he always asks how things are going with my fiancé as if waiting for me to say we’re going to break up. 

I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to get him in any kind of serious trouble or anything. But I do think that I have to sit him down and explain my side clearly. So, he knows it’s not a joke anymore.

Is that a bad idea? What should I do? I’d like to handle it as clean as possible. I don’t want to make waves. 

**tl;dr** We were friends at first, but I have a strong feeling that he thinks of me as more than that now. The amount of attention he gives me makes it hard to focus at work sometimes. I feel like I have to avoid him at all times. Plus I’m engaged, and he always asks about my fiancé as if waiting for us to break up. I’m not sure what I can do without making waves. "
44,"Personal Issues: Me [42 M] with my online game commumity, 1 year, read private threads, hurt and embarrassed at how I'm viewed by my peers.


I've spent the last 10 months or so in a tight knit gaming community of around 60 players. High activity, lots of conversations, generally engaging and rewarding.

Due to a glitch, I was able to read months of private communications between leaders of my gaming community. Probably shouldn't have. I was hurt and embarrassed to see that I'm viewed not as a positive contributor, but as a significant annoyance and even a problem.

I think I'll be leaving the community. Not sure if I should take the experience as I need to change, or I just need to find a community that's a better fit for my style. 


tl;dr Thought I was a contributing member of gaming community. Turns out I'm more of a nuisance. Do I change me, or change communities?"
45,"Fiance [25m] is very jealous of all the male attention I get, and the way I [24f] dress. How can we fix this problem before the wedding?


My Fiance and I have been dating for 5 years, and he just recently proposed. I love him and couldn't be more happy, but there is something in our relationship that we have to fix before moving on first. My fiance can get extremely jealous of any kind of attention I get. Please note I am not trying to sound conceited at all, but my looks and body shape get me quite a lot of attention from men. It's been that way since I started developing as a young teenager. I don't give in to these remarks or anything, but it still bothers him to no end. He'll get really clingy and start grabbing all up on me I guess to make it known we're together, but that can get frustrating sometimes.

My way of dress is another huge problem for him. I'm very much a girly girl and like to dress in dresses, skirts, and heels. He likes for me to be cute but not when we're out in public. It'll bother him to no end if I go out without him dressed up,texting and calling me about what I'm doing and who I'm with. This is starting to become very tiring, as I feel like he almost doesn't trust me in a way. I don't like bein told what to do or wear as I'm not a child, but I don't want to seem like I'm completely dismissing his feelings. How can we both work through this problem and try to come to an agreement? This needs to be solved before we o ahead with anything I feel like.

**tl;dr**: My fiance is very jealous of male attention directed toward me and my way of dress...how can we fix this? "
46,"My (32F) husband (32M) thinks his financial contributions count as household chores.


My husband and I have been together for 7 years, married for 4.

My husband has always made more money than me, because he has opportunities to work over time and earn bonuses. He makes about $30,000-35,000 more a year than I do. 

Right now, he is working 50-55 hours a week, M-F. I am a teacher and am also working on a graduate degree. 

I always viewed our financial contributions to be fair because of our different salaries. But, after some things he’s said lately, I’m wondering if he feels differently. Here’s how we split finances: 

I pay: electric, gas, my car, vet care (3 animals), half the mortgage, my credit card. 

He pays: half mortgage, his credit card, water, tv and internet, oil changes (both cars), both car insurance, both phones, groceries (75% his food). 

While I recognize he does pay for some things for me, I feel I pay my share too. 

Now the financial background is out of the way, here’s the main topic. I take care of 85% of household chores. Things like laundry, cleaning the bathrooms, picking up the house, vacuuming and mopping the floors, dusting, cleaning the kitchen, and deep cleaning at least once a week.  My husband does the dishes twice a week and mows the lawn. He used to not do anything inside the house unless I specifically asked. He started doing the dishes more regularly after I broke down and begged for more help around the house. Teaching and grad school takes a LOT of my time and I was having a difficult time keeping up with all of it. 

A recent Saturday, our friends texted and asked to hang out that night. I was in the middle of cleaning the house and had homework I needed to work on. I told him this, and that I would be up for going out if he would help me clean so I could get to my homework faster. He told me he would do the dishes later and I asked if he could do something else too. I don’t remember how it devolved into this, but he told me he does other stuff for me, like pay for my phone and insurance. He also brought up how he is still paying off the new flooring we bought. Even though I’ve suggested using our tax return to pay off the balance or I will purchase our next big item (we’re planning on a mattress). He didn’t say much after that and then he went to the gym.

This isn’t the only time he’s used this same reason when the topic of helping around the house comes up. I’ve asked for help more than once, and all I get is the dishes done twice a week. Is it fair for him to do less work around the house because he pays for more? Does it sound like he’s upset about the division of finances? 

Tl;dr My (32F) husband (32M) brings up the fact he pays for more things than I do, some of which are for me, when I ask for more help around the house. Is that fair? "
47,"Girl [14F] keeps visiting me [20M] at my job and it's getting weird


I've been working at this small store for 4 months now, and it's directly by two neighborhoods. The building is next to several other shops, so it basically makes a line of stores. My job is easy and I've made some good friends there and I, for the most part, enjoy working there.

Last month, I was on a break and went out to the back of the store, which is completely open to anyone and is right next to a road. I sat in one of the seats laid out for us and soon noticed a girl walking along the road. I didn't think much of it, as obviously, people came here all the time. Soon after, I heard a ""Hey"" and looked up to see her a few feet away from me. I kind of gave her a nod and smiled, and she introduced herself.

I did the same and she was very social. We'll call her A. We had a general convo, with mostly her speaking, for less than five minutes. She mentioned her age, 14. A then excused herself and I mostly forgot about it. 

Flash forward a week later and A showed up again, this time with a friend. She just said hi then left, until a few days later. At this point I just thought she was a bored and extraverted teen. I came outside for break and saw her. She came over slowly almost as if she had been waiting.

She started talking to me and asking about my day, and I answered reluctantly because I didn't want one of my coworkers to come out and see us. This conversation changed what I had been thinking of the interactions because of two things: her asking for my Snapchat, and calling me cute. I declined the Snapchat, saying I only had close friends on there. Her compliment made me feel uncomfortable so I tried ending the conversation quick.

A then visited me again inside of the store and I half-assed the conversation and felt weird the whole time. I felt rude for trying to get away from her, but I knew that's what I should do. She was slightly flirty at some points and even the thought of it is just gross. Once she left, I asked my co worker if he knew anything about her, and he said she's said a quick ""Hi"" a few times after passing by him, but nothing more. 

How should I go about this situation? I'm not sure if there's a specific person I should talk to, or if I need to confront her. I'm not good at confrontations but I'll certainly do it if I need to. Thank you


TL;DR a 14 year old likes to visit me at my job and her intentions are confusing, so I'm not sure how I should handle it "
48,"My (26F) husband (26M) wants to follow family tradition and use his Dad’s (78M) name as our daughter’s (due September 2018) middle name, but his Dad is a crabby racist that I don’t really respect.


I have a son (3M) from a previous relationship that my husband is an unbelievably wonderful Step Father to. I’m pregnant with our first child together who is a baby girl due this September. 

My FIL (78M) is considerably older than my MIL (early 50’sF), and therefore considerably older than most parents in my husband and I’s generation. 

My husband has very fond memories of his Dad while he was growing up. He was a very supportive and active parent. My husband is obviously stressed in general about his Dad’s (maybe soonish) impending death because of his age. My FIL is also becoming more anxious/crabby/generally unpleasant with age. My husband recognizes this, but it’s his Dad, so the bias and history obviously takes over. 

We live about 40 mins from my in laws, so we see them occasionally but not too often. We recently bought a new house that took forever to close, so we lived with my in laws for about a month. During this time, my husband and MIL would go to work in the morning, and I ended up spending a lot of my mornings with my FIL. 

I won’t bother going into the offensive details of his words, but long story short in this period of time I learned that my FIL is a racist, sexist, homophobic, crabby, Fox News loving Trump supporter. He would also bombard me with anxiety ridden questions about my husband, in a negative way that made it seem like he’s not incredibly supportive of his life choices (job, hair length, other random nit picky things). 


My FIL’s name is Ray. His father’s name was Ray. My FIL has an ex wife he had two children with (mid 50’s), and his first born’s (daughter) middle name is Ray. My husband was the first born of the siblings my FIL has with my MIL, and my husband’s middle name is Ray. 

It has always been my husband’s plan to use Ray as his first born’s middle name. It actually does go well with the first name we picked out for our daughter. The problem is, I generally dislike my FIL (for the reasons listed above), and it feels wrong to use his name. I don’t know how to bring this up with my husband without offending him. 

TLDR: My husband wants to use my FIL’s name as our daughter’s middle name, but my FIL is a racist, crabby, old bigot. What do I do!? 


"
49,"Me (30sM) with wife (30sF) decided to separate. I got into a potentially life ending accident and now she has changed her mind about everything.


As the title states, my wife and I had decided to mutually separate. We have both been to counselling and although we tried to make it work, it didn’t last long and we were back in the same boat we had started in. 

We got married when we were young after a very short dating period and engagement. We both grew up a lot through this time and grew apart because of it. Time went on and the distance and differences between us grew. This got to the point when we didn’t enjoy being around each other anymore. So after several years of marriage and a few kids, we were at then breaking point and decided that it would be best for everyone if we went our separate ways.

Now this separation got delayed just because we were still living together and had some things we needed to get in order for us to be able to go our separate ways. We were both fine with this over the weeks that passed. 

One day on my commute to work, I was in a very terrible and potentially life ending accident. I came out unscathed  but suffered some emotional trauma. I’m still currently working through it as it’s still pretty fresh (within the last couple weeks).

I noticed that when I got home, my wife was extra clingy and extra loving. I chalked it up to just being scared that I could have died. She eventually confessed to me that she didn’t want to separate anymore and loved me so much. She told me that everything had become so clear and the things about me that used to bug her no longer seemed important anymore.

That’s all fine and dandy, except I didn’t change my mind. I feel terrible though because I still love her and don’t want to hurt her. Having a mutual separation made it easy because no one was getting hurt. But now I feel like some part of me doesn’t want it to end just because of how it will break her heart. One of my reservations as well is that this feeling is only temporary and once she’s sorted out her feelings and processed them, things will go back to how they were.

Does anyone have any similar experience or any advice? 

Currently I’m still carrying on with the mindset that we aren’t together anymore and just living together for the time being out of convenience. 

I am just more or less wondering if this new kindled loved for me is short term or if she truly has changed and will always feel as she does now.

TLDR: me and wife are going to mutually separate. I get into accident and almost die. Now she doesn’t want to separate and loves me agin. "
50,"My (33f) wife (37f) of 6 years just started taking meds for anxiety/depression. Now her behavior is erratic and at twice now she’s done things that have scared me. Is it appropriate to insist she see another doctor?


My wife of six years had been depressed for about a year now after her dad died. To me it seemed like very normal grieving and she was doing well in therapy but her friend (also her ex-boyfriend so lots of worms in that can) strongly suggested she needed to see a psychiatrist to get on medications. So she did.

I’m not a doctor so all this is just from my outside perspective and my conversations with her. she went on anti-depresants and her mood got better but they also made her anxious so she went back and got anti-anxiety medications. As she told me this affected how the anti depressants worked so they added an enhancer of some sort. This somehow affected her blood pressure so she was given medications for those and those affected her sleep so they gave her ambien for daily use and Valium for emergencies. This affected her work so now she’s on an ADHD drug like Ritalin. So in a little over six weeks she went from not wanting to even take aspirin for a headache to 7 different daily pills.

Now instead of just being sad over her dad passing away she is all over the place and it’s crazy unpredictable. If I knew she popped a Ritalin in the morning and she’ll be on an upswing until she takes her ambien to sleep I could deal with that. But in reality the medications seem to hit at different Times and she’ll have wild mood swings. 

Twice now she’s really scared me, the first incident was I came home to find her litterally slumped over and passed out next to the toilet. She claims she had just fallen asleep but she had poop all over legs and her face was red almost like she’d passed out, fallen off the toilet and hit her face in the bathtub on the way down. Yesterday was worse, we went to see Avengers and she was an emotional roller coaster from screaming, laughing and cheering (more than was appropriate for a theater) to sobbing uncontrollably at the end. Then she fell asleep at the wheel on the way home. Thank god we were on a side street and going slow because she “only” smashed into some trash cans.


I tried to talk to her about it when she was somewhat coherent but she said she felt better than she ever had and these “side effects” will work themselves out in time. I asked her to please think about getting a second opinion. She said that she wouldn’t even consider it because this doctor was saving her life from the despair over her dad. I tried to suggest that while yes, she seems sadder with just the therapy, she was making great strides and maybe that it was ok to be sad over her dad. This made her furious and she threw a glass at me which glanced off my arm and shattered on the floor. She then slammed a door so hard it broke the frame. She’s never, ever done anything like that to me ever.

I don’t know what to do. Is it ok to insist that she see another doctor as a condition of moving forward with me? I feel like I can’t worry about her safety all the time and I can’t be afraid of her.  What should I do?

*tl;dr: my wife’s behavior had gotten so erratic since she’s gone on medications for depression and anxiety (as well as others). She’s passed out on the toilet, fallen asleep at the wheel and thrown things at me which she never would have done before. Is it ok to insist she see another doctor?*

51,"I (20s/F) was on a reality show years ago and did not come across well. I have trouble making friends and relationships because I'm judged because of the person I was years ago. My self esteem suffers too. Help?


Hopefully this version of my post will be acceptable \- the comments were really helpful to me on the original one. 

I am being vague with my age to help protect my privacy.

A    few years ago, I was on my country's version of Next Top Model. I    didn't become a ""top model"", in fact, I did hardly any modelling work    after the show and honestly, all it left me with were a bunch of regrets    and wishing I never did it. The money I did make is long gone because    it wasn't that much and basically paid my rent while I studied, the   cool  free stuff I got is all used or now very out of fashion, and I   feel I  have nothing positive left from this experience other than   getting to go  to another country as part of it, except for a couple of   cool friends I  met. We're not even that close really, but like, well,   if you asked me  ""what was the positive from being on this show"", well   there is them. I  liked seeing the other country, but I could have just   as easily going on  my own terms by traveling myself.

I    wasn't mature enough to understand what I was getting myself into by    'signing up' to become famous and how the internet now means you can't    just run away and start a new life, otherwise I could just move  country.   But there is always google. And I don't actually want to move   countries  either unless it was to Australia, but the Australians have   google too.

I  was still a teenager  when I  did it. A friend of my mother's worked at  the TV station that  produces  it and was a cameraman for the show and  said ""you should  audition for  it"". I was on summer break right after  finishing high  school and my  mother said I should go for it, so I did. I  don't know  why. I didn't  really think about it to be honest. I didn't  think I'd  get in. I think I  just liked that I was ""pretty"" enough to get  told I  should try out.

But I made it into the final casting and lasted for more than half the season.

I    wasn't the 'villain' of my season but I also wasn't portrayed super    well either because I and another girl were 'best friends' with the  girl   they decided to make the villain of the season. She could be a  bit   whiney and snarky sure, but as someone who knew her and still  knows her   \(we are not best friends but we talk. I think because she  feels like me  a  lot and we are basically the person who understands  the other you  know.  We basically bond over our TopModelRegrets. The  other girl just  cut us  both off, and I understand. I think it was what  she needed to do  to move  on from this. She blocked and deleted anyone  who had anything  to do  with the show one day and that was that\). But  anyway, she's no  where  near as bad as she was made out to be, and I'm  not just saying  that. She  wasn't a mean person, just not the type to  pretend she liked  the way  they did her hair when she didn't like it,  and if you pushed  past her  without saying ""excuse me"", she'd roll her  eyes. Stuff like  that,  basically she is the type who will be honest  about what she is  thinking  and won't pretend she is 'fine' when she is  not, but she was  never the  b!tch she was made out to be, but she was  the easiest one for  the  producers to make the b!tch, so she became the  b!tch of the  season.

I  feel like my  edit was a  combination of being young, immature, naive,  and a couple  of situations  where things were genuinely taken out of  context \-  including a sneaky  edit that made me look like I was saying I  don't  like someone that got a  good edit during the show , but I was  talking  about a singer. I  remember watching that air months after I said  it  and instantly being  like I NEVER SAID THAT WTF. The girl I said it  to  texted me all ""OMG  WTF, I remember that conversation, you said ""I   can't stand her"" about  Taylor Swift, not \[other contestant's name\]. But   they were allowed to  do whatever they wanted with the footage. They   basically showed this  girl people liked because she got a good edit and   then my comment. It  was SO infuriating. It was in the contact I  signed  not really  understanding what I was getting into. I did say  some things I  regret, I  did look a bit bratty at times, I was  particularly whiny and  difficult  during one photo \(one of the ones  where they make you do  something  extreme and a bit scary and I was  terrified.....and a bit  homesick and  unsure and just YOUNG in general\)  but unlike most people,  my teenage  stupidity was filmed and broadcast  to the country \- and I  hate that I  let that happen.

I  hate the  way that I  am now in my mid twenties and feel like I am  constantly  judged because  of the 18/19 year old I was on some TV show.  I feel like  so many people  have the wrong idea of me and I hate that.  It makes it  hard to make  friends. It makes people not want to be my  friend. It makes  people not  want to date me because they will have to  explain this all  to their  loved ones. NTM was very popular during my  run, if someone  doesn't  recognise me, one of their friends or their  sister ot whatever  will.

I  think I have  improved a lot as a  person in the past few years, but  people just see  me as a b!tchy brat. I  actually don't want to be a  model or work in  entertainment at all, and  having been on this show is  something that  hurts me in the field I want  to be \- it is a  ""respectable"" field and  places are reluctant to hire some airhead from next top model, and it  doesn't help that a lot of google  results for me  are unflattering  about my personality and a couple of  the photoshoots  are ones I regret  taking part in. Nothing that could be  called porn,  but a couple of  them are photos of me that I wish didn't  exist now I  don't want to be a  model.

I think at 18/19 I just didn't really understand the long term consequences of being on this show and taking certain photos.

I    still get anonymous people messaging me telling me to kill myself and    that I am a bad person and I have anxiety a lot now because I feel    judged, and I am really harsh on myself and despite conventionally    attractive enough to have been on a modelling show I feel like my self    esteem is low and I have bad anxiety because I have internalized all  the   comments about being a bad and horrible person and feel like I am   kinda  worthless. I wish I could erase this stupid show from people's   memories  but I can't \- it is out there forever. I wish I could erase   myself from  people's memories and have a clean slate, but I can't. You   just  internalize it all though. When so many people who do not know  you  tell  you what a bad person you are, you start to believe you are a  bad   person. When people tell you that you are a pathetic piece of  crap,  you  start to believe you are a pathetic piece of crap. When  people tell  you  ""you weren't even that pretty anyway"", you start to  believe you  are ugly  and not that pretty. So many bad things have been  said to me  so many  times that I now feel like they are true.

I    just want to be free of all the past and this awful perception of    myself I created but I never ever will be and I hate that so much. I    wish I never went on this damn fucking show. Everyone fucking hates me    and no one will let me move on.

What can I do?

tl:dr:    In my mid twenties, but still hated and seen as a bad person because I    wasn't portrayed well on a TV show when I was 18 and want to move on   and  be seen as the better person I am today, but don't know how I can   when  google doesn't forget."
52,"My (29F) fiancé’s(29M) friends (28M) girlfriend (26F) wants to have sex with my fiancé to “equal everything”??


Tldr at bottom 

Background:
Me and my fiancé have been together since we were fourteen-except for a period of 8 months when we were 23 and I was on a uni placement abroad in France and we decided that we should have fun for 8 months and see where we were after that. We ended up sleeping around a bit, but missing each other a lot so the minute I got back, we got back together. During that time, I admittedly kissed and made out with my fiancé’s friend ‘C’. My fiancé is fully aware and understanding and while he found it difficult for a while, I worked hard to regain his trust and we have grown together and everything is amazing now. I am in fact in the early stars of pregnancy but have chose not to tell anyone because we would like it to remain a secret until we r both confident.

So to my issue 

C and his current gf have been together since roughly the same time as me and my fiancé but are notoriously off and on. 

The minute she discovered quite recently about me and C she was outraged. She demanded to have sex with my fiancé to level everything out. 

My fiancé immediately refused for obvious reasons but she is persistent and says that it is only fair. 
C is obviously fed up with this ridiculous request but will not leave her for unrelated issues. 

My question is ;

How do I get her to back off my fiancé and cut her from out life? 

Tl; dr I made out with fiancés friend during a break years ago-his current gf is mad and demanding sex from my fiancé?

53,"Boyfriend [32/M] of 5 years told me he’s cheated on me our whole relationship [27/F]


I’ve been together with my boyfriend for 5 happy years and we’ve lived together for 4.5 years. 

He is divorced with a child who he regularly sees, spending his only day off with him but as it’s his son I never minded. He always told me he loved me etc. 

Anyway tonight he basically dropped a bombshell - he’s been married with kids to a woman in his home country of Pakistan for our whole relationship. He goes for 3 months each year but he told me to see his parents and it’s too dangerous for me to go. 

I feel so ill - I’m shocked. He said he’s sorry blah blah and didn’t tell me bcos he knew I’d leave and he does love me. I obviously don’t believe him. He’s now sleeping soundly while I can’t shut my eyes. He wants us to be friends but I hate him so much. 

I even told him about my ex bf of 3 years cheating on me and how mentally / physically abusive he was. And all his friends knew about his wife. 

I’m just so upset. I feel I can’t trust anyone anymore, I feel I’ve wasted 5 years as it was all lies. I now have to move out and I’m saving to move to another city ASAP to try and start again. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, but I’m so heart broken and angry, I can’t sleep or eat. I’ve never had a good person for a boyfriend even though I tried so hard to find a nice person, but it was all fake. We even joked about him having a wife in his home country. 

He wants us to stay in contact / go on our booked holiday but I really think I’m about to have a breakdown or something - he was the one good thing in my life and now it’s all been a lie I feel like I want to die (not seriously sucidial just feeling so hopeless). What should I do ? 

Tl:dr my boyfriend of 5 years told me he’s been married with kids our whole relationship - he wants to remain friends / go on our hooked holiday but I’m so angry and heart broken - what should I do? "
54,"[22 F] my mom [49 F] invited herself and her sister [50s F] to stay with me in the middle of finals week.


My mom sprung another trip to visit me for her 50th birthday coming up. I had just got off the phone with her where i told her how stressed I am about money and that I dont know how I'm going to make rent next month and 15 minutes later she emails me her surprise flight details. I'm a little bitter that she would spend $1200 on a plane ticket 15 minutes after I've told her I cant pay rent. It's tacky at the very least. Moving on.


So the next time I call her she tells me she's invited her sister to join her on vacation. This is great. I like my aunt. They can hang out with each other while I study for finals. I assumed that my aunt would find her own place to stay while she was visiting, but I just got off the phone with my mom and she has invited herself and her sister to come and sleep on my pull out couch for ten days during my finals week. She REALLY did that. I'm livid. 


I told my mom that my apartment is simply too small for three people. Its really too small just to have one visitor. The couch pulls out directly to the kitchenette and takes up the entire living room, and my mother's visits are always grating. I could tell that she was about to cry. She says ""well I just thought we could pile on the couch, what are we supposed to do now?"" I told her that cheap airbnbs are available near my apartment and got off the phone before the water works started.


Maybe you can tell from my post history that I need some serious help setting boundaries with my house guests. My mother is especially bad. 


I'm so angry that my mother would have the audacity to tell somebody else that they can come and stay in my home. Talk me through this please. Help me stand my ground.


TL;DR: My mom invited herself and her sister to come and sleep on my futon for 10 days during my finals week. She didn't even ask my permission. I'm so angry. Please help."
55,"I [22F] am concerned about my husband’s [24M] actions. He’s being sketchy and hanging out with other girls that I’ve never heard of.


I made a post on my actual account but I think I need to use a throw away at this point.

My husband is an early morning worker with his coworkers. They all work at 6am, so something seemed odd when he told me at 9:30pm that they wanted to hang out at a bar. I was performing last night when this happened and I was hanging out with some friends afterwards. Something seemed sketchy about the way he was acting and he’s not a very good liar, so I logged into his snap and saw he had been communicating with this girl, D. 

They were talking right around the time that he told me he was invited out, so that was my red flag that he wasn’t being totally honest. After we both got back home last night, I looked again and saw he had sent a message saying “Yo I need to hang out with you, *other girl*, and your hot friend more often lol.”

Obviously I was upset and left for an hour or so with my friend to help me collect my thoughts. This morning, he tells me he actually wasn’t out with any of his coworkers, he was only out with them and doesn’t know why he lied to me about it. I also saw that this girl KNOWS he’s married but still offered to hook him up with this other girl. 

He hasn’t done anything necessarily, but I don’t know how to handle this or what’s actually going through his head when he does this.

TLDR; husband is being sketchy and I don’t know how to resolve it. "
56,"I [45M] don't like the way my wife [43F] treats our daughter [19F] about her weight and body. [married 21 years]


My daughter who will be Amy for this post recently came home for a couple weeks before returning to live at college for the rest of the summer because she has a job on the campus.

Throughout the past year, since Amy left for college last fall, whenever she's visited my wife Sarah has given her a hard time about her minor weight gain. Amy has always been very slender and at 5'7 went off to college weighing around 130. Now at the end of her first year she weighs 141, Sarah made her weigh herself on the scale. 

When she first came home for Thanksgiving the comments were ""Wow you're getting pretty pudgy"" and asking did she really need another helping in front of all our family. Over winter break Sarah made a lot of comments about the ""Freshman 15"" and wanted to know details about how much Amy was eating each day and what food, how often did she go to the gym, and was she just ""lazing around all day snacking"" because that will turn you into ""a whale pretty fast."" This caused them to argue. I told my wife to lay off when she said these things and she stopped, so I thought it was over. Amy later told me Sarah kept saying it, just not when I was around.

She didn't visit for spring break because her friends went on a trip. Now is the first time we've seen her since Christmas and I'd say half the things Sarah has said to her since she came home a couple days ago have been about her weight. Like I said she made her weigh herself. She keeps exclaiming, ""11 pounds. That's more than a pound a month."" And researching diets online.

Like I said Amy has a slender build. I'm not a doctor but I know the amount she gained isn't anywhere close to being a problem. Sarah is exaggerating, but even if Amy was becoming worryingly overweight, I'd disagree with my wife's method. It's shaming her and making her upset. She told me she was glad she got the job on campus so she wouldn't have to live here for the summer.

I've talked to Sarah twice so far about stopping the critical comments. She said ""Maybe it's not a big deal right now but when she weighs 300 pounds you'll be wishing you'd said something too."" She also said 19 is too young to let herself go. And that college won't teach kids this kind of self-discipline. She's also obsessively worried that Amy won't be attractive to any men.

I can't help but be put off by my wife's hypocrisy here. She's not really someone with a right to criticize anyone else for letting themselves go. As she's aged she's put on maybe 20 more pounds since we got married, and certainly looks older than she is due to wrinkles and gray hair. But here I am despite such. If she was single in this state I could see her own mother making the same remark about men to her. But it is what it is, the hypocrisy is more of a secondary problem here.

I'm worried about Sarah's hysteria causing emotional problems for Amy. I've tried to counter her mom's negativity by being reasonable and supportive, explaining it's normal to gain a little weight since at 19 she's not done growing yet. I've also told her she's worth way more than her body. She's afraid she's ""gotten fat"" (her words) when she's in no way fat. She's simply not as skinny as she used to be. To her they're the same thing, to Sarah too it seems.

What can I do to get my wife to see she's giving our daughter bad ideas about weight and body image? I thought about scheduling a doctor appointment so she can hear from the doctor that Amy isn't overweight, but am worried it could make Amy's self-consciousness worse.

tl;dr: My wife has been making some mean-spirited comments to our daughter who gained a minor amount of weight her first year of college. My wife doesn't see my side that this is affecting our daughter badly, making her embarrassed and believing she's fat when she's really not."
57,"I 58 (M) really dislike my son (22M) because of his personality and I worry about his future.


God help me im probably going to get a lot of dislikes for this but I have to get it off my chest, throwaway because my son uses reddit. So as the title says I really don’t like my son because of his attitude. He is loud, arrogant and obnoxious and always has to be the centre of attention. He is a smart kid and really good with IT but ever since he was little he has always had to have all the attention or else he will throw a tantrum. He has this way of hijacking the conversation by taking the topic and turning it into some grandiose made up story about himself to impress everybody, but doesn’t realise it just makes him look bad. I have no idea where all this came from but he has been like this ever since he was a child. Me and my Wife \(52F\)have tried multiple times to stop it by getting him to play in team sports and other extra\-curriculars so he can build some social skills but all it ever did was make us look bad to other parents and teachers because of his attitude. He once bullied a younger disabled child with a lisp and a learning disorder for two weeks because he thought it made him look cool. I was so embarrassed when I got called in to the school for it, and his only response was that the disabled child has been bullying him all along! 

Since he left for university I have finally had some peace and quiet in the house but now that he has graduated I worry about him. He is unable to keep a job or a girlfriend for longer then 6 months and when asked he always acts like he is the victim and everybody else is an idiot. I have tried everything to stop this attitude of his but now that he is an adult I feel like it is to late. But most of all I don’t want him moving back in with us and staying with us for the rest of his life. How do I get through to him? 

TLDR: Son has a terrible personality, I worry about his future and need him to change. "
58,"Update: My mother(60/F) and I(27/F) are not agreeing over the ad set-up of our horse she wants to sell.


Here is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ur5wo/my_mother60f_and_i_26f_are_not_agreeing_over_the/?utm_source=reddit-android

I know this post got just a little attention and that's ok. 

TL;DR: My mom decided that she needed to sell my/our dangerous horse. I came to accept that but she wanted to add that he does mounted archery extremely well and I trained him for hours on end in that sport. I disagreed due to wanting that to be just ""our thing"". 

So my mom and I made ammends. I read the comments over and over realizing how immature I was being. My horse, R, was sent to my farrier's facility to have him worked and ""retrained"". I got to go down there ever week to ride and be ""retrained"" myself. It was refreshing. The farrier was trying to find someone that would beinterested in R. But then, his hips started becoming extremely stiff. Training had been halted as he recommended R to come back to our place to get a chiropractor scheduled. I learned massage techniques as well and R and I bonded over that. 

After we discovered R has minor arthritis in his hips, we came up with a pain management plan which worked wonders. He is taken back to the facility to be worked with and continued treatment. He is a brand new horse. No pain and he is listening to the trainer. 

But then, R almost put the farrier in the hospital when loading him into a trailer. Farrier says he can't do much more so R is back with us. Do we keep him on the property and have him live out his life with us? Or do we continue to try to sell him to a trusted and experience horse owner? I was afraid if we sell him, they would give up on him and sell him to slaughter. Trust me, my mom and I were up all night talking about it.

So we let the days pass before we come up with a decision. But then, open wounds started forming on him. The smell was horrendous. We called a vet. After running tests, we discovered they are sarcoids (skin tumors). They were spreading so fast and bleeding and oozing constantly. We tried medicine but nothing is helping. 

So my R is scheduled to be put down tomorrow. I am heartbroken but i can tell he is pain. He is still a feisty and defiant horse up until the end but he will always be my defiant horse and the best mounted archery horse in the world. Thank you everyone who commented on my OP. 

tl;dr: my mom and I made ammends but my horse is sick and needs to be put down to end his pain. I am heartbroken but not being angry at my mom helps me focus on being there for him.

59,"[M/M 24/25 Married 1 year] Husband doesn't find me attractive.


Hi, relationships, 

I'm here because I have a dilemma. My husband and I had a talk last night which involved devolving into a conversation about bring attractive, social standards, etc.

I mentioned to him that while he has issues with his body (he's balding) I find him very attractive and that he's kinda my ""type"". It's nothing new I haven't stated before. However, when the subject turned around to me, it wasn't the same thing back.

He more or less admitted that he doesn't really find me attractive. He feels I'm ""cute"" and he loves my personality, but I'm not very attractive to him.

Needless to say, I was crushed, and after he fell asleep I spent most of the night crying. I've always suffered with my body image but felt I had found someone who thought I was ""hot"" you know, even if others never did? Now I seem to have lost all my confidence and self esteem.

We spoke briefly this morning and I'm still very upset. I don't know how to rationalize this. How do I handle having a husband who ""really likes my personality"" but not much else?

We had some sexual issues over the past year where he kinda liked porn more than me, and we'd go long times without sex. We cleared that up a month or so ago but now it's starting to all make sense. He often has to watch porn to get into the mood with me, and I thought that maybe this was a porn issue, but now I'm starting to think, all along, it was a *me* issue.

**tl;dr** My husband doesn't find me attractive, what do I do?"
60,"My brother [29M] sexually demeaned me[21F].


My brother[29M] and my mom got into an argument about him stealing my car, drinking and driving, and crashing it. During the argument he was mocking my mom and just being extremely disrespectful so I got involved. I[21F] basically just told him to leave her house and he was doing nothing productive by doing that. 

So, in the process of bringing him back to his place. We got into a passive aggressive conversation. He didn’t understand why everyone was mad at him. I thought he was trying to play the victim card to make people feel sorry for him. He always does this. He never takes responsibility for his own actions, it’s always someone else’s fault. I told him this and he started to call me fake and a bitch. 

So after I dropped him off and went home, he asked me if I could bring him some stuff he forgot at our moms house. I said no. Because he didn’t get his way, he started to call me sexual slurs. I told our older brother about this, he called him and told him that’s he’s disgusting for doing that and only then did he text me an apology. 

This never happened to us before. This isn’t like we’re both kids and we’re calling each other stupid. This is him sexually demeaning me because he didn’t get his way. For me, that’s a line that he’s crossed that I have zero tolerance for. I don’t want him touching me and I don’t want him talking to me. 

I’m the only one in my family that’s not talking to him. I feel like everyone thinks I’m taking it too far. My mom wants me to forgive him because “he’s a drunkard” she keeps on making excuses for him but I don’t care. He’s even called our mom a whore and he never apologized for it until he wanted something from her, and then she forgave him right away. He seems to have no respect for women. He does the same exact thing to the mother of his child. 

I haven’t seen him or spoke to him since this happened in March. I’m going home for the summer and I’ll be alone with him for two months. I just want advice on how you think I should handle this.

TL;DR: My brother didn’t get his way and started to sexually demean me by calling me sexual slurs. I want advice on how to handle it.

61,"I [23 F] was groped by my male friend [30 M] and I feel violated


Two days ago, I went out with a couple of coworkers to celebrate the fact that my friend was getting a promotion. At some point the night was getting late and we all decided to head back to our own houses for the night. My friend (30 M) insisted that we head somewhere and get one more drink to celebrate his promotion. I decided that one more drink couldn't hurt and decided to go with him. We order a quick drink from the bar and I don't know if it was just really strong or something because whatever was in that drink made me feel like I had 3-4 drinks at once. I felt myself feeling very weak and getting nauseous. 

My friend tried to comfort me and calls me an Uber to get me home. When the Uber arrived he got in with me which I thought was odd. As we drove I realized that we were in fact not going to my house but to his. I asked him what was going on and he told me not to worry. When we got to his place he helped me out of the Uber into his living room and tells me to wait there while he sends some emails. 

I instead, crawl to the bathroom to get myself to throw up because of that last drink we had. He finds me before I can make it to the bathroom and takes me to his room so that I don't wake up his roommate. He put me on his bed and goes back to writing emails. While his head is turned I again try to crawl to the bathroom but he finds me and pulls me out before I can make it. I push back at him, telling him I really need to throw up but he just laughs and puts me back on his bed.

This time he gets in bed with me and tries to cuddle with me. I push him away and beg him to let me go to the bathroom because I needed to pee (when again, I was going to try to get that last drink out of me). He finally lets me go to the bathroom and I get rid of the contents of my stomach. By the time I'm done, I feel that all of my strength has left me. I stumble out of the bathroom and lay on the floor in the corner of the room. My friend comes and lays beside me and starts rubbing my back. I tell him to stop but he just laughs and continues rubbing. Then he reaches under my shirt and starts groping my breasts and kissing my back. I squirm as hard as I can and tell him to get off of me and he eventually does for a bit before starting up again. At this point, all I'm thinking about is how to get out of there and get home. While he's groping me, I pat my pockets looking for my phone only to find that it's nowhere to be found. He turns me over and starts kissing my breasts over my clothes and tries to reach his hands into my pants. With what was left of my strength I forced him off me and told him I needed to pee again. After a few minutes of hiding in the bathroom, I ask him for my phone. He tells me that he will only give it to me if I come outside. I then tell him that if he didn't give me my phone I would yell for his roommate. He laughs and tells me his roommate is actually out for the night. Knowing that the phone was my only way to call for help I went back out there. When I open the door he grabbed me and pushed me down on the bed and started kissing my face. When I push back he pushes down on me harder. He then wrapped his arms and legs around me as he kept kissing my breasts, neck and face and tells me about how much he's been fantasizing about me since my first day at work. He goes into a disgusting amount of details about these fantasies and tells me to kiss him back which I refuse. He tells me to do other sexual things to him and when I tell him no he starts unzipping my pants. Even though everything is spinning at this point I still struggle against him and manage to zip my pants back up and turn away. Things keep going in circles for the rest of the night (I ask for my phone or for him to let me leave, he gropes me, I fight him with what is left of my strength). Finally when morning comes he give me my phone, takes me back to my car and tells me not to tell anyone what happened.

Later that day, he called me and told me that what happened was my fault for ""being too pretty"" and for ""going to his place"" (I didn't even know we were going to his place). I hung up on him and tried to have a normal day at work despite feeling gross and guilty for everything that happened. He called me after work and apologized profusely saying that he understood what he did was wrong and that he really valued our friendship. He didn't want what happened to ruin our friendship.

However, I really don't think a friend would do what he did to me. I feel that if I were any weaker than I already was, I wouldn't have been able to stop him from doing what he wanted to me. So people of reddit, am I doing the right thing by cutting this ""friend"" out of my life?  


TL:DR My male coworker ""friend"" took me to his place and tried to have sex with me. Now he wants me to keep quiet about it and to resume our friendship like nothing happened  "
62,"Me [35 F] with my coworker [30s? F]; her husband has called and left two voicemails on my work phone ranting and raving about their relationship


I do not know this coworker very well (I'll call her Liz for now) - I've worked on a couple small projects for her with minimal interactions, all related to work. I have never met or had any sort of interaction with her husband. This morning before I got to work, I received an email notification of a missed call with a voicemail attached.

I listened to the voicemail as soon as I got to work. It began ""This is Liz lastname's husband..."" and continued on into a rant for almost a minute of how unhappy he was, how he didn't deserve this, that she had kicked him out again, she works too much, he has no where to go, he wants to go back, etc. I have no idea how he got my number - my best guess is that he randomly chose an extension.

I had no idea what to do with this so I told my manager about it without revealing Liz's name. My first instinct was to go to HR and let them know and they could let Liz know and handle it from there. My boss said that he would recommend directly letting the person know to give them a chance to handle it on their own before getting HR involved and ""escalating"" the issue.

I sent a very simple and straightforward email to Liz letting her know that someone identifying himself as Liz lastname's husband had left me a voicemail and he sounded upset. I told her that I would send the vm to her if she'd like and that I understood this is a private matter and would not say anything to anyone else. She immediately replied with ""Thank you, please send the vm.""

I thought that was the end of it... but then this evening, I received another vm from the husband, with an even longer two minute rant. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I want to be sensitive to her, knowing that she is probably mortified and obviously going through a lot. Should I simply forward it to her and let her handle it? Should I reach out to HR? And let her know beforehand? Thoughts?

tldr; random coworker's husband has left me two voicemails ranting and raving about the coworker and their relationship. I let her know about the first one and sent her the vm. Later in the evening got the second one; what do I do now?"
63,"I [30F] had my first orgasm with my husband [32M]. He doesn’t know it was my first.


I’ve been sexually active since I was 16 and I’ve had several (&gt;10) partners over the years. I’ve been able to orgasm pretty easily with oral, but I’ve never found my G-Spot and I’ve never had an orgasm that wasn’t from clitoral stimulation (neither during sex nor by myself). 

Sex feels fine and I enjoy it but I have never gotten close to orgasm during it. I know it doesn’t do me any good but I’ve faked orgasms for as long as I can remember. I had come to terms that it just wouldn’t happen for me. I’ve also been faking them with my husband (dated for 1 year, married for 2). 

Two days ago I had an actual orgasm during sex with my husband. It was so different from any other orgasm I’ve ever had and I was proud of myself for finally getting it right and in awe of my husband that he made it happen after so many (including myself) couldn’t. 

Should I tell my husband that I’ve been faking it this entire time and I finally had one for real? Or should I keep it to myself? Now that I know I can have an orgasm, I’m not going to fake them anymore, even if I don’t have one every time. Just knowing that I can is enough to keep me trying. 

Tldr:

Husband doesn’t know I have been faking orgasms. Finally had my first one. Do I tell him?"
64,"My husband [29M] and I [27F] are moving in with my sister [18F] in less than a week. How do I tell her that I’m pregnant? TW: suicide attempt


A little background: Less than a year ago, my little sister moved to the large city in which my husband and I currently live to go to college. We loved being physically close to one another, as our age difference kept us at a distance before (I moved out of our parents’ house when she was quite young, and before that, I was more of a babysitter than a friend). In her second semester of college, she unexpectedly attempted suicide and moved back in with my parents to heal emotionally/psychologically. I was crushed.

Now, she seems to have recovered, and she’s gearing up to start school again in our home state. To help her in her transition, my parents purchased a small home, and they asked my husband and me to make the big move to live there with her and pay rent (this is admittedly also a huge financial boon for us). We are set to move in less than a week.

My sister is really excited for us to be physically close again, and I am as well. I want to do whatever I can to help my sister continue to get stronger and transition into adulthood, and we have set an appointment for me to meet with her and her therapist to help with our communication and for me to learn more about how I can help her.

However, I found out a few days ago that I am pregnant. I’m afraid that my sister will no longer want to live with us if there’s a child in the mix, but I need to let her know sooner rather than later. My question is: should I break the news to her before, during, or after the therapy session? I can see it being helpful having a neutral third party present, but I don’t want her to feel blindsided. Any advice is welcome!

TL;DR-I’m moving into a house with my sister, who is recovering from a major depressive episode. I just found out that I’m pregnant. What is the best timing to tell her?"
65,"Why do people think it's okay to yell at me?


My mother [46F] and boyfriend [27M - we're dating for 8 months] always do that and it makes me so sad. I never yell at anyone. They say that I don't know how to express my feelings, but I don't think it's true. And they say that I deserve to be yelled at because it's my fault. I make them angry. My mom even threatened to punch me because I couldn't find my favorite shorts. She didn't apologize to me later. I feel so sad. I think people treat me badly. I don't have anyone in my life. And my grandmother is the only one who doesn't do those things. I don't have anyone to talk about it. I may be a pain in the ass sometimes, but do I really need to be yelled at?

TLDR: I hate people yelling at me and saying that I deserve it."
66,"My (27F) partner (29F) of over a year got custody of her cousin (2 years old) due and my parents don't like it because they think it's wrong.


My partner of a year has become the legal guardian to her cousin. His mother sadly passed away, and no one else on the family was really in a position to take him in. My partner is financially stable enough to raise a kid. She was his god mother so that's another aspect to the situation. They're been living together for 6 months. I'm not living with them yet. I believe it's psychologist or something, but he said its best if it's just the two of them living together for a while. A sense of security I believe is what they guy said. 

My parents never seemed to have a problem with the fact I was lesbian. They never really cared. I think it was easier of them because they have grand children from my siblings. That's all they really wanted. They were more than welcoming at first. Well as they learned that my partner is taking in a child they became more stand offish with me. They didn't return my calls. They only contacted me when they needed or wanted something. This is where I started to put the pieces together. My partner sent me a picture of him wearing his little Batman shirt. He's too young to even know or understand Batman. He just likes his Batman teddy. To him it keeps monsters away. He won't sleep without it. When I showed to my dad, he made the comment that Batman wasn't raised by a same sex couple. That's essentially what he said. 

To shorten this post the summary of the argument that ensued was the following. They don't like that my partner is essentially raising a kid that will grow up without a father. They think it's going to screw with the child's mind. They think it will be harmful if or when I move in. I want to know how to handle my parents going forward because I don't know what to think of them anymore. 

**TL;DR:** parents don't like that my partner is raising a child without a father figure in his life. "
67,"Me [27 F] heartbroken after my [26 M] boyfriend of 6 years backs out of planned proposal


My boyfriend and I have been together 6 years as of this August. We have lived together now for close to 2 years as well. We have had many conversations about marriage, babies, and our future together.

This past winter we had a more serious and strategic conversation about our future than we have had in the past. We decided that we both wanted to get married in late January of 2019. My boyfriend asked me to send him links to rings I was interested in for the engagement. I sent him links by late January of 2018.

I of course wasn't expecting a proposal within a few weeks of our conversation. However, I did assume that a proposal would happen within the first 3 months of the year - considering we would need at least 8 months to plan a proper wedding.

Fast forward to March 2018, and we have a vacation planned for the last week of March/first week of April. This trip was very representative of our relationship, as it was a mainly hiking and outdoors themed trip.

Maybe I was naive, but I was almost certain he was going to propose at some point during our trip. My friends and family were all expecting a proposal as well - despite the fact that we had not talked to many people about our plans for marriage. My boyfriend was seemingly the only person that did not notice what a great opportunity our trip was for an engagement.

I came home from the trip disappointed. I absolutely understand that he is not expected to read my mind, and know that I was expecting a proposal. What hurt is that he seemed like the only person that did not know me well enough to know how important this trip was, and how meaningful a proposal would have been. I started to think he wasn't being honest with me about his intentions to get married.

For the next week after our trip, we had many thoughtful discussions about what to do. He made it very clear to me that he still wanted to get married this year, and that the past few months had gone by so fast he didn't think about planning a proposal in time for our trip.

Fast forward to this past weekend (April 20th) - he tells me that he has an appointment on Saturday but won't tell me what it's for. I start to assume he is up to something regarding a proposal. Sunday night he asks me about my rings again, and asks me which one I really prefer. At this point I am very certain he is looking to buy a ring within the next week. Monday night after work he has another mysterious appointment. As you might guess, I am now dead certain a proposal is happening VERY soon.

Come Tuesday night, he is acting funny. He seems sad, distant, and distracted before bed. I ask him what's bothering him, and he finally admits that he is feeling a lot of pressure to propose. He tells me that he was on the phone that morning about to finalize his purchase of a ring - but he gets a bad feeling and backs out. He tells me that he feels like he needs more time, but doesn't say how much time he needs.

I am completely floored. I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. Hearing that was the last thing I expected to hear from him last week. I feel like he has lied to me this entire year about his seriousness over marriage. I feel like he has betrayed my trust and that we are no longer a team. I feel like he's broken my heart from having second thoughts about proposing.

At this point in the year, it's almost too late to start planning a wedding for January. So essentially our plans have unravelled completely. I feel lost. I don't know whether or not this is a deal breaker for me. Despite my boyfriend wavering on the proposal, he still strongly claims that he wants to spend his life with me and doesn't want to lose me over this. 

I'm not sure if this is something I can move past - but I also can't imagine not being with him. Despite being hurt so badly, breaking up isn't something that my brain has even truly considered.

I would really love to hear some advice and opinions on this. I haven't talked to many of my friends about this, and have really been trying to work through it with my boyfriend alone. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend of nearly 6 years backs out of planned proposal, not sure how to react or what to do."
68,"Me [32M] with my wife [30F]. She constantly makes hurtful (false) comments about me having an affair.


Background: Married for 3 years. 1 infant kid. I work full time, she's a SAHM.

More background: A few months before the kid was born, I decided I didn't want to become a stereotypical ""suburban dad,"" so I lost weight (about 40lbs) and started to make a concerted effort to be more ""put together."" I wasn't a slob or anything before, but I didn't put much effort into my appearance either. With the baby I still don't devote tons of time to my appearance, but I keep the weight off, have clothes that actually fit, use soap made for my face, etc. Just little things. 

When the changes started becoming obvious, my wife would joke that I was gonna leave her for someone else. Haha. Funny. I didn't like her saying those things but I just rolled my eyes when she did. At some point, it changed from being little jokes to snide, hurtful, comments about the affair I must be having. And she's still making them almost a year later.

Like the other day I had a pretty good day at work. It was nice weather for the first time in months. I was in an especially good mood. I'm usually in a pretty good mood, but that was just an especially bright day. When I got home my wife made a snide comment about me being in a good mood and how I must have seen my girlfriend that day. Good mood instantly gone. When she says stuff like that it hurts and I don't want to interact with her for awhile, which I'm sure makes the problem worse.

This should go without saying since I'm making the post, but I'm not having an affair. I've never cheated. I would never cheat. And it's not like I have an opportunity to either. I don't spend time outside of the house other than work. I don't even have any female co-workers in my age bracket to cheat with. It's 100% her insecurity.

I know the solution is to talk to her, and I have. I've told her many times that the comments are hurtful. I've told her that when she says things like that it just kills any joy I'm feeling toward her. I know that she's probably feeling a little insecure since the baby and tired of being stuck at home all day, and I've offered to do whatever she needs. Time to herself, a gym membership, whatever. She doesn't take the opportunity. If there's something she's unhappy with, she doesn't seem motivated to do anything about it. The romance in our relationship is obviously down with the baby, but even the last date night (the first one in 2 months) we had she ruined with a mean comment. I would suspect something postpartum, but she's been screened for depression and she was making these comments before the baby too.

I'm obviously not communicating correctly or effectively. I know the other obvious solution is to work harder to make her feel special and desired, but she needs to stop saying hurtful things to me. It's hard for me to make her feel ""special"" when she says mean things that just piss me off. 

I feel like we're just resenting each other right now and I don't know how to address it. Help? Can anyone give me a more constructive way to talk with her about this? Especially from a female perspective?

TLDR: I got in shape before the baby. Wife keeps making hurtful comments about me having an affair. I'm not. Her comments are starting to eat at my feelings for her."
69,"My dad (65 M) is skipping my sister's wedding(30 F) and I (27 F) don't want to talk to him ever again.


My sister (30F) has planned for a vegas wedding since November because she didn't want a big traditional wedding. I (27 F) also made the suggestion for a vegas wedding since that's is where our parent got married. My sister has never been married and has been with her fiancé for almost 4 years.

The wedding is almost 3 weeks away and my dad (65 M) informed my mom (66 F) and my sister is not coming to the wedding because of the dog. She had surgery to remove a bladder tumor and is in remission but now she's incontinent and leaks on herself. He states she needs around the clock care and will not go to the wedding. This issue has not been brought up and if he would have said something from the beginning my sister would have gotten married in court. 

My mom's cousin(62 F) doesn't work and already has volunteered to house sit and watch the dog. My dad said no because he doesn't want that responsibility on her because she would have to wash her bottom a lot. My dad also refuses to diaper her because of his own pride. 

My sister has expressed her wishes for him to walk her down the aisle and can't force him to go to the wedding. I wasn't there when he informed my mom and sister but I know that my mom is probably furious.

Right now I can only describe my feelings as disappointed and heartbroken that my dad is choosing not to go when help has been offered and declined it. My sister also made the suggestion for him to fly out the day of the wedding and leave at night so he is considering it. I feel like his priorities are mixed up and even my sister said, ""well I don't plan on getting married""

My sister has begged me not to say anything because she wants it to be peaceful and not to stir drama. I haven't said anything to my dad but I told her that if he doesn't come I don't want to talk to him again. I don't know if I could ever forgive him if he chose not to come when help has been offered.

What should I do? My dad is very stubborn and believes he's always right. I just can't believe he thinks this is the best solution. Money is not a factor.

  **tl;dr**: My dad is not going to my sister's wedding, won't accept help, and I don't want to speak to him again."
70,"Me [F/30] with my boyfriend of five years [M/30] going on a trip, he wants me to pay for part of an extravagant expense he plans to do there for himself.


Hi! We are going on a trip, yeah! I make about twice the salary as my partner (we're still middle class) so I said that I would be paying the expenses to pro-rata.

Today he showed me the website of something he wants to do while there : an afternoon at a heavy-machinery 'sandbox' where people can maneuvre real diggers, excavators, etc. He wants to buy the big package, which is some 450$ (plus tax).

I didn't think that this was the type of thing that would be covered in our 'pro-rata' deal, as this is an experience for him only. I said 'oh that looks cool, it's a bit expensive though, do you have the budget for that?' he looked like me like I was an alien, and he said 'well, I'm only paying my part because of the pro-rata'. When I explained that since this was something for him only, I didn't think it would be fair that I pay, he seemed a bit shocked and said we're going to need to have a more definite conversation about what our deal means because he really thought we would be putting every expense in a box and divide it pro-rata once we got home.

Am I being unfair here?

TL;DR : When dividing cost of living to salary pro-rata with your partner, should this include extravagant expenses that they decide to do?"
71,"Two years ago, I (M36) fired my biggest client (M30s) for lying to me and costing me a huge opportunity. Did I do the right thing?


I do video work and this guy, we'll call him Anthony, had been my client ever since I got out of college. Anthony had been a big cheerleader for me throughout, but I think he knew I was insecure and would often take advantage of my eagerness to please. He came from a far more stable and financially secure background, private school and all that, and I think he saw that as a reason to look down on me. 

About five years into Anthony and my working relationship, I meet Mark, a performance artist. Mark and I become friends and we travel to New York several times to film. Anthony becomes Mark's manager. Two years go by, that film becomes a pilot and that pilot gets picked up to become a TV series. This was my dream all along and it was finally happening.  I run into Anthony and he says he supports me fully and he'll put in a good word for me.

After several agonizing months, the show moves forward. Mark is the star, but I don't get hired. I'm shattered, but Anthony hires me for a small gig and it keeps the lights on. I do it, but my heart's not really in the work.

During the show, Mark calls me up and tells me that I need to sit down. He proceeds to tell me that Anthony had been badmouthing me to the producers of the show. That's why they didn't hire me. Specifically, he said I did too many drugs and wouldn't do the work. This is so far from the truth, it's not funny. I am appalled. It's like church bells are ringing impending doom in my brain. I spent seven years working for this guy, two years building up a pilot and one person tore it all apart. 

So I don't believe Mark.

After the show is done, Mark sits me down with one of the writers. The writer tells me the same story. Anthony was badmouthing me.

I still don't believe it.

Finally, Mark gets me in the room with the executive producer of the show. She tells me the same story. 

Now, I'm livid. White hot rage. 

I stop all communication with Anthony. I work with his business partner instead, wrap up my remaining work and cut off all communication.

Anthony sends me an email basically saying ""you'll be nothing without me"". I don't reply.

Here's the thing: that experience shattered my confidence. I haven't been the same since. I even won a huge award for my work in there somewhere and Anthony was at the ceremony. Didn't talk to him. Felt terrible. 

That was two years ago.

How the hell do I get back to loving my work? How do I resolve the feelings of betrayal? How do I move on?

TL;DR: Long\-time client lied and sabotaged my most ambitious effort. Confidence shattered. Need to start over."
72,"Pretty sure my[26 M] GF[25 F] of 8 yrs is expecting a proposal *tonight* but it's not happening


Throwaway because she know my reddit username: We've been together forever, we've absolutely talked about marriage and she even designed the ring, which I now have stashed. So, this isn't the ""I'm not ready, she is, so we need to have a marriage talk"" thing.

It's her birthday, which is the anniversary of me asking her out the first time. Not a bad day to pop the question, I admit! But I had made the decision a while ago not to propose on a day that is both a) already special and b) a day I like to make about her. Plus we've got our actual anniversary coming up soon and a few more options that I think could be better - the act isn't a surprise, so I kind of wanted the question to be one. Plus, she went ahead and picked our restaurant and more or less planned out the night (including inviting a bunch of friends out to a bar after we get dinner) so I didn't have a ton of options to set something perfect up.

She made a point to tell me yesterday that she's getting her nails done, wearing a new dress, and has generally given off a vibe of ""this is gonna be a GREAT day..."" almost as though she feels like she's figured out my secret. I would chalk it up to a girl just getting excited for her birthday, but she knows a proposal is coming (soon) and it feels different from previous big date nights.

I don't know what to do. I see my options (feel free to expand them!) as: 1) give it my all to be a great date and don't mention anything or do anything that might look like winding up to propose - basically ignore the vibe I'm getting and try to avoid any semblance of playing a ""will he or won't he"" game or 2) somewhere early in the night somehow explain that it's not going to be tonight. Option 2 is a bit scary on a number of levels, but so is the idea of just not mentioning it and her getting really sad when she realizes it's not tonight.

**tldr: She knows I'm going to propose and I am, just not tonight - but she seems to be planning on it and I don't want to ruin her birthday** "
73,"My so [30F] of 5 years has started to ghosted me [31M], and i don't understand what is going on.


We have been together for over 5 years now, and last Sunday we came back from spending a 3 week vacation celebrating 5 years 
 bouncing around Europe. We have never really fought, or argued and have always been really open about everything. On top of this less than a month ago we agreed to both sign a lease for renting a much nicer apartment in downtown Toronto.

The last thing she said before our uber dropped her off at her apartment coming back from Europe. Was 'i love you', and that she would see me tuesday night for our D&amp;D group.

On average we text a bunch during the day, usually we send good morning and make small idle chit chat. 

* Monday she never responded to any of my texts and i just assumed she was jet lagged, or her phone was dead.
* Tuesday same thing, no response. I called her before i was supposed to come pick her up for D&amp;D, and got her voicemail. Ended up showing up anyways and waited almost an hour but she never showed up (or she was home and not answering her door).
* Wednesday i started panicking, thinking she was kidnapped. I ended up calling her parents who told me they talked to her yesterday. I messaged her roomate on FB, who also said she was home this morning, and left for work. I came by at her place after work, and her car was there but she ether wasn't answering or she went out. 
* Thursday i realized that she no longer showed up on Twitter, Steam, Instagram, and Facebook for me. I sent her a rather diplomatic email late thursday basically asking ""Hey what is going on? Along with if we are done what do i do with all your stuff still in my apartment. Along with what are we going to do with the apartment we cosigned on.""
* Friday i ended up hiding my number, and called her she ended up answering but i got too scared and hung up. I then drank myself into oblivion. 

On Saturday night she posted on twitter that she got a new job (we both work in Software) at one of the Big N (Starting with an A), which really confuses me, i had no idea she was applying for jobs. Probably 50% of the clothing in my apartment is hers, along with many other things. I am just at a complete and utter loss, and feel like an absolute wreck. 

TLDR; My SO of 5 years has started ghosting me, and i am at a complete and utter loss.

74,"My ex [24F] of 3 years left me [23M] 5 months ago for co-worker. Now she texted back.


Hello guys.


I have to say thank you for all advices you give to people. It's been rough 5 months for me, and for the last 2-3 months I was checking /r/relationships to survive my hard-times by reading your advices for others.


As the title says, I have been with my ex for 3 years. We met in university and shortly after we started living together. 


We had our conflicts, as others do, but we were just happy couple and never counted time of how long we have been together.


I have always trusted her. Whether she is out with her female friends, drinking and stuff, whether she is out with her male group-mates, I had my trust in her and have never thought that someday she would brake it.


I have to add that she was a bit controlling. Whenever I was leaving the room, every single time she asked me where I was going. If I was for a longer time with her sister in another room, she would come and beg me to comeback to our room. Whenever I was out, she was angry if I was not answering to her messages. Whenever I was out of the country and logged into messenger (i.e. accept new friend invitation, exchange contacts with people I met there and so on) she would be mad if I won't answer to her messages. It usually went like ""If you are going to log into messenger, you also have to find time to answer my messages"".


So, back to the story. 5 months ago she started looking for a job. She found one and was very happy with it. But I felt that something was off. She started to use her phone more frequently and I could definitely tell that not everything was allright. She started to deny my invitations to go out, but started going with her female best friend more often. 


So one day I asked her to whom she is talking to on her phone so much, and she told me that it's just co-worker. There is nothing to worry about because they don't talk that much during work, so it's the only chance to talk between them.


The feeling that something is off just did not go away. Some of my friends noticed that she has none photos of us in her instagram and made changed privacy to private (it was always public). I checked it and it was true, there was just photos of herself. So one morning, I logged into her fb (she changed password a few days ago, but I used the recovery) and saw whole conversation between them.


Not only they met during work more than others, they also hung out together, exchanged pictures (first she sent photo of herself to him, then usually forwarded to me (it was like deja-vu seeing same photos I have received)). She even knew where he lived, there was some expired location sharing sessions and so on. She lied to me that she was hanging out with her best friend or group of co-workers. Usually it was just him or she, her best friend, he and his best friend. She told to her best friend that she would love to sleep all 4 in the same bed after getting drunk.


I was crushed, I was devastated. I left my work hour earlier, so I could pack my stuff and leave (it was her parents flat).


She got back, I had to really force her to tell the truth, and after about 10 times of asking to tell me everything she still hadn't told everything I knew. At least she confessed that she lied to me and was out with for a few times.


I left, but I couldn't believe of what have happened. So we met after a few days. I was so in love with her that I wanted to forget everything and get back with her. Also, I couldn't feel at home like I am at home, and wanted to get back to her (our) place as fast as I could.


Long story short, she me the chance, I made her surprises, gifted gifts to her and so on. She agreed to celebrate new years-eve together. I prepared many surprises, such as releasing sky lantern during the night, our photos collage, the jar with the ideas of what should we do together in 2018. After the eve, she stopped talking to me. I waited for a week or two, went to her crying, desperate and asked why she is not writing to me. She said that she feels perfect the way everything is and doesn't want to change anything. She said maybe one day we will be together but now I must live my life without her.


It was tough 3 months for me, I drank a lot, cried, banged my head to the wall (not literally), etc. But after reading one motivational book, I got back on my feet: started going to gym (the idea taken from your suggestion to others), learned how to cook, started helping others, smiling more, got promotion at work, got bonus, got few free trips for the help I provided and so on. Everything with the heart broken feeling, it stayed no matter what I did.


So now, one week ago, there was my birthday (Hers was month ago, but I just ignored it). I didn't expect anything, but woke-up to a missed call from her. I didn't call her back, but the old bad feelings came to me again and for a few days I was desperate. Then those feelings got away and I could feel normal again. 


Until today. I woke-up to a missed message from her at midnight. I didn't read it, but the first lines where something like this ""I had quit my masters because I knew that without you and your support I couldn't do it. I am also crushed because I don't know how are you doing. Please tell me a bit..........""


And for a little bit of context, I helped her a lot with her bachelor's. I don't like to say that she couldn't had done it without me, but practically half of the work she had to do was mine. And also, I have her blocked on social media, removed all her friends so she is just left with the phone.


So reddit, please help me to grasp the idea of what is happening. All this time I was dreaming of her to write to me. How will I tell her that I have changed, how better I am now and so on. But after she messaged me, I don't feel like that anymore.


**TL;DR** Girlfriend of 3 years left me for her co-worker (or just only I think so). We have been in no contact for 3 months, and recently I have found a missed call during my birthday and later on a message which I did not read, but from the first line it was asking how I was because she is crushed that she does not know anything about me.

Edit: I have to note that I still have a few items left at her place (such as tv, chromecast, a few tshirts, ice skates). I told her to keep the tv until I will need it (because I thought that we will get back together). I know that eventually I will have to ask her or her sister to bring evertyhing back to me. But I just feel that it's still too soon and I would burst into tears seeing those people again."
75,"Me [34 F] with my Friend [31 F] Friend went off on my after my polite request to split a group trip gas and insurance total



I recently went on a bachelorette party which was a road trip to Baja wine country. We needed two cars, so I happily volunteered to drive one of them as I have a larger SUV. I had to buy Mexican insurance for the weekend and I asked the group if we could split that, and got an affirmative response.

I got horridly sick the weekend of the trip and almost didn't make it but forced myself to go despite a throat that felt like lava (I didn't want to get them sick but they wanted me to go). Since I didn't want to drink while sick, I offered to drive and be the designated driver all weekend so everyone could have a good time and not deal with cabs down there. I was very happy to do this and I was glad that at least it worked out. I also drove everyone from winery to winery, which we were originally going to either get a driver for or take cabs.

However, driving everyone around all weekend definitely put me in the hole gas wise, and that plus the insurance was a good $120. Since we were all splitting condo rent, food for the condo, and group restaurant meals evenly, I felt that this expense should be split as well. So I politely asked about splitting it and the friend who planned the weekend went absolutely CRAZY on me over the group text and in personal text.

She accused me of not thinking of the bigger picture and cited that she had to pay for a $300 plane ticket to go, that she had spent money on an atm fee to get cash out for people ($10 I think she said?), and basically said that I should foot this $120 bill after being designated driver and helping out because ""that's what friends do."" She accused me of not chipping in for little things which was untrue (I brought desserts which was on part with everyone else's personal offering). She then said I could have just not gone, and it would have been cheaper without me. Which hurt and also makes no sense.

I was flabbergasted because she asked to split the $92 grocery bill for everyone that she spent, which was totally fair obviously. How is my bill any different? And on top of that, I had ASKED if it could be split before this to avoid this kind of thing, because my current financial situation makes it hard for me to splurge on things like this without feeling resentful. She also accused me of asking for it a day later and ""not at breakfast when we talked about the grocery bill"" which makes no sense to me.

So I tried to reason with her and take the high road, and told her that I did not think it was fair that I should pay $120 over everyone else on top of driving, and that her personal plane ticket to go to this was her own responsibility and not mine. (Keep in mind, she planned this event and she could have opted to do something cheaper or planned it when she would already be in town). I told her that I am NOT in good financial shape at the moment (I am in credit card debt due to medical things for myself and my dog separately) and that friends should not expect each other to go into debt for them.

Keep in mind that on this trip we all split restaurant bills evenly despite the fact that I didn't drink, so obviously I was paying extra for everyone else's multiple cocktails. But I didn't say anything and it was for the fun and good of the group.

She kept going on about how friends do this for each other and I could not calmly rationalize with her.

Am I missing something? I agreed to do the weekend because as it was with everything split I could afford it, but having to personally pay $120 extra for something that we all shared seems crazy and I would feel resentful and taken advantage of if I didn't ask to split it. I mean, she didn't foot the grocery bill. Everything else that wasn't a minor expense or gift was split.

I shouldn't be responsible for her personal travel expenses, right?

I asked her why she thought I ""always did this"" and she said something about how she's a vegetarian and her stuff is always cheaper but I'm ok splitting the bill. Which confused me because I almost never dine with her one on one and I'd rather pay my share separately and when it's up to me I pay for my own items. I almost never ask to split the bill unless it's clearly even. I actually thought back to when we last ate out together and I believe the last time we dined one on one I bought a beer and made sure I made up for that cost.

I guess I'm just really upset because I really try to go out of my way to help friends and not ask for things in return, but on money I have to draw some boundaries.

This friend also has extremely wealthy parents and I believe is living rent free.

I've been working on not being a doormat and trying to have boundaries and speaking up for myself. It's very hard for me to ask for help and to ask for people to do things for me. When people ask me for help I go out of my way to do it, in fact I have had to work hard on saying no to people and asking for my fair share in certain things. And now that I've spoken up I got completely ridiculed and insulted.

I feel that if anyone else on this trip asked to split this cost it would have been fine. I would personally be uncomfortable letting someone drive me around and not offer to chip in if the expense was that much.

I asked if this was about anything else and didn't get much other than the thing about splitting food bills which I am stunned about.

She then accused me of never having been to a bachelorette party (I informed her I have) and also accused me of going on a personal trip to Seattle next weekend (which I'm using points for and staying with a friend and is totally free).

TL;DR:  Friend went off on me for asking to split a $120 gas and insurance bill for a group trip after driving everyone around, citing her personal travel expenses to the event and that ""friends just do this"".  Wat."
76,"My (24/f) boyfriend (28/m) frequently judges my monthly budget


I have a pretty good job, and I make about 15k more than my boyfriend of 6 years. I pay heavily into a retirement fund and a 401k each month. Naturally, without trying too hard or thinking about it, I save an additional 600 bucks a month and have quite the little nest egg right now.



The problem is, my boyfriend seems to just assume I am very bad with money because of my family history. I grew up in a very poor environment and neither one of my parents have savings. By contrast, his parents are extremely wealthy, and he has never needed money for college, cars, etc. He still is on his family phone plan.


There is definitely some tension that I earn more, as he has expressed the desire to be the 'breadwinner' before and often talks about how he isn't being paid market value for his job. All these discussions about money really annoy me because we are doing better than I could ever imagine. I have more money in my bank account than my mom earned in a year raising me. I feel proud, fulfilled, and safe, and he constantly seems to feel like we are underperforming in terms of saving money. 


What this results in is he is EXTREMELY critical of all of my purchases. We haven't been on a vacation because he refuses to work it into the budget. He gets a little huffy if I have any packages delivered, as it is evidence that I spent money. Lastly, he points I spend more than him each month, EVEN though I also SAVE more than him each month, and I buy all the household supplies!


I know this has to be some sort of anxiety on his end. How do I get my boyfriend to stop micromanaging my money when we are legitimately doing fine?



**TLDR: Boyfriend judges my very sane spending habits, I feel like it is out of his anxiety, what do?**"
