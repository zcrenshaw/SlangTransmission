9,"Me [31F] with my friend [39M], been good friends for two years. I have cancer and am not going to live a whole lot longer. Should I tell him I have feelings for him even though nothing is going to come of it, probably?


Chemo is very, very not sexy.  So it's not like I think I'll tell him and he'll be like ""oh god, let's bone right here!"" or he'll make some grand gesture about having a relationship with me til my time comes.  That isn't what I want, nor why I want to do it.  

I get really sad when I think about dying without telling him how I feel.  We've always had ridiculous chemistry, we were just never single at the same time while I was still healthy.  


tl;dr: Should I tell him I'm in love?  How?  And since I don't think there's going to be a lot of time left or that he would want to be with me anyway...is this a good idea?

ETA:  Obligatory 'this blew up' comment and thank you guys for taking the time and being so, so kind  It occurred to me this a.m. that he has probably read this by now and figured everything out.  So maybe you guys did my job for me?  Thanks!

11,"I'm [23F] pulling my hair out over the fact that my bf [27M] is in trouble at work for acting aggressively and not watching his freakin mouth when speaking to coworkers. He wants me to hold him while he boohoos and I'm over it.


Basically my bf thinks of himself as a fighter for justice at his job and takes it upon himself to try to tackle any perceived injustice that's happening.

For instance: at some point a mix up had happened and he and a coworker weren't getting paid for sick days. He marched into his bosses office and raised his voice and demanded pay for both of them. Boss told him to watch his attitude but eventually both bf and other dude got their pay. Bf told the other guy but was never thanked. In fact, the other guy thanked God and went on with his day. I told him he needs to watch his mouth and using curses with his boss is immature. I also told him stop marching in there and demanding things for other people because none of your coworkers care about you, nor have they ever stuck their neck out for you. Theyre the smart ones!!

Another instance, bf was leaving work an hour early because he felt he completes his work early every day, and that he carries the brunt of the work (this not requested of him. He picks up other people's slack because HE WANTS TO) Boss called him out and once again they got into a heated verbal argument where they got into each other's face. Boss told him to stop and just let him know who isn't working but bf continued leaving early because he feels that's his right. Bf also told me he believes that arguing means his boss respects him and that he's ""basically"" second in command. Again, I told him watch your damn mouth, you're not second in command, and you are replaceable as an employee. Watch your footing because if you keep taking a mile when offered an inch you'll fall off the cliff. Again, nope, he respects me and knows that I help him run things. He wont get rid of me, he needs me. Bf left early EVERY DAY since that conversation.

ANOTHER instance, 3 fellow employees got in trouble for getting to work late the same day. It was a busy stressful day and their presence was sorely needed. They all trickled in with the latest being 20 minutes late due to the subway messing up. There's an employee-boss group chat where the boss chewed these three guys out and in the end wrote them all up. The boss also chewed out the rest of the employees and said that there was work that wasn't done and everyone needs to try harder.

Bf of course is horribly distressed that they got in trouble because it ""was only 20 minutes!!"" And he was personally offended by the boss saying work needs to be finished. (If the shoe fits, huh?) So bf matches into bosses office and demands that boss tells him what exactly was not finished. Like, get any paperwork or get online and show him whats not finished. He also told boss that he should've asked him if the guys were late enough to warrant being in trouble.

Aaaand they argued. And argued. Bf admitted that he was aggressive in speaking to boss and got in his face telling him that he didn't know how to run the place. Boss got in his face back and they were cursing at each other. Honestly, bf is very lucky his boss is a physically large gutsy guy and not easily frightened because if it was a different person with less patience I have no doubt that he would've been escorted off the premises.

So boss told him he'd ""handle him later."" Bf kind of laughed it off and said since he's in a union nothing is going to happen to him. I told him AGAIN that you need to stop this! You can't bark at your boss and speak to people like you're in a bar fight. You can't bully people into listening to you, you cannot forget that you are REPLACEABLE. Bf told him he'd standing up for what's right since boss was taking his frustration out on everyone. I told him STOP TRYING TO SPEAK FOR YOUR COWORKERS. NO ONE ELECTED YOU AS A SPOKESPERSON. And no one has defended bf because you go to work to get paid! Not skate on thin ice for some asshole that yells at the boss!! Bf assured me that what's right is right and that the Charlottesville protesters were hurt for standing for what's right, and that this is similar. Basically he's a good person being punished for trying to do what's good.

Well, later came. 3 write ups at once for language + aggressiveness, leaving early, and disobedience, basically. 3 write ups means unpaid suspension, possibly termination in the worst instances.

NOW HE'S UPSET. I asked him how many times I've told him to mind his damn business and act like he's got some sense. Now he's weepy and scared. His schedule will also be changing to graveyard shifts when he gets back (so he'll never see the boss again, basically) instead of his 7am-3pm. He said theyre still deliberating on if he'll be kept at all but theyre changing things around for the time being. I'm pulling my hair out and part of me honestly wants to leave. This is so stupid. So many chances were given to him! What the hell!

I don't know what to do. He wants emotional support and cuddles and I can barely look at him right now. I've never felt so disgusted and unattracted to anyone the way I feel right now. What is the next step when you've been telling someone something they refused to listen to and now they want your help? I am so, so angry.

Tl;dr: bf acted like an ass multiple times and finally got in trouble for it. What happens after ""I told you so""? Am I really supposed to support him through this?"
12,"My (30f) husband (29m) of 10 years is an addict in recovery and I'm so proud of him. He's taken up super long distance running (50-100 miles) and I'm seeing the ""addict"" coming out in him again. I don't know if this is my last straw.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6q4u1b/i_19f_want_to_tell_my_mom_48f_that_i_dont_want_to/) to original post.

Hi Reddit! I've received a few requests to make a follow-up posts, so I'm back! Before I start, I want to thank everyone for their kindness and their support. Some of you guys gave me some really great advice, and I honestly couldn't thank you enough. Of course, there were a few trolls in my last post, and I want to go off topic for a bit to tell any prospective assholes to *please* stay off my posts. The anti-muslim rhetoric these days has really shaken me up, and I deal with plenty in real life without you guys bringing it online.

About three weeks ago- the Saturday after I made my original post- I sat down with my mom and I told her about how I didn't want to wear the hijab. I like to think that it wasn't a complete surprise, because I've definitely been loosening it up over the past few years, but it was still a painful conversation. We both cried and said some very painful things, but our first conversation ended at an impasse. The next day, we sat down and had a very honest discussion. I told her that I loved and respected both her and our religion, but the hijab was ultimately my decision and she couldn't force me. She agreed, but with the stipulation that I participate in events at our mosque more often and make more religious friends- which is a fair enough compromise, so I agreed.

Talking to my dad was a little harder, because we're not very close, but he was pretty calm and understanding throughout. He told me that even though no one on his side of the family wore the hijab, he liked it when I did because he always saw it as a good thing. Ultimately, he left the decision up to me, but asked that I wear it to family events for a little while so that people wouldn't get the wrong idea.

I'm not going to say my mom and I are 100% okay, but she's handling it remarkably well. We'll go out and shop together, or hang out around the house and just talk and she won't treat me any differently. After those first two days, we haven't really had an in-depth conversation about me wearing the hijab, but she does ask that I wear it around certain people for now so that people won't unnecessarily gossip. I completely understand, because my mom is a pretty well-known figure in our community, and I would never want my decisions to reflect poorly on her. We both agreed that I'll handle it in phases, and that I'm not going to wear it at college or at work or when I'm with my friends, but family and mosque events need me to be more covered-up. I actually move in to college tomorrow, so wish me luck with that!

It's a little silly, but now that I'm not wearing the hijab I have so many inane problems to deal with. I completely skipped 9 years worth of haircare experience, so I have NO idea how to style it, or what to do other than just throwing it up into a ponytail. I've definitely noticed that people treat me differently, too. Service people at stores are a lot more friendly and I've gotten cat-called a few times (which is really uncomfortable, but I guess that's life?) I'm also a little nervous about posting stuff to instagram, or changing my social media profile pictures, because not a lot of people know yet, but I figure I'll take things as I go. Once more, I want to thank all of you guys for your kindness and support!

TL;DR I spoke to my parents about not wearing the hijab, and they took it pretty well. I'm a little nervous about how people are going to react, but also excited to see where this decision takes me."

20,"I [23F] just broke up with my boyfriend [23M] of one year because of his obsession with marijuana. Everyone is acting like it's no big deal and that I'm crazy or out of touch.


Hi r/relationships. I hope it's okay that I am posting this with a throwaway account because people I know irl know my main and I don't want this drama all over it.

**Firstly, I will say as a disclaimer that even though I have never smoked/eaten/taken marijuana and don't ever plan to, I have no objection to it. I think it should be legal for adults and sold like alcohol. I don't think anyone should be arrested for it and the war on drugs has not been effective. I don't use but I have no problem with other who uses for medical or recreational reasons. I don't care if you use, I just don't want to smell it or be around it when you do.**

The story is that I [23F] just broke up with my boyfriend [23M] of one year because I could not handle his obsession with marijuana. He talked about marijuana almost 24/7. Everything was about when he smoked last and when he would smoke again. He entered into a 2 year MA program after he did his undergrad and he almost got kicked out of his dorm for smoking marijuana because of the fact that it is illegal here and from the smell. He had free bordering at the school from a grant but he decided to move out and pay rent in an apartment so he could smoke there more freely.

In our state marijuana is completely illegal for any reason. Our state does not have diversion and possessing anything over 2 ounces is a felony. If he had gotten caught with it in his apartment he would surely be evicted. His apartment was near a school and this is a 5 year sentence if caught. He also would use hash all the time and it's a felony also. Now I don't agree with the law and think it should be legal like I said above. But I think you need to be realistic about the reality where you live. He had no medical need and I couldn't believe he would risk going to jail for felonies over this. He also would drive after or while he was smoking marijuana and said it doesn't impair you to affect driving.

He would smoke the second he woke up, before every meal, when he got home from school and before bed. He had to smoke it at least 6 times a day every day or he would get so cranky and annoying to be around. Everything was about how great marijuana is and when he would smoke next. He smoked it before his grandmother's funeral and went there high, with red eyes and reeking. He actually argued with me and said marijuana does not smell even though his place and his car reek and he often smells of it. He had a part time job but he got fired because he would be late or not show up because he was off smoking and getting high instead.

I could not handle it anymore. I was second fiddle to it and he was about marijuana 24/7. I couldn't see a future with him and I couldn't imagine living with him because of his constant use and the smell. I stopped going to his place because it smelled so bad and he said he hated coming over to my apartment because I refused to let him smoke or bring marijuana inside. Now everyone single one of his friends and all of our mutual friends, and even a few of my friends who I have told say I am overreacting because marijuana is not a big deal and I need to stop being so uptight. Not one person has sided with me. I have been told stuff like there is no such thing as being addicted to marijuana or that you can't really drive high on weed as a danger because it doesn't make you a dangerous driver. I have been told I am too uptight to understand and I need to chill and smoke a blunt to relax.

Am I really that out of touch? Did I overreact here? I just can't believe that almost everyone feels so strongly that I am wrong and my boyfriend is right and should be supported over me. Even people like me who don't use say marijuana is not a big deal and is different than even cigarettes or alcohol or hard drugs.

tl;dr: My boyfriend of a year talked about marijuana 24/7 and had to smoke it at least 6 times a day or he would get cranky and be unbearable to be around. I broke up with him over it and everyone who knows about it has supported him over me and says I am uptight and wrong. Am I really that out of touch?"

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qzkz2/my_27m_partner_25f_of_15_years_whose/)

After all the replies I got, I told her that I was going to take a step back and let her figure out her thoughts and feelings since I felt completely neglected emotionally. It was now or never, I needed actions and not just hollow words.

We did not speak for a week and she never tried to contact me. We're now in the same city (we were in different countries for 1,5 months) and I went to pick up my stuff from her apartment yesterday.

She said she tried to fall in love with me but wasn't able to and she felt she could not reciprocate the feelings I had for her, although she does have feelings for me. It was a very emotional moment for both of us and she told me she didn't want me to stop talking to her. I told her that was not possible and I would not be contacting her again, as painful as it may be.

She said she will definitely go to counseling/therapy after I suggested it, but she can't ask me to wait for her and see if she gets better/wants to be with me in the future. She also finally told her family about the relationship that we had, but I guess it was just to prepare them because she knew I would not remain friends after this and they would wonder what happened to me since we were always together.

I feel devastated and just moved in to an apartment 2 blocks away from her. Everything in my apartment reminds me of her because she helped me shop for things (I started living alone right as we started going out), and I barely got any sleep last night.

Am I being immature for going completely no contact on her and erasing her from my life? We had great times together.

26,"My [24m] friend [22f] is embarrassing herself pursuing a girl who clearly isn't interested in her.


My friend Sarah has a lot of self-esteem issues. She's always been very quiet, shy, and introverted. Recently she's made a lot of positive changes in her life, including coming out as a lesbian, and is trying to be more outgoing. 


Unfortunately, she doesn't have a lot of experience with it and I've noticed she comes off as aggressive or irritating sometimes. I've tried explaining she needs to be more aware of people's cues (standoffish body language, one-word answers, etc.). She claims to understand what I mean and thinks she's trying but honestly in the moment it feels like she especially pursues people she doesn't get positive reactions from. Almost like she can't help but try to earn their approval. It never seems to go her way.  


There's a woman who works at a bookstore Sarah and I frequent. Sarah and this woman like the same podcast and Sarah found and friended this woman's Facebook profile through that podcast's facebook. At first the woman accepted her request but after a series of embarrassing and somewhat bizarre comments, she unfriended Sarah. Now Sarah tells me she's been bringing this woman various items at work, which the woman is rejecting. I've told Sarah outright she needs to stop pursuing this woman because she's made it clear she's not interested. But Sarah tuts me off with excuses for why this woman was too busy or not hungry and tries to discuss other plans to get this woman's attention. I've become aware some acquaintances are semi-mocking her behavior and the things she's said to her. I don't plan on telling her this but we have a tight knit community and I don't want this getting spread about so I'd like to nip this ASAP.    

tl;dr: My friend is trying to come out of her shell and I want to encourage that but I also need to explain to her she cannot *make* people like her. I would appreciate a lot of help with the wording, there's probably a lot going on with Sarah that I can't understand and I don't want to accidentally say the wrong thing. "
27,"My friend [25F] is mad at me [24F] and other friends [20sM&amp;F] for going to a festival without her, even though she was invited but turned it down to go do something else.


Lola and I have been friends for a few years now, and she has always been a good friend... except for this. 

Last weekend, me and a group of our friends drove up to a music festival in a different country. We've been planning this for months, booked everything as soon as the tickets went on sale, and had a blast. I was driving most of the way so I only looked at my phone during rest stops, and saw that my friend Lola texted me ""Thanks for the invite to the roadtrip..."" with a bunch of angry emojis. I texted back saying that we were on our way to the music festival and that I hoped she had a good weekend at hers. MONTHS ago when we were planning this trip, I asked Lola if she wanted to come with us and she turned me down, saying she wanted to attend a smaller festival closer to our state. She just responded ""oh."", and has been ignoring/one wording me over text since.

This makes me mad - we did invite her (twice actually), she just chose to do something else, and is treating us like we betrayed her for doing the thing we said we would do without her. This is a common theme in gatherings without Lola - she's a huge introvert, well known in our group for coming to parties and leaving without saying goodbye when she needs alone time. She's told us before that she hates going out to bars and clubs, so she never comes out with us unless it's a special occasion (not a bad thing, just showing how she likes to socialize), but if we post a group picture from a night out that she chose not to attend, she'll comment something passive aggressive on it and then ignore whoever posted it for a while.

Lola has confided in me about her struggle with social anxiety before, which is why she cancels at the last minute or dips midway through a party without saying goodbye, and I understand that, but is it unsympathetic of me to think that doesn't her the right to treat us like we're doing something wrong when we do something without her? Other friends have told me that they're getting tired of always being turned down when they ask her to hang out, but when they don't invite her to something she obviously would not be into (eg. ribfest - Lola is a vegan), she flies off the handle. Any thoughts on this? Lola's really sweet and fun when she wants to be, but I'm sick of this passive aggressiveness. 

tl;dr: Friend with social anxiety lashes out at us when our friend group goes to events without her, even though she declines invitations left right and centre. Not sure what to do from here.

31,"Update: My [f21] mom [f53] lied to me about my brother [m30's] coming to Thanksgiving.


Link to [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5epjcj/my_f21_mom_f53_lied_to_me_about_my_brother_m30s/) post.

So, I ended up toughing it out that day, tried to avoid any confrontation, and generally, tried not to break my mother's heart because in the end I love her dearly; I understood we were both in a tough spot. It ended up being an okay holiday, my brother behaved and we were all fine. I thought maybe he straightened himself up a little and realized he had made a mistake. He had even held down a job and told me he was really good at it. For a brief moment, I was proud of how mature I thought both of us had become.

Welp, I was wrong. Six months later, my brother's girlfriend was blowing up my mother's phone asking her to get my brother out of jail, **because he had beaten the snot out of her.** Needless to say, my mother didn't answer. That may sound cruel, but I feel the need to add context to fully encapsulate why this was an important step for my mother.

I get it, people make mistakes sometimes. When it comes to my brother, he has been nothing but violent his whole life. He's tried to fight my father (we have different dads), he's fought his own brother, he's been sent away for 'accidental' manslaughter, he's beaten all three of his ex-fiancees, he's pinned my ex down to pound his head into the dirt, he's smashed phones that I used to record his behavior for proof that my family felt endangered, and finally, he's hit me in the face for trying to stop him from doing something I know he'll regret. My brother is a monster, and there's no hope for him anymore. He's not the same person I knew and loved.

Every day for the last thirty years, my mother gave up time from her social and business life to answer his beck and call. If he was in jail, she'd bail him out. If he had a warrant for his arrest, he could hide out in my mom's house for a couple days before he left state. Because of him, the last twenty years of my life were barren because my mother was busy coddling him because she felt everything was her fault. She couldn't reason out that maybe, in the end, some people are just born with disorders that make them the way they are. Sometimes, people *like* that they have a condition that causes them to manipulate the people around them.

For ten years, I watched her fall into depression and misplaced anger because she felt useless because every time my oldest brother, the psychopath, didn't get his way, he'd scream and yell at her till she broke herself to get it. I couldn't tell you how many TVs and how many pieces of jewelry were never retrieved from a pawn shop. My mom will never see the engagement ring she got from my father again in her lifetime. 

On that day though, she didn't pick up the phone. My brother's girlfriend screamed into voicemail and posted on Facebook about how she was a horrible mother and that you shouldn't abandon your children. She blocked her page and her number, she got a new personal number, and she works somewhere different now. My brother has no way of reaching her besides the internet. She doesn't use it much anymore.

I've never seen my mother so relaxed. I can tell she's hurting and that she feels like this is her fault but inside I know she's making peace with it. She comes up to my town to see me every couple of months, she can afford her rent, and she doesn't have to sacrifice every part of herself to keep someone happy anymore. Seeing my mom this way has lifted so much guilt and stress off of me. I've hung out with her more in the past couple months than I have in fifteen years. In the end, honestly, I'm really glad she didn't answer that call.

My advice to anyone going through a situation similar, don't wait for the abuse to end. Don't think it's okay just because they're ""family"". You can make a family anywhere. You can make one at work, at school, with your friends, even with a group you do activities with. Blood means nothing if someone abuses it, you're always free to step away from a situation if you fear for your mental state, safety, or your life. Sometimes it takes longer to get out because of complications and that's okay. You can always find a way.

Thank you, Reddit, you've improved my life to the fullest it can be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to thank you enough.

He moved with me to new city when I went off to university (his family sucks and he doesn't have much contact with them, he says I'm his family) and we lease an apartment together. 

I'd say over the past year or so my feelings have gotten increasingly complicated. We do pretty much everything together. We make meals together when we can. We go out a lot just the two of us. Heck we even have a dog together. It's technically mine, but Jason shares the responsibilities with me.

I know things aren't quite normal between us, and a lot of you will probably think we're weird, but we often share a bed.  I feel this is mostly out of convenience though. We like talking. We always chat before bed. One of us will always go to the others room. Half the time we are both on Reddit just showing each other random shit before falling asleep.

We cuddle. Sometimes on the couch, sometimes in bed. We hold hands sometimes and we hug fairly frequently. The hand thing we don't do in public, nor the cuddling thing for that matter.

Before we leave we always say bye and that we love each other. The love thing started out as a joke, but now it's always and Jason will even say it to me before hanging up the phone. He always insists he loves me more.

Like honest to fucking god it feels like I'm already in a relationship with this dude and we just haven't kissed or banged yet. 

I've noticed myself getting increasingly jealous when he talks about girls or hooks up with one from tinder. It feels like I *hate* these girls even though I don't even know them.

At this point I don't even think about girls myself, I just think about Jason and it's driving me mad. I want him. Worse I want him to want me back. I swear half my day is spent thinking about boning this dude and I'm not even sure what would go where between the two of us. It's the dumbest situation I've ever found myself in.

It's not just sex I want with him though. It's everything. I'm in love with this guy and I haven't the faintest fucking clue how it happened. 

Lately I've been thinking of making a move on him. Kissing him or something. I don't know! This is probably the worst idea ever. I'd be so screwed if he took it badly.

I don't know Reddit. What the hell do I do? I think he's got to have caught feelings too, right? Or maybe I'm just telling myself that because of how badly I want him. Jesus, I'm so damn lost.

Any advice and outside perspective would be very much appreciated.



**tl;dr** I have some serious feelings for my best friend. Should I make a move or not?

37,"My [24F] husband [26M] always disrespects me and humiliates/undermines me in front of others. He just called me lazy in front of our guests for a party I arranged for him.


My husband, Mike, and I have been together for 3 years and married for one. He was always a loving, caring man who was perfect in very way. Only recently (about 6 months ago) did he began ragging on me constantly. 

Here are some examples:

1.) In February we vacationed with his parents and his mom complimented my body as I've been doing Pilates. My husband then goes ""Yeah, and she was just talking about getting implants- how dumb"". A.) that was a private conversation between my husband and I and he shouldn't have shared it. B.) He said it with such disgust- it was embarrassing. Later that night I told him that was a private conversation and he said ""who wasn't going to notice you going from a B to a D cup? That's not a secret"". Only the next morning did he actually apologize for it.

2.) I opened up a hair salon which took a lot of time, money, and effort. I do not have a partner- I operate every aspect of it. I have 4 stylists and I recently stopped doing hair myself so now a couple times a week I work from home (forwarding calls to my cell). We met mutual friends for happy hour not too long ago and my boyfriend starts saying all I do is ""answer phones"" and complain about the stress in my life when really I do ""nothing"". Our mutual friends stood up for me but I was embarrassed and irked. He does this often. 

3.) He frequently comments on my schedule as if it's less significant than his. He does respect my Pilates schedule, my time with friends, etc. meanwhile he has guys night set in stone but expect me to be flexible with my plans.

Tonight:

My husband recently got promoted so we invited 15 of our friends (mostly other couples) for a little get together. I worked from home while Mike was at work as usual. I cleaned, bought groceries, cooked, made some spiked drinks, etc. It took all of today and yesterday to set up not to mention following up on invites and such. People started arriving at 5pm- around 6pm we were grilling steaks. I asked Mike to check the steaks and in front of all our guest he said ""Wow she's too lazy check the steaks at my own party"". They all kind of ragged on him and teasingly told him to check the steaks.

Now I'm upstairs because I needed to decompress. I'm so upset I don't even want to go back downstairs. I don't know how to hy through to him. I've told him feeling disrespected lately and he just feels attacked and it's not productive. He says ""if I were to keep track of everything you blurt out I could say the same"". But he doesn't give me examples and I have always been careful with my words.

I really don't know how to handle this. It's embarrassing honestly.

Tldr: my husband humiliates me in front of others. How to handle this?"

40,"My [26F] roommate [22M] insisted on having the master bedroom, now that he has it, he insists on sleeping in the living room


Two weeks ago, I moved from an apartment into a house rental with my roommate. The master bedroom in the house we are renting is huge, literally twice the size, maybe more of the other two bedrooms in the house, and has its own bathroom. It also gets much sunnier than the other bedrooms because it has way more windows and is on a side of the house that gets a lot of sunlight. I naturally wanted this bedroom for a number of reasons. 

For one, I have a king size 5 peice bedroom-set that takes up a lot of space, the entirety of which can't fit into either of the other two bedrooms. My roommate only has a two 5 drawer chests, which are mostly empty. I have a lot more clothing and belongings in general than he does, and I need the space. 

Another reason that I wanted the master bedroom is that I spend way more time in my room than he does. I'm a fairly introverted person who is easily distractable and needs relative quiet and calm to concentrate properly. I'm also in the process of learning two languages as well as studying for various CLEP exams, so I need to concentrate quite a lot. Becuse of the fact that my roommate is one of those people who is literally uncomfortable being in the house without the tv on, I have to study in my room whenever he's home.

The last reason why I thought it was ony fair that I have the master bedroom, is because my roommate is the complete opposite of me when it comes to his room. Even in the last place we lived in, he basically  lived in the living room. He even had an extra bed that he kept in the living room to sleep on. His actual bedroom was basically a glorified closet, since he *literally* only ever went in there to change his clothes. At the old place, we had a running joke that I slept in his bedroom more often than he did.

Despite all of these reasons, which I expressed to him before we moved into the new place and he understood, he insisted on having the master bedroom. After a few days of debating, I gave in and let him have the room. He assured me that he would actually use the bedroom this time instead of living in the living room like he did at the old place. 

Well, as I'm sure you know if you read the title, he lied. We've been in this place for over two weeks, and he still has yet to spend a full night in his bedroom. Our third bed is in our guest bedroom, so now he sleeps on the couch with a comforter. Both of my side tables are also in the guest room, because they don't actually fit in my room with my king sized bed and the rest of my furniture, which still, even without the other two peices, barely fits in the room. I'm crammed into one of the darkest rooms in the house for basically no reason because he still spends literally every waking and non-waking hour in the living room. 

I'm so irritated and angry about this situation but I have no idea know what to do. I feel like I have no right to complain at this point since I let him have the room, but I can't help but feel like I got played and it really pisses me off. What do I do, if anything, about this?

TL;DR - My roommate insisted on taking the bedroom that is much bigger and nicer by a long shot  that the other two bedrooms. He now spends all of his time in the living room, he even sleeps there. I'm really annoyed because I wanted that bedroom and would have used it way more as I have to spend a lot of time in my room as a result of him being in the living room so much. "
41,"My [18F] mom [63F] has been living vicariously through me and has been a helicopter parent all my life to the point that she impersonates me through emails to my teachers and contests.


First time poster and throwaway Bc my mom goes through my phone every so often. Sorry it's so long. 

I'll start with a little back story for context. My mom is an incredibly smart woman who had a very hard child/early adulthood. Her own mother cheated on her father which resulted in her family falling apart. She has a very toxic relationship with her sisters, who she ceased contact with when I was child, and I've only just now reconnected with them and their children. She's been ""working on"" her PhD for the past 30 yrs, and doesn't seem to understand that in the field she's working in, she needs a PhD to be taken seriously. She complains about how she can't get a job any where, meaning that she can't find the exact job she wants. She takes the resulting stress out on the people in the form of flying into incredible rages over small things like the dishes not being done (we have a dish washer, but it's been broken for 5 years Bc she insists she will fix it and refuses to hire someone to fix it). 

She had me later in life. I was an IVF baby, and I know that the pregnancy was really hard on her and my biological father at time, and led to their divorce. She really wants me to do well, which is her main excuse for many of the things she does. She always wanted the best out of me, and doesn't really except anything less. If I ""fuck up"" somehow, she constantly reminds me about it as sort of a way to ""encourage"" me to do better. When I was in 7th grade, I made a science fare project that made it to the regional competition. At the same time, I was in the middle of tech week in a production of Macbeth, and I was getting home really late and was very sleep deprived. Come the day of the science fare, I was really tired and wanted to wear a particular green sweater. My mom wanted me to wear a black shirt. We got into a huge fight, and I just gave in and wore the black shirt. When we gat there, I get set up and she starts criticizing my hair Bc I didn't have time to brush that morning Bc of the fight. She started trying to fix it for me, even though I had already fixed it the way I thought it looked ok. She wouldn't stop touching me and she was saying ""you already caused enough trouble today, stop being a brat"". This resulted in me breaking down in the show room when the judges came out. I didn't make it to state, so my mom reminds me to this day about how I ""fucked up"" science fare. Flash forward 4 years to 10th grade. I had been in dance for 7 years before that Bc that's what my mom did when she was little and my sister wasn't very good at it, so I was the one who had to do it. My teacher was a very old fashioned man who was, unbeknownst to us at the time, quite sexist. Around that time I started filling out, and put on a little weight. I wasn't very good at ballet, and my mom insists to this day that I am. My teacher started making comments about my weight, and stopped putting me in certain performances. This had been going on for a while, and my mom kept saying ""oh we'll leave once you do this performance"" and then I'd do it, and we wouldn't leave. Finally, I just decided I'd had enough. I was done with being put down constantly by this man, and stopped going. My mom was furious with me, raging at me and saying how she had had a plan for me to leave ""gracefully"" and how I had fucked it all up. This is another event in my life she constantly reminds me of. An event that was super damaging to me that being reminded of it constantly brings back all the bad feelings. As punishment for all the infractions, she won't let me get a drivers license, Bc she knows how much it means to me, and it forces me to be dependent on her for transportation. 

She was the one who set up my email address in 8th grade, and at first I was really happy. But then she had the password, and she started using it to enroll my teachers under the guise of me, resulting in me coming into class one day, and my teachers start talking about something I had no idea about. She would get into arguments with these teachers, and these teachers would hate me during the school day. I was too embarrassed to explain that it was my mom who was doing this. She also found my poetry book and started entering all of them into contests with out my consent. None of the poems were personal, it just started snowballing into her forcing me to write more so she could enter me into competitions. I think she got a thrill from the results. Now I'm going to college, and I'm afraid she will do the same thing while I'm there. Everyone in my family except for me and my stepfather [51M] went to Ivy League colleges, and this really bothers my mom. She keeps saying how I'm ""better than where [I'm] going"", and plans to reapply to the Ivies this coming year as me. She's forced me to ruin my summer taking SAT classes (classes I wanted to take last summer, but she yelled at me to not bother her about it). 

Among all this, I have unmedicated ADHD and I think my mom's actions have given me anxiety and depression, but I don't know Bc she refuses to take me to a psychiatrist. Recently I've had many times when I can barely get out of bed Bc the thought of such little independence and a constant reminder of my faults is just too much to handle sometimes. I feel like my life is not my own. 

Do you guys have any advice for me? Should I cut her out of my life when I finally become more stable? Or am I just imagining things, this is normal, and I should suck it up?

Tl;dr: mom has been super overbearing in my life to the point that she does things in my name without my knowledge.

43,"Me [29F] With my Husband [30M] I found something on his phone


We've been together for 10 years, married for 5. Our relationship, in my opinion, is and always has been rock solid. I'm secure in the knowledge that I'm his wife and the mother of his children. We're in that comfortable stage where we love each other, and see each other as partners and teammates. There's always been total honesty and trust in our relationship. 

So for a bit more background: 

My husband is objectively waaaay out of my league. He's gorgeous and intelligent and kind. He's very charming and funny. Understandably, he gets hit on. A lot. Like constantly. He's very good about shutting women down gently. Always brings the conversation around to me and how wonderful he thinks I am. 

To give an example: When we first got together, he had a long time female friend who was pretty much obsessed with him, and decided that right after he proposed to me, his pregnant girlfriend, was the perfect time to tell him. He tried to gently shut her down and preserve the friendship. One evening she came to our house for dinner. I thought things went amazingly and was excited to start making friends with his friends (despite knowing this woman loved my husband- I tend to be a bit over positive and exciteable), until my husband woke up the next morning to a barrage of texts from her. She called me trashy, said I was the wrong woman for him, that I'm a gold digger etc. My husband calmly showed me the texts, called her, and went off her. I believe almost word for word he said ""my pregnant fiancée welcomed you into our home with open arms, and accepted you into our lives with more class and grace than you could ever hope to have. I don't like home wreckers. Don't contact me again."" 

I'm sharing this because it shows how our relationship has always been. He's always been nothing but my partner, my best friend. 

So the problem: 

We switch phones constantly. I'm not sure why- a convenience thing really. If one of us is running late and can't find our phone, we'll take the other persons, that sort of thing. So a few days ago I had his phone and he had mine. I was looking through his pictures (he had taken our oldest fishing and I was looking through the pictures he'd taken), and noticed something... weird. 

2 weeks ago, he received (or took?) very graphic nude pictures of my friend. My male friend. Honestly, im not mad or even upset. But I'm confused as hell and a little shocked. 

I have no idea how to bring this up. Or what to say. He's never shown any inkling of being interested in men. He knew at some point I'd have his phone and didn't bother deleting the pictures. He hasn't been acting weird or staying out late or hiding his phone or anything like that. But he also never mentioned this to me, despite telling me every single time a woman flirts with him etc 

So... what the hell do I do?? 

TL;DR: my husband has naked pictures of my male friend on his phone. I'm.. shocked, but not angry. "
44,"My parents drove drunk with my little sister and her four friends in the car.


My parents are alcoholics. Both have driven a car while intoxicated before, even with my siblings and me in the car. I have told them before how uncomfortable this makes me and how unsafe this is, and they always say something like, ""I know it's bad, we'll stop."" They still keep doing it. 


My 13 year old sister told me today that when my parents picked her and her friends up from the fair a couple days ago, both of my parents were drunk.
My dad was in the drivers seat. My sister explained that he swerved around the road and would break randomly. She kept telling them how unsafe she and her friends felt, but my mom just told her to shut up. During this time my mom tried to take the wheel with the intention to help my dad drive, and he hit her.


I don't know what to do anymore and I am scared for their safety and the safely of my siblings.


Tl;dr
My parents drove drunk with my sister and her friends in the car.

Edit: I am 16 and female, and I have my license. I will gladly drive my sister if my parents are drunk. The only problem with that is I don't have my own car so I won't always be able to.

 I have a 20 year old sister that has been staying with us for the summer but she goes back to college in the fall. She knows about all of this and was the first person to come to the conclusion that our parents are alcoholics a few years ago. I often mention calling the police or CPS but she disagrees with me saying, ""You want to lose our parents? You want to be put in foster care?"" So unfortunately she may not be of any help. I have no problem going behind her back to call the police and that is what I'll do next time my parents drive drunk."
45,"Me (31 f married), my parents r acting weird after me getting pregnant


I have been in a relationship for more than 7 years and married for more than 3 years. As I was a single child my parents were always a bit overprotective about me. But after I got pregnant recently they started acting very weird. First of they told this is the only child I need (that is if I am adamant in having a child), and I explained politely its not their business. But they are acting weird day by day.

I am having several health issues and struggling throughout pregnancy, but they are not at all supportive, simplifying my issues and they do not even ask about the health of the baby when we talk. Its like they are trying to avoid the baby from the talk.

When I talk about the baby they reply weirdly and act as if they are a jealous couple, implying that their baby was superior or something. I tell them I am that baby they are talking about, and how can my baby be any inferior to theirs.

It is very difficult to explain their behavior, every time they shuts me down, and I get depressed after talking to them every time. Even if I am happy they will find some way to kill that happiness. They have repeatedly told me many times that my baby will not be any good and I better expect the worse. I dont know what that means and how to react to it.

My husband is very loving and supporting, he had started considering my parents as bullies nowadays. If he tries to tell them to behave a little better and show me a little care they yell at him and gets very angry. As I am the only child I feel obligated to check upon them and care about them. But I cannot take this torture they are giving me anymore. What do I do?

46,"My [25F] sister [19F] moved to LA to be a dancer, she has begun to pay thousands of dollars to a church to be their intern, now she wants to spend 8k a year on their unaccredited religious 'college.' Is this a scam or a cult? What should I do, if anything?


My sister and I are kind to each other but not very close. My immediate family (including myself) are very mentally ill and fucked up, my sister is the exception, she is functional, athletic, popular and beautiful. I am extremely proud of her for thriving on her own and moving to LA for her career (she has been doing well, though she is confused about her exact path as most of us are - I'm being vague about her career just in case someone I know sees this). And I am extremely proud of her for thriving given the shit she was born into (it wasn't that bad compared to people who actually had horrific childhoods, it just was very stressful for both of us). I am not a role model of any kind, she is far more successful and basically better than me in every way edit: I just wanted to edit this to explain how it feels strange to try to parent her or guide her in any way, since I'm such a fuck up. She's been avoiding talking to me because she knows I'm an atheist (I'm not an arrogant atheist and do not think less of people for believing in whatever they believe in, I do not actively try to turn people into atheists or judge them for disagreeing with me) and she fears I will judge her for her newfound spirituality even though I've tried to be reassuring. We were not raised with any religion whatsoever but my mom has been 'spiritual.' I have no issues with that, I personally agree with a lot of Buddhist principles and have found relief in them, my mom and I discuss spiritual matters often. I don't even consider myself an atheist anymore, probably more of an agnostic. 

I was actually really glad (at first) that she found a community out there and I think religion can be a fantastic source of support and guidance for many people. I explicitly told her I supported her in the beginning several times and I talked to her about the spiritual books she had been reading and tried to be receptive to them. Then she started wanting me to watch videos of the 'preacher' of her church. The video she showed me bothered me a lot, because it basically stated that atheists were 'at war' with God and that life without God meant life without love, creativity etc. It's fair to believe what you believe, but I resent the fact that they have to insult other people's beliefs and act self-righteous about it. So I told her that I didn't want to see anymore videos and I told her why the video bothered me. She has begun to try to force my parents to start watching her preacher's sermons as well. My mom has communicated with her about how we all find answers in different things, and our beliefs are our own personal journey and can't be dictated by other people - but my sister has been acting like Jesus is the only way of life and everyone else is wrong.

The church basically seems like a church for LA hipsters to be honest - the church is called Mosaic, I have not found anything online that says they're a cult - but the Wiki page of the founder alarms me. He used to be a fashion designer or something and now it seems he's made a business out of this. His videos remind me of any Oprah-type self-help gurus. I have no problem with self-help gurus until they try to sell their vague inspirational ideas to scam people. There are little short films before his speeches (at least in this video I watched) of young, beautiful LA people next to beautiful scenery with inspirational/religious quotes over-top. Apparently a lot of famous people attend and it's fairly well-known in the area.

Even though I disagreed with the video she sent, nothing about it seems actively malicious or anything...and I highly doubt it's a cult like scientology, I just get nervous because she's so far from home and I don't know what to do.

Sometimes the line between cult and religion appears to be very thin.  But I always told my sister if she respects my beliefs I will respect hers. Recently she began texting my mom about how she wishes she would find 'Jesus,' which really freaked my mom out because we thought this church was kind of a more casual Christian interpretation that wouldn't push people to proselytize. My mom has no issues with religion in general as long as it does not harm people. Her parents were jack mormons, and so we're wary of a lot of organized religion because of how bad the Mormon church was.

My sister is going to ask my grandparents for help with money for the Mosaic ""college"" thing (our immediate family is broke, but my grandparents had a limited amount set aside for college if my sister chose to go) and my mom already told them that she would rather them save the money for actual education rather than this but I don't think it's enough. Those particular grandparents are religious so I'm worried they'll jump at the chance to send her there (sidenote: that particular grandmother tried to ambush-baptize us when we were younger without our parent's permission - I think my sister remembers me as an angry atheist because that side of the family tended to drive me insane with their conversion tactics, my uncle told me I was responsible for sending my sister to hell if I didn't convert us - I was 14 and she was 8 at the time, it left a sour taste in my mouth).

My sister already paid thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer, my mom tried to talk her out of it but it didn't' work. Since I barely talked to her I didn't feel it was my place to say anything but now I wish I did.

I don't want her to waste time and money on this. It seems like a scam to me. I want her to be happy and I am glad she has found a community - but I do not think a healthy, happy community would push their believers into spending thousands of dollars on them (but maybe they don't actively do that?).

Do you think this is a scam/cult? I'm hoping to find some people who have experience with this, or it would be amazing if anyone knows of this church and could chime in. I'm open to being wrong about my judgements. Should I say anything to her or just let it be? I would appreciate any advice.

**TL;DR** my little sister joined a seemingly progressive liberal Christian church in LA (she got baptized, she was never religious before this because our family was not). she spent thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer and wants to spend thousands more on their religious school (earning no actual college credit, 8k+ a year). Should I be more concerned? should I be trying to talk her out of this even though we are not extremely close?

**edit** Wow! I only expected a couple of replies. I am so grateful for all of your amazing responses, especially from those of you that are religious - your perspectives helped me the most because I do not want any of my residual distaste for organized religion to taint my relationship with my sister and I do whole-heartedly believe religion can be a positive force in her life and I do not want her to feel judged by me in any way. I'm compiling a lot of the advice I've found in this thread in a word document to remind myself how to approach her (this might be strange, I have a terrible memory). I'm extremely glad I made this post! Thank you guys for all the varying opinions. 

I am pretty certain Mosaic is not a cult at this point (there is a wonderful redditor that PMed me who is a former Mosaic member and they helped me understand it much better...if you're reading this, I really can't thank you enough), but they do have a tendency to pressure people into paying more money than they should - I'm comfortable in calling parts of the church an out-right scam at this point, because it does seem kind of predatory especially since my sister is a teenager who is not at all wealthy -  so once I rebuild my connection with my sister I'm going to gently nudge her in the direction of another church but I'm not going to hostile or harsh in any way, I just want to be a supportive presence in her life no matter what. She agreed to talk to me on the phone tomorrow, I will definitely be as gentle and supportive as possible (as most of you rightfully recommended) - thank you all again :) I truly appreciate it"

I'm getting married in 8 months. My fiance and I spend a lot of time together and I'm always at his place. Hanging out with our pup and having a good time. I've decided it just makes sense for us to live together since we got 8 months left, on top of everything we have an amazing relationship and hardly argue. I told my mother I want to move in with him and she has been freaking out saying I'm doing wrong and am disgusting and that she's not coming to the wedding if I move in with him. She also calls him ""that man"" now even though she really likes him a lot, I guess now she doesn't because of my plans. 

I am sad because I want her there and am her only child, I know I was too sheltered and kind of brainwashed how to think I was raised a devout Christian (which I still think I am) but I feel like God is more worried about other things than me living with my future husband, I personally don't believe it's a sin. The sad thing is that my uncle has been cheating on his wive and cohabitation with another woman and everyone treats him great,but how dare I live with the man I'm committed to. 

Now I finally am making my own decisions and this specific decision my mother hates. I really feel bad and I don't know if I should just live at home to please her or should I continue to move in with my Fiancé?

TL;DR I am moving in with my Fiancé, I told my mom and she flipped out saying I'm disgusting and sinning and that she won't be coming to my wedding. What should I do, should I live at home to please her or continue the move."

So the other day during our break I showed her pictures from my aunt's wedding that was over the weekend. She gasped once she's seen my mom and younger sister.

Her comment really hurt my feelings. I was so happy about my hair and makeup, and mostly my dress, my aunt chose me to be her bridesmaid. I felt like a princess that day and now I feel sad after her comments. To think that I was wandering around the venue that day thinking that I was beautiful when I was easily overshadowed by my mom and sister is sad. I'm not shallow and I am always aware that my mom and sister are prettier than me, but I never thought it was something that someone would consider is worth mentioning or even thinking of. So it never bothered me. I am actually so proud of how beautiful they are. Its like they're my little kittens and I want to make sure that everyone knows how cute they are.

But I never saw a family and thought to myself that one is prettier than the other. I just think that people are beautiful without comparing them to their siblings, family, friends, etc. Now I can't stop thinking that it must be so obvious that people feel sorry for me being the ugliest one of them.

Am I overreacting? I feel so bad for feeling this way. It might have been a joke what she said, but its not like we're close friends. We're just classmates.


tldr: showed my friend a picture of my mom and sister from my aunt's wedding over the weekend and she said  ""omg your mom is so beautiful why weren't you born beautiful just like her. And your sister obviously won the big lottery that is your mom's beauty"" I feel sad because although I am aware of how beautiful my mom and sister are compared to me, I just never thought it was noticeable, or at least I never thought people would think it to themselves or even say it. I was a bridesmaid that day so I felt so good about myself, but now I feel ashamed, I feel like everyone at the wedding was thinking to themselves that my mom and sister are prettier than me, and that I'm a joke for feeling beautiful. I am always proud of my mom and sister and how beautiful they are, its like they're my little kittens and I want to make sure that everyone knows how cute they are."
52,"My[m/29] best friend [m/28] told the truth about my Gf's[f/27] work history to a potential new employer and she is livid I took his side


Me, my best friend ""Chad"", and my girlfriend ""Liz"" used to all work together for the same company in a very tight knit industry until about a year ago Chad got a better job with a competitor. We are all still very good friends and are very close.


A few months later our company had lost several more employees and chose to not replace them since production wasnt suffering. Without the personal to properly staff all the shifts they ""Asked"" certain veteran employees like Liz to work 12 hour shifts to maintain coverage. While working one of these 12 hour shifts with a skeleton crew, doing a job that normally requires 3 people, Liz made a simple mistake trying to do too many things at once that destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment.


There was an big internal investigation which found that A) She indeed shouldnt have been doing that task alone B) The production schedule was completely inappropriate for the shift that morning C) The machinery was so incredibly insured that the company was actually going to make money off the accident. Liz is a stellar employee with no prior issues so the management gave her a formal write up (slap on the wrist) and in a few weeks everyone had moved on and forgotten about it.


Everyone forgot about it except for Liz. It truly haunts her to this day. The company loves her and she still has plently of upwards mobility but she has become deeply embittered. She accepted responsiblity for her actions but resents the company for putting her in that position in the first place. Over that last few months she has become increasingly sad and grim. She is terrified that this mistake will follow her everywhere, making a fresh start impossible.


I finally convinced her to start looking for jobs at other companies within the industry. To aim high and find a position that will truly make her happy. I forced her against her will to send out a few resumes and apply to some positions she thought she wasn't qualified for. Lo and behold, a recruiter from that company reached out to her mere hours later and wanted to schedule a phone interview with her the next day.


Well with these developments she brightened the fuck up almost instantly. All smiles as she finally realized that she actually has a bright future ahead of her. Next day Liz crushes the phone interview with the recruiter and an hour later receives an email that the Production Manager (a well known, highly respected hot shot in the industry) wants to interview her himself! 


She had the interview yesterday and when I got home she was in a weird daze. Liz says the interview was going great till about 10 minutes in, he started asking her about her accident, which completely caught her off guard. He didn't dwell on it and seemed to be very satisfied with her explanation because at the interview he ended offering her the job! He asked her to take a few days to think about it. Liz is stunned that he knew about the accident. They didn't ask for any references so she was perplexed how he could have found out.

Jump to this evening. Chad, Liz and I are out having dinner and about halfway through the meal Chad asks if the Production Manager ended up offering her the job. Both Liz and I are confused cause we had been keeping her job search on the down low. He follows up that he knew the Production Manager from college and when he saw that Liz worked for the same company that Chad used to, he gave him a call 2 days ago before the interview to see if Chad knew her. Chad reveals he spoke of her accident and the circumstances behind it but that she was excellent at her job and that the Production Manager would be a fool not to hire her.


Liz was stunned and I could tell on the verge of tears, she excused herself to the bathroom. After 20 minutes she had not returned so I call her a couple times and get no response. Liz then texts me that she went out the back and got an Uber home, That she felt betrayed and never wanted to see Chad ever again.


I get home and we talk. Liz informs me that she emailed the Production Manager declining the job offer. I'm shocked, he knew about her accident but still offered her the job, I cant understand how she would think that is a bad thing. Liz believes that what the Production Manager did was unprofessional, unethical, and potentially illegal.  She thinks the accident will follow her for the rest of her career and that she needs to find a new industry to work in. She is furious that Chad would tell him about the accident and not immediately inform her. I tell her that I disagree and she flips out.


In my opinion Chad had a professional obligation to tell the truth and that he did no wrong. If he had lied or omitted that he knew about the accident and the Production Manager found out about the accident in the future, that it would reflect very very poorly on Chad. Liz can't believe I would defend Chad like this and makes some comments about my caring more about my friends professional reputation than her. She has now locked herself in the bedroom crying.


This is a mess, I have no idea what to do. I can understand Liz's mental block and the shame she feels about the accident, but besides urging her to get help and talk to a therapist, I don't know what else I can do help her get over it. Especially now that I am currently a Bad Guy.


Apologies for the rushed sentences and horrid grammar, it's been a crazy night and I'm having a hard time thinking straight.

TLDR : Me, My Girlfriend, and my Best Friend all work closely in the same Industry. Girlfriend had a very big accident at work that haunts her to this day. Girlfriend found new dream job but is horrified that new boss knew about her accident. Turns out Best Friend is buddys with new boss and told him about accident. Very upset and emotional Girlfriend


**edit: Holy smokes guys thanks for all the great ideas/advice. I'll will try to answer as many of your questions as I can **


**edit #2: just to clarify a few things 1) Chad had only been gone a month or two when the accident happened. He still has very strong ties to the people at our company and due to things like snap chat actually knew the full details of the accident before I did. 2) I seriously doubt that Chad understands how much Liz is haunted by the accident, she publicly jokes about it in social settings and conceals how much it continues to bother her. 3) I know for a fact that several of the Production Manager's current employees knew about the accident, it would have only been a matter of time before he found out regardless of Chad's endorsement. **

**edit #3: 600 comments and you've truly split fault 50/50. At this point I DON'T CARE WHO IS AT FAULT!!! I'm only interested in Advice that will A) make me a better boyfriend B) help me help my girlfriend find her happiness.**"

54,"Me [38F] with my Husband [39M] keeps getting drunk and did something terrible so I left him. He's begging for me to come back, I love him but don't know what to do


We have been together for 19 years married for 16 and have three kids. I'm a stay at home mom and he has his own business. My dad was a verbally abusive alcoholic. 

Husband is the nicest person ever sober, all his employees and family members love him, but when he drinks he is what you call a mean drunk. He calls me names sometimes, gets mad at random people, is unpleasant to be around and I hate sleeping next to him when he drinks because he acts like such an asshole. He doesn't do it everyday but it's enough where I've gotten sick and tired of it. 

So here's what happened, he got a new car and hit a guy on a motorcycle, he just hit the bike and did no harm to the guy but he drove off anyway. I picked him up and he started cursing the guy saying he's an asshole and it was his fault and he hopes he fucked uo his bike. He also went to go gamble.

I couldn't believe my ears. Keep in mind he was so drunk he didn't even know if he killed the guy. He has gotten a lawyer and the police don't know he was driving drunk. The police came to our house but he left before they came. This happened at midnight and the only reason the police knew was because the distinctive car and that he went to go gamble at a nearby casino.

The guy isn't pressing charges but this did it for me. He didn't even know if he killed the guy and this could of been so much fucking worse and he acts like it's no big deal. This man is the most generous, thoughtful guy before this.

I left the house and I'm with my mom. I told him I'm done with him. He has called me crying and begging for me to come back and telling me he'll change. That I mean the world to him and he couldn't stand living without me. It's so hard because I do love him but he was fucking driving drunk and didn't care if he hurt the person which is completely not him. I don't know if he's depressed or if there's something wrong with him. I am so hurt right now, I actually feel like my heart hurts and I don't know what to do. 
  
It was the scariest moment of my life. We didn't even know if he fucking killed the guy. When sober he doesn't have a mean bone in his body to anybody. He is not acting like the man I married. All I was thinking about is if he killed the guy and the guy had a family and he just ruined their lives. Yet he was acting like he didn't care and I could believe it.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband keeps getting drunk and becomes mean. He just committed a hit and run against a guy and didn't care if he hurt him or his motorcycle. He is acting like its no big deal and I have left him. He's begging for me back, he is the love of my life when he's sober but I am so fucking hurt and scared."
55,"This shouldn't bother me anymore, but I (22F) am the 'ugly friend' and it's getting me down


So I just moved to a new city to start graduate school. My cohort is a group of 9 other girls who are really nice and I love hanging out with them. There was a welcome mixer for us and some of the other graduate students at the school, with an open bar and dancing and stuff. I went along with them and on the whole, I had a good time.

What gets me under my skin though is the fact that I'm the ugly friend. If some guy from another program walked over to us and we'd all introduce ourselves, the guy would just skip over me. This happened multiple times! Several of them didn't even look at me or bother to remember my name, even though they made the effort with all the other girls in my group.

Additionally, I just feel ugly compared to the rest of them. Prior to grad school most of my friends were guys, so I didn't compare myself appearance-wise to them. I'm a bit heavier than all the other girls in the group, I wear large glasses, and I have short hair. I personally enjoy my personal style. I realize all these things are turn-offs to men, but I always considered myself not ugly and at the very least worthy of being treated like a person!

The thing is, this shouldn't bother me anymore. I'm in a happy relationship of 4 years. But I guess I feel a bit attention starved these days because my BF started a new job, is tired all the time, and doesn't really notice me physically anymore, since we now live together. I don't feel hot. I feel like a troll.

How can I get over being 'the ugly friend'? I really like these girls and want to continue hanging out with them! But I don't want to have this lingering resentment for my situation.

  **tl;dr**: I'm not so attractive according to most men. I'm in a relationship but still feel ugly."

Is my girlfriend of a year acting irrationally and is she being super dramatic or am I in the wrong for not understanding? Basically, this girl I was seeing like FIVE years ago has just recently had a child and has been posting this on Facebook a lot as one does. She happens to be my cousin's best friend, and neither me nor my mum are friends with her on FB anymore; I'm assuming my mum only saw the pictures because my auntie and cousin liked them. 

My girlfriend went on this girl's page (idk why) and saw that my mum has been liking her pictures she's put up with her son even though she isn't friends with her. I've explained that she's only liked them because she's my cousin's good friend and when someone that young has a child news goes around, etc. It's not serious or a bad thing.

Well, girlfriend is now very worried and is assuming my mum likes this girl more than she likes her and wished I ended up with her instead. I don't even think my mum knows I was seeing her lol and I'm positive she only even liked the pictures because of my cousin and because she knows of her because she's her good friend. I mean I kind of understand why she's upset but I also think she's being really silly assuming my mum doesn't like her when she clearly does - she stays over at mine a lot so obviously my mum has to like her and I can just tell. She's also worried that me and my mum are now talking about this girl whenever she isn't here. 

She says she doesn't like it because she feels like I have an attachment to this girl (I haven't even talked to her in like 5 years so I definitely don't plus I've only ever had one real gf and it's my current gf and I love her to bits so???). I don't know how to convince her that the like meant nothing. Hopefully if you guys agree with me I can show her this post and the comments and she may realise how insecure she sounds.

Please give me some outside opinions, Reddit.

TLDR: I was seeing this girl 5 years ago and she's recently had a baby and has been posting pictures of her child on FB. This girl is a good friend of my cousin. My mum has been liking this girl's pictures of her son because she knows her through my cousin even though she hasn't got her added on there. She can only see the pictures because my cousin and auntie are liking them too so they appear on the homepage. My gf is worried my mum likes this girl and wishes I ended up with her instead?
