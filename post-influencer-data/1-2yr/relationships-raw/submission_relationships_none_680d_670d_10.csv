2,"(Update) My best friend (25/f) thinks I (25/F) ruined a relationship and now she won't talk to me.


Original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/792yji/my_best_friend_25f_thinks_i_25f_ruined_a/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit).

I didn't think I would need to update especially after hearing nothing from John's girlfriend after the first couple of days but, here I am.

First off, thanks for the comments and PMs. I know I did the right thing and I was confused by Anna's reaction. But the support that poured in helped so much. Thank you.

Now, Anna still wasn't talking to me when my trip home came to an end so I just drove back to my city and went on about my life. She ended up calling me middle of last week and said she wanted to talk about what happened. She still believed that what I did was fucked up and she didn't approve. I asked her if she would ever tell me if she found out a future boyfriend of mine was cheating on me and she said ""Of course. But that's because I **know** you."" I told her I didn't see the friendship/stranger status as an excuse to let a guy be shitty to his girlfriend. After a while of back and forth with the same arguments I told her that we can agree to disagree and leave it at that. She said okay and we hung up. 

After we hung up I decided to check my Facebook and low and behold there was a message from John's girlfriend in my inbox from two days before. I was kind of nervous to read it but it just said ""Are you in ________ right now?"" I replied that I wasn't and an hour later I got another message asking if I could call her and her number. I was super nervous because I had no idea what I was going to be walking into but I figured if it got too bad I could hang up and block her number.

I called her and it was a very awkward greeting and then she asked me to tell her everything that happened. I obliged and told her exactly what happened. I could tell she was crying on the other end which broke my heart and I started apologizing but she told me not to. She was grateful that I told her. Apparently John and her have been together for close to 4 years and he cheated on her a lot during the first year of being together until she found out. He promised he'd never do it again and she took him back. She said she was always really paranoid he would cheat again but he never showed signs or anything out of the ordinary.

I apologized for being the spotlight on what an ass he was. We kind of got to chatting for a while after that and after a while she switched from the depression to the anger stage and I let her vent. At the end of it all she said she was finally going to leave him, which I agreed with, and then said that if I'm ever back in town that she'd like to buy me a coffee. Which I thought was a nice gesture and I might take her up on the offer.

After the phone call I was really relieved and happy about how things turned out. I went to go text Anna to tell her but then I remembered that John's girlfriend said they were dating for 4 years. So I texted Anna and asked her when she dated John. It was two years ago. She must have known that he was dating another girl and that's why she was so fucking pissed. So a lot of you guessed right that she was his mistress for a while. I'm not going to tell John's girlfriend since she's done with him (hopefully) and doesn't need anymore heart ache. But I'm definitely going to cut Anna out of my life. And when she asks why I'll just tell her that I know about her and John.

All in all, it turned out okay for pretty much everyone involved except for John. Which is good because fuck that dude.

6,"Me [27F] with my husband [32M] of 4 years- his friend [32M] and family are staying with us, he doesn't take me seriously when I say they need to go.


I know this sounds bad but I feel like I've reached my limit with them. I'm not trying to be mean or selfish so please hear me out.

My husband's friend [32M], his wife [33F], and son [10M], came to stay with us at the end of July. They were renting a house from her parents but it was put up for sale and sold rather quickly, leaving them without a place to stay. 

I was sympathetic and agreed without hesitation when my husband mentioned letting them move in temporarily. The original plan was for them to stay here for one month while they arranged a permanent living situation. My husband has known this guy forever and I understood why he wanted to help his friend. We were both happy to do it.

Everything was great at first but by the end of the second week I was having doubts. They're loud, messy, and kind of rude. They leave pans on the stove, dishes all over the kitchen, clothes in the living room, their laundry is never completed, etc. The little boy doesn't have boundaries or many rules. I've woken up in the middle of the night and found him playing on his xbox or iPad. They argue and yell at each other almost daily. It's especially bad in the mornings because the boy doesn't like going to school. I've overheard the parents fighting among themselves too and it's awkward to say the least. I try to be considerate of the fact that they're going through a stressful time but I don't know how much more I can tolerate.

Early this morning the little boy walked in on my husband and I in the shower together- we don't know how long he was there because when I looked over he was standing silently in the doorway. I screamed and my husband yelled for him to get out. He left our bathroom and bedroom doors open when he bolted and we heard him (loudly) laughing and telling his parents. I am so embarrassed. I know it's a perfectly normal thing to do but I'm kind of shy and prefer not to talk about my sex life openly like that.  

I'm ready for these people to move on. I didn't say anything when the initial month passed. At about 6 weeks I asked my husband about their plans and he said he would talk to his friend. I guess they needed to save more money to rent in the area they wanted and asked to extend their stay. My husband talked to me about it but it sounded like he'd already said it was okay, and I want to be supportive of my husband and his friends so I went along with it. Last week I kind of blatantly said it was time for them to go. He smiled and agreed to talk to his friend. Now that it's been 3 full months I'm *really* ready for them to go. They can stay with someone else if necessary but I want my house (and privacy) back. 

I know I need to talk to my husband but I want to do it without sounding like I'm demanding he toss his good friend out on the streets (with a child, no less). I have a hard time asserting myself and I would appreciate advice on how to go about this in a kind and respectful way. I'm also curious as what people would think of me maybe talking to the wife. I don't know what to say but I want to be nice as well as firm while sending the message it's best for all of us if they find their own home.

**edit**: My husband and I have talked a little through text this afternoon (we'll talk in more detail when he's home) and he seems more understanding of my feelings. He didn't realize how disturbing the shower incident was for me and agrees it's creepy. He said he's going to have a serious talk with his friend tonight and they'll set a date to move out within a month. He doesn't think he'll have to evict him or involve the police.

  **tl;dr**: My husband's friend and his family have stayed with us for 3 months. I was fine with it at first but I'm ready for them to move on. My husband isn't as affected by their presence because he works and therefore doesn't really understand why this is bothering me so much. This morning was especially bad- the friend's son walked in on my husband and I in the shower and proceeded to tell his parents about it. My husband laughed it off but I'm mortified. I feel like this is a big deal and should serve as the last indication that this family needs their own home and we need ours back. "

11,"""UPDATE"" Me[25F] with my SO[29M] of 3 years and his child[4F]. Sleepover issues.


[Link to previous post](https://redd.it/79j4rm)

My last post really got a lot of attention and I got a lot of helpful comments! 
Before I posted here I had actually had a brief conversation with my SO about the sleeping issue that wasn't very productive (or so I thought). 

It turns out that the night I made my first post he finally decided to start getting his daughter to sleep in her room. She didn't want to be in there at all to begin with and screamed a lot, but he stayed with her the whole night. In the morning she said she actually liked sleeping in her room! Then he told she'd have to start sleeping there by herself eventually, which she didn't like, but it's a start lol.

He also contacted her mom to talk about the sleeping issue, and she's actually 100% on the same page! So now they're going to work together to come up with a plan and reward system that will be consistent at both houses, which is awesome and should make things easier for everyone.

Thanks to everyone who commented with their story/advice/opinion! There were so many helpful people, and some that really stood out to me and commented a lot were u/TacoPenisMan u/sweadle u/NotYourOklahomie u/Dead_Like_Me and u/RascalBSimons . So special thanks to you guys and thanks again to everyone else. I love r/relationships!

12,"My wife [40s F] and I [40s M] are both seeing other people but choose to stay together regardless. Our oldest child [29 F] is very angry at us for this and fighting with our other children [25 M and 21 F] about the situation.


This is my first post on Reddit and I hope I am doing this right. Please let me know if there is something I need to fix. I hope that this website can provide a more diverse range of opinions than my family and friends can.

My wife, Marge, and I were high school sweethearts and we have been married for over 25 years. We have three adult children: Lisa [29], Bart [25], and Maggie [21]. Lisa and Bart live on their own and Maggie is still in college.

Life has generally been good and we have never wanted for anything, but I would be lying if I said that the spark had not died down during the past decade. Despite this, Marge and I are still very close and we never fight with each other. I don't know if you would describe our relationship as one with romantic love or sexual intimacy, but we are both very much connected to each other and I couldn't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

Neither one of us is quite sure how this happened, but during the past 4-5 years, we have both been seeing other people. This will sound very odd to most people, but we had never made any effort to hide the fact that we were seeing another person. It was like one day, we both realized what was happening and we both started laughing about it. Marge knows that I am seeing several different men and women and I know that she has her boyfriends. We're both comfortable with this and we encourage each other to have fun and be happy.

Despite our best efforts to keep this a secret, our children found out. My wife accidentally left her email account logged in on Maggie's iPad and Maggie went through her emails and printed out all of the private conversations between Marge and her boyfriends to give to me. Maggie and I had a long talk about the situation and I explained to her that not only was I aware of her mother's actions, but that I supported her mother 100% and that it was a mutual agreement between us. After my wife confirmed that it was true, Maggie said that she understood and would support us doing whatever made us happy. Our son Bart had a similar reaction and is fine with the situation as long as we are both happy.

Unfortunately, Lisa has not been nearly as open minded as Maggie and Bart have been. Lisa has been calling my wife and crying on the phone to her, begging for her to leave me. Lisa does not believe that an open relationship can exist and she believes that I am manipulating Marge into staying with me. It has gotten to the point where my wife is tired of explaining the situation and has begun hanging up the phone whenever Lisa brings the subject up. Lisa has tried to get her siblings on her side, but neither Bart nor Maggie want anything to do with her after some of the posts she made online about us. Maggie and Lisa also got into a screaming match about the situation and Lisa banned Maggie from her house until further notice.

The holidays are coming up soon and I don't know if there's a way to fix this and make our family whole again. I've started to lose hope that Lisa will ever come around and accept the situation for what it is. I love my daughter with all my heart and I don't want to lose her over this.

16,"I [F29] started breaking down after hearing about my dad's latest stroke. Fiancé [M32] told me in annoyed voice to ""stop stomping"".


I just found out my dad had another stroke. My mum kept this from me for four days because she was ""busy"" and didn't want to worry me. I'm not happy about this. 

Background: my dad had a serious stroke 14 years ago, at the age of 51, and it's left him permanently incapacitated. For illustration he can walk for limited distances (around the house) but very weakly and slowly. His speech is slurred. He wears adult diapers. Last Wednesday, he had another one that affected the same side of his body. He's been discharged from ICU but is still hospitalized, and it's not clear to me what this new stroke means - whether it's going to undo all the progress he made over the last 14 years. 

For more context, I now live thousands of miles away from my parents for career-related reasons and only see them twice a year. We are not close, but I have to admit that my dad's stroke affected me tremendously (I was 15 years old then) and a big part of my coping mechanism was to distance myself emotionally, to pretend it wasn't really happening because it was simply too much for me to process. 

Now it's happening again, years and years down the road. It doesn't seem as serious as the first but it brings back a lot of old feelings, of sadness and helplessness and guilt. I feel so fucking bad for him. I hate that he has to suffer again on top of the pathetic, limited excuse for a life he has been forced to lead for 14 years. The selfish part of me wants to keep running away and pretend nothing is new. But I also feel so fucking guilty that my mum has to deal with this alone and I can't be there for work related reasons. It doesn't seem fair that I get to live the life I always wanted while she deals with all the shit on her own. 

I have a hard time expressing my emotions. For the record, I rarely ever cry and usually internalize all my negative emotions. I found out around 1.30am and talked to my mum till 2. My fiancé was there the whole time and he was...vaguely sympathetic but didn't ask for the details until I shared them with him. Then I sat alone at my desk trying my best not to cry while he laid in bed. I guess I don't blame him for not noticing, but I didn't want to be like, ""HEY COMFORT ME PLS"", especially when he seemed so...uninterested? Finally I gave up, sat up beside him in bed and started crying softly because I couldn't really handle it anymore. I think he was tired, and perhaps it would have been too much to expect for him to sit up and hold me like I needed. Instead he just kind of lay on his side with his eyes shut and half-heartedly patted my knee while I cried. 

I began to feel like I was going to have a meltdown and made a mad dash for my anxiety meds. I rushed to the cupboard and grabbed one and chopped the bar in half to the right dose. At that moment he said in an annoyed voice, ""can you please not stomp? The neighbours can hear.""

I fully agree that I should have been aware of the force of my footsteps. Living in an apartment with thin walls requires consideration. But, fuck. I wish he hadn't said it to me like that, in the moment. I badly needed him and felt scared to ask/didn't feel like I should've had to ask - and it hurt so fucking bad that he cared to tell me off for the noise I was making instead of being there for me in the moment, like his priorities were jumbled. I said in a quiet voice, ""I don't give a fuck"", and he turned over to face me with his back. 

This set me off and I started full on ugly-crying in the bathroom. Eventually he got up and touched my arm, but told me to take a walk with him downstairs or just get in his car and cry there so the neighbours wouldn't get woken up/think he was domestically abusing me. I refused to move but forced myself to stop crying. He *did* begin to try comforting me then, which I appreciated. He also apologised for being ""rude"" or inappropriate with telling me to stop stomping (apparently he was annoyed because he thought I was doing it on purpose???) but I can't fucking get over his initial reaction. It feels so fucking callous to me. If I'd heard him sniffling I would have been there with my arms around him, immediately. Even if I thought he was being too noisy, I would have tried to quiet him gently. As mentioned - it's hard enough for me to ask for help because I don't want to feel like an emotional burden. And this reaction - the impatience and knee-jerk concern for what the neighbours might hear rather than my emotional state - makes it harder and harder for me to have the nerve to seek emotional support from him. 

To be fair - it was late, he was tired. He put in effort to listen to me in the end. I was being truly inconsiderate and a bad fucking neighbour - but etiquette wasn't exactly the first thing on my mind, you know? It still hurts that he would not get up to hug me or ask me if I was okay, but only to tell me off harshly for stomping. Again - I agree that I should have been more conscious of the force of my footsteps.  But for fuck's sake, I was running to pop my meds. Was he a jerk or am I being unfair? When we got in bed, I said, ""hey, for future reference, it's hard for me to ask for support but -"" and he cut me off by saying ""yeah you already mentioned that, I don't want to stay up till 5am talking when we have things to do tomorrow [Saturday]."" Now he's sleeping but I can't despite being all dosed up on Xanax. 

**tl;dr** Fiancé did not ask me if I was okay or comfort me when I was first crying over my dad's stroke (when I rarely ever cry or break down); instead told me to ""stop stomping"". 

**edit** He wasn't asleep. We were both awake (I'm an academic and he's a musician; we keep late hours). I agree he was tired though. "

[Previous Post Here  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/74akvg/i_31f_cannot_stand_my_boyfriends_30m_mom_60f_and/)

It's been about a month since I last posted and there have been a few small developments.The most notable thing is that my boyfriend and I, along with his family, have had several serious conversations about how to move forward. But first, some more information on how his mother has been behaving over the last month. 

She went on an spree of verbally attacking me, both via text to me, and via text to his family members. She threatened to sabotage our recent trip to my hometown to see my family (which I'd been looking forward to for months, as we hadn't all been together in three years). She also made lots of petty comments and insults about me, not limited to my lack of talent (I am in a creative profession), and my boyfriend's ""stupidity"" for being with someone like me. Basically: she's super pissed with her current station in life, and I am the privileged individual who gets the blame. She also contacted my boyfriend's brother to let him know she was writing his 7-year-old daughter out of her will and taking away her college fund (this has been done about two dozen times) because she spent time with me and enjoyed it, versus not being happy when spending time with her. I have blocked her from every social media platform, email, and phone/text. Boyfriend's brother has taken a placating approach by simply responding with ""OK"" whenever she texts, versus engaging. 

Outside of the verbal aggression, she has backed off. She used to call my boyfriend at a frequency of several times a week, which he admits was a cumbersome, exhausting burden because he felt obligated to listen to her 30-minute angry diatribes about whatever drama was happening in her world. She hasn't called him in two months, and it has been glorious.

Regarding the upcoming holidays, we sat down with his other family members here and decided how to move forward. We are all in agreement that we will not spend Thanksgiving or Christmas with his mother. We have made plans to travel out of town for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we're very much looking forward to the mini excursions. At this point, his mother would have likely contacted us about Thanksgiving plans, but in her anger since the PCH fiasco she hasn't attempted to do so. I am not sure if she will reach out about Christmas, but if she does then we will relay our current plans and take it as we go. 

In addition to family-wide conversations about holidays, we have talked extensively about his mother's mental health and the best ways to move forward. In my state, there is a law that allows you to file a court - ordered mental health evaluation, and it only takes one person to file the application. That is not an option we have ruled out, especially since she is clearly hurting and mentally unwell, and could benefit greatly from a mental health check and medication. It is my understanding that one has been filed for her previously, and that the court found mental disorder, but that she has ceased taking medication. If it were up to me, I would file the application yesterday, especially since she mentioned wanting to kill herself in her last angry bout. Ultimately, though, I don't want to sidestep my boyfriend. 

In the end, as a family we have agreed that our lives are better when she is not in it, and that ultimately she is happier, too, since everything we do — even planning a life-long dream trip for her — causes her great distress in the end. 

We'll just have to take this one day at a time, but things have been calmer, generally, and I am looking forward to the holidays instead of feeling anxious about them for the first time in three years.

22,"My (F 32) husband (M 50) of 10 years has a harmless habit but denies it vehemently


My husband is a surgeon and works long, weird hours that often involve him getting up way before me. He's developed a strange habit that he denies and I don't know why. It's possible he always did this but I just never noticed because we were living in a different house and I couldn't see the back yard from our bedroom.


When his day starts early he often goes out the front door, then sneaks into the backyard and pulls his shirt up over his face. Think Cornholio. He'll stand there doing nothing for a good five or ten minutes before he pulls his shirt back down and goes out the side gate. I can see him from our bedroom window but he says he has no idea what I'm talking about.


 He denies the whole thing. I have no idea why, it seems harmless, but he gets incredibly irritated if I even bring it up. I could yell to him or take a picture and show him and he would still say I imagined it. It's not even the act, it's his adamant denial that confuses me. I don't think it's sexual but he reacts to my questioning with the same level of angry denial he only reserves for questions about totally harmless crap he's needlessly ashamed of (his dr. phil addiction, some sexual kinks), which makes me wonder. He's not a liar or even an exaggerator but very uptight and has difficulty talking about issues if he feels accused or there's any kind of personal shame around it.  


I would accept ""It's personal and I don't want to talk about it."" but not ""no, you're just imagining things and probably going insane."" He's otherwise honest and not prone to lying or exaggerating. Should I just give up and accept that he does this for some reason and I will never know why?

23,"Me [47 M] with my wife [45 F] 16 years married, her family asking us to go in on a joint investment. She wants to and I don't.


My Wife's brother is asking us to go in with other family members to buy her parents spare cottage on their property to give the parents some liquidity. 

The bank loan will be in her and her siblings names (not the respective partners). As I am the main breadwinner I would have to service the joint loan for her.

I do not want to be told how to invest my money esp. when I have little spare after my own costs. We already have our own hefty mortgage and have 3 young children (15, 13, 11). I currently pay 85% of all our costs and she the remainder.

I am the only one out of ten siblings and respective partners who is baulking at this. They feel that there is money to be made by renting out the house on 'Air bnb'. My wife is furious with me that I never join in on her families joint ventures. There was once a race horse that they all purchased (except for me) - another story!

My Wife in her anger said to me that she needs to be involved in this as it is part of her inheritance. I pointed out that it didn't seem fair that I pay the loan and her name is on the investment. Come to think of it, our house is in her name and I pay the loan (security reasons), I pay for her car and it is in her name etc. 

My wife really has no money sense and wants for nothing as I give her want she wants. But this seems to be a big ask. Family gatherings will be awkward if I am the only one not involved. My wife's brother, the instigator and eldest sibling (47 M), is seen as a bit of a 'hero' by her family so what he says goes! Kinda guy that orders the wine on behalf of others at a restaurant and you don't get a say!

Greatly appreciate some advice. I feel my choice is to say 'ok, Let's do this' or 'I am outer here, let's see how you handle things without me' - How do I handle this?

24,"[updates] Am I (25F) being mean/unreasonable to my coworker (22F) asking for rides?


Hi everybody,

My original post didn't get a ton of comments but it got enough that I thought I'd share an update for anyone interested in the aftermath of my ride-share drama.

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/761dk1/am_i_25f_being_meanunreasonable_to_my_coworker/

It was about 3 weeks ago that I told my coworker I wouldn't be driving her anymore due to her constant tardiness (and her ungratefulness). I felt bad about it at first because she seemed so young and clueless rather than manipulative. After I ended it, she started asking everyone in the office for rides, including people she had never spoken to who live in the complete opposite direction of her. She did manage to get to and from work every day for the last three weeks, basically by bouncing from car to car every couple days because nobody would commit to a long-term agreement. For the record, I didn't tell anyone why I wasn't driving her anymore apart from my manager and a coworker who asked me what happened after she received a message asking for a ride home.

Well, Monday she was finally fired due to poor performance (which we all knew was coming since she had been there almost 4 months and still hadn't been given a company cell phone) and the floodgates opened. Not only did she ask everyone for rides, she was just as thankless and demanding to the rest of the office as she was to me. The team went on a group outing last Friday and she evidently got really bratty towards the woman driving her home because she was hosting a Halloween party that night and wanted to leave.

Even though I kind of feel like a sucker for agreeing to drive her in the first place, I'm glad to know in the end that I definitely made the right judgement call.

TL,DR: Coworker proceeded to badger the rest of the office for rides every day. She was finally fired on Monday and nobody who was nice enough to give her a ride had anything nice to say about her.

26,"[UPDATE] My [28/M] fiance [28/M] came clean about emotionally cheating on me with a mutual friend [25/F]. What's the best way for us to all deal?


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u8fsr/my_28m_fiance_28m_came_clean_about_emotionally/)

Hi guys! It's been a while. God, almost two years? I've always wanted to do an update to this, but felt it wouldn't be appropriate until I waited a while to see if it all worked out (also lol I couldn't remember my username and couldn't find the old post whoops). Didn't want to count my chickens before they hatched, y'know? I know the original wasn't the most popular thing in the world, but maybe this will be helpful to someone.


So I took a lot of solace in that it looked like I was going the right track... except that I was kind of nervous telling John to cut contact with Ellen. I knew it was right, but I felt weird making that kind of demand -- especially since she had been a friend for so long and in a weird way I sympathized with her. I put it in the back of my head as a sort of ""well, if she treats me like shit or if they look to be getting too close again, that's going to be my last straw."" Kind of cowardly, but eh.


I got a lot more blunt about her though. Since he was more open with me and shared chat logs, I saw Ellen was doing.. weird shit. Stuff like insinuating she'd hurt herself if he cut contact, or that ""if [she] went down, [she's] taking as many people with [her] as [she] can"". I also was very honest in how she treated me like shit throughout the duration of our ""friendship,"" and she only seemed kind to me when she wanted something (he himself later noted it was extremely fucked up that I had been emotionally supporting both of them while they were both essentially stabbing me in the back). 


I told him that it was, at best, a toxic friendship, and at worst she was skirting towards emotional abuse. I've been through an emotionally abusive relationship before, and I told him a lot of the warning signs. I distanced myself from her at this point -- she REFUSED therapy, and considering how she treated me (and him, despite claiming to love him) I had no tolerance for being someone's pocket counselor. If you can't even pay me in being a good friend, I don't owe you shit.


I wound up showing John the post I made here. He read over it, took it in... and I don't know if it had anything to do with his decision, but: he came home for Christmas and told me he was going to do a no-contact ""trial run"" over the winter break. He made this decision on his own, which definitely made me happy -- not just because of the whole infidelity thing, but because she was kind of a shithead. He spent a week apart from her, and it more or less shattered his rose-tinted glasses. When he returned she essentially said she got sexually involved with nazis, and that it was his fault because he wasn't around to stop her (???). He blocked her, severing contact permanently. I followed suit.


Almost two years later: 

* We're still in no contact with her, despite the fact that she's been sending e-mails, Facebook messages, and even tried to hunt us down in an MMO we both played. It's a little creepy.
* He went into therapy, and found out it was REALLY helpful. He continued to go even after things mostly recovered between us. 
* We're not LDR anymore -- he finished up college and he's been home for over a year now. We're still engaged -- we've agreed that he needs steady employment first before we're gonna take that jump!
* Our relationship is a lot better, he's put a lot more work into it. Grass is greener when you water it! He worked to earn my trust back.
* He's been much, MUCH better about transparency and setting boundaries. If someone presses him or tries to lean on him emotionally in a way that's uncomfortable, he shuts that shit down and tells me immediately.
* He and I still have open and honest dialogues about what happened. We won't let it just be swept under the rug. He feels guilty and disgusted about what he did to this day. I've forgiven him, but I've made it clear that despite Ellen being a shithead it wasn't her fault and I will not tolerate this sort of betrayal a second time.
* While I've forgiven him, I still wake up sometimes angry at Ellen. I know the infidelity wasn't her fault, but... it's weird. I'm angry over how I tolerated her treatment of me for so long, and because she claimed to love John despite treating him like shit. Like, if you're gonna have a secret relationship behind my back, at least treat my guy right goddammit!

So I guess.. I dunno. From reading about other cases of infidelity, it seems like to get it to work the cheater HAS to be honest with you. They have to come clean to you, and they have to accept fault. If they blame you take it as a dumptruck of red flags. 'cause that shit ain't your fault. When I'm sometimes rationalizing the infidelity, or thinking I overreacted John will tell me straight-up that I'm being too nice about it, and that my anger was (and still is) justified. On one hand I hate that my loved one still feels guilt, but on the other I'm kind of glad because it's made it easier to trust him not to fuck up again.

I know it's not common for these types of stories to end well, and maybe shit will change in 5 years down the line... but I'm happy with him.

**tl;dr: Two years later, we're still together and I feel confident saying we've recovered from his infidelity. He's taken active steps to earn my trust back. He did a shit move and knows this. I'm glad I didn't have to lose my best friend and partner. I'm overall happy with life.**"

I’m the ”funny” girl who has never had a date in her life mostly because I’m socially awkward and not the most attractive girl which doesn’t faze me. I’m actually content being ugly because people don’t feel threatened by me and I don’t get unwanted attention from people (I don’t like attention unless I’m joking around).

Had a chat with my guy friend who is experienced and good loking. He can realistically get any girl he wants because he’s charming as well. We talked about dating in general and he asked me if I’ve ever dated someone. No I said, apart from having sex a couple of times when I was 20 with my crush, who ubfortunately didn’t feel the same but only wanted a sexual relationship. He laughed and then said I should put more effort into my looks if I want a relationship because guys have sex with ugly women out of desperation. I was taken back a little and then countered with saying I’m proud of being ugly and if it means I’ll be chronically single then so be it. He went silent after that and we changed the subject, lol.

So here’s the deal. I rarely wear make up, I have a plain and boring hair cut and I’m not into looking like a hipster or a smoking sexy hot woman. That’s not me and I would never pull off that look. I’m just a boring looking socially awkward 23 yo old that likes to joke around.

I feel like it’s not socially acceptable to be an ugly and single young woman? My parents are telling me to dress up and put make up on because I look homeless and will never attract a guy, my friends are talking about doing a make over on me etc.

Do you think it’s true that I’m chronically single because I’m ugly?

Tldr: Not socially acceptable to be an ugly young woman

Whenever I ask what she wants to do it's *literally* always ""I don't care"" or ""you pick"" or ""I don't know"" or ""I don't have a preference"". She says she has anxiety about picking in case she chooses wrong but I've told her seven million times that it I won't get upset at all if she ""chooses wrong"". Hell, I've taken us to places that weren't interesting or the food was bad before.

I'm starting to feel like I'm dating a mannequin. She chooses nothing. It makes me feel selfish and controlling even though she is willfully surrendering any sort of decision making to me. 

If I have to hear ""you pick"" one more time I might light myself on fire.

38,"My[27M] girlfriend[25F] of 9 months just told me that we have to break up because her parents have set her up with an arranged marriage, and I don't k ow what to do next.


I met my girlfriend Mehnaz a year ago at ER. I sprained my ankle, and she was one of the nurses there. It was a slow night so we ended up talking a lot when the doctor wasn't around. She gave me her number, and we started going out.

Mehnaz is brilliant, and beautiful. She's also funny and an awesome dancer. Great in bed too I might add. It was very new for both of us. She told me that was the 1st non-muslim man that she had ever dated. I was cool with that, she was the 1st middle eastern woman I had ever been with also.

Things have been great so far. She had told me that her parents were very conservative and traditional. They were born in Pakistan and moved here before she was born. I hadn't met them yet, as Mehnaz thought that it might not have been a good idea. I never let on, but i think it might have something to do with me being black.

I let it go, and we have had a great relationship for the last 9 months. I was sure that sooner or later I would meet her parents, either they would like me, or they wouldn't. I thought that either way, since Mehnaz claimed that she loved me, we would get though everything together.

Last night, Mehnaz texted me that we needed to talk. She told me that her parents had set her up for an arranged marriage, to the son of a friend of her family. A Muslim guy. I told her that she should just say no, or to finally tell them that she already has a serious boyfriend. She just made excuses about how things work in her culture.

We got into a big argument about it, because I honestly couldn't give 2 shits about how it works in her culture if it means losing her. I told her that if she really loves me like she says, she will stand up for herself, and for us. 

What do I do? Is there something I can say that will help her break out of whatever cultural or familial bonds that are forcing her down this path? Should I just let her go? Should I fight for her till the end? Should I crash her wedding proclaiming my love like out of a 80s movie?

TL;DR My girlfriends parents are forcing her into an arranged marriage. I want her to stand up to them, but I don't k ow if she will. I want to know what should i do?

Edit:

**Thank you to all the people who kindly responded with advice. I know that I didn't want to get it through my thick skull that I have lost Mehnaz.**

**I think I will give her one last chance tonight at dinner. If she chooses not to fight for what she says that she loves, I will end it, then and there.**

Hey guys,
My wife and I have been together for almost 6 years now. We have been married for just over a year. She is my best friend and I love her very much. I have known her since I was 14 because she is friends with my sister. We didn't really talk to each other in our younger years though. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago she sat me down to confess that she had met a guy at a show we went to together and that they had been text messaging/snap chatting each other. This was going on for about a month before she told me. Upon hearing this I was pretty hurt but we had a civil discussion about it. I told her that I did not like her talking to someone else and that I felt hurt. I explained that it made me feel like I was not doing enough and wanted to know what he was doing differently that I wasn't bringing to the relationship. We had a good discussion about how our communication has not been the greatest lately and we even discussed seeing a couples counselor to work through some of these difficulties. I politely asked her to stop talking with this guy and she said that it was done. Later she told me she had let him know that they would no longer be talking. That was the end of it... or so I thought.

In the last few weeks I started trying a little more to show her that I do care and love her. I had been trying to play less video games and spend more time with her. I started doing more around the house, as that was one of the things she said she wanted me to work on. I have been trying my best to focus on what her wants and needs are to improve our relationship.

Last night we were eating dinner and talking about this and that. We got on the subject of sex and trying new things. I am not the most sexually outgoing guy so I kind of got quiet and didn't say too much. She continued the conversation and then looked at me like she had something more to say but didn't want to. I asked her what was on her mind and she admitted that she was still talking with this other guy. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I tried to stay calm and ask her questions about it. I just couldn't concentrate and was feeling so hurt. I walked away from her to collect my thoughts. I finally told her that I was hurt and that I felt she was going to leave me for him. She continued to stress that she if fully committed to me but all I could think was, for how long? She told me that she liked talking to him because she wanted to get to know him on a friend level. OK great. Except I feel like the way it was introduced to me was in a secretive, I have feelings for this guy kind of way. I even asked if she was attracted to him and she said yes. I feel like if she wanted to just be friends with this guy she would have introduced him to me at the show where they met and we all 3 would be friends. Instead she hid his existence in her life from me for a month before making the confession. 

I do appreciate her honesty with telling me but I am afraid she is going to develop feelings for him and lose interest in me. I have told her this and she insists that she is fully committed to me, loves me and would never leave me for someone else. 

So here I am, posting on reddit for advice. I want to know if I am over reacting and should just let her talk to her ""friend"" or if I should do something more about this situation. I don't think telling her to stop talking to him will work so in my mind it will turn into the ultimatum of me or him.

Thanks for reading.

44,"Me [35M] with my wife [33F] of 9 years. Her recent obsession with saving money is becoming a major problem for our family.


We've been together for 12 years and married for 9. We have three kids (8F, 6M, 4F).

She's always been more frugal than I have been, but it was never a problem. We always managed to come to agreements and sometimes she was right and sometimes I was right. But recently she's gone to a bit of an extreme.

We're in a good financial situation. She hasn't worked since we had our kids but I make good money and we have no debts except our mortgage which is very reasonable. We'll pay that off in less than 10 years. We're saving about 20% of that income for our retirement (I have no plans to retire early) and we're saving money in college funds for our kids. We'll be able to send them to the best schools and grad schools without a problem.

After all of that, we still have a lot of money left to spend. Of course we're a family of five and there are costs but we can easily afford them and there's always money that is left over. Our problem is not budgeting or being aware of what we spend, rather, it's that she doesn't want to spend almost anything.

She's gone into couponing, she spends at least an hour every day finding, printing and collecting coupons and creating shopping baskets to maximize the use of them. This has reduced our groceries bill for example, but the stuff that we get are not the stuff that we like. Our kids often complain about that and I notice it too. I think it's great to minimize the bills but it shouldn't come at the expense of us not buying things that we'd like.

We have three kids and that's a lot of work. I always help out as much as I can but I know it's a lot of work and we can afford to hire help for her. For example, for cleaning and tidying up the house. I don't want her to do these things and get tired up, if she has an hour I'd rather her relax or go out and have fun, or play with the kids rather than doing housework. I think bringing someone in every couple of days to clean and tidy up the house and do laundry is very reasonable and a huge weight off her and my shoulders. She agrees with the principle, but disagrees that we should spend this money. We should instead save it.

Another example is her car. It's a fine and safe car, but it's a 1999 Honda civic. She bought this before we got married and I have suggested her a few times that it's time for her to get rid of it and get a newer, nicer car. The kids don't like this car, it's not comfortable for them and doesn't compare to the cars that their friends' parents have. But she insists that it's wasting money until she runs it to the ground, and then she can buy another car that's 15+ years old to again, run it to the ground. But we can just buy her a nicer car right now, in cash without any issues. Her phone is the same. She uses an iPhone 4 and always complains about how slow it is and how horrible the battery is. But when I suggest that she can get a newer phone, she says no. 

The thing that got me a little frustrated was that I had lunch with my brother yesterday. I paid for his lunch (not an expensive lunch, about $20). She made this an issue and was all about how we shouldn't need to pay for family members. I didn't know but she apparently splits the bill when she goes out with her younger sister who is a student. I think she should just pay it and help her sister out. I could make several other examples, but you can imagine the overall picture.

I've tried several times to do the math with her and figure out how much we're actually saving. For example her couponing on the groceries saves us less than $1000 a year. That's for a family of 5. This saving goes nowhere. Spending the money to buy things we and our kids like more? That's worth a lot more. All of these savings are negligible in the long term. But they don't seem to make a difference to her, it's like she's resisting spending money so hard, and it's getting worse.

I'm just struggling to come to terms and communicate with her about how much this is affecting us as a family and how happier we'd be if she just relaxed a little about it. Any help or advice is appreciated. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wife has always been frugal but recently has taken it to a whole new level and it's negatively affecting me and our kids. We're at a good financial position and have everything under control and do not need to save as aggressively as she's been.

So our neighbor (Sarah) lives by herself she occasionally talks to my wife but I don't know her well enough to consider her a friend. She always says she has trouble finding guys but I don't see how because she is attractive and does have a good personality so I don't know.

But we live in a small town (population is around 11,000 or so) so I guess it's not too unbelievable that she wouldn't be able to find someone. Anyway 4 hours ago she came by and asked me if I could help her move some stuff in her house because she has back problems and can't hold heavy stuff for too long.

I went over and we spent maybe 2 hours moving stuff in her basement and got everything organized, after I had went to sit down because I was pretty exhausted honestly she sat next to me and gave me a beer.

We talked and she was going on about how Lonely she has been and wishes she had someone like me in her life. I just explained that she will eventually meet a guy who will treat her right and just tried to cheer her up and she seemed to have felt better.

She got up and said she had to get something and went upstairs and told me to wait. I'm going to be honest I dozed off for a few minutes I probably should have payed better attention to the situation but I didn't expect any of this.

She came downstairs and she has some form of lingerie couldn't really tell but she came over and sat on my lap. I just got her off and told her that I'm married and that I couldn't do that to my wife, she started saying how my wife didn't have to know and that it could be our secret.

She kissed me and I just pushed her away and left, I don't know how to bring this up to my wife she gets here in 5 hours and also I know this will sound horrible but I liked it a little.

I really need some advice please.

47,"Last night I (26f) found out my husband (26m) had been cheating on me before he left me. He tried to kick out me and our kid so he could bring her over on thanksgiving.


My husband and I were married two years and have a three year old together. I caught him on tinder very early in our marriage, and I forgave him and was able to move on from it. He started acting off a couple months ago. He has bipolar disorder (untreated), so I thought he was having a manic episode or something. Suddenly he was irritable and distant, and seemed to hate everything about me. He also started accusing me of cheating on him, he once even woke me up in the middle of the night to yell at me because he found lingerie from our wedding night on the floor after our toddler had been digging in our clothes. A couple weeks ago he ended our marriage, saying that I never did anything to change or try to make it work, that I criticize him constantly and treat him badly. It was confusing, just a few weeks ago he told me he could never be happy without me. 

I was supposed to fly back home on Saturday, but I ended up having issues and cancelling my flight. He was extremely pissed, he started slamming doors and throwing things. It was upsetting.

Well yesterday it all came out, he was mad because he had invited a woman over to spend thanksgiving with him, and she apparently gave him 130 dollars to help pay for my plane tickets. I really didn't need to know more than that, this is obviously someone he's been seeing for awhile if she's going to give him money to send his wife and child away.

I'm so angry and upset, I couldn't sleep at all last night. I'm supposed to drive back to our hometown with him at Christmas and move in with my mom at that point, and he'll end up seeing his daughter a couple times a year and paying child support. Even though I know this wasn't a good relationship, he could be very emotionally abusive at times--swearing at me, putting me down, blaming me for everything wrong in our relationship--I feel so abandoned and betrayed. I don't know how I'm going to make it living here for two months. I suspect I have issues with codependency, I feel like my world is falling apart.

50,"My (25F) roommate (28M) is super creepy and I don't know what to do...


Hi everyone, 

So, I'm a student, I moved to a new country and move into a house that I share with 2 other people. One guy and one girl. I moved in this house about a month ago. I met my two roommates before moving in with the presence of the landlord and I found them quite nice and friendly, nothing seemed off about them.

The girl is nice, she's often not there because she has a full time job and a boyfriend and she sometimes spends days with him so I don't really see her much at all. This past week I've only seen her once so far.

The guy is creepy AS HELL. Like I'm honestly scared of this dude. So scared that I try to quickly eat in the kitchen just to rush back to my room afterwards and brush my teeth/shower before it's super late, always afraid to find him creeping around the bathroom. 

Why is he creepy?

First of all, he's very cold but too friendly at the same time. It's weird. Like he would barely mutter hi when he sees me but smiles very creepy at me like it's forced, it just looks so unatural and it's not this :) it's this :D but creepy version. Once he came to knock at my room just to ask me if I wanted an apple (wth), but his eyes were wandering all over my room.

He likes to turn off the lights in the house. Everytime I need the lights to quickly go downstairs to the kitchen (otherwise I can't see anything) I turn the lights on, as soon as I reach the kitchen, I hear him stand up from the couch in the living room (it's where he hangs out mostly) and turn the lights off. WHY? then I have to turn the lights on again and I barely reach my room before he turns them off again. 

Once I was going to the bathroom and I saw him standing next to it, there's only one bathroom. He was just standing there, not doing anything. He couldn't have heard me and ran to stand in front of the bathroom because it's an old house and you hear everything. Which means he was just standing there, in the fucking dark. I said ""Excuse me I need to use the bathroom"" he stood there for like 10 more seconds before finally walking away, without saying anything.

I usually sleep late but I've stayed up late for uni until 4am twice, and in these two times, I've heard light steps coming upstairs and then steps in front of my door! Then no steps at all which means he was standing there or something?! It was him because the girl wasn't here the first night this happened, so it couldn't have been her on the second night. He is such a fucking creep.

The other day I locked myself out of the room, forgot my key inside and it's impossible to open the door without keys. So I went to the living room, called the landlord and waited for her to call me back and give me the combination to open the safe for the spare key. He came home and asked why I was sitting there as I never did before, I said I got locked out of my room. He sat down with me and I could feel he was staring at me, then he started to ask me questions like ""are you single"" ""do you have family/friends here?"" ""Are you a natural blonde?"" Like weird questions. Then he got up and came back five minutes later with my keys, I asked how he got them (I was silently freaking the fuck out) he said he used a paper to open the door and that it was quite easy to open these doors, that the landlord was doing a very bad job at keeping rooms safe. I thanked him but I felt extremely uncomfortable about this. So uncomfortable that when the landlord called me I told her it was sorted and all we had to do is open it with a piece of paper which made me concerned for my own safety. She said she couldn't replace the doors and that guy and girl have been living together for 7 months and even with the roommate that was here before me, there has never been any issues. 

The thing that freaked me out the most is that one day, I came home and it was all dark but I could hear that there was someone, just didn't know who. I went straight to the kitchen to grab something to eat when suddenly I hear loud bangs, screams (male), stuff being thrown, violent kicks on the wall, I was literally paralyzed. His room is above the kitchen and the living room so it was really loud. I stayed in the kitchen forever because I was too afraid to go upstairs, then I ran upstairs and just when I closed my room's door, I heard his door opening then closing again.

I don't know what to do. I called my landlord the other day and she said I can only move in three months, otherwise I'd have to pay three months worth of rent to move which is impossible because it's a big amount of money so definitely not an option. Plus she sounded super unhappy about my question.

But I also don't want to live in fear and figured I should deal with this, what should I do to deal with him? Should I tell him that he creeps me out? 

I'm quickly writing this on my way home in the train so if I forget any details or if you have any questions that might help you help me, please ask. 

Also, the girl seems to get along with him and I've spoken to her once or twice, she thinks he's a nice dude. But I also think they're sleeping together because I heard them have sex and there was no one else in the house. We have to let each other know when we invite someone over, I haven't been noticed and I never heard the front door open so... Yeah, don't think she can help me much with this.

TL;DR Roommate is super creepy, I don't feel safe when I'm alone in the house with him, I'm freaked out and I don't know what to do.

Edit: Hello again everyone! I'm sorry I can't answer to everyone's replies but I will try this morning.

Two things I want to address:

Some people said that maybe he was just socially awkward/might be sleepwalking, the thing is, I don't think he is socially awkward at all, he seems to be quite confident, the way he walks, talks etc... He looked looked at me in the eyes when he talked to me in the living room. I've dealt with socially awkward people before and nothing was off or creepy about them. With this guy, I just feel creeped out, like even his presence, it's just a feeling that maybe makes me even more paranoid than I should be or maybe a feeling that I should trust.

Just earlier, he was cooking his dinner in the kitchen, I came down to grab a beer and he started just staring at me, arms crossed. At that moment, I thought about what some people said that he might be autistic and that I should try to talk to him so I did. I asked him how he was doing and just flat out ignored me?? Then when I was about to leave, I heard him chuckle. Like wtf?! 

Girl came back today and will be here tomorrow so I'll try and talk to her about this, I don't care if she tells him. I'll try to keep u guys updated.

54,"[UPDATE] Me (26F) with sister (33F), visited me in the hospital even when I asked her not to


My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79pd3r/me_26f_with_my_controlling_sister_33f_i_insisted/) didn't get much attention, but here's an update anyways.  Slightly different throwaway bc I don't remember that one's password.

My sister's birthday is today. I wanted to call her but didn't know whether she was mad at me after the whole hospital situation and I was afraid she'd be angry and we'd end up fighting. If you didn't read the original one, the gist of it is: I got into a somewhat serious accident, I asked my sister not to visit me immediately because I was stressed and due to our strained relationship, her presence makes me very anxious and brings back traumatic past situations for me. She insisted a lot so I let her in, but then told her that I felt disrespected and wished she had listened to me. She seemed scorned and left and I hadn't talked to her in a month. 

Thank you all for your advice. I received some advice, specially on how I need to grow a backbone -- duly noted, working on it. One redditor hit the nail in the head saying that my sister used me for a long time as a punching bag to deal with her own anger issues - and suggested that we could try and go to family therapy together, which I thought was a great idea.

Since my leg is broken and I can barely get out of the house for the next two months, this isn't feasible right now. But I decided to take a step in that direction, so I wrote my sister a heartfelt e-mail explaining how despite knowing she loves me and cares about me, I can't let go of the past that easily. That I want to, but pretending that everything is alright has been killing me, and the situation in the hospital illustrated how I'm still deeply affected by what happened in the past. That I wanted us to face the truth and find a way to work with it.

Before sending her the e-mail I called her, to let her know that I'd written it but didn't want to send it right away because it's her birthday and I didn't want to bother her. I told her that I loved her, but we needed to talk, so as soon as she was ready I'd send her an e-mail because I couldn't quite voice some of the things I wrote.

She apologized about that day in the hospital, told me that she agreed with me and that she knew things were complicated. She said she wasn't angry, and hadn't called me because she didn't want to pressure me into having a conversation. She also said she recognized that day that she truly needs to be in therapy to sort out her own stuff, so she's been going since that week. She told me to send the e-mail, and that she'd read it with an open heart.

I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget the things she did to me, nor the way they made (still make) me feel. But I believe that she's genuinely trying, and willing to work on our relationship. So I'm happy.

  **tl;dr**: Sister apologized, acknowledged my feelings, is seeing a therapist and both of us want to deal with our shitty past. Best possible outcome :)"
55,"My [30F] classmate [40M] assumes I am in an abusive relationship with my husband [37M], and I am not sure what to do.


This past semester, I started going back to school, after a hiatus, due to marriage, pregnancy, raising my children, and anxiety.

I have been working with a few classmates, and getting tutoring in other subjects from one of them (the 40 year old male in the subject).  

Before I get I to that issue, I will say a little more about myself.  I am pretty anxious, especially around men, and I am currently the only woman in my program.  I have been in some seriously abusive situations a number of years in my past, and I am generally a recluse, although I am much improved compared to maybe six years ago.  So, in a nutshell, I am kind of weird on top of having a lot of interests, and an education, outside of my current program (so I don't really culturally mesh with my classmates).  

I have been married for five years, and my husband and I have a few kids (and some dogs) together.  We have a generally good relationship, and are respectful to one another.  He's happy that I am finally going to finish a degree.  

I also do a lot of manual labor, as my father and I man a few gardens, which add up to about 1/3 of an acre, and it's harvest time, so get a bit bruised and cut-up.  

Back to my classmate/tutor.  He occasionally makes comments which assume things like: my husband made me have kids I didn't want (not true at all), my husband doesn't share money with me (I just bought a brand new car), my husband made me leave school (him motivating me is why I went back), et cetera.  He has also pointed out bruises, from my toddler pinching me, as ""obvious"" hand marks, in front of other classmates.  

His ""concern"" is making me anxious.  It's really uncomfortable having someone point out a bruise on my arm, and loudly stating, ""wow, someone must have grabbed you good,"" in front of a bunch of people.  

Generally, he, and some of the other people he's said things around, are starting to make me feel extremely anxious and insecure at school.  Especially since I try to remain relatively private about my life, and people are very prying for information about subject I am not comfortable talking to, what are essentially, strangers. 

Today, my classmate/tutor mentioned that all the tutors are trained as manditory reporters for abuse et cetera.  We talked about it a bit, because I was once a tutor at the college, before there was any sort of training.  He went into some detail, and causally dropped a few things he's ""noticed"" about me, in his explanation of what is expected of them.  This too, was in front of another classmate, and was also pretty embarrassing.  

I think he is taking his training too seriously, and is actually seeking me out, and trying to get information on me, so he can build a case to report me to the school as an abuse victim, of which I am, but from many years ago (and not ever a victim of my husband, who's great!).  

I know his boss, as he is not only a former professor of mine, but a former boss, and a proctor for my distance education exams.  And I am thinking of speaking with him, about the training all the tutors received, and to explain the attention that I am getting from some of his employees, and how it's making me uncomfortable.  

I am not sure if this is the right course of action.  I feel as though if I talk to my classmates directly, I not only have to explain my prior traumas, or which I don't want to, but that they might think my husband if putting me up to it.  

Anyway, I know that is a lot, but I am not too sure what a good course of action is, and it is kind of an unusual situation. 

Tl;dr: my tutor had training to spot abuse, and thinks my husband is abusing me, due to my social anxiety, and being marked-up at times from kids, manual labor, having an active lifestyle, and being clumsy.  It's gotten embarrassing.  What should I do?

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for affirming talking to his boss is reasonable.  I'll try to muster the courage on Monday, and see what happens.  :)"

57,"My girlfriend [26F] of three years takes drinks I [25M] put in the fridge for work the next day


Hi r/relationships,

This may seem like a stupid problem to have but it's been driving me insane. 

Been with girlfriend, who I'll call ""Jenna"" from here on out for three years, lived together for two. 

For basically my entire adult life, I've been picking up drinks ahead of time for work  (red bull, soda, whatever) so I won't have to allot extra time in the morning for a gas station stop. 

For some reason, the last couple of months I'll get up in the morning and my beverage will be gone. Which means I don't get any sort of drink unless it's available at work because grabbing my drink is the last thing I do before leaving for work, so I don't have enough time to stop somewhere. 

I asked Jenna and she apologized and said she didn't realize I was ""saving"" it (I wasnt saving it really, most of the time my drinks go into the fridge for less than 24 hours before they come out again). So okay, mystery solved. 

Two days later, it happens again. Okay, My fault, because while I did ask her of she took my drink, I did not outright ask her not to do it again. 

So I get home later that day and ask her not to keep taking my drinks without at least warning me so I know to leave myself extra time. She apologizes again and all is well. 

Until she does it again. The next day. 

I get home and ask her to stop taking my drinks as it's getting really frustrating. She loses her shit, saying it's her house too and she can take ""whatever the fuck she wants"" out of the fridge because ""that's how it works when you live somewhere."" She told me she can't remember to tell me when she does take my drinks and that she shouldn't have to and to just have to deal with it. She says I'm being ""overly sensitive"" and that they're just energy drinks/soda so it's not a big deal.

Is she right? Should I just let it go and start getting up earlier instead? I mean, she's right, it is her house too, but she can't even let me know when she does it? 

Help me out here, r/relationships 

Tl:Dr gf keeps taking things out of the fridge that I buy to take to work. Refuses to warn me when she does so I can leave extra time before work, also refuses to stop consuming the things I leave behind. Am I being sensitive like she says?"
58,"I (25F) think I want to leave my boyfriend (26M) of 6 years. Even though I know it's the right thing, I keep backing out because it will be incredibly messy and I'm terrified.


We've been together for 6 years. For the first 4 years, things were absolutely perfect - I couldn't have asked for a better boyfriend. We were talking marriage, kids, buying a house together. He made me feel on top of the world. 

The last 2 years has been absolutely awful. This started with him falling into debt, struggling with his job and not telling me, which made us have to move out of our flat and me move back in with my parents. Whilst he struggled with debt and the long distance of our relationship, plus job frustrations, he became very emotionally abusive and manipulative. He lied constantly, bullied me, blamed me for all of his problems. I could go into more detail but basically ended up with me in hospital for passing out due to stress and exhaustion and even included him being arrested after threatening me in a hotel. 

I have suffered with depression before and so rather than leaving him, I felt sorry for him and as I loved him, I wanted him to feel better. Many times he admitted he needed help but wouldn't seek it. In the end, to top this all off, I found out he had cheated on me and taken another girl out on a date. We broke up for a couple of months but he begged for me back and stupidly, I accepted. I thought he had changed and this was the wake up call he needed.

At first, things were better. For a few months it really felt like he had changed. We agreed to move back in together eventually and finally did so 2 months ago. Leading up to this, as he still has financial worries and decided to have a career change (leaving the military - big deal for him), he became incredibly stressed again and inevitably started to return to his old ways. 

We still moved in together despite this and shortly after, I found out that he was texting another girl behind my back to help get himself a job (apparently). I found out because he sent her flowers to say sorry for not meeting up with her and the receipt went to a joint inbox. 

Since this has happened, I have tried to leave and have gone back and forth, because the thought of not being with him terrifies me. His end to his military career is approaching, and over the past month he has started to be emotionally abusive again. And yet for some reason I haven't been able to leave. 

Now, if I get upset about something (like his cheating) it's an inconvenience. Telling me I'm a disgusting slob because I didn't straighten the pillows on the bed. He's started saying nasty things to me about how his friend 3 years ago thought I was coming onto him (I wasn't, I was being nice to him at a wedding where I didn't know anyone) and that he can't trust me anymore. He hates everything because of me.  That I'm the reason for his problems. He's not happy because of me. He pretends to pack his bags saying he's leaving me because I'm a liar (I'm not) and then 15 minutes later breaks down and says he could never do that, and then literally pretend like nothing has happened. 

Sometimes I do this as well. I find something so unacceptable in our relationship (abuse, cheating) and start the process of leaving, looking at spare rooms, telling him I'm going. Walking to the train station but then breaking down because I think I'm making a mistake because he USED to be nice to me. Then we make up and say 'lets stop this now' and tell each other how much we love each other. Then the next day I'll be crying myself to sleep because he will do something again and I will despair that I haven't left yet. 

The other day, I was building some Ikea furniture at the weekend but one of the screws didn't fit. He came over to help and then shouted at me, in such a chilling tone, right in my face, saying ""You've been building this for ages and all I wanted to do this evening is to watch the rugby and you've ruined it! You ruin every weekend!"" He then stood up, grabbed a beer from the fridge and looked at me like a piece of dirt. 

I don't know why but that was just it for me. Something clicked. I had literally done nothing wrong and he was shouting at me. The way he said it was chilling - like he was deranged. I genuinely felt worried, abused even. I finally thought ""I don't like this person. He scares me.""

I went out for a walk and called my mum and told her that I think I am finally done. She told me to stay calm, get my ducks in a row and prepare. I come back and he is crying - the first time I have seen him cry in the last two years. He tells me I'm his best friend and thought I had left him. 

I stayed calm. I pretended like things were fine. I wasn't loving with him, but I didn't reject his hugs and kisses. I had sex with him (and hated it). This was 2 days ago and I still want to leave.

FINALLY to the actual problem - I have tried to leave so many times and have chickened out. All I know is him - we have been together for over 6 years, since I was 19 years old, and I don't know any different. I don't have any friends here - I moved to a new city to be with him and to put our troubles behind us. I don't have a support network here. I have a job and we have signed a lease together, so I can't go back. 

I know if I try and leave he will beg and stop me. He will make this messy. I am worried about his mental health, although he is inflicting harm on me. The last time we split up when he cheated, he pissed himself and threw up. He told me afterwards he was thinking about suicide. I know he needs help, but he won't seek it no matter how hard I beg him.

I'm just terrified of being alone and the mess this will cause. But at the same time I am suffering so badly by staying with him. 

TL;DR I want to leave my emotionally abusive boyfriend, but we live together in a city where I don't know anyone. I have no support network. We are tied into rent for another 10 months together. He has mental health issues and I am worried about what will happen. This is the reason why I have tried to break up with him before but have stopped myself because I believe the consequences of doing so are worse. Help me break this cycle. "

My boyfriend is conscious about how I conduct myself in public. He pulls me, tells me to move around in the crowded metro because I'm potentially in someone's way (It's crowded and I usually carry a big bag of books/laptop). The same goes for roads. If we're in the kitchen cooking with friends, he goes crazy about my knife skills and about how he was to worry about my not cutting my fingers (I've been living on my own since I was 18, and I can cut veggies?). We go to a restaurant that gets crowded, and I normally order dessert and he doesn't, and he gives me shit for not being able to ""live with the community"" and taking extra time at the table, making other people wait, annoying the waiter, etc. If I say that I'm there to eat just like the others in the line, he talks about how selfish I'm and how I sometimes can't behave. You don't wanna hear about what happens at Asian restaurants as I use chopsticks. We once went to the bakery and I missed out the ""please"" as I was in a hurry and hunting for my card- and in FRONT of the manager, he says, ""It's give me a red velvet, _please_. Say it that way."" Sometimes if I bump into someone on the road while walking with him, he says ""excuse us"" before I could respond. 

This could honestly come from the fact that he's been raised in a household where his parents had to struggle and learn good manners/ etiquette through books - or the fact that my family is immigrant - I've been raised here though, just among a different community.

Is this a red flag of some kind, or can we work around this? I have spoken to him about it and he denies this or points out how I was being an incovenience to strangers.

I have alopecia totalis which means I have no hair on my scalp. I've had this for approximately 15 years but only recently started wearing a wig (i used to wear a headscarf so it was more obvious something was wrong). 

I'm not sure when I should tell people about my condition. In the past few dates I've told men on the first date and even though conversation was great they didn't text again. So I'm not sure if I'm making the first date too awkward and scaring them off before they get to know me.
Prior to that I had told guys later on (few dates in) and those lasted longer and they all said they didn't care. I've also been in several long term relationships so it's not that I can't sustain a relationship but yeah I'm not sure what to do. 

I  don't have much experience navigating single life so not sure what I should be doing. I want to be open and honest but I don't know if I'm shooting myself in the foot. On an unrelated note I'm also finding that a lot of guys just want sex and I don't know how to filter these guys out from potential partners. I'm not sure what it is but I feel like when I was younger/before dating apps it was easier to know when a guy genuinely liked me but now it's so hard to tell. Maybe because less effort is required to get a date? I'm not sure.

68,"UPDATE Me[23F] with my sort of new BF, got in a stupid drinking contest and peed the bed.


As required here is a link to the previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7b171h/me_23f_with_my_sort_of_new_bf_got_in_a_stupid/

So first of all I want to thank everyone who commented, even those of you who I think really got the wrong idea.
A lot of things have happened in a short period of time, but I'll try to make sense if I can!
First of all and possibly the most interesting, it turns out I had actually met that girl before the night of the date. I mentioned her name to a friend from high school and she told me this girl was apparently on one of our rival swim teams from a different school. I don't want to think that someone could seriously be so petty over high school sports, but it makes sense why she didn't bother to introduce herself and seemed pissed when I tried. I really wasn't trying to be nasty, and I don't know anyone else who expects someone to remember someone they've met like once and won against.
Now, on to what I guess probably most people are interested in. A few hours after I put this post up, he called me, and I figured not answering would look much worse than just putting up with what he had to say. Of course he asked if the reason I hadn't texted back was because I was still embarrassed over what happened.
I admitted that I was still really ashamed and disgusted with myself and my total lack of self control the entire night. He laughed and also admitted he thought the whole thing was pretty high school drama level (makes sense!) on both girls parts. I had to tell him that honestly the entire reason I let her drag me to her level was because I really felt belittled and intimidated, and that I'm still incredibly sorry and ashamed for acting like that.
I know this doesn't excuse my behavior. I know I acted like a huge brat to everyone involved and I was no better than she was in that moment. I definitely shouldn't be drinking that much, so for those of you who said so, you're right.
After I apologized for the 100th time for having an accident he jokingly said that his mattress was too nice to ruin, and that he was getting a waterproof sheet or putting me on a two beer limit. Which, of course, I had to ask if that meant he still wanted another date..and he didn't. He wanted to make the entire relationship official!! Honestly I couldn't believe it, but he told me he had been intending to before all this happened, and it hasn't changed his feelings.
I'm super grateful to have someone so sweet (I still don't think this level of kindness would be everyone's reaction, although some of you must feel pretty amazing up on those high horses...) and forgiving. Maybe I overreacted by crying so much, haha, but I've always been a little bit of a crybaby (don't think I'm going to hit therapy for it just yet, but I think everyone who was concerned in that regard is very kind!). Everyone makes mistakes, though (maybe not pee the bed level but..), the comments are right.
So anyways, yeah, sorry I couldn't reply to everyone personally, I got a lot more advice than I expected, but if you took the time to comment or even PM me, thanks a billion!!

69,"My [20F] mother-in-law [40~F] keeps making 'jokes' that she hates my second child [6mo M] and I don't know what to do


I had my second child a little over six months ago, but recently my mother-in-law has started making 'jokes' about hating him. Initially I brushed it off due to the fact that the first time she said something along those lines, he had been fussy all day (he was teething, of course he was feeling like crap), but it's been picking up a lot in the two weeks since she said it. 

More recently she's been overflowing with affection for my first son [3yrs] and kind of brushing my other child to the side? She keeps reiterating that he's her favourite etc etc. It peaked at a family dinner the other night where my 6mo was fussing and refusing to sleep (again, teething), where she stated that 'the first grandchild is always the perfect one'. 

I am very hurt and conflicted about what to do with this. My husband [21] is extremely angry with her over this and is fully prepared to cut ties with her (due to past relationship strains, and apparently she exhibited this kind of behaviour with him and his siblings). I'm unsure of what to do as I always had a wonderful relationship with my grandmother and would like our kids to have the same thing, but not if she's only going to love one of them? I'm terrified of confronting her over this, especially as she's known to have a temper and I sometimes rely on her for transportation and childminding. Thoughts?

70,"Me (30f) with my BF (28m) one year, having weird sex issues - UPDATE


Hi everyone, I posted here [about a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/765gq7/me_30f_with_my_bf_28m_one_year_having_weird_sex/) to get advice on dealing with my boyfriend's extremely low libido. I got a lot of really great suggestions for how to talk to him about it, as well as ideas about why he could be having issues. 

It took me a couple weeks before I felt ready to have The Big Talk with him. Part of me was hoping that the issue would just resolve itself without my intervention, but of course that's ridiculous. So about a week and a half ago I finally sat down and discussed this with him.

I'm not going to give too many details because this stuff is really personal, but there were definitely a couple of underlying reasons that I didn't know about. He had started taking medication for ADHD without telling me, and that had killed his sex drive. He also had some trauma in the past that made it hard for him to enjoy sex. We talked through everything, and I told him that I completely support him and wouldn't push him to have sex until he's ready. I also made sure he knew that, when I was trying to be physically affectionate, I wasn't doing it in order to initiate sex. That's something that had clearly been weighing on him, because he immediately became a lot more affectionate after our conversation. He assured me that he still loves me and finds me insanely attractive, his lack of sexual desire is entirely separate from his feelings for me.

We discussed ways to satisfy my craving for intimacy without pressuring him into anything, though I could still use some ideas for that. Other than cuddling and kissing, I'm not sure how to recreate the closeness and intimacy of sex without any sexual contact. 

But the really great thing is, last night, after two months of waiting, we had sex! And it was amazing and emotional for both of us. He initiated it and I almost immediately felt like two months of insecurity and anxiety melted away. Even if we wait another two months to do it again, I think I won't feel nearly as bad as I did before, because I know now that he wasn't lying about how he feels about me. 

Anyway, sorry for the long update, I just wanted to thank you guys for all of your help and see if anyone had any new ideas for ways to be intimate with someone who doesn't want to have sex. We're both really committed to making this work, and the past two weeks have gone a long way towards healing the rift that had grown between us.

Thank you thank you thank you!

TL;DR - We talked it out, it's not about me, and we finally had sex!

71,"Me [25F] with my two new roomates, a couple 28M and 22F. They are acting like I am living in their apartment, not a shared apartment for the communal space, how to address this?


I recently moved in, and I didn't come with any furniture. We live in a smallish apartment, although the rooms are quite well sized. The house is entirely furnished by their belongings, (they knew I didn't have any since I just moved to the city) and it is a good thing since they have quite a bit.


In our hallway they have a large shoe cupboard. I decided to put a small wire rack shoe storage also in the hallway. At this stage I haven't finished furnishing my room so it looks quite empty. I came home tonight to find one of them had moved my shoe rack and shoes into my room.


Tbh I feel quite irritated by this. For starters because they didn't say anything. Also it is SHARED space, it isn't their apartment, it is ours and I have every right to put furniture in the shared space as well. It made me feel like they are dictating what is okay to put in the shared space, like I should ask for permission, which frankly I don't think is fair since it isn't like I said anything about their shoe racks, or records (which I honestly don't mind like it looks very nice all their decor) I'm just a bit pissed off they are living mine back into my room like it's ""theirs"".


Should I address this? How should I say it? Like I said I only recently moved in, so I don't want to make things awkward, but I'm also not keen to live in a house where I feel like I'm a guest, or tiptoeing around.


EDIT: I should mention it was actually their shoe rack that was in the same position it was when they put it there, that they said I could use. So I didn't buy a new piece of furniture or move it to a new space or anything. 

**TLDR Moved into a sharehouse with a couple, how to establish it is all of our sharehouse ie I rent the communal space as well, not just them?**"
