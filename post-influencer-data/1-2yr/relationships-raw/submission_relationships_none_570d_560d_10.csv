1,"UPDATE Me [19M] with my boyfriend [21M] 3 years, I had a seizure after accidentally taking too much of a medication and now he is being extremely overbearing


Original TLDR: 
  tl;dr: accidentally double dosed on a medication which caused a seizure. Was severely injured during seizure. Boyfriend has become completely controlling in effort to protect me which I believe is masking fear. He has taken possession of my medications and won’t let me leave the house without him. How can we move past this? How can I get him to understand that this stresses me out? How can I get some space?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7omn3j/me_19m_with_my_boyfriend_21m_3_years_i_had_a/

Tom was starting to get over his fears when we got his with a curveball. I was diagnosed with a brain tumor which probably contributed to the seizure. Tom and i are both completely terrified. 

I let Tom do whatever he needs to feel better as it now comforts us both. He helps me keep track of appointments and picks up my medications a lot. 

Fighting cancer and loving my man. It’s all i can do.

  **tl;dr**: got a cancer diagnosis. Tom is back to being scared but so am I️ and I️ don’t mind it at all. "
2,"[Update] A colleague (30ish M) that I (28F) dislike keeps trying to force an uncomfortable conversation with me. How do I navigate this?


[link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7wewwb/a_colleague_30ish_m_that_i_28f_dislike_keeps/)

I wanted to post a quick update because a lot of people here seemed  as annoyed with this caveman as I am. 

I got a ton of great advice (thank-you!), and I started practicing what I would say to his face the next time I ran into him. I also considered alerting the management at the club he chased me out of, but I didn’t have to do that. Apparently he brought it to the club himself and tried to rat me out for my “rudeness,” but it totally backfired. 

One of the managers approached me a few days ago and said “Justin” told her about what happened. My stomach sank at first because I thought she was going to encourage me to talk to him, but she said just the opposite. Without even hearing my side she told him that I don’t have to talk to him if I don’t want to. She also said she won’t be booking us on the same shows anymore, and that the staff knows not to allow him into the building on nights I’m performing. She said she wants me to feel safe at the club, and she’s got my back. What a win for sisterhood!

After that, he tried reaching out to my SO who also shut him down and told him to leave us alone. I don’t know if he’s let it go at this point, but I’ve been making notes about everything like some people wisely suggested, and I’m feeling validated and supported.

TL;DR: creep tried to rat me out for being rude, and it blew up in his face. "
3,"[update] I (28f) was very angry with my husband (31m) for taking extreme risks during skiing while we have two small kids. After the responses to that post and some more vacation events, I realized that I was unreasonable. I've apologized to him but reiterated my fears.


Here is the original:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yn3jg/my_28m_husband_31m_of_6_years_takes_ridiculous/

So that post totally blew up. I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them. 

One post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him. 

It also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area ""village."" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective. 

The yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to ""call someone goddamnit."" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because ""that's a $6500 grill on that car!"" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out. 

Yesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a ""burden"" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson. 

While we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on ""kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to ""one upping"" and ""talking down"" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good. 

So basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it. 

If I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!

5,"(UPDATE) I (20/M) am worried that my girlfriend (23/F) is codependent on me, because she has been relying on me entirely for emotional support and fulfillment.


https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7x5tyn/i_20m_am_worried_that_my_girlfriend_23f_is/

The advice I received was superb, and all the stories shared were extremely relevant and eye opening. I read every comment, and realized I used the word ""codependent"" wrong after someone pointed that out. 

I told her I was worried for her health, and I wanted to get her professional help before things turned really bad. It took a lot of convincing but eventually she went to the doctor with me. She was diagnosed with depression, and prescribed antidepressants (SSRIs). I also booked an appointment with a therapist, and the plan is for her to go once every week.

My girlfriend felt sad about the whole thing, and asked if I was going to leave her. I told her I wasn't, especially in a time of need. I reassured her about everything and said I loved her. I mentioned that I couldn't be her whole support network though, and being entirely dependent on me wasn't healthy for either of us. I said I would still visit her, but only on the condition that she sees her therapist every week, and she reluctantly agreed.

I knew the next morning she was going to beg me to come over. I was right. I told her I looked forward to seeing her in the afternoon, but I wasn't coming over. She started crying and I had to walk her through what to do on the phone. It sucked, I really wanted to go over and comfort her, but I wasn't going to feed her dependency.

The same thing happened the next morning, but this time I didn't guide her on what to do. I couldn't focus at school because I was worried if my girlfriend could function by herself. I called one of her co-workers and asked if she came to work. She did, she was a little sad but otherwise fine. 

I was finally able to get her to accept help from her friends, after she had neglected them for 3 weeks. They planned a girls night out. My girlfriend finally got out of the house, spent time with someone other than me, and according to her friends she had a lot of fun. She has been talking to her best friend again, and it's been a huge weight lifted off my back having another person for her to talk to.

I'm visiting my girlfriend every other day, instead of everyday like before. I don't know how long her depression will last or if it'll ever go away, but I'm completely okay going through this with her. She’s in a depressed mood for most of the day, but the antidepressants will start helping, she's becoming a little more independent each day, and talking to her friends again.

I'm disappointed in myself for not getting her help earlier, and to be honest if I didn't write my post I'd still be feeding her dependency. 

Seriously though. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who responded. This update is the least I could do. Thank you &lt;3

**tldr: After some convincing my girlfriend went to the doctor with me, and she was diagnosed with depression. I booked an appointment with a therapist and she is seeing her every week. I reassured her that I loved her and wasn't going to leave. I set some boundaries regarding her dependency to help her be more independent. I was also able to get her to accept help from her friends, they planned a girls night, she finally went out of the house, and according to them my girlfriend had a lot of fun. Things have been tough on her, but they're getting better.**

7,"Is it alright for me to get offended and upset with my bf over this? [3 years, 23 f, 24 m]


I'm a full time student and work part time so normally don't have enough time for myself to cook complicated, full meals. I make one pot dishes and eat a lot of salad and fruit as they're simple.

My boyfriend recently pointed out that my cooking skills are lacking and I need to upgrade there. He keeps asking me what I cook, if I even know how to cook a real meal, etc. What broke the straw was him telling me to cook something and bring the next time I meet his fmily so that he could introduce me as ""a complete package"" rather than just a ""smart"" girl.

I'm pissed off- I cook enough to survive and at this point being good at the kitchen is hardly my priority. Plus, I'm offended at the whole complete packgae thing. I brought it up and he says that his parents make fun of him saying that he'll be eating take out and instant food once he starts living with me (he lives with his parents) pplus he says that its important to him to eat good food made at home. BUT I CARE MORE ABOUT FINISHING MY THESIS THAN MAKE BECHAMEL SAUCE FROM SCRATCH.

8,"My friend [28/M] got upset with me [27/F] for breastfeeding my daughter [5days/F]


My SO and I welcomed our first child, a little girl, 5 days ago. She's eating like a total champ, and it's super impressive, but just a tad exhausting. We've had a revolving door of people coming by, quite a few unannounced or off-schedule, and sometimes, I just don't have the time to throw on the cover before they see me, because I don't cover when it's just me and my SO. I try to be really respectful, though. One of the ladies is always in the shirt, and the other is covered by the baby's head. Unless they say otherwise, I try to get a cover on as soon as possible. If I gotta switch sides, I turn away, provide warning, and try to be as modest as I can be. It's natural, it's feeding my baby, but I know not everyone is cool with seeing my rack and I don't expect everyone to be. I just try to be considerate when I can be.

A friend of mine that I've known for the past 5 years called, asking if he could come over today at about noon. I gave him the go ahead, and a bit before he was supposed to come over, my SO hopped in the shower. Our daughter was demanding to be fed, and so I went ahead and started to feed her. Of course, my friend got to our place early, and I didn't have a cover nearby. I figured that this guy has seen me much worse, so I went ahead and answered the door. I opened it just a crack, and warned him I was feeding. He was disgusted, and told me I ""might feel empowered, but it's just gross."" I said I was sorry, she would be done in a minute. I asked if he wanted to wait in the hall while I found a cover, and he said he'd just go. I apologized one more time, and he said he was just disgusted I thought it was appropriate to ""put nudity like that on display."" I was a little weirded out, but it was his choice to leave, so he left. I called him later, and he said he was sorry to get upset, but it was really disgusting and he asked what I would think if he had been the mailman. I responded that the mailman has seen me at a much worse state, and he got extremely upset and started yelling- saying that I'm a mother now, and I don't get to go flashing every man that comes knocking on the door. I guess what I'm here to ask is- is this guy still worthy to hang out with? Was I really being as gross and rude as he says I was? Am I a total ass for feeling like this was an unwarranted freak out?

TL;DR: My male friend got disgusted when I was breastfeeding my daughter."

10,"[UPDATE] Me (30m) with my wife (25f) have been going to Muay Thai (6 months) and noticed one specific trainer (mid to late 20s) that treats us poorly compared to other students. What should we do?


[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ucwxi/me_30m_with_my_wife_25f_have_been_going_to_muay/)

I took everyone's advice and spoke to one of the co-owners the following Saturday after class after I addressed the issue here on Reddit. We also didn't attend any classes at all until that Saturday.

He immediately apologized after we told him every incident we could think of. He refunded us this month's dues and waived next month's as well and told us he would immediately talk to the trainer because there's never been a situation like this with any of his trainers.

He's on his phone at this point texting who i'm assuming is the trainer and told us he's going to teach the class on Monday morning and that this guy is suspended from working/training till he figures out what happens.

When Monday morning rolls around, we see both the trainer and both owners talking in the office and one of the owners waves at my wife and I to come enter the office and he says that (trainer) admitted to treating us poorly and said there's no excuse for why he did it.

My wife and I agreed it was good enough for us and I told the owners that whatever punishment they were going to give him should just be let go since I thought as a trainer he was fine and told them if he wasn't punished then the entire issue would be resolved for us since a sincere apology was good enough for us.

The trainer's eyes really lit up and he looked surprised, but the owners were okay with our request and let him train that class.

After the warm-ups ended, he asked both of us to come to the front of the class and he told the class about how he wasn't being fair to us for a while and asked us to forgive him for his behavior and then he looked at the class asked them to forgive him for how he was acting as well.

After class, he came up to us and said he was grateful to us for giving him a chance to redeem himself and he said he isn't the kind of guy we have ingrained in our minds and wanted to prove it to us by offering to give us three free personal training lessons. Of course, we accepted. 

Everything is resolved and we saved $625 in the process. Thanks Reddit.

TL;DR: Told owner, owner talked to trainer, then talked to us and trainer apologized. We got a bunch of free stuff.

11,"Me [34F] with my [35F] friend who had a frightening, screaming meltdown at me this past Saturday (my birthday)


Hi everyone!  I have a job where I move a lot for work.  I've been in my current area for a few years.  Since I move a lot, I am constantly meeting/making new friends.  While I stay in touch with my older friends after I move, it's always a bit difficult to make in-person friends at first (especially the kind you can curl up on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, watching chick flicks).

I currently live in a major city where status/money/etc is important.  It isn't Miami, but think Miami.  That's made making friends even harder.

I finally met Kelly at a bar.  We got along really well and basically became inseparable.  We went on a few trips together, we do spa dates together, and we randomly drop by each others' places.  I'm giving you some back story to how our relationship has been because I think it's relevant to some of the things she ended up saying over the weekend.

I'm married and she's been dating different guys on and off.  A lot of times when we talk, she dominates the conversation.  She interrupts me when I'm telling her something to tell me something completely different pretty often.  I chalked that up to her being in the middle of dating and really needing to talk things out.  We're both extroverts, so I understood it (at least I thought so).  I talked about dating all the times to my friends when I was dating.

Sometimes when we go out, she does strange shows of wealth.  For example, I asked her to get happy hour, and while we were drinking $5 well cocktails, ordered shots of this $100 pp whiskey for the two of us.  She always pays the bill whenever she does this, but it's been a bit strange when our J. Roget nights suddenly become Dom Perignon nights.

Again, it's been strange to me and I've protested, but since she never asked me to cover her sudden spending binges, it hasn't kept me up at night.

Quick digression:  the last few Februarys have been very, very awful for me and my family.  My sister died a few years back and I spent my birthday holding her small children at the funeral.  My friend John died last year (one of my other friends I met in this area).  And those are just the bigger things.  There's been a lot of setbacks around my birthday and I haven't celebrated in really in the last decade.

Because of this, my husband wanted to do something bigger for me this year and talked to Kelly to get her on board.  They reached out to some of my friends and those who weren't too far away in the country agreed to come and celebrate my birthday with me.  This was incredibly sweet.

First, we went out to dinner with all my friends, which my brother had asked to cover ahead of time since he could not come out.  After dinner, Kelly got a little weird about my brother picking up the tab, even though she knew that ahead of time.  She started marching towards the manager to get him to pull her stuff off the bill.  I shook my head no at the manager, and he told her that everything was already taken care of.

During dinner, Kelly was interrupting guests a lot to talk about something different and to complain about an on-and-off boyfriend.  I was feeling kind of eye-rolly about it, since she wasn't letting them really have a full-on conversation without mentioning her dating life, but I didn't say anything or react to it.

We go to one of those fancy bowling alleys afterwards.  My husband had put his card down to pay for everyone's bowling, our own drinks, and some apps for the group.   He had told everyone ahead of time that they were on their own for drinks for this part of the evening.  

I had about two drinks, but with all the bowling fees / appetizers, we racked up a bill of about $300 that we were taking care of.  Kelly went ahead and secretly paid the $300 bill, which we didn't realize until we tried to close out.  I thanked her, but told her I was a little uncomfortable at that since *we* were planning on paying the bill and treating the group to the bowling/apps.

This is when it got really dark.  Our time at the lanes was up, so we were headed to another bar afterwards.  One of the girls in our group, Jillian, didn't realize our lanes were ending soon and had just gotten her second drink.

Jillian is in graduate school and doesn't get to go out much.  I am very much in a different place financially than I was 10 years back, so I know what it's like to spend money on drinks when you don't have too much money.  So I told Jillian to take her time, that we weren't in a rush, and we'll get to the next bar when we get there.

Kelly started saying, ""hurry up.  Chug it up.""  not directly to the girl but loud enough for her to hear.  I walked over to Kelly and told her that I told Jillian to take her time and not to rush her drink.

Kelly pointed at Jillian and yelled, ""That girl is so fucking rude!  She has a whole group of people waiting for her, just so she can finish her fucking drink?!  Just leave it on the bar.""

I got very quiet and said matter of factly that I wanted to stay in this bar until Jillian finished her drink.  Kelly completely loses it at this point.  She screams, ""I didn't pay $300 tonight so this fucking cunt can just do whatever she wants.  I want to leave and we are leaving.""

She storms out.  I signal for everyone to stay there and I follow her, even though I'm wtf-ing and am a little scared at this point.  (I had an abusive ex and it was starting to feel a little like some of those situations).

I am trying to stay as quiet and fact-based as possible when talking to Kelly.  I asked her to come back inside and reminded her that these people are here for my birthday too, and that I want everyone to have a good time.

She starts screaming random stuff at me, including terrible things about Jillian.  She calls her a cunt at least four more times.  And says she called an Uber home.

She also said some choice things about me.  I honestly don't remember everything, because my brain was super wtf-ing at this point, but the two items that stood out to me were, she said that I'm a fucking baby for thinking that I get my way on my birthday and that only children do that.  She brought up the $300 again, so I pulled money out of my wallet (which was more than $300, less than $400, though I don't know the exact amount) and put it in her hand.  I said, I appreciate the work that you did planning this..  That was nice of you.  You didn't have to take care of the bar bill, especially if you are going to hold that over us.  This is more than enough money.

Then she said, ""Without me, you have no friends.  No one likes you.  No one loves you.""

I said, ""actually, I have some friends to get back to"", and went inside.  We moved on to the next bar.  About 20 minutes into it, Kelly storms the bar screaming about how I left her to cry outside in the rain by herself.  I reminded her that she said she had called an Uber.  She said she couldn't believe I chose my other friends over her and I said, you have no right to call my friend a cunt.  

She got really angry at me, and screamed at me for letting my friend know she called her a cunt (even though... she originally screamed it so everyone in the bowling alley knew she said it).  Then she got this weird-psycho like proud gleam in her eyes and said, you know how you tried to pay for the bowling alley?  I threw that money in the trash.

I just responded with, ""okay Kelly, have a nice life."" and turned back to the group.

She went quiet and eventually walked out.  

Afterwards, I talked with the group, all wtfing over what had happened.  Someone suggested that she may have been black out drunk (she had mentioned drinking before meeting up with us), and that she probably wouldn't even remember that any of this happened.

On Sunday, my husband wrote Kelly an email basically asking her if she remembered what happened.  She hasn't responded yet.

I really don't know what to do.  This whole episode seriously frightened me, but I don't want to overreact to it if it's something strange that the wrong mood / too much alcohol sparked.

On the other hand, given her domineering nature / need to point out her status by dropping money left and right, I'm wondering if this is showing her true colors (or even some sort of psychological issue she has).

I felt like she didn't get her way for once and couldn't handle it.  I'm a pretty easy going person, and I don't have strong preferences until it involves friends (and I'm fiercely loyal).  

The amount of insults she just lobbed at me freaked me out too.  It's as if they were things she had always thought.

I also feel like since Jillian is ""poor,"" Kelly was offended that I let her get her own way since she didn't ""deserve to"".

I've spent the last two nights crying in a mix of frustration and embarrassment.  I really don't know how to move forward.  We had been doing everything together.  This almost feels like a romantic relationship breakup!  

I should note, since I don't have many local friends, this is the first time she's really hung out with my friends as a group.

Furthermore, the part the bothers me the most, honestly, is that she threw out over $300 in cash.  Jesus Christ, at least hand it to a homeless person!

Do I wait to see how she reacts or whether or not she reaches out, or take this night as a red flag?
  
  ---   

tl/dr:  My friend went absolute psycho at me when I let my other friend finish her drink at a bar before we left to crawl to the next bar.  Do you think this is was just a really bad night, or a huge red flag that I should stay away from this person?  (And bonus question, how should I proceed?)

15,"How to tell my extremely religious neighbor [30+F] that I'm [24M] not interested in going to their church or ""following their gospel""?


Alright, so I just moved into an apartment and finally met one of my neighbors.. Who is extremely religious. The first time I introduced myself to her, she was trying to recruit me to her church. I didn't boldly say no at the time, but more so just kind of went along with what she was saying (not agreeing with anything, though) until I could steer the conversation away from church.

I am not a religious person, nor do I want to be. 

Today when I returned home and had my girlfriend with me. She ran over and said ""Hey!"" and introduced herself to my girlfriend, and started the same pitch over again. In the past, when I have told people that I'm not religious, they seem to take it as a ""Oh, let me convert you!"" opportunity. Additionally, I worry that someone that is *this* religious will not like to hear when I say ""I'm sorry, I'm really not religious, I am not interested. Thank you though."" I don't want to put myself on bad terms with any neighbors, let alone be viewed as though I'm the antichrist or something...

How can I most neutrally and politely tell her to stop trying to push her religious views on me. It's getting bothersome at this point, and she is super sweet, so I don't want to tell her to just get stuffed.

Thank you for your time. I appreciate any advice and/or similar stories with how you dealt with a situation like this.

**EDIT**: Thank you all for your advice, I really do appreciate you taking the time to read my situation and offer me your input.

I run into this neighbor every once in a while; with that said, the time that it takes for me to provide an update may be longer than expected. However, I will report back to let you all know how I went about handling it, and her response as well.

16,"My wife's [26F] grandfather gave us his heirloom baby grand piano as a wedding gift. I was incredibly honored to receive it, but now it's a burden. What should I do?


My wife's grandfather (we'll call him J) was a judge/lawyer by trade, but was also a semi-professional composer. He had a piano dated to the year 1890 that was his most precious possession. It has this huge crazy backstory of the famous people it has changed hands from until he picked it up in an auction (No way to confirm this, but it's a fun family story). He spent a bunch of money 40 years ago tracking down the original manufacturers and having the piano totally rebuilt.

J, for whatever reason, REALLY likes me. Whenever I visit he's always showing me his instruments and what he's working on that day. I'm a hobby pianist (but I'm not very good) and I've played for him a few times.

 For our wedding he surprised us by asking if we'd like to have his piano. He was moving to his vacation home full-time and just didn't have room for it, but wanted to make sure it would be taken by someone who would treasure it the way he did. 

I unfortunately got a TON of shade from 2 of my wife's uncles (J's sons) who did not appreciate that they weren't getting the piano. Which I understand - I'm only barely family. They would have loud whispers that they would make sure I overheard, like ""Wow, HE's getting the piano?"". One of them approached me and said ""If you decide you don't want to take the piano, just let me know. It really should be back in the family.""

I was super honored to have him ask me to take the piano. My wife and I said yes. I had it moved in to our place (rental home) and set up a very generous tuning schedule - I'm having it tuned every 5 months.

The thing is, the piano is getting worse and worse faster and faster. It won't hold a tune for more than 2 weeks now, so it's unplayable 95% of the time. The hammers get stuck and the keys are misaligned. The tuner informed me that the ""rebuilding"" that J had done all those years ago was actually very poor quality, and now the piano is suffering for it. He also assessed it and said that having the piano rebuilt would be twice the cost of a new GOOD piano, and this was never a GOOD piano in the first place.

Now of course the value in this piano is the sentiment and the heirloom status, but it's quickly looking like I'm going to be stuck with a sentimental piece of junk for the rest of my life. I was kind of fine with that until I found out that my wife and I might have to move into a much smaller place to make ends meet before we're ready to buy a house a few years down the road. A place that wouldn't have room for a piano at all.

So what do I do?

Put it in storage for now and just keep it forever? Let one of the uncles know they can have it if they want it? That risks offending J, and also looks kind of bad since as far as everyone knows it was in good condition before I took it, and now it's unplayable. Go into debt paying to have it rebuilt? Ask J if he wants to pay to rebuild it again? That would be pretty rude I think, since it was a gift.

---
EDIT: Several people rightly pointed out that I was very self-centered in my post, and didn't mention my wife's opinions or wants here. That was dumb of me. To clarify a little, my wife feels the same as I do in this matter. And the reason I was referring to it as a gift to ""me"" is because that's how J framed it. I'm the pianist, so he was choosing me, an in-law, over his sons. My wife said since it was mostly a gift to me and I'm the one who plays, she wanted to leave it up to me what happened with it. That's why I was phrasing it as ""what do I do?"". I hope that makes sense.

17,"(update!) My girlfriend [29F] introduced me to her son [13M] and I don't know if I want to parent him


[Here’s the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7h3k1u/my_girlfriend_29f_introduced_me_to_her_son_13m/?st=jarmpiqr&amp;sh=0dc1d090)

I’m surprised I remembered the password to this account, but I’m back! I just thought that with all the help and kindness I received, why not update?

I’m still with Emily. I went forward with the idea that Emily and her son are a package deal in mind, and it’s been kind of a weird process since. We get along really well, and I’ve found that I’m lucky to have this kid in my life. He’s funny, mature, intelligent, witty. But at the same time, he’s *not* my kid and he never will be and that’s something hard to navigate. It’s hard even to describe the feeling- of loving this kid and feeling like a dad, but never being one and feeling like you can’t be one. But I try. It’s a lot of blood, sweat and tears (Emily can testify to the tears), but it’s so worth it. A few weeks after I found out about him, Emily told me her son was getting picked on because he didn’t have a dad to do a father son activity at school with. I decided to go, sort of just to scope out how that sort of thing felt. The look on his face got rid of every question I’ve had, every doubt or regret.

Emily and I are in counseling. We found out shortly after I posted that Emily is pregnant- and we’re twice blessed in that it’s twin girls. There were a lot of emotions, and we both knew that it was a weird situation and we haven’t been dating that long. So, we went to see a counselor. Sometimes Emily’s son joins us, but it’s mostly us, learning how to be our best for her son and our daughters, and each other. We’ve been definitely testing each other some days, and this pregnancy has put a strain on every relationship we have. Her son moved in, and they’re stepping on each other’s toes. I moved in, and we’re all learning our new boundaries and new bonds.

It’s hard. There’s a lot of stupid mistakes I regret making now, that I’ll regret more in 5 years. If I had s time machine and my current knowledge, I might’ve been more careful during sex. I might’ve put distance where I didn’t. But for right now, I’m happy to be with my girlfriend and her son, waiting for our little Amelia and Lorelei. This is teaching me how to be a good dad, a good partner, and a good human. I’m learning coping skills for so many things in life, and I’m just learning how to be okay. This is a situation a lot of people would shake their heads at and say “poor guy”, but I’m really blessed. I’m really thankful.

Thanks for helping me out, everyone.

TL;DR: Emily and I are still together, raising her son and expecting twins ourselves. "

19,"My[34M] parents will not back off to see their new granddaughter after my wife (34F) had a difficult c section.


I've already had a bit of a discussion in another subreddit about my performance as a new parent.

To say it the best way, I've been lacking.  Right now, I'm getting pulled apart by the fact that I can't get my parents to back off.  

Me and my wife were very clear about needing 4 weeks especially in the case of a c section.  We reiterated it and now my parents are nearly beating down my door to see their grandchild.

My father has already threatened me with coming here, and I've told him that we aren't going to let them in.  Then he's gone as far as threatening with not helping if I ask.

I don't know how to navigate this.

My wife has been trying to feel better and went so far as to offer to have dinner on Sunday with them so they can see the kid.(granted she's not happy about any of this and would rather people respect her wishes, including me.)

TL;DR: My wife wanted 4 weeks to recover from a c section and my parents aren't letting her.

Not sure what other information I may need to include, please excuse me if I gloss over or missed something relevant.  Ask any questions you may need.  I'm 15 days in as a new dad, and the days blur together.

Edit: thank you all for your advice and perspectives. Every person hopefully got an upvote from me. I did not come here to be agreed with or trashed. I'm getting a great amount of input. And I am grateful for the information.

Some additional points of info that seems to clarify:

The grandparents have seen the child at the hospital and came back to visit while we were waiting to be cleared to go home. We Skyped and video chatted a few times to hopefully make people feel involved.

My mother in law did come over in an emergency situation (we needed some sleep and it did not go well. We were too raw and everyone left irritated.)

My wife's pregnancy was considered high risk. She is diabetic and had symptoms of pre-eclampsia. She had to be induced. That failed and led to a c section.

We live in a 1 bedroom apartment. And only in the last few days has she been able to sleep in bed. Previously she was confined to a recliner in the living room because she couldn't move very well."

21,"[UPDATE] I [23F] broke up with my ex [22M] because his dad [45M] is a raging racist


Hi, all. It's been a year since I made [this post.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5kcenj/my_22f_boyfriends_20m_father_44m_has_been_making/) Obviously, as the title states, he is now my ex. I am thankful for all the straightforward comments that most of you made on that thread because it really catapulted me into action. **This is gonna be a long post, so I have a tl;dr version at the bottom.** Since that post, I ended up writing the letter that I said I was going to write. I still have that letter to serve as a reminder of how much ""compromise"" I had to make at one point because I thought I wasn't worth it. The letter disparaged the racist dad, to the point where he called his son and screamed about how I was a terrorist!


Fast forward to a couple of months later, I was weeks from graduating from college and found out my aunt, who was basically my second mother, was dying of her second battle of breast cancer. It was too late for her to find out because at that point, her cancer had already spread through her lymph nodes.  Four weeks after, she passed away in her sleep, and I was spiraling into depression. At this time, I broke up with my ex, saying that we were both young, and there is always room to change for the both of us. If it doesn't work out now, it may work out years down the road. He didn't fight it much, and he pretended like nothing happened until, three days later, he drank a half bottle of vodka straight and told me he was contemplating suicide.


Growing up, my mother always guilt tripped me with suicidal threats, but I grew accustomed to it; however, this was a different person, and I was in a vulnerable state of mind. I ran out of the apartment (we were living together), and I went to one of my best friend's place in a panic because I didn't know what to do. He said we should call suicide hotline and ask them for the best course of action. The operator said that we should start by doing a wellness check on him, since at that point it had been almost an hour since I left him alone. I called the police to do a wellness check, and I told our roommate to keep an eye on my ex. When the police came, my ex was in our room, crying, and they talked briefly before he asked the police to take him for immediate professional help.


Long story short, my ex went to a mental rehab place, where his parents, sister, and cousins blamed me for causing him to want to die and terrorized me over Facebook and text messages for days. When he got out, I stupidly listened to his doctor's advice to continue living with him because he was suffering from maladaptive personality. So we got another apartment lease together, and I went back to my home country to clear my mind.


When I visited my parents, I told my dad everything, and one thing he told me that made me feel good about my decision to leave was: You might not see it, but you are worth so much. Don't let other people tell you they love you if they can't do anything for you because love is sacrifice.  Just days after arriving, my best friend (now boyfriend) flew from Korea to visit me back home to give moral support, and I was beginning to climb up from the hole that depression dug me into.


I came back to the US with a better state of mind. I got a job and was beginning to feel more like myself until my ex (remember when I said I made the stupid decision to continue living with him?) started sexually assaulting me and pretending like he never did. He also would berate me about having sex every day, literally every other message was, ""Can we do something dirty tonight? I wanna fuck you on the balcony."" Luckily, our apartment complex let me out of the lease early and penalty-free after three months because I couldn't handle it anymore.


Fast forward to today, I bought a condo, got into grad school for a chemistry PhD program, and I am in a super healthy (but long distance :'(  ) relationship with a man who loves me and is willing to cross oceans for me (he's visiting again in April!) because he said I'm worth it.


Sorry for the long-ass wall of text, but I just wanted to express my gratitude to everyone who shamed me enough into leaving the POS :D


tl;dr: Left my spineless ex and his raging racist of a dad, life took a turn for the worse, fixed everything, and now I am a homeowner, working on her PhD, and am with a man who thinks the world of me."

23,"Update: Psycho Marriage Counselor Lied to Us (31f/35m)


So this is an update more than... Three years later? I hope this is allowed. I used a throwaway and don't remember my password. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25m8vh/me_27f_with_my_husband_31m_marriage_counselor/ 


A lot happened since then and it occurred to me that maybe I should post an update in case anyone here was around for that. 


Summary: I was the wife who was seeing a marriage counselor with my husband. Both jointly and individually. Things were only getting worse and worse and it was only after a blow up fight that my husband and I compared notes and realized the counselor had been feeding each of us lies. 


Counselor was telling me that my husband was emotionally 12 years old and would never be capable of a relationship (while reassuring my husband all was well with him). Meanwhile, he was telling my husband I had borderline personality disorder and needed medication. 


When my husband started accusing me of being mentally ill, I brought this up to the counselor who then began making fun of my husband for saying such a thing (""Does he think he's a psychiatrist or something?"" He actually laughed.) Counselor reassured me that I was a ""beautiful and intelligent woman"" and would do great once I left my husband. 


The counselor (who was provided by the military through their family services) ended up being transferred a few weeks after we discovered this. We couldn't figure out if he got canned for abusing some other couple, if he retired, or some other shenanigan. 



Well. Fast forward to today. My husband and I are doing great now. We went on a vacation, both of us changed jobs, moved, and we are very happily married now four years later. We travel, adopted a couple of kitties, and bought a house in a place we both love. 


How we got here: We both read some self-help books. Started giving each other the benefit of the doubt. Got better at communicating. I left my super high stress job, he changed careers, and everything sort of did a 180. (Funny enough. My old job had been killing me and when I'd mentioned to counselor that I thought maybe I should find another job, since it was so dysfunctional, he protested against it.)


My husband and I did not report him at the time. We were concerned he would retaliate against my husband in some way, as my husband was in the armed forces for a year and a half after all this.  I am embarrassed that we did not report him. We were scared and overwhelmed. I am considering calling that base's family services now and filing an official report. Not sure if it'll matter, so much time has passed. 


That's... That's all really. You all were such a great help then, I thought I might as well post this in case anyone around here remembered. 


 PS. I thought to post this after we watched an M Night Shyamalan movie recently. One of the commenters had mentioned this sounded like a film he'd make. :) I still laugh at that comment years later, so thank you U/brandon23z and u/acheronshunt for that.

24,"[Update] My (29/F) ex's (35/M) new girlfriend (33/F) hates me and is becoming a little scary.


Well its been 6 months and so I think an update to my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6w1ihq/my_29f_exs_35m_new_girlfriend_33f_hates_me_and_is/) is in order. 

&amp;nbsp;

You were all correct, they were cheating. She was cheating on her husband, and my ex was cheating on me. For MONTHS evidently. He would go to her office on his lunches and do her on her desk, she would blow him in his car in the gym parking lot, he would sneak her into my house while I was asleep and mess around with her. Super cool. I'm more just grossed out than hurt. Like... we didn't stop being sexually active until about 2 weeks after the breakup (he had told me at one point he still loved me and had just gotten confused and wanted to work on it). So he was sleeping with her at the same time. Ick! So since I just found out I have made an appointment to get checked. Lovely. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I found out I texted him and told him I didn't want to speak to him anymore and even though I love her like my own, I can't see his daughter anymore. I don't want my kid around him and I don't think I can see him without wanting to hit him. I also def lost my temper after finding out and said some very not nice things about their life choices... whoops. Anyways, I am in the process of cutting the last couple ties to him.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, he met his GF at our gym. We all still go there. I have been going there for years and we all go at different times so its never been an issue. I literally haven't run in to either of them at the gym since we broke up 10 months ago. Well about a week after I found everything out, I'm at the gym and his girl comes at me. Like, she is trying hard to start something. Screaming and causing a scene, getting in my face. I just ignore her and keep doing my cardio. The owner eventually came and kicked her out. Lets just say, she doesn't go to my gym anymore, and I am in the process of filing a cease and desist for harassment. So yea..... That's about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks to the sweet people who were helpful and understanding of my situation 6 months ago. I was in a sad place and just really needed people who weren't involved in the situation.

25,"My [31M] fiancé [30F] has asked me to whiten my broken smile before our wedding and I don’t know if I should.


Throwaway because my fiancé uses reddit.

I love my fiancé, let’s call her Lucy, she is beautiful, kind and intelligent - pretty much all I’ve ever wanted from a woman.

We have been together for 6 years, friends for 3 years before that. I couldn’t imagine spending my life with anyone else, so I proposed in January and she made me the happiest guy ever by saying yes.

But yesterday Lucy asked me if I could do just one “small” thing before the wedding, whiten my teeth.

You see, when I was a teenager I fell and hit my face on a curb, a couple of my front teeth were broken. My dentist managed to “save” them, in the sense that I still have my original teeth, but they no longer have nerves and darkened a fair bit afterwards. 

I’m not going to lie and say that I love the fact that my teeth have darkened, for photos I tend to keep my mouth closed, but they have become a part of who I am now (16 years later) and I’ve always thought that if someone can’t accept me the way I am then screw them.
But I love her, and I want to make her happy.

I should add that this is not new. Lucy has brought the subject up before and I’ve always point blank refused, I gave excuses about money or said that I couldn’t understand why she didn’t just accept it. It’s been a while since it was last brought up though.

And, as I said, we were friends before we got together and I knew her type always had dazzling smiles of pearly whites, and she has always prided herself on her own smile.

Lucy thinks it will do me good, that if I got it done then I’d like it and wonder why I hadn’t done it sooner. I probably would like it, but the procedure isn’t guaranteed to last and I may need to have it done again in a couple of years. And also I may hate it, I might feel like I’d given up on or lost something.

She hasn’t threatened to break up with me or anything like that, the wedding will still go on, but I can’t decide whether or not to do it. Our finances are better now and it’s a small drop in the ocean compared to wedding costs, but I still feel like she shouldn’t ask me to do this. I thought she’d get over it.

Am I just being stubborn? Or would I be giving up a fundamental part of myself? 

TL;DR my fiancé has asked if I would whiten my teeth before the wedding, which are quite dark because of an accident in my teens, but I don’t know if I want to."
26,"I [25F] don’t want my future MIL [50F] to come wedding dress shopping with me.


Don’t get me wrong—I love my future MIL. In many ways, she’s more of a mother to me than my own mother is. She raised an incredible man who makes my life an absolute dream, and we’re coming up with a way to appropriately honor her on our big day.

But she and I don’t share the same values when it comes to fashion and beauty. She only buys secondhand clothes, doesn’t wear makeup, and is passive aggressive about my clothes by always suggesting I go to Goodwill. It’s not just me, either—she frequently calls her own daughter’s style “ridiculous” and is also constantly suggesting Goodwill to her. She thinks the beauty industry is shallow and damaging to women. I don’t entirely disagree, but I do like to indulge in feeling pretty. I plan to feel absolutely beautiful on my wedding day.

My parents and sister are flying in to go wedding dress shopping with me, which is something I’ve dreamed about for years. I loved shopping with them for my sister’s wedding dress and thought it was a lot of fun and really special to indulge in all of the frivolousness. Idk, it was just fun bonding and I’m ready for it again.

I never planned on having MIL there simply because I didn’t think she would care, but she’s made a comment about wanting to have a hand in planning since she and her husband are paying for our rehearsal dinner (as is tradition). She’s already asked where I want to book appointments and has said she can take the day off. So it seems like she wants to be a part of my trying on dresses. However, I’m really worried that she will vocalize her disapproval of my style and make rude and tacky comments about prices or the wedding industry in general to the stylists. There is also some enmity between her and my parents because they clash politically and religiously, and I know my dad likely won’t hold back if she makes passive aggressive or outright rude comments to me.

Basically, I’m just worried I won’t get that family experience I've always wanted if she comes. Is there a way to politely say this is a family-only thing? Or is that out the window now that’s she’s a part of my family, too?

TLDR: My future MIL thinks that beauty and fashion are shallow and I’m worried she’ll ruin my experience trying on wedding dresses and that she’ll cause drama with my family."
27,"Me [16 F] with my sister [22 F] keeps asking me to babysit, and she's been getting mean about it, but I feel guilty saying no. She told me last Friday ""what could YOU possible have to do on a Friday night??""


My sister and I were never close when I was younger. She was always a lot cooler than me and had a lot of friends and a great social life and she moved out when I was 11. We weren't close, I was always the lame younger sister.

My nephew spends a lot of time over at my house and I'm usually the one who takes care of him because the adults are busy and I try to engage him. I love him but I do get exhausted since he is here most days and he comes straight to my room and wants to spend the entire afternoon with me. I feel guilty if I don't step up and take care of him.

Anyway my sister started calling me up after she had a baby and I thought it was her maturing but a lot (or most) of the time it is to babysit, and I usually do. My nephew is 3 now. Last Friday I'd had a really stressful couple of weeks at school and had just finished my exams, and I was spending the night with my parents watching tv because I don't have any friends. So my sister messages me asking to babysit and I tell her I can't, that I'm busy. She gets all aggressive on me being like, what could **you** possibly have planned??? Was the general tone. So I got pissed at her and actually blocked her. It was a long conversation where she was basically insulting me the entire time. It was just a Friday and I didn't want to spend it on her couch, partly because she says she'll be home before 1am but she's always out until 4 or 5am at least.

She also started inviting me for dinner and I was really excited about it, she had two of her friends there too. Then at the end of the dinner she was like so we were thinking of going to see a movie! I was like awesome what movie! She starts telling me about the movie and I'm really into it and then she's like ""so if you could stay behind and babysit that would be so great..."" So I felt like the only reason she invited me was so they could go to the movies after. I felt like I was put on the spot and had to say yes because she'd just cooked me up a dinner. I mean that is a really nice thing to do. It'd be different if she'd told me beforehand? Or am I being a brat. This has happened twice now.

I don't feel good about the situation and I don't know what to do because I just end up feeling guilty if I don't help because she's a single mom and going through a hard time. What would you do?

28,"[UPDATE]: I [38F] saw texts between boyfriend [44M] of seven years and woman he works with [28/29F]. I confronted him.


[Link to original post:]  (https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7xp83a/i_38f_think_my_workaholic_boyfriend_44m_of_seven/)

**EDITS at the bottom**

Well, fuck.  Shit hit the fan.  We were were having dinner and stuck to mostly small talk.  That's all I could really do and he seemed comfortable staying in the small talk zone as well.  I was going to gently broach the topic (our relationship) when we were done eating.  The whole time, both our phones were on the table.  He received a text from his mother, replied and then went to the bathroom leaving his phone unlocked.  I have never done this before but I couldn't stop myself.  I took his phone and went into his messages.  I found her name and clicked.  My hands were literally shaking.  I quickly scrolled up and saw what must have been hundreds of messages.   I didn't have time to read them all so I just skimmed and then read the most recent ones, quickly.  


They were not explicit.  But they weren't good.  I took a few photos of recent messages with my my own phone.  By this time my hand were shaking so bad that I almost dropped his phone.  In the messages, he had told her about an issue (non relationship related, non-person related) that he had had.  I will refer to this as [issue] in the following... Here is the exact transcript of the texts I photographed:


**Him:** I have no idea how [issue] stands.  It's really intense, I am nervous and scared.


**Her:** I hope everything with [issue] is ok... It should be, right? :) I wish I could give you a hug! 


**Him:** Ohhh I wish that too.  Looking forward but scared about [issue].  Hugs are always so soothing :) Thank you.


**Her:** Yes they are!  Let's finish [project] and there can be many hugs.  Let me know when you find out if [issue] is ok please :)


**Him:** Lol we must finish!! . I can't wait.  Let's FaceTime tomorrow? 


**Her:** Yes!! :)


And a little later, there were some more texts about some family member's ""party"" she was apparently at.  He asked her a lot about it and how it was going and he wished her family member a happy birthday from him.


I also caught many texts of him saying goodnight and good morning to her.  And I saw one where he said ""good morning, darling"" to her.  Felt like a dagger through the heart.  I knew he was somewhat enamored by her but I didn't realize the extent... From the looks of the texts, it seemed to be mutual as well but at that point I wasn't sure.  All this time I thought that if he was unfaithful, cheating with sex would be bad, but love would be somehow worse.


The rest of the dinner was, as you can imagine, awful.  He asked me what was wrong a few times.  I told him I didn't feel well.  Went home right after and just cried in the dark.  After a few hours, he texted to ask if I was feeling ok and I told him I was ill.  My thought process for a few hours was: Will decide how to proceed with this after things sink in further.  All I knew was that my heart hurt like never before.  


I wasn't sure if I even wanted to officially break up in person.  I thought I might just text or call.  I didn't know if I could stomach the sight of him.  But after a couple of hours I knew I deserved to lay it on him.  So I told him to come over because it was urgent.  He was in the middle of working but he came since I said it was urgent.


**Confrontation:** And then I laid into him.  I asked what the deal was between him and the girl.  He seemed shocked when it finally clicked that THIS was the emergency I spoke of.  He beat around the bush and wasn't answering my questions.  I asked him why he was so intent on working with her.  He gave me the same bullshit excuses of her being talented, etc. etc.  I asked him if he saw her as just a friend and he clammed up.  I said, ""stop trying to protect my feelings, I want to hear the truth no matter how bad it is.  You owe me this."" 


That seemed to shake him up a little bit.  He admitted that he viewed her as more than a friend.  I asked him to elaborate.  He said he misses her, they spent 12+ hours a day together in the US over the summer and did everything together, were super compatible in terms of lifestyle, clicked extremely well.  I was shocked.  12 fucking hours a day... I asked him why he didn't tell me this sooner.  He said because he didn't think it meant anything at the time and he didn't want to hurt me.  I asked if he fucked her.  He was adamant that there was no physical cheating and he swore that he didn't sleep with her.  


I remember that a few times when I had called him during this time, he declined my calls and said he was ""working."" Now I'm wondering exactly what he was doing with her to make him cut my calls.  He says there was no sex and swore up and down that he'd never go that far.  I think what he's admitting to is just as bad though, or worse.  Isn't it?


I asked him to explain this ridiculous behavior.  He said that we've been together for so long, and that he knew his feelings for her were wrong and that he tried really hard to stop liking her, but since they were working together (with signed contracts), they were always together and he couldn't help his feelings.  He said they both like all the same things, both like to stay up super late, connect over music (they are both musicians) and are really close emotionally. He said that he felt a responsibility and an obligation to try to work through our issues but he just couldn't stop his feelings.  He said it's been a daily struggle and that he has tried to do the ""right thing"" but wasn't able to get over her, even when she was far away.


I was fuming.  I asked him what made him think that his feelings are reciprocated??!  Does she feel the same?  And that's when I found out that she actually has feelings for him and somehow it ended up coming out when they were working together.  She admitted to him that she had feelings even when she knew he had a girlfriend.  Apparently she ""couldn't help it"" either, and while he claims neither of them crossed the line physically, and he claims she is too good of a person to do that.  I asked if they will start dating now and he said ""I don't know."" He said ""I don't know"" to basically everything else.  I am basically destroyed after hearing this.  He apologized repeatedly and clearly felt bad but his guilt isn't making up for any of this.


I know now that my relationship has been over for months I just didn't see it.


I can barely type this.  I am in tears and I feel devastated.  I know I will be ok in time but right now this is just too much to bear.  The man I gave 7 fucking years to is doing this to me.  He has been outright cheating with her at the very least, emotionally.  If not physically as well.  And she knew he had a girlfriend.  They are both disgusting and deserve each other.  How will I explain to my child that the man considered a close, quasi parental figure that has dated me for more than 7 years has basically betrayed us by engaging with someone else?  How can I let my child see me this way? I'm a complete mess.  This is a conversation I'm dreading.  


I guess it wasn't until I really put this all in writing and posted it here that reality sunk in for me.  And after what I just read, I am so wrecked beyond belief.


Thanks for reading.  Sorry for any gaps or bad writing, I'm just in shock.  And I can't believe how quickly this all happened.  I just want to sleep and wake up from this nightmare.


**EDIT 1: I will get back to everyone as soon as I can.  Thank you for reading :) **

**[UPDATE] -  TL/DR: I saw texts on his phone between them.  Evidence of emotional cheating/some kind of relationship between them.  Confronted him. He stonewalled me for the most part but he eventually admitted feelings for her.  I feel like my life is over.**"

30,"[UPDATE] How can I (25F), as a nanny, phrase to my bosses (40s F/M) that I am quitting when I promised them 1 year?


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ysohf/how_can_i_25f_as_a_nanny_phrase_to_my_bosses_40s/

Hello again! I posted a few days ago about leaving my job, and I was surprised at how much attention my post had received. I was expecting one or two responses, max.

Anyway, I did talk to the mom two nights ago. I waited until her work was over (I work based on her hours, not the dad's, but I also feel more comfortable talking to her). I took the advice of a lot of people on the original post and was just completely honest. I told her that I was moving to Florida and that I planned to break up with my SO, and that I really wished I could stay for the family, but that everything outside of work was not enjoyable (which is all true). Her response was, as expected, surprised but understanding. She DID immediately say, ""Well, I know [her friend] knows someone whose been looking.... I'll ask her..."" so she went straight into damage control mode. She also thanked me for giving her so much notice (1 month).

I did tell her that I could train or write something up for the next nanny, which she didn't really respond to (I think she was still trying to figure out who to ask to be the new nanny), but I did get it out there. One of my favorite parts was when I asked her not to mention anything to SO if she saw him out and about (we live less than 5 minutes away so it's possible) and she just looked at me and said ""Why would I EVER tell him?"" It was great.

To the more negative side, at least for me, yesterday after work I stuck around and ate dinner with them, then ... I had sort of a mini breakdown. I know it was totally unprofessional and not okay. But I ended up crying a bit and the mom took me to the front porch and calmed me down. I was crying because I realized, I did NOT want to go home. At all. I was making up any reason to stay. And I told her that as well, and she actually offered to me to stay on their couch if I felt I needed it! What a wonderful woman.

So overall, even though I acted like an idiot and definitely will not use them as a job reference (haha), I would give them an A+ on being decent human beings and helping me out.

TL;DR: Long story short, my boss is an incredible person and would literally let me sleep on their couch if I needed it, despite having 4 children with special needs and a demanding job. I personally made a fool of myself, but I am okay with it."
31,"My husband (37M) and I (36F) are disagreeing about pornography. Am I a prude or is this creepy?


A married couple(41M, 37F) that me (36F) and my husband(37M) know is having a rough time. Because of this couple's struggles, I'm learning about some things I didn't know before. 

The male friend of the couple is cheating. He recently sent my husband a bunch of nude women snaps, including a naked snap of the woman he's cheating with. I'm creeped out. I think it's inappropriate men of this age to share porn or sexting snaps. 

My husband says 100% of men do this. And that I’m acting like I’m “on a high horse” and “out of touch.” I’m not against nudity or pornography, I just don’t understand why grown men are sharing it with each other, especially the mistress. I'd prefer my husband went online to find his own pics or vids. Am I a prude? 

Do 100% of men share porn instead of having their own stash? Do 100% of men share sexting snaps with their friends? Is the Male Friend a creep? Thanks for any feedback.

tldr: Husband gets porn messaged to him by friends. He says every guys does this. I think it’s weird at this age (near 40). I’d rather he find his own porn on his own. He’s angry with me and calling me a prude.  Am I as naive as he says I am?

UPDATE: Thanks for the responses!! Want to clarify that in addition to the images of the friend's lover/mistress, Porn gifs were sent of ""professionals."" Husband says the ""professional"" gifs and images are constantly shared by 100% of men."

33,"Should I [23 F] date him [24 M] again after this very strange date?


Hi, y'all!

So this is the situation, and I could use some advice. I am 23 years old, getting my PhD in Engineering, and I met a 24 year old through Tinder.

I opened a Tinder account which only lasted for about 12 hours because I am too paranoid and got some strange messages. But I received a message from this guy, let's call him John. He looked really attractive in his profile pictures, is also an engineer (working), and we had a common background as we come from similar countries (I am from Venezuela, he is from Ecuador).

He was the only message I replied to, because I felt like we had a lot in common. We exchanged a couple of messages through the app, he seemed very nice and funny, and then we started to chat through Whatsapp. About two weeks later (talking almost everyday throughout the day) we decided to go on a date. However, since I had never met him in person and we do not have any common friends, I decided to look for his profiles on Instagram/Facebook/etc, only to discover he didn't have any. The only social network through which we connected was Snapchat, which as you guys know does not give any type of info about the person and we don't necessarily see his face. Other than that, he basically did not exist.

Since this seemed a bit off for me, I kept on postponing our date until one day I finally decided I should just go ahead and meet him. I asked him where he thought we should meet, to which he replied ""come over to my house, and we can walk to a restaurant from here"", to which I specifically replied no, let's meet at a restaurant.

We decided on a restaurant and he gave me the address, which I blindly (my mistake) copied and pasted on the Uber app. To my surprise, when my driver indicates we have arrived, we are downtown (near the restaurants area) but at an apartment complex, where I see John waiting at the gate. At first I thought WHAT, but then I figured it must have been a misunderstanding, and he was standing there on the street so - what could happen, right? and got out of the car. Basically one of the first things he said was that before we walked to a restaurant, he needed to go back to his apartment to ""turn off the lights and get a jacket"", and insisted I come with him. I basically gave in and went upstairs with him (there were people in the hallways) until we reached his doors. He insisted over and over again that I come in, and I said no and stayed outside. He finally grabbed his jacket and we left.

After that happened, we had a really nice time, talked a lot, went first for a glass of wine and then for dinner. Talked about our lives and lots of things, and all ideas of him being suspicious had left my mind, until this happened: I was having a beer and had less than two sips left when I decided to go to the bathroom. I have always been careful of spiked drinks so, even though he now seemed perfectly normal to me, I wouldn't finish the beer once I came back because I had left it alone with him. When I got back from the bathroom, he almost immediately grabbed my beer, handed it to me and said ""you should finish it"". This seemed really strange to me, became paranoid again, and decided I should go home. I very politely said I had a nice time and was going to call an Uber to go home, when he insisted over and over again that I should finish my beer, we should go together to his apartment and I should get my Uber from there. I politely refused, called my Uber and got home safely.

We have talked again via Whatsapp, and he has asked to meet again, but I still have this instinct not to go out with him because he doesn't quite add up - particularly because we know absolutely no one in common and he doesn't seem to exist online.

So, do you think his behavior was actually suspicious (as in he wanted to hurt me or worse), he was just trying to get laid with me on that date (consensual), or his behavior was perfectly normal?

I must mention that this was my first Tinder date - so my paranoia instincts may have been a bit over the top.

**TL;DR; : Met a guy online and have no information on him whatsoever except what he has told me and no friends in common. Had a normal date with some strange moments. My instinct tells me not to date him again, am I being paranoid?**."
34,"My [22F] roommate [20M] just threw out my food because he wanted to use the container.


To say I'm livid is an understatement. This morning I made rice for sushi/onigiri and put it in the fridge. I used it at lunch, and I was going to make dinner with it just now and went to the kitchen to find my roommate using the container. 


I asked where my rice was. He says he threw it out because he wanted to use the container! Not because he thought it was off, or for some other reason that it was inedible. Just threw it out.


I don't make a lot of money. I certainly do NOT waste food either, and this was literally throwing money in the rubbish for no good reason. He just threw out my dinner, and tomorrow's lunch and dinner. 


I'm so pissed. I yelled at him, asked what was wrong with him and why would he even do that, and he didn't even apologize. Just looked offended that I was even mad in the first place.

Not sure where to go from here or how to address this when I see him again. I'm hungry, angry and upset. 

For clarification, the container wasn't even his. It's mine.

35,"I [26F] was diagnosed with Plasmablastic Lymphoma and my boyfriend [27M] of 4 years has turned to his childhood friend for solace.


[[Throwaway account as I'm worried about this getting back to him.]] 

Hi all, for the purpose of this my name is Daisy. I'm 26 and on the 7th of this month, I was diagnosed with Plasmablastic Lymphoma, stage 4 &amp; HIV Neg. The initial prognosis is poor and I'm expecting only a couple of months at best. 

My partner (for all intents and purposes we'll call him Jamie) has been completely inconsolable since I found out. I've tried my best to be strong for him and appear as close to my old self as possible. Though, this is a difficult task given the treatment is making me insanely tired and he doesn't feel comfortable undressing me or even touching me in such a way which makes even holding hands troublesome. 

A week or so after my diagnosis he reached out to his childhood friend, we'll call her Cynthia. She's not been around since the start of our relationship. She's one of those people who ducks in and out of your life because it's easier than maintaining a day-to-day friendship. My best friend thought it was weird at first and has planted mini seeds of doubt in my head, especially since she lives a few doors down from Jamie and has seen Cynthia leaving his house on occasion where he tells me he's too tired to see me, and doesn't want to come to the hospital. 

I've tried surrounding myself with my family and friends to keep myself occupied and I've also been trying my hardest to tell myself that this is just his way of coping. Ever since we started dating I knew what type of guy he was: he rarely became unstable with sadness, typically being the strong one out of us both. 

I have only just accepted the idea that I won't make it and death is on its way, however, I feel selfish because I'd love to spend my remaining time with him. At the same time though I feel terrible trying to put him through this. My first thought was to end our relationship, but I realise more than ever now that I'd love to feel wanted, and anything but lonely, until the very end at least. 

He deserves happiness as much as anyone else does. I can't blame him for turning to Cynthia in his time of need, but I need him too. I need him to be strong for me. I just can't seem to put up enough of a fight to make him see it from my point of view (which only a few days ago caused an argument). 

I don't know how to tackle this, or how I should, or where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated. I'm sorry if this isn't worded very well, I'm kind of shaky and just wanting to let it all out at this stage. 

TL;DR diagnosed with terminal cancer, boyfriend seeks comfort from a childhood friend and isn't coping well. "
36,"I, [24/F] am so angry with my [25M/] boyfriend of a year, am I being unreasonable?


Sorry, Repost as previous one got deleted.

On Saturday, I drove my partner and I to his parents, which is a 160 mile round trip, in my car. I used over half a tank of fuel and had to fuel up on the drive back.

Last night, my boyfriend gets a call from his dad, and he's thanking him, so when he came off the phone, I asked what he was thanking him for, and he seemed reluctant to tell me, but then said his parents had given him fuel money for the journey. I'm unbelievable angry, not only did he take the money and not tell me, but he argued that this was perfectly OK, that his parents had given him the money and it was 'none of my business' despite it costing me over £30 for the trip.

My boyfriend has a good job and earns a lot more than I do, so it isn't like he's broke or needed the money either, this I would understand. He just felt entitled to it and kept it without even telling me.

He proceeded to throw in my face all the driving he's done throughout our relationship. I don't even want the money, for me it's the principle. Am I wrong to be super pissed?

tl;dr: I drove us, boyfriend took fuel money and didn't tell me about itm am I in the right to be mad?

37,"My [29F] fiance [32M] is charging me rent for the one month before our wedding.


My fiancé and I are getting married in early April. The wedding will be near my hometown (about 3 hours from where we live), so my plan is to stay at my parents' house for the two weeks in March leading up to the big day to take care of last minute details. 

My fiancé owns his house, which is where we'll both live after the wedding. Conveniently, the lease on my apartment is month-to-month, so I felt it made sense to go ahead and move my belongings into his house by the end of the month. I didn't think it'd make sense to pay another full month's rent, since I'm planning on being in my hometown anyway for two weeks in March. 

Last night, my fiancé awkwardly tells me that he thinks I should pay him rent for the month of March. I said, ""wait, so you want me to pay you for storing my stuff at what will be OUR house in less than 2 months?"" He said, ""yeah, well, we're technically not married yet."" 

I was so flabbergasted that I couldn't even really say anything at that moment. Fortunately, I had to leave to meet a friend, so that forced me to bite my tongue and gave me more time to ruminate over what he said. The more I think about it, the angrier I feel. I'm even more confused because in our prior discussions about finances, we mutually agreed that we'd have a joint account and all our money would be shared. 

Looking back, I know money has been tight for him over the past few months due to unexpected large expenses that popped up. I can't help but feel that he's trying to manipulate this situation and squeeze money out of me. 

I'm seeing him later this evening, so I'm trying to figure out what to say without completely blowing up on him. Am I overreacting or if you were in my shoes, would you also be rethinking the upcoming marriage?

41,"My [28/F] mentally ill sister [25/F] went missing and killed herself, my brother [27/M] knew where she was the entire time


My sister, Eliza, has always struggled with her mental health. We’d been doing our best to help her, but she wasn’t helping herself. It got to the point that we just had to do daily check ins, and just make sure she was okay. There were definitely times we had to physically be with her to make sure she was alright. It’s been tricky. There’s 4 siblings, and we all have to pitch in. Eliza started dating some guy three years ago, and we all thought things were turning around for her. He seemed okay with the level of commitment, and they looked like they were in love. She got pregnant, and he said he couldn’t handle having a child with a woman like her and asked her to abort or at least think about adoption. Eliza refused both, got off all her medication for the pregnancy, and he left her. It was hard on her. We would spend nights with her. My brother put off his wedding to help with Eliza. We were just so afraid that something might happen. Eliza gave birth to a healthy boy, and we were struggling to get her back on her meds afterwards. She struggled with PPD, and it was a nerve wracking situation. One day, about a month after her son was born, she said she wanted to go for a walk to clear her head. She asked my brother to hold her son while she went, he did, and she never came back. We got the police involved and everything, but after a lot of searching, we all came to the conclusion she’d run from being a parent. Even with her mental health, we knew that she had run away and we couldn’t do anything to bring her home.

Eliza’s ex-boyfriend agreed to take care of their son until Eliza turned up. Eliza had been missing for almost 8 months. We had to stop looking at a certain point. It wasn’t emotionally or financially sustainable, as awful as it sounds. There came a point where we just had to stop. We couldn’t keep it up forever, and we had a duty to be there for her son. It sounds so terrible to say, but it was true. I love my sister, and it was a horrible time. We found out last week that my sister’s body had been found. It was an obvious suicide. Her funeral was this morning. I planned it with my brother, and after the service, he came to me and said he had something to tell me. He said that Eliza told him where she was going, and asked if he thought she should go. My brother told her to go. He said he thought it was a sign that Eliza was getting independent, and he said it was better for us all.

Even though we’d been checking with her daily, my brother and her spoke only once or twice a month. He said that she was doing drugs and struggling, but she never asked for help and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” her. I feel so angry. He told me that he was “working with her”, but she still died. If we had been there, we could’ve gotten her help. Eliza wasn’t able to function independently or without her meds, and we ALL knew this. He still let her live on her own like that, do drugs- he didn’t even try to get her medicated. Eliza didn’t ask for help because she didn’t understand that she needed help. I’m so upset. If it hadn’t been for him, Eliza would still be alive right now. I’m so mad at him, I asked him not to speak to me and not to tell anybody else about what he knew. He apologized to me, but said Eliza being dead is for the best, even for her. I’m just horrified by it all. I want to just scream at him and then never speak to him ever again. My sister is dead because of what he did. My nephew is being raised without a mother because of what he did. I’m so disgusted with him. Am I just upset because of grief? Or is this actually as effed as I think it is? Should I cut him off? Or just... Let it take its course?

TL;DR: My mentally ill sister ran away from us, and my brother knew where she was the entire time."

43,"Me [16F] i am trying to transition from giving away my knitting for free to selling it, people are not getting the memo and I’m slowly losing it.


Greetings Reddit!

This is a short one. 

I knit hats. All kinds of hats. I most enjoy making basic beanies. I love making hats and as a result have a LOT of them.

I’ve recently discovered the magical world of hand dyed yarn. As any fiber enthusiast knows, that stuff is stunning but also expensive. As a result, i really cant afford to give them away for free.

I used to randomly give away my hats to anyone that wanted them. People at my school would “claim” them while  i was making them. I truly didn’t mind as i was glad they were being enjoyed.

People are still claiming my hats as i knit them. I’ve explained many times that i am no longer giving them away and they will now cost $30-$35 a hat or only be given away on special occasions.

I am not actively trying to sell, i just started and only hAve one done so far that i am still in possession of. Two others were given as birthday gifts to close friends. I don’t know how I’ll sell, ill figure it out if/when i need to sell them.

I am getting a bit insulted by people ignoring me and insisting i should still give them away for free. People even say things like my hats aren’t worth that much which stings. The yarn costs $20-$25 dollars and the hat takes 8 or so hours to make. I’m really not ripping them off.

Currently i brush it off and just say “I’m so glad you like it, but I’m not giving away hats anymore. If you’d like to purchase it’ll be $30-$35!”. But once people start badgering me not to charge them i typically get a bit sad and ask them to please leave me alone.

I need a better way to combat this. Also side note- is that really such a ridiculous price to charge?

How can i respond to people at school insisting my work is not worth $30-$35 and insisting that i should give it away for free because we are “friends” or they “really want it”.


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: no longer able or willing to give away knit hats I️ make for free due to now using pricier nicer yarn. Now charging $30-$35 for $20-$25 of yarn and about 8 hours of work. I’m sick of people disvaluing my work and insisting they shouldn’t have to pay. I’m not handling it very positively at the moment as i tell them to leave me alone, which won’t make people like me over time. How can I politely handle these situations but be firm in my stance? Side note- is that price really ridiculous? People have told me it is multiple times even when I break it down for them :/"
44,"I 31/f told my husband (32/m) about the small things his best friend 34/m is doing that make me uncomfortable. He is pissed.


My husband K is best friends with a guy named R. R is great. He spends his weekends at our house hanging out and I like having him around. 

R has been doing very small things that make me kind of uncomfortable. 

For example he always sits on the couch that I am on even if the other couch is open. I even experimented by trying a different couch. He even retires to sit on the couch if I’m laying down on the couch. He sometimes puts his feet on the couch and wedges them under me. He makes random dirty jokes and comments to me which I don’t really mind. It’s more of the combination of everything. He recently has been creating secret conversations on telegram with me (separate from our private conversation) and later deleting them. He will send me things like dirty gifs. 

Last week I was wearing a really low cut shirt and he sent me a private message that said “That’s a good top”.

I talked to my friend M who is also friends with R. She had an issue where he became inappropriate but they were also cybering during that time period. She said that this is how the behavior started and escalated from there.

I hadn’t told my husband anything until this point because these things were so small. After talking to M I decided to tell my husband just so if it escalated he would know what was going on. 

Everything was fine at first but after our son went to bed my husband said that the combination on the door was changing because R would never be coming into our house again. He also wouldn’t talk to me and said he was mad at me for not telling him in the first place. He wants to end his friendship with R and I don’t think R actions warrant that. I think maybe we should take some distance and have me establish some firm boundaries with R. I think he also hangs out with people that are extremely flirty and affectionate and I am not. I think the things R has done to me are extremely small and minor. The only reason I even told my husband was because M said R behavior escalated from there.

** tldr: told my husband about the small things his best friend is doing that make me uncomfortable and now my husband is pisses


Edit: further backstory. Up until recently I weighed 300 pounds. I really let myself go so it’s very hard for me to even comprehend someone hitting on me. 

Edit part 2 boogaloo: I realize that I was wrong and my husband is right. He was upset that I didn’t tell him earlier but he understands. We had a long conversation about it and have agreed to cut him out but also inform him why his behavior was extremely inappropriate. I didn’t realize how predatory his behavior was until it was pointed out to me and I’m very upset. I should have realized it earlier. I should have said something sooner to R but I’m horrible with confrontation. Most of the time I just ignored him or got up and left. I honestly thought that it was me overreacting. "
45,"Me [20M]. My girlfriend [19F] of 2 and a half years, believes I am to blame in the following situation that happened on Valentine's Day... am I?


My girlfriend and I decided that we would not get each other much for Valentine's Day, perhaps just each others' favorite snack. We are saving to move out as well as the many personal expenses we have currently ($9/hour doesn't go very far). Anyways, we decided, because of how busy she was on Valentine's Day, being at college all day until 8:00 P.M., that we'd just go out to eat when she got off. After some time the day before, arguing where to go to eat, she requested Outback Steakhouse and I ultimately gave in and agreed. 


Valentine's Day rolls around and I go over her house so we can head out to eat. I was focused on going to Outback, even managed to grab some coupons for it. After 10 minutes, we're ready to leave. I was swapping to a nicer shirt when she headed out to the car. It was her car so she was cleaning out the front seat a little bit. I wanted to drive, but naturally I got into the passenger's seat because she was in the driver's seat and the car was already started. The moment I sat down, I asked to drive instead, but she refused. Then the big problem came...


My girlfriend said she ""wasn't hungry"" and that she ""already ate a sub."" She said she could eat something small maybe and asked me where we should go (we are still in the driveway at this point). After trying to brainstorm because this was unexpected for me and I had no answer, she impatiently began reversing out into the street and began driving. 


At each vital turn she asked me ""which way?"" I began taking us the way to Outback. When we reached the point where we could either head toward Outback or go toward the highway which is covered with all kinds of restaurants. She asked me to choose once again and this time I said it was her turn (it was still difficult to read whether she wanted to go to Outback despite not being hungry, or wanted something small or wanted to do something fun). At this critical point, she turned to head toward the highway. 


On our way, continued asking me where we should go and I was frantically looking for things to do in our city at this time of night (there are very few and they consist of the following: Restaurants, movies, or bowling). She wasn't hungry, didn't want to go to the movies, and hates bowling. Despite this, she asked me, mind you with tons of attitude and that ""hate my life voice,"" ""do you want to go bowling??"" I quickly declined as that obviously wasn't/isn't something she enjoys. 


We continue driving, all the way to another city and an area on the water with tons of shops/restaraunts. Rather than stopping somewhere as it was an oldtown area with very tight streets, lots of people, and difficult to navigate, she continued on looking around. I asked her to park somewhere so we could figure out what we're doing. I offered to go to one of the nice, expensive restaurants in the area, but she continued driving, freaking out about the clustered area and how she doesn't know how to drive in it. Eventually, we navigated our way out of this area, not stopping once to look around and see what restaurants we could go to or looking up online which ones are any good. At this point, we start heading back to her house. 


I originally suggested Steak n' Shake which is a step up from fast food and has milkshakes and a sandwich that she loves. It's one of her favorite places. As she said earlier that she wasn't hungry, it would have been a good option because the meals aren't huge and it's open 24 hours. She agreed to going there at this point, frustrated and obviously upset. So she turns into the parking lot, but gets blocked in next to the drive through by a semi-truck restocking the food at the restaurant. This is where it's clear she freaks out. She demands me to drive and I agree. 


I go park the car to try and figure out what to do or to go inside and eat. Suddenly she's hit with a ton of sadness and refuses to go inside. I ask why and I try to remedy the situation by telling her I'll buy her a milkshake if she's not hungry still. Nothing works, and we head home. It was too late for Outback or any other restaurants really (they all close by 9-10). 


I can't remember exactly when she said the following, but it was either in the car when we were at Steak n' Shake, or when we got back. I believe it was in the car. Anyways, she begins tearing up and tells me that she bought her outfit that she's wearing just for Valetine's day and that she did her makeup in-between classes out in the rain under an overhang- very dramatic like, but I completely understand why she's so upset. She tells me she wanted me to take her out and show her off. This was my intention from the start, but unfortunately, I wasn't the one driving and she seemed like she didn't want to go to Outback. HOWEVER, after the fact, she told me she did want to go to Outback and she would have been fine with it. 


So this whole situation has led into a much bigger fight and unfortunately, the end of our relationship. She clearly blamed me for her having a terrible night and even went as far to state it directly. She said she did nothing wrong and she is not to blame for any of it. Now normally, I take the blame for a lot of stuff that I don't agree with, but this is something I cannot take the blame for because I tried and tried again. It was ultimately her decisions that kept us from doing anything that night (this is how I see it anyway). I was not and I am still not looking to blame anyone for our bad night. Rather, I consider it to just be one of those ""shit happens"" kind-of-nights. My goal was to make it up to her and take her out this weekend, which sadly, I did not make clear until it was too late. 


My question is, am I the one to blame for all of this? 

Please note: I may have left some details out, but I tried to be as thorough as possible. I tried to not be bias, but I'm sure my bias has shown through a bit. 


TL;DR
My girlfriend and I decided on a restaurant to go to on Valentine's Day as she works all day and there aren't really any other options. After telling me she wasn't hungry and having tons of hesitation, she begins driving (though I wanted to drive), and asks me which direction to head in. When we get to the turn for the decided restaurant, she drives in the other direction and says we can look for something (we live in this city and know everything here). 

Ultimately, after trying to and almost succeeding taking her to Steak n' Shake, and after 2 hours or so of driving, we head back. She refused to stop anywhere, even to just think of what to do. We get back and she blames me for all of it and says she is not to blame at all. I am not trying to blame anyone, just that shit happens. 

Am I the one at fault for this mess, should I be blamed? "
46,"My wife (38/F) broke a window while upset and wouldn’t speak to me (38/M)


My wife and I have been married for 15 years, dated for 5, and we have two children (14/F &amp; 12/M). I work about an hour out of town, I leave at 6:30 and get home at 6:30. My wife works in town, leaves at 7 and gets home at 5. When our kids were younger, I worked in town, so we split the parenting duties equally. Now, she handles making sure they’re ready for school, as well as breakfast and dinner. I pack their lunches every night when I’m home, do my bit on the weekend so my wife can get time off, and spend time with my kids and wife after work. It can be hard to make time for our relationship, but we have at least one date night every month. This month, we managed to sneak in quite a few. I thought things were awesome- we had a great Valentine’s, our kids are getting in the swing of things for their second semester. You know, life is good. This week has been fairly mellow, and my wife has been in great spirits. 

I came home Friday night, and my wife was upset. She was making dinner and I asked if I could help, and she said no. I asked if everything was okay, she said no but she wouldn’t bother me with her “stupid problems.” I told her that her problems aren’t stupid, and said she can talk to me about anything. She said it didn’t matter, and told me to get out of the kitchen. I thought maybe work stress or home stress was getting to her, so I asked if she wanted to go get dinner and a movie on Saturday. She said it was a waste of money and time, and so we just ate dinner. I didn’t want to argue, just in case it was just a bad day and she just needed quiet time. On Saturday, we went to a tournament for our daughter and had dinner as a family. My wife was kind of cold and short with me, but I figured it had been a busy day. So, Sunday, I told her to get her nails done, go get a massage, whatever she wanted. I’d go take the kids to do some shopping and other errands. She got weirdly accusatory and told me I was just trying to have fun with the kids without her. I said no, we wanted to do the boring stuff so she could do the fun stuff. I said she was welcome to come, I just thought she’d had a busy week and deserved some time to herself. She said she clearly wasn’t welcome, and went by herself. We got home later than expected, and I let my wife know, because the shopping list is always added to while we’re at the store and the new items are always halfway across town.

When we got home, my wife was in the kitchen, and I asked if she needed any help with dinner. She said she didn’t want to make dinner, so I said I could make it or we could get pizza or go out or get take out, and she told me to shut up and leave her alone. I got kind of upset, and asked if I’d done something to upset her. She got huffy and told me to leave her alone again. I said I wanted to make sure she was okay. My wife got really upset and started putting pots and pans out saying she was fine, she was going to make dinner and everything would be fine. I said if she wasn’t okay, if she needed to talk, we could send the kids to their grandparents and just talk, and she got mad and told me she wanted to talk to anybody but me. I asked why, and she grabbed one of the pans, and slammed it against one of the windows. It broke, and she threw the pan on the ground and started to cry. I asked if she wanted to go to the hospital, if she was okay, but she wouldn’t answer me. Our son came in the room and freaked out because he thought I’d hurt my wife. I got my wife’s parents to come get our kids for the night, but my wife wouldn’t get off the floor, just completely sobbing. It was scary. I left the room for a minute to try and get my son to leave, and when I came back, my wife was walking off into our room. She locked me out of the bedroom, and only spoke to me in one word sentences when I told her I was afraid of her hurting herself and I wanted to call the police. She told me she was fine, and eventually opened the door so I could come in and sleep. In the morning, she just acted totally casual, and didn’t really say all that much to me. I’m a little freaked out now, and I just need some advice from non-biased parties. I know I shouldn’t have pushed so much, but I was genuinely worried, and now I feel like I should be concerned for her safety.

Where should I go from here? What’s a good next step? And just, what? I’m sorry, I don’t know what I’m asking, I’m just lost. 

TL;DR: My wife got really upset over the weekend and broke a window using a pan. She’s been distant and cold since. 

**EDIT:** My wife and I split our chores. She does NOT do all the housework will I sit on my ass. Our kids contribute, and we all keep up with an equal amount of responsibility. If I had dumped this all on her and she snapped, I’d understand, but we distribute the chores easily. While she does make dinner and breakfast, I do the same on weekends, and be sure to pick up additional work to do for her to match her contribution to the house.

**UPDATE:** I came home early, got the kids from school, and made dinner just to take another burden off her shoulders for tonight. My wife came home, and became very upset. She told me that I’m treating her like an incapable child, and when I asked her to talk to me in the kitchen, she started yelling that she didn’t want to talk to me. My wife went to the kitchen anyways, and started throwing the pots and such on the stove onto the floor. I tried to pull her away, and she hit me before starting to scream and cry. She pulled out a clump of her hair and banged her head against the counter. I kept trying to pull her away and keep her from hurting herself, but she screamed that she’d stab herself if I touched her. I called my in-laws to get our kids, and called 911. My wife has been hospitalized for a severe psychiatric breakdown, and is undergoing evaluations over the next week. I plan to visit her tomorrow, but my kids are still really afraid and don’t want to see her for a while, which I understand. I’ve asked them to perform some scans as well, as some commenters suggested it may be a tumor. I’m hoping they can help find some answer to this, so I can help my wife recover and get better.

Thank you all for commenting, if something changes, I’ll be sure to come back and let everyone know"
47,"My [23F] boyfriend[22M] told me he feels embarrassed to go in public with me because of my weight


I've been together with my current boyfriend for 3 years and this is my first serious relationship. When we met he still wasn't over his ex-girlfriend and depressed, I had a savior complex and chased him, thinking I could help him heal (he had broken up with his ex more than a year before we met). We started off as friends, texting every day until the am. He told me he could never see more happening with us, but I kept trying, hoping our friendship would make him see me differently. We made a friends with benefits pact even though we were both virgins and soon after that we became official.

I was overweight ever since I was 11 years old, I gained weight while my mother was pregnant with my brother, she had depression all throughout her pregnancy and postpartum as well so she stopped taking proper care of me, I ended up snacking a lot. Also, I'm an emotional eater, I eat to cope with stress, sadness and anxiety which for a nerdy girl that was taller than everyone else in class, were a lot of opportunities for. 

When we started dating I was sitting at 207lbs and being 5'9"", which looks a little less than the numbers because at least I have an hourglass figure. I decided to start losing weight and reached 180lbs in about 6 months, but I had to stop because of health problems made worse by overexercising. After I had my surgery I found it really hard to get back to working out, which may be a psychological fear of it not happening again, or not having enough motivation. Over the last two years I gained back the weight, currently sitting at 216lbs.

I knew that my weight was always an issue for my boyfriend, he never made it a secret that he likes slim, petite girls with small breasts, which puts me at the exact opposite of his physical type. But we both love sex, having it 2-3 times a week (we're not living together) and sometimes more than once in a night when he comes over. I always tried to compensate for my weight (it came easy considering that I'm a giver) with massages and a lot of oral, kinks and a whole lot of other stuff. 

Emotionally, we've been having a rough patch because his ex-girlfriend is back in his life, he reached out to her to make sure she's alright after a very bad breakup when she disappeared from all social media and they've been talking and spending time together. I don't much like it because they had a very bad breakup as well, which resulted in a depression that he's still dealing with. I tried to be supportive, I'm okay with them talking, but not so much with playing video games together (we're all gamers). I had some issues with jealousy in the past because of my insecurity and the fact that most of his close friends are female, over time I learned to accept it and trust him, but it caused a bit of a dent in our relationship.
 
Yesterday he confessed to me that he wants me to find an exercise and nutrition plan because he feels embarrassed when he has to go out in public with me and he'd rather just go out with a group from his highschool which were mostly uneducated thugs, which came as a really low blow to me. He also said that he sort of has to force himself to have sex with me, having to put my ""person"" above how I look because he thinks I'm really unattractive. 

Having slept on this, because I didn't want to overreact, it still breaks my heart to hear these things from him and part of me wants to break up with him, because at this point I'm not even sure if I could even have sex with him anymore, considering I will be thinking about how bad he thinks I look every time and part of me wants to start progressing to weight loss, because it's something that I always wanted. 
  ---   
 tl;dr: My boyfriend said he feels ashamed to go out with me in public and that he forces himself to have sex with me because I am overweight."

50,"(UPDATE) My [17F] best friend [17F] had a complete meltdown because I wasn’t able to compete at a tournament, and it killed our winning streak


[This is the original post link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yfp36/my_17f_best_friend_17f_had_a_complete_meltdown/?st=JDXJDTAG&amp;sh=70282fa6)

On Monday, I went to my coach and talked to her about what Molly had said and done. My coach said she would speak to Molly, and try to work things out between us. The rest of the day was fairly uneventful, but Molly completely ignored me. I saw her in the hall and smiled, to see if maybe she got over it, but she rolled her eyes and kept going. We sit next to each other in a few of our classes, and I tried to be friendly and make conversation. In our government class, I asked how she thought our test was, and she didn’t respond. Then, in math, she moved desks so she could sit on the other side of the room. I was really mad! I didn’t do anything! I texted her, saying she could be a bit kinder, and she just responded: “don’t try to kumbaya it out now.”

My coach spoke to Molly in the afternoon, and I got an email asking me to meet my coach and Molly yesterday morning. So, I went. Molly came clean right away. She’s failing 3/4 of her AP classes, the college course she’s taking, and our math class. It’s midterm for our school today, so any failed classes equate to one competition that has to be sat out from. Given how many classes she’d been failing, her parents got mad and told her she couldn’t compete at all. The tournament on Saturday was our last. She’d been planning to tell me afterwards, and when I’d gotten sick, she panicked. She never got a last tournament- and she completely lashed out. I told her that still wasn’t fair to me, and she apologized again. I said I’m not sure if I was okay with that, and Molly got kind of huffy and standoffish, saying I was being really rude to her. I told her she was being rude to me, and our coach told us we had to respect each other, so we both left because it wasn’t getting anymore.

I quit today. My coach offered me a new partner, but I didn’t feel any chemistry. I told Molly I was blocking her number, and did. We didn’t talk at all today and it was the weirdest thing. Like, I felt like I was missing a part of me. I’m glad I blocked her number because I almost texted her like 15 times today. I think eventually I might talk to her and try to rebuild our friendship, but for right now, I don’t think I can. I know she was struggling herself, but that was the most hurtful thing she’s said to me. She was being really awful, and reading the comments, I didn’t feel like her friend. I felt used. I felt disgusted. It was really eye opening. Thanks for everyone’s help and advice.

TL;DR: Molly and I have stopped being friends."
51,"My (32F) Husband (33M) is resentful because I keep the house clean? Am I missing something?


We’ve been married for two years. I have three kids from a previous marriage (9, 6, 4) and we had a baby together two weeks ago. 

Before my husband and I met, my parents bought the house we live in now as a real estate investment. It’s small, but pretty and in a nice neighborhood. After I divorced my ex, they offered it to me and my three kids (rent free) so I could get back on my feet. 

I’m a clean person anyway, but especially because I was living in a place my parents own, I was careful to put a LOT of effort in the upkeep of the house, yard etc. 

My husband is VERY messy and I knew that from the get go. His car and the room he was staying in when we met we’re both covered in trash, dirty laundry, etc. But he was a bachelor, he works long hours and just doesn’t find cleaning to be particularly important. 

While that’s not particularly attractive, it didn’t bother me that much. It does now that we live together, of course, but I’ve learned to accept it. I can’t force him to think having a clean house is important, but it’s important to me so I just keep up with it myself. 

When I got pregnant with our newest baby, I was put on bedrest pretty quickly and could only do the bare minimum. By the time I had the baby a couple weeks ago, the house and all the outside areas were completely trashed. I started working on it a couple days after coming home from the hospital and while I still have some big projects to do, things are clean and functional again on the inside of the house. 

I guess I assumed that this would make my husband happy. I haven’t asked for his help at all. He works until late at night so I stay up to wait for him and spend an hour or so with him when he gets home. I spend a lot of time with the kids and take great care of our baby. 

But instead, he’s gotten sullen and resentful. He thinks I’m being “manic” because I tidy up several times throughout the day. He thinks I should just let messes happen and then do one big clean at the end of the day. I explained that I don’t do that because it’s more work and I feel much less stressed during the day when things stay clean-ish. I don’t expect it to be perfect, of course. We have four kids. But I do make sure dirty dishes go in the dishwasher and I wipe up spills as they happen, straighten the living room periodically if no one is in there, etc. 

Yesterday, my husband was off work and by the end of the day he was angry and confrontational with me about this. I honestly don’t understand. He says I wasn’t spending time with anyone... but our house is very small with a nice, open layout. It’s almost impossible to NOT interact. I wasn’t closed up in a room, just tidying up every once in a while and hanging out with the kids.

He went on to say that there’s not one place in our home that he feels comfortable in. He said that about a year ago, so I made our enclosed back patio into a sort of “man cave” for him. I bought a heavy bag he wanted and hung it back there along with a bunch of football signage and memorabilia. Got some comfy, manly furniture for it. Set up his hand saw and all his tools in one corner. 

Now, that whole patio is so covered in trash/dirt/wood scraps/ etc etc. that you can’t even get onto it.  So what am I supposed to do?  He doesn’t have a spot that’s “his”... so I made one for him... but he didn’t take care of it and now it’s unusable to anyone. Our house is only two bedrooms, it’s not like I can just make him another one. 

And why is it a big deal to him that I like a clean house and make the effort to keep it that way?  He’s constantly trying to talk me out of feeling that way and I just don’t understand. I don’t give him a hard time or ask him to help. I just clean up his messes along with everyone else’s, so what’s the problem?  I’m not asking him to care.  So why is it an issue for him that I do?  

Further than that, it does suck that he sees absolutely no value in how I spend my days at home. But I can’t change that, so oh well. Still, I want to understand why he’s so resentful about it. I’m not willing (or maybe even capable) not to keep things clean. How can I fix this?

TLDR:  My husband doesn’t think cleaning is important and is resentful that I spend a lot of time on upkeep of our house. "

My boyfriend and me have been together for almost two years. We met through my best friend at a party where she introduced us to each other.    
Though we had some pretty nasty fights our relationships has been pretty nice up to now. He was super sweet towards me most of the times, but recently he became distant.    
First I thought he had a rough time at work, so I just told him he should tell me if something bothers him, since we talk about most things that bother us.   

Since all of us are in the same group of friends I thought maybe going out again would be a bit refreshing, so this friday we (my boyfriend, my best friend, two other male friends and me) went to a club. Since I didn't want to drink too much and didn't want to dance I stayed back with one of the male friends after some time, while the rest went out to get some more drinks and to dance. 
I think it was around 1 am, when I wanted to go home because I was feeling kind of sick, so I tried finding my boyfriend and my best friend, but I didn't have luck, so I texted them and quickly said goodbye to our other friends.   
I knew I had to take a cab which could take some time so I decided to go to the restroom before I head out, but when I entered the women's section I saw my best friend and my boyfriend *literally fucking* each other. Literally. His pants were down and she was pressed against the wall.

That picture is also the last thing I saw and I've remembered since. I know I turned around on the spot and went straight back home, crying my eyes out on the way. 

Honestly I've never felt this heartbroken and betrayed. I couldn't stop crying yesterday and now I'm just a dull mess..
My boyfriend texted me and tried to contact me, but I don't see a reason to respond. We had previously planned to meet tomorrow so I guess I'll break up with him then.... 
Regarding my ""best friend"" - she hasn't even texted me, but I'm not even sure if I would ever want to see her face again. I feel so hurt, it's making me angry. 

I know I should break up with my boyfriend, and I will, but I don't know about my ""best friend"". Since we are all in the same group of friends we will all meet eventually. I don't want to give up my entire circle of friends because of two assholes' actions. But on the other hand I don't really know what all of them are thinking, what they know//what they've been told and how they will react.. 

My trust has been broken twice in one instance and I don't know what to feel or how to react further. What the fuck do I do?

Sorry for my bad english, I'm from Germany [which is also why it's legal for us to drink]. 

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all those encouraging words. I read all of the comments and I strongly agree with all of you that I don't need to meet up with my ex. I already texted my friends on private message and told another good friend on phone what happened and he was so shocked. He didn't know anything was going on, but it's still unclear if it was a 'mistake once' or if it has been going on for a while. Ghosting both of them now though//Blocked rip :)

57,"My [24F] fiance's [26M] mom [50sF] want to move in with us with her aggressive, schizophrenic daugher [25F]


For some back story, my SO and I took over the lease on his mom's house when she retired early and moved across the country with her daughter to take care of her elderly parents (they are living with them atm). We agreed to take over the lease for two reasons: to help her out (so she wouldn't have to pay out of it), and because we needed a larger living space. 

When my SO and I were first getting on our feet we did live with his mother and his sister for a short period of time. His sister is diagnosed schizophrenic and is notorious for not staying on her medication. She is also very aggressive and has at times truly frightened me with how angry and reactive she gets. My SO knows this as I've told him plenty of times how uncomfortable she makes me. To top it off, she almost killed our puppy by dropping him on his head and has carelessly left the back gate open and let him onto the street more times than I can count.

My SO called me today and told me that he had just talked to his mom and there's a chance she will need to move back to the state and in with us. His sister went off of her meds and attacked both of her grandparents, pushing her grandma over, punching her grandpa in the face, and screaming at them both. She then went and overdosed on her medication and had to be taken to the hospital. Right now his sister is at an inpatient program to get her stable and back on her medication, but her grandparents have said they won't allow her back in their home.

My SO's mom doesn't know what to do as she retired early and isn't making enough money to live on her own. Her only option to find a very cheap apartment or move back in with us.

I told my SO I am 100% NOT okay with this. I explained to him basically everything that I've written in this post and he said he knew I'd say that and he understands.

SO's mom is not going to take that very well. I know she's going try and guilt my SO and make me out to be selfish. I love his mom, but she's said before to me that I will never stand in the way of him and taking care of his sister (we've discussed that as well and he has always taken my feelings about it 100% serious). But I also know my SO loves his mom dearly and won't want to see her struggle.

I don't know what to do or what to say or where to go from here.

I'm by myself any on my phone right now. I'm sorry if there are mistakes that I don't catch in advance. I feel like I am on a vacation from hell. It's not that the place itself is bad at all. I have a nice view over the wilderness from up here. It's most of the people. I feel uncomfortable in all honesty. I don't feel like I can do anything without getting some sort of passive aggressive remark. 

My girlfriend had a fiance that unfortunately died. I'm her first partner after his passing 2 years later. I would never hold anything against this guy. My frustration has nothing really to do with him. We've been together for 8 months. Her friends wanted to go on a vacation up some mountain for three weeks. She wanted me to come with because she thought it would be fun. That's much how I got up here. 

Her friends have not made this a pleasant trip. There's this one guy that keeps calling me Sammi, because he thinks I look like Sam from Supernatural. I can tolerate it because it's not that bad, but when loaded on with the other stuff. He keeps saying it over and over. Her friends have been making these weird passive aggressive comments about me and her deceased fiance. Someone asked me in private how it felt to take his spot. How do you answer that? I didn't know what to say other than I don't want to take anyone's spot. One of them asked me what it felt like to take her to the same spot her fiance took her. It's a waterfall. Plenty of people go the damn thing. They always seem to do it when she's not around.

I don't know who to talk to. She's having fun with her friends up here. I've kept my mouth shut for two weeks and I'm starting to lose it.

60,"My (28m) husband (31m) of 6 years takes ridiculous risks while doing his ""extreme"" sports. Now that we have kids (2f,1m) I want it to stop. How do I do this?


Edit: this blew up, sorry I wasn’t around to participate—an ironic twist, I skied all day with my cousin and had such fun my husband actually beat me in.

To address the most common concerns;

1. We have a huge life insurance policy through my husbands work, as far as I know it covers everything but I need to look into. It’s part of his job so we actually pay very small premiums on it.

2. I chose to be a SAHM, I do miss my career sometimes (as evidenxed by my comment) but I love spending tome with both kids, my husband works very hard to give me this. Our first was planned and we’d hoped for several years between kids but things happen and it’s a little more stressful than I’d hoped but we love both kids.

3. My dad adores my husband and he’s an introvert like Gregory, so he’s to bed while the rest of us are talking late into the night. My dad loves hearing about all about Greg’s adventures so he’s happy paying. Which sucks for me because my own dad is not an advocate for my desires. 

Thank uou for all the advice I have some reading to do. Hopefully I can update when we get home.

So this is coming to a head because at the moment we are on a ski vacation with my family. For the most part we are having a great time and have my parents, brother and kids and my aunt and cousins and their respective kids. It's a great time. 

My husband lives for this stuff but while we are being more social, he's in the lift line at 9 and he comes off the mountain at 4:30 like clockwork. He doesn't take hot chocolate breaks with us and he doesn't eat lunch with us. He will eat at the family dinner but instead of staying up telling stories and drinking wine, he goes to bead and listens to music until he falls asleep. So strike one, I'm annoyed with him being so anti social.

But the annoyance is compounded by the fact that he is doing behaviors that we have fought over many times...him not realizing he's not 19 anymore and now has kids and responsibilities. I found out last night that he made friends with a group of local kids who have been showing him the ""back hills"" where there are rocks and cliffs to jump off of, but this is off ski area so he has to ski down to the road and actually hitch hike back to the ski resort. I'm livid, literally seeing red, wanting to do terrible things to Him angry. 

This is bad enough but we have this same fight every time we go anywhere, whether it's surfing, mountain biking, rock climbing you name it...he's always pushing it. We have this same fight almost every week night because he goes to Brazilian jiu-jitsu and comes back with his knees tweaked or face all scratched up. I'm sick of this. 

In fairness to my husband he's a great dad and we had two kid much closer in age than we'd planned and he's very supportive and good at giving me breaks, but that makes his irresponsible behavior even more stark because I can't raise two small kids on my own if he kills himself flying down and mountain with no ski patrol (or surfing waves too big, etc...). And to add insult to injury, he says he can't wait to take our kids along on all his adventures as soon as they are old enough.

Like I said, I can't raise two small kids by myself. How do I get him to stop the nonsense and take his responsibilities seriously?

62,"[UPDATE] My BF [M/23] got mad that I [F/22] clogged the toilet at his apartment.


[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7y0tmw/my_bf_m23_got_mad_that_i_f22_clogged_the_toilet/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit)

So a lot of you were right about underlying issues he had going on. He's got bad anxiety that was exacerbated by him not being able to smoke and worries about living in the apt illegally. Yesterday I laid out how his outbursts and snowballing, aggressive thoughts and conversations with me were starting to be a deal breaker (similar things to the toilet incident had also happened). I told him he needs to find a way to manage it, etc., and he agreed and apologized. I also will try to be more understanding of his thought process and why he might be acting the way he is.

Today, he had a dr's appointment and he was prescribed anxiety medication, and he seemed calmer and more relaxed after he took it. I know it's not a permanent fix, but it's a start. This relationship is going to take work, I know, and as long as this doesn't become an issue again, I'm thinking we can get through this with better communication and more respect for each other.

  Thank you all for the responses!
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Sat down and talked about how his behavior has been unacceptable, he apologized and today he got anxiety meds which have already seemed to help. Yay!

EDIT: I'll have to discuss therapy to go alongside the prescription *(which is Xanax short-term and Prozac long-term)*, especially given his somewhat addictive personality. . I don't know much about this at all, so any insight or experiences with those are welcome! 

I'd rather him have psychological changes that are permanent over a dependency on meds/eventually withdrawal. BUT one step at a time though. I'm proud he took this first one given his bad childhood experiences with doctors/prescribed unnecessary meds, and will probably wait a few days before bringing up therapy."
63,"I [21F] had my hair done by my boyfriend's sister [24F] and things were kind of a disaster


At my boyfriend's family's holiday dinner recently, I was saying how badly I needed my hair done. My boyfriend's sister, ""Marie"" said she was moving back to (city we live in), and got a chair at a salon close by me and that she would love to do my hair. She shared a couple of ideas she had and it sounded great, so I booked an appointment with her last week after she got settled. I hadn't spent a whole lot of time with her, but we had lunch a couple times just the two of us and I definitely trusted her.

I've actually been to this salon before, so I was familiar with how pricing worked. The reason I didn't return was because the woman who I had a good experience with moved and I am always nervous about trying someone new. I have a LOT of hair, so usually I am there for about 4 hours, maybe 5 if I'm doing an extra treatment or something. But my appointment with Marie had me coming in at 5, an staying nearly 3 hours past closing until 12am (yes, midnight!). 

The first weird thing was that Marie seemed to be generally in a bad mood and didn't really want to talk very much. This was totally fine with me, I'm not into supper chatty hairstylists or small talk. But she seemed to have a bad attitude and was going pretty slowly, which surprised me because she had always been really upbeat and energetic when I'd spent time with her. By the fourth hour it became apparent we were not even half way done..and I asked if I should return for the rest of the treatment another time because the salon closed at 9. She said the salon would stay open as long as we needed and not to worry, so I didn't bring it up again. I started to get extremely restless and had a huge migraine at this point and was just looking forward to having my hair done and leaving.

I have a cartilage piercing on one ear and the earring is a hoop. Ideally I'd have taken it out before getting my hair done, but it is an earring that can only be put on/taken off with a special tool so I have to get it done at the piercing shop. My ears are really sensitive to typical jewelry so I had to save up for a $200 earring and I leave it on all the time, except to have it cleaned occasionally. I always warn hairstylists that the hoop is there and ask that they approach that area with care, and have never had a problem. While combing my hair towards the end of the treatment, Marie ripped the earring out with the comb and the earring broke, my ear was literally gushing with blood. She apologized but was also like, ""You probably should've removed that before the appointment."" At this point I was dying to go home and didn't want to argue, it was close to midnight and she was also trying to add several charges for the time it took - even though it felt like she was purposefully going slowly to get overtime once the salon had closed.

I just paid without arguing because like I said, I was exhausted and wanted to get out of there. But now I'm really pissed because my piercing closed up and got infected over night, the earring is broken, and on top of that my hair doesn't even look good which honestly is the least of my worries, lol. But I really don't know how to handle this situation. My friend thinks the salon should reimburse me for the cost of the earring and having to get the hole re-pierced, but I feel like this will create an issue between me and my boyfriend's family. Also, I apologize if this sounds petty (worrying about hair and an earring) but I feel like I typically let people walk all over me and I really want to end that, but I don't know if this situation is the best time to start..

Is this something I should just let go or should I stand up for myself?

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend's sister did my hair, took a really long time (7 hours), cost $200+ more than the salon usually has charged me for the same service, and she ripped my earring out...don't know how to handle this without making my boyfriend's family hate me."

My sister has yesterday told me that a good friend of mine has over the last few weeks multiple times made advances at her when I happened to not be around, called her cute, asked her whether she ever wanted to hang out, if she had a boyfriend. 

Should I confront him about this and how? It's completely unacceptable to me, after all she's only 16, my sister, and also not interested in him and despite making that clear he still acted like that.

68,"I [23F] can’t help crying during serious conversations when I don’t want to


Title says it all really. In emotionally charged situations with another person I just can’t help but cry. I’ve honestly always been this way since childhood. It’s like I’m trying to stuff down my emotions but it comes out through my eyes if that makes sense. It’s not necessarily sad situations, I could be angry, anxious, caught off guard, etc. Also I’m not sobbing, it’s more like tears are just leaking. 

It happens with my bf, my mom, and it’s happened at a previous job. I honestly hate it so much. I can feel it happening and then I get more anxious and it happens faster! I feel like I’m a pretty even keeled person so idk why I turn into a ball of feelings at the drop of a hat. 

I just want to get a hold of this before I start working at a real person career where I face criticism from peers/bosses/etc. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? What have you done to help cope? 

Tldr I can’t help but cry in serious conversations with people when I really, truly don’t mean to. I desperately want to stop. Any tips? "

70,"I [27F] am considering a deadline for my partner [28M] it 5 years to make a serious commitment or else I leave. Am I a horrible person?


My partner and I have been together for five years.  We have lived together for 4.5 years and have had a wonderful relationship. 
I have always been honest about wanting kids(around 30) / marriage (before 30). We have lived with his family and have openly planned to buy for 3 years but due to market fluctuations we have put this off.  I adore him but he went from wanting to be engaged at 26 to not knowing when and he mentioned having kids at 35y.o the other day which I informed him wasn't possible for me (due to genetics). 
As his timeline rapidly extends I have fears I will not be able to have children with him (he isn't open to adoption) and am concerned he is putting off marriage due to concerns regarding me. 
I have been very open regarding my concerns and he assures me this is not the case and states he wants to spend his life with me.  
The other day I decided if by our next purchase deadline (mid-2019)  he hasn't made a long term commitment I may have to consider moving on...  
Is this mad? Am I a bad person?  

Tldr: long term relationship goals being extended beyond what is genetically possible and personally desired. Deadline has been considered "
71,"Boyfriend (23M) overreacted to my(23F) prank or is that what he actually feels?


So my boyfriend usually loves to play pranks on me, like telling me things are not going to plan if I am looking forward to something...then take it so far until I am about to break down, and then he tells me it was a joke. It's been 3 years and now I usually take whatever he says with a pinch of salt.

We're in an LDR and we have plans to meet in the first week of March, with everything booked..flights, hotel etc after 6 months since we last met. My parents suddenly wanted me to come along on a family vacation, which was coinciding with last couple of days of me and him together. I told him about it, and I said I'll talk to my parents and work it out, so that I can join them a couple of days later. He was fine and said let me me know about it.

So I worked it out with my parents and decided ,for once to play a prank on him. And I called him with a serious tone and everything saying that I'll have to leave early and things like my parents are really eager for me to go...and he literally blew a fuse, started shouting about how stupid I am, how I have literally no voice and how much money of his I have wasted. I was shocked to hear him talk to me like that. I told him to stop shouting at me, and he says why, should I sympathize with you that how sad your life is. 
I just told him I was kidding, and he cooled down instantly and said oh, that's fine then. I feel so angry and disappointed about the things he said.

TL;DR: Played a prank on boyfriend saying we won't be able to meet, he blew up with the first thing being I wasted his money and I'm a loser for not standing up to my parents."
