0,"UPDATE: Me [26F] with my best friend [27F] I just got engaged and wanted to share the news and all she said was ""Relationships are trash.""


[removed]"
1,"[UPDATE] I (F27) have been dating my Bf (M26) for 2 years and our sexlife is horrible. I'm not sure whether or not that is a good enough reason to break-up.


Follow-up story from my previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77mj8s/i_f27_have_been_dating_my_bf_m26_for_2_years_and/?st=j94icn31&amp;sh=05f76e51

So I did it.. Broke up with him :(. I'm incredibly hurt right now. We both said some pretty awful things to each other and as soon as he left I started doubting. I think it's because I've known him for so long and I very much *wanted* it to work. 

But I can't do this anymore. I made a couple of threads, got a bunch of PM's, and it was all made clear that this isn't a normal situation. It's been my reality for so long that I can't picture being in a relationship where the sex actually works. Sad, I know... 

We had a big blowout fight. He felt like I was just trying to ""emasculate"" him with the stuff I brought up. ""Good luck finding a guy who is willing to deal with a girl who has anxiety!"" he shouted. 

I think he said all those hurtful things to make me doubt and stay with him. I will admit I said some things I shouldnt have too.. :(
He started to make me feel guilty by saying that I owe it to him that we stay together the rest of the year. That this wasn't a fair time to break up since he is starting a new stressful project and he *needs* me to be there for him for support. I got so angry when he started saying this because I feel like I have already tried! I have been his blowjob machine for so long without getting anything in return. When we *did* have sex, it was always missionary, zero warm up/foreplay and he never kissed me or touched me during. It felt like he was just masturbating with my body :(. How exactly is that supposed to make me feel? 

I just can't anymore. If I stay, I feel like thats me saying I accept our situation, and I don't. I might not ever find someone (ending up alone is a big fear of mine.. maybe thats also why I stayed longer than I should have..), but I atleast want to get out there and pursue what I actually *want*. 

Sorry for rambling and I hope what I wrote made sense.   

Our relationship wasn't all bad and we had lots in common but our physical problems ruined it. I am going to keep my distance for a little bit, but then I hope we can be friends. 

Thanks everyone for the advice again.

2,"I'm [29F] starting to think that my husband [33M] of 2 years is obsessed with his ex [33F] and is trying his best to COPY her life. I'm 33 weeks pregnant and I feel very disturbed. How do I approach this?

4,"In laws [60s M&amp;F] are upset I'm [29/M] not attending upcoming events for my late-BIL [was 34/M]. Wife [28/F] not supporting me on this.


5 months ago, my BIL passed away from a heart attack. Since his death, my in-laws have been beside themselves, statements like “they never saw this coming” and “he was SO young, it could happen to ANYONE” have been common. The thing is, my BIL was not the paragon of health. Frankly, I’m surprised he made it to 34. First, my BIL lived with his parents and worked as a library assistant. He worked from 11-7, would get two large pizzas on his way home, eat the pizzas, leftovers at home, drink 1 or 2 2L sodas and smoke probably more than a pack of cigarettes (20 regular cigarettes) an evening. He hadn’t eaten a vegetable in more than 20 years – something he was proud of – had diabetes, a bad back (which is why he couldn’t exercise) and would help wind-down every evening with about a gallon of cheap beer. He’d wake-up at 8:45, microwave himself a few breakfast sandwiches/burritos (7 or 8) and would smoke another 10 cigarettes. He’d toddle off to work. He did that M-F, on Sat &amp; Sun, he laid in bed till 2, watched TV, chain smoked cigarettes, ordered either Chinese take-out (meat only) or burgers, would drink beer from 4 until 1 or 2 AM and then pass out. He literally never left his room. 

BIL was warned by numerous doctors to get healthier, cut the smokes, stop drinking and to clean up, but he never did. Even when he got diabetes and spent almost a week in hospital, it didn’t phase him. He had begun to walk with a cane – he was only about 5’7 but well north of 350lbs. He didn’t drink water, he didn’t eat a vegetable, he lived in his room and was never, ever healthy. Last year, he suffered a major heart attack and required emergency bypass surgery. He barely made it through the surgery, he was so unhealthy that he nearly passed away many times during surgery/recovery. He spent 3 weeks in the hospital. 

He got home and immediately resumed his habits. Just days after he got home, he was in bed, with a bag of cookies on his chest and an ashtray next to his bed. The home care workers tried, his surgeons tried, everyone tried to break him of his habit… Except his parents who didn’t want to upset their son….

Anyway, a couple of months after surgery he died in bed. He had deteriorated rapidly, could barely move, had no energy, was white &amp; gaunt and had trouble breathing. He refused medical attention and finally passed away. It was tragic, and everyone mourned. Since then, my in-laws have had their eyes-opened to the fragility of life and have been booking the ENTIRE family on events. I went along with it for a while, but it’s gotten excessive – we’re expected to be with them every Saturday (even when they just sit around telling stories about someone who never existed…); we’re expected to be there when they need support and they’ve began booking us for every holiday: Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas are being renamed “BIL Remembrance Days”. No celebration but rather informal wakes will be held in his honor. 

I get they are sad and upset, but this is beyond crazy. My wife [28/F] has another sister [34/F] and brother [37/M].  They &amp; their partners think this is getting out of hand. They’ve all pulled out of these events, but my wife won’t stand up to her parents. She’s the baby and doesn’t want to disappoint them. The thing is, it’s gone way beyond. My birthday involved my in-laws coming over and making a “speech” (more like a lecture) about how deceased BIL would love this party. It went on for well over an hour, attempts to stop them failed and finally my mother had to physically remove them. They apologized when it became obvious everyone was so uncomfortable that they left. 

They need therapy, but they think this is all part of the grieving process. They refuse to talk to someone; they refuse to get help in any way whatsoever leaving my wife to carry the burden and for me to deal with their shit. They both informally “retired” but can’t afford it; they didn’t really do their taxes (so I’m dealing with it) and aren’t keeping up with bills, so I’m their financial advisor. I haven’t had a weekend to myself in 5 months and I don’t want to give up holidays with my folks, so my in-laws can make-up stories about their son. I've had to help my FIL apply for jobs; I've had to give my MIL prepaid visa gift cards to prevent her from going wild on spending. I've structured their finances in such a way that they are okay, but what they need is long-term mental help to get them working again. 

I know it sounds cold &amp; callous, but I’ve hit my limit. How can I get my wife to take my side and deal with her parents who obviously need therapy and support? 

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: BIL ate &amp; drank himself to death and has sent my in-laws off the deep end. I can't handle their crap, renaming holidays after my BIL and need 1 weekend away from them. Wife won't stand up to them as she's afraid to disappoint them. "
5,"My mom [45F] is pregnant and she just got put in jail for meth. Everyone in my family has been looking to me[22F] and my fiance[23M] to take the baby. How to navigate this?


Basically, my mom is a drug addict. She has been for as long as I've been alive. She lies, cheats, steals and hurts other people just to get her fix. Well, she got pregnant accidentally. She was put in jail for meth with intent to distribute, shoplifting, and tresspassing. I'm not sure how long she's going to be there or if she's going to get any prison time.

Me and my fiance and dog are a happy, stable little family despite what I grew up with. I made a life for myself. I am in nursing school and my fiance is getting his phd in 2 years. Ever since my mom got pregnant, everyone in the family is basically expecting us to take the baby. We do not want to. We are both students and while we live comfortably on his stipend and my disability, there are things I want to do before I have a child. Also, I am schizophrenic and I'm not ready to have a child until a few years after that goes into remission. 

My grandma, aunts, uncles, and cousins all seriously expect me to take this baby. They have told me that. How do I tell them no and make them understand our POV?

10,"So my (F 20) mom (F 40s) offered my apartment for a friend's kid to use (M 19) for this weekend without asking me



UPDATE: After having a long talk to my mom and telling her it's not her place to let people stay here, especially without my permission, she messaged the kid and told him she should have asked me first and didn't realize how much I had going on. She apologized to both me and him. She was extremely apologetic because she had no intentions to ruin my plans; she basically thought he would just be sleeping here and doing his own thing. 

She's not a mean person or a jerk, she had a bad call in judgement and was just trying to be helpful. She now knows that this is not okay and it'll never happen again. 

*I read and responded to a lot of comments and am very grateful for everyone who told me to put my foot down and have a good time this weekend.




So I live about 6 hours away from my mom in my college town. I've lived here for three years and this is my first time renting a one bedroom apartment.

My mom and I were both extremely excited that I got my own place. She has a habit of making herself feel right at home and acts as if it's her's sometimes. It's never bothered me too much, only annoying once in awhile, plus she's only here every couple of months.

But today she offered my apartment for a friend's kid (who I know and get along with decently) so he had a place to stay while visiting my college town. Again, normally this wouldn't be an issue but it's super last minute, he would be coming tonight. And I have an insane amount of plans since it's my 21st birthday this weekend and it's the weekend before Halloween (my absolute favorite holiday).

It's not like I can let him come and go whenever. I only have one key. So I would have to let him into the apartment and be here when he left to lock the door.

But now if I tell him he can't use my place then I look like a jerk since it's already been offered. And if he does stay here I can't do a lot of my plans that me and my boyfriend wanted to do to celebrate.

I really need advice on what I should do.

TLDR: my mom offered my apartment to a friend's kid that's coming to visit my college. It's by 21st birthday weekend and can't let him just come and go since there's one key. 

EDIT: My mother isn't trying to ruin my plans or put me in a tough situation. She's just a very happy to help kind of person. And in my small town everyone's parents are like this because they know each other.
This doesn't excuse her doing this though by no means but she's not trying to be a jerk and is just trying to be helpful.

EDIT 2: I keep getting asked if I pay for the apartment. Which yes I do. I pay for all my own bills."
11,"How do I (early 30s) tell my student (mid 20s) to shower before class? I will NOT host the student for another class unless this is resolved.


note:: ** I own  this business / studio. **

This student has the worst BO. I noticed it during out first lesson. I was willing to forgive the bad BO because the student mentioned going on a run before our class.

I teach sewing lessons, ans as such use MANY textiles, some of which absorb smell easily. My place STANK to the sky. I had to break out the special sprays, I tossed the seat cushion used by the student, even the doorknob stank. I hung my textiles in the sun to destank. This is not hyperbole.

The 2nd lesson-- It become CLEAR this is just how this person is. Wearing the same clothes, same everything.

My lessons are not inexpensive, and from his address, I know the student lives in a very uniformly posh neighborhood. Seems like an anxious person. I'm even willing to go out on a limb and guess some of this issue isn't a question of resources, but maybe a psychological issue. This is not meth-stank, I don't think... (Meth causes a buildup of ammonia in the body and that signature methhead smell is ammonia and dissolving subcutaneous fat... this is unlikely to be that smell. I've worked wardrobe and wow, one gets super knowledgable with idiosyncratic body stanks when extras return their costumes.)

I will **NOT** host another lesson if the student doesn't take a shower and change clothing immediately before class. I spent 4 hours cleaning, spraying, and airing out my teaching space EACH TIME, and I absolutely lack the time to do this again as Halloween is peak season in my line of work.

I know the student lives with a parent, whose phone number I don't know, so I can't call the parent in as an ally. An even if I did... the student is mid 20s.

Any suggestions?

**tl;dr: I teach patternmaking and sewing lessons-- My student smells terrible and I will not host the student again if the student doesn't fix the body odor/personal hygiene issue."

15,"My best friend (25/F) thinks I (25/F) ruined a relationship and now she won't talk to me.


After high school I moved out of state for college. I always kept in touch with my best friend Anna and we kept each other informed about guys we were seeing and all that stuff. After college (about 6 months ago) I moved back to my home state but an hour away from my hometown. About a month ago I decided, since I was settled finally, to start getting back into the dating game so I joined Tinder.


Instantly I met this really awesome guy named John. It turns out that John was up in my part of the state for work but that he actually lives in my hometown. I started to realize that he looked familiar and ask if we went to elementary school together or if he attended my church as a kid. He said he just moved to the state a couple years ago and I chalked it up as him having ""one of those"" faces.


We started chatting and hit it off pretty quickly. I told him I wasn't big into social media and he said he wasn't either so we exchanged numbers and started texting to communicate. Even though he lived an hour away he commutes to my town a lot for work and since neither of us were looking for anything serious we figured this was a pretty awesome set up. After a while our conversations turned a bit sexual with some sexy pics being sent from his side and comments about hooking up when he came back. We set up a date to have lunch and meet when he got back.


During this time I had told Anna all about him and when I finally told her we were going to meet up she asked for a picture. I sent her one (not one of the sexy ones, obviously) and was surprised to find out that she had dated him for a short time (couple of weeks) a few years back. I asked if she was okay with me seeing him and she said she didn't care but that she was positive he had a girlfriend. She sent me his full name so I could find him on Facebook and sure enough he was in a relationship. I was pissed.


I instantly sent him a message confronting him. He apologized and profusely and said it was a mistake to talk to me on Tinder. I told him he should be apologizing to his girlfriend which he begged me not to tell. I told him to fuck off and blocked his number.


After that I screenshot all the messages we had sent including him admitting to his guilt and sent his girlfriend a Facebook message. I told her I felt awful for having even a small role in his potential infidelity and that I thought she should know. I haven't gotten a message back and I don't think I will. But I felt what I did was the right thing to do.


Fast forward to a couple days ago when I came back home and went out for lunch with Anna. She asked me what ending up happening with John and I told her. She instantly got furious and started saying stuff like I had ""no business interfering with another person's relationship"" and ""how could I destroy a relationship I wasn't part of."" I got really defensive and told her that he *made* me part of their relationship when he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with me. She told me I was disgusting and an awful person for what I did and that I had no business messaging John's girlfriend then paid and left. She hasn't talked to me since.


I feel like I did the right thing but the way Anna reacted and how she refuses to talk to me anymore is making me question everything. Was I right to get involved and message his girlfriend? How can I get Anna to talk to me again?


**TL;DR**: Met a guy on Tinder, turns out he had a girlfriend, message his girlfriend with screenshots and told her, best friend thinks I shouldn't have meddled and that I'm awful for doing so and won't talk to me. Did I do the right thing? How do I get my best friend to talk to me again?



"
16,"My fiance (34m) and I (28f) don't agree on what giving someone ""space"" is. How can I get us on the same page?


Fiance and I have have been together over 2 years. We get along great, complete each other, so on and so forth.

However, he is much more... physically needy than I. He wants to touch me, snuggle me, be by me, talk to me always. When I say please stop, or that's not comfortable, or please be quiet, whining ensues about how he just wants to be close to me, touch me. 

I am and introvert, I work a stressful job. I prefer quiet, alone time to decompress after work or on the weekend. I will be ready for snuggles when I'm ready. I have said this many different ways.

The last couple weeks have been especially frustrating for both of us.  Here are a few examples of events that, while minor, are creating a stressor for our relationship and intimacy. 

- We were bickering about something stupid, I went in the bedroom, closed the door and asking him to drop it. Not 1 minute later he comes back in pressing the issue. I clarified that when I close the door and go in the room I want to be alone, that doesn't mean come in. He gets mad and slams the door. (Then comes back 5 minutes later again)


- We have a king bed. Plenty of space for 2 adults. Every night I pushed to the edge with most of his body weight ok me and I'm in able to move without falling off. He gets mad when I ask him to get off of me, move over, theres a whole other side of the bed, because I'm not comfortable. It tends to end up with me switching sides to the empty one, which he just rolls that way too, or going to the couch which makes him mad. Again I clearly say, I need HALF of the bed. He's immediately spooning me and groping me after I literally asked him to lay over there.

- This weekend I just wanted to be lazy on my phone and do some crafts. Ensue whining that I'm not even watching the movie (the one I said I have no interest in watching), and hovering over my shoulder giving me unwanted commentary on my art project. 

It's getting to the point I feel MEAN because I don't know how to be more direct. ""Please leave me alone to chill out, I will come out or snuggle (or whatever) when I'm ready."" Turns into. ""What do you not understand about the door being closed?!"" I've tried explaining that his whining turns me off even more and to just let me come around, it'd be much quicker and less painful. 

I get that we have different needs and ways of showing affection, but I need to find a balance. It's so bad right now I practically flinch when he touches me. Currently the only way to have space it so physically leave my house, which creates more whining about how I don't want to spend time. 

***Ding ding ding*** I'm on on the couch writing this, he was still sleeping. He just called. ""You're not going to lay with me?"" No....I'm awake and you're sleeping. 

Guys, I need help having a constructive conversation with him so we can both be happy and comfortable in the time we spend together. 

TL;DR Fiance needs way more physical time together than I. Instead of giving me the space I ask for, he harangues me, which leaves me annoyed and not wanting any cuddle times at all. I've been very direct, but it's not getting through. Need to ideas to get this conversation going.

17,"My [29M] mom [55F], who never liked my wife [25F] or my brother [26M], is spreading a very nasty rumor about them.


My brother had autism and our mom never took this seriously or treated it as a developmental disability. To her it was rather a failing on his part. This happened despite everyone's advice and she never listened.

My brother is a very nice, caring and loyal person and despite his autism is a successful person and really does well in many aspects of his life. The two of us have a good relationship and he's also close with my wife. The two of us usually help him when he struggles with something and he trusts us.

The reason my mom doesn't like my wife is purely on her looks. She likes very girly girls while my wife is more of a tomboy. My wife has never wronged her.

She started this nonsense last year when there was a party at our uncles and I wasn't there, and my wife danced with my brother. This is not an issue to me, they can dance all they want. I'm not into dancing myself while my wife loves dancing and she usually dances with family members she's close with and she feels comfortable with.

So that night my mom called me to give me the ""news"" (I was in France for work trip at the time) and when I told her that I don't mind them dancing and she started about how intimate they were, how they were looking each other in the eyes, how they were touching each other, how my brother's hand was on her waist and moving towards her ass. I interrupted her and told her that she should drop this. She said my brother ""almost"" kissed her, and my wife would have welcomed it. I asked what she means by that and she says he looked like he was going to kiss her and she looked like she wanted him to, until they were interrupted. I just hung up on her that night.

Ever since then, she's been trying to gather evidence that my brother and wife are having sex. Of course she hasn't found anything because they're not fucking having sex. All she's found is like that, oh they sat close, oh they talked intimately, oh he liked her post on Facebook, on this oh that.

I asked her about 10 time already to stop, she hasn't listened.

My cousin called me today, she gave me the heads up that my mom has told her mom that my brother was testing her hand on my wife's ass during our other cousin's wedding, which was 2 months ago.

If my mom told her that, she's telling others.

I want to confront my mom once and for all, tell her that she needs to stop it or else I'm fucking done with her for the rest of my life. I don't know how I should do that. I've had a difficult time in my life getting my message into her head because she never listens to anyone except herself. Should I do it in person? Write a letter? How do I phrase things?

Any help is much appreciated.

19,"I (28F) found out my aunt (50s) is my biological mom.


My childhood was awful and I spent most of my 20s with a serious and untreated mental illness. I have a learning disability due to head trauma and now that I'm in college I'm having a ton of difficulty. I'm fine at working, and am a bit over an overachiever when I'm actually in the workforce. But it takes me hours to even remember what different Greek letters mean in my math-related courses. That sort of thing.

My grandma moved out of her house and we had a ton of family pictures to go through. In it was a picture of my aunt with a guy. She was pregnant and the date on the back of the picture matched to right before I was born.

My mom doesn't have any pictures of herself during any stage of her pregnancy despite being married to my dad at the time. My whole life I've been likened to my aunt, and I don't look much like my mom or dad at all. Boyfriends always comment how different my mom and I look, and she's easily put in a bad/competitive mood because I get compliments when we go out.

I kept the photo and later asked my grandma about it. She's a straight shooter. She told me mom aunt was not in a stable career and my mom and dad were stable. They adopted me when I was a few months old. And I was a kid and wouldn't understand. And then I was a teenager who was angry at everything. And then I had a mental breakdown and likely wouldn't have had a positive reaction. And then because I enrolled in college and had mentioned a few times how stressed I am.

It's more frustrating because I'm not able to have a serious conversation with either of my parents (about anything). I don't have much of a relationship with my extended family because of my mom, even though we all get along really well at family gatherings. I don't reach out much because I don't really know how, and at this point I feel like it would be weird. My dad isn't close with any of his family and though I'm friends with my cousins on Facebook, we don't talk. The only reason my dad knew his sister died was because one of my cousins reached out to me.

My aunt has a family now and she's such a good parent.

I have no idea how to process this and I'm in school full-time and work 30 hours a week. I barely have time to study enough and don't know where I would fit in time to see a therapist. And I only recently started working so much, and my Medicaid is more than likely going to run out. So I likely won't have the money anyhow.

I asked my grandma to keep it to herself that I know, but I know it's created a huge burden for her and it's unfair to ask it of her.

I have no idea how to bring this up, or who to bring it up to. My mom doesn't even know what major I am despite me being a sophomore. She doesn't remember what foods I'm allergic to, and I don't talk to her much because I'm never doing anything right. My dad is only just getting emotionally stable after a few years of being really depressed (and only talking to me about it), and he takes everything so personally and requires days and weeks of reassurance that he isn't a terrible person. My sister is special needs and wouldn't be able to understand.

I'm more sick to my stomach that I had to endure my childhood and I don't even have a relationship with my aunt. And now to see how good of a parent she is, is sort of a kick in the gut.

I'm not sure where to turn.

TL;DR: found out my biological parent is my aunt, who I am not close with. I'm not able to talk to my parents about it, and I don't know but to ask my aunt. It feels like I'm drowning."

21,"My gf (18m) hit my brother (19m) because he hit me (19m), my family is demanding she apologizes.


Sorry for any misspellings, I'm on mobile.
 
I mean (18f) btw.

Just to preface this, my brother has known anger issues, and I try not to push his buttons. 

Earlier today, my brother came up to pick up some items he left at my house a couple months ago and we started arguing about his way of life. My girlfriend was home and was in the room when this arguing started. 

The argument started escalating and he started screaming at me, and I knew he was gonna get violent soon and I was trying to calm him down. I didn't want our neighbors to call the cops and just wanted to situation to de escalate. My girlfriend came out of the room and told him to step off and just get his shit and go. That made him even more angrier and he started screaming and jumping up and down telling me he was gonna ""lose it."" My girlfriend then told him that if he put his hands on me, she was gonna "" knock him out, get your shit and go."" He didn't listen and started pushing me and he ended up trying to choke me. My girlfriend then came from behind him and hit him with a wine rack across his back, which caused him to stop. My (heavily pregnant) mom managed to coax him back into the car and away from the situation with all of his stuff. 

She left him with 4 long welts across his back which are probably gonna bruise, but she doesn't feel bad. To be honest I don't feel bad either because he was warned by her to just leave. My family is now demanding that she apologizes for hitting him, but I don't think she should because she was trying to protect me. They say she shouldn't have gotten in the middle, that brothers fight like this all time, and that I should've just handled the situation in a better way without getting her involved. I mean, in her defense this was happening in our house and he was threatening to destroy her decor, so I think she was heavily pissed off by that too. 

TL;DR 

brother got violent with me and hit me, gf went full mama bear and hit him back. family is now demanding she apologizes.

I kicked her out of my apartment and let her sleep in the hallway and I spent the night at a friends house. I am very emotionally traumatized and still in pain.

29,"Me [26/M] with girlfriend of 4 months [27/F]. Our friends are warning me about her “odd behaviors”. Am I blind/ignoring warning signs? Red Flags? Starting to doubt myself.


I’ve known my current GF for about a year. We met through friends and were casual acquaintances. She was dating someone sort of on/off and he put an end to it just before Christmas of last year. We stayed casual acquaintances until this summer and then began seeing each other. Official for four months. 

Friends have commented on her “odd habits” that have ruined relationships in the past. At drinks, a few of my friends warned me. That was followed-up by one of girlfriends asking me to give her an honest chance. 

From the outside, she looks completely, totally, normal. She’s amazing looking, well poised and just a really great sociable person. When we’re alone, she’s a lot more confessional about her social anxiety, esp. worried about hurting people’s feelings and worried she’s committed some transgressions. All things I’ve dealt with in a relationship before. She has mild/moderate OCD which she gets therapy for.  

I guess her odd behavior or habit is that she has this thing where she likes to play with my hair, for hours on end. We can watch a movie with her playing with my hair. She keeps asking if it bothers me or if I am annoyed. It neither bothers nor annoys me. 

I finally asked my friends to clarify and they went through a litany of “weird” things. She does every single one of them.
 
* She does talk to her cats; 

* She is fastidious with folding clothes (it’s impressive to watch); 

* She gets flustered easily in social situations and begins to profusely sweat; 

* She has an odd habit of sleeping with her arm under her SO/ my clothes; 

* She gets very “comfortable” around her SOs pretty quickly; 

* She’s very direct about how she envisions her future; 

* She has a bit of a “wild” past; 

* She talks to herself (she’ll do it when she doesn’t think anyone is around/notices); 

* She orders/alphabetizes everything and will fix it if it gets out of order; 

* Her fridge is all put into special containers and ordered by categories  (sauces in sauce section, meats in meats, leftovers with leftovers);

* She brushes her teeth ~3 or 4 times a day; 

* She can be very forthright: she’ll ask (rhetorically) if she has bad BO then smell her pits, can’t decide and then ask me. 


None of this strikes me as critically odd/Red Flag, but everyone seems to think I'm blind to it..... Am I? Am I missing flags here?

I met her parents and they’re lovely people who seemed a bit… like maybe I was going to dump her, too. They were very lovely but guarded, made sure I knew she was a really great girl, etc. 

Am I totally off the wall or are my/her friends just conjuring crap in their minds?

30,"Should I go along with my [30 F] mother's [60 F] strict code of conduct for Thanksgiving?


Hey guys! This isn't as serious as some of the other relationship problems here, but it bugs me. 

So, I have a very large family and we're fairly tight knit. We get together for all of the holidays and there are 50 or so of us that show up, so holiday parties are really big events. 
  
Traditionally, Thanksgiving was always at my great aunt's house but she died a couple years ago and I took over because I was the only one who had a house big enough to accommodate all those people (and I also just really love thanksgiving!). And wowie wowza did I realize how much I'd taken my sweet great aunt for granted! It's a ton of work! I'm happy to do it because I love my family, but I have a whole new appreciation for what she did for all for all those years. 

The problem is, I'm a different generation and I do things differently than she did. No one else has commented on the way I do things, but my mom won't stop going on and on about it. For example, I'm on facebook with at least one person from each household so I set up a facebook event and invite everyone. Everyone should be able to get the info that way, but if there's someone who didn't I can call them. My mother was horrified. The tradition is that you call the people who are basically the elders (in their 70's) on the phone to invite them. The elders are responsible for telling their children about the dinner. I pointed out that I invited all the children (who are all married and in their 30's and 40's) and why can't they just tell their parents? After all, I've never gotten a call inviting me to Thanksgiving. For all those years, my great aunt expected my mom to tell me.

The only response I got was that it's not the way it's done. You call the parents and the parents tell their (grown) kids. It's disrespectful for any of the ""kids"" to be invited before their parents. Fine, whatever. I'll call the elders, even though the majority are on FB with me and have no problem accepting the invite and messaging me about it. She doesn't like that I do anything online and insists that I also call the elders even if they have already seen and accepted the FB event invite. 

That one's not ridiculous, I just think it's overkill. I find the whole ""elders are invited, kids get the info secondhand"" issue kind of offensive, but whatever. 

So the next issue we disagree on is that, traditionally, the host waits until everyone else has gotten their food before they make themselves a plate. Wtf? Is this really a tradition? I'll go along with the invite thing, but after cleaning for three days, shelling out all that money, and cooking all day long, I'm not waiting for all 50 people to get their food. For one thing, half of the dishes (that I slaved over) would be gone. Secondly, there are always people who stand around talking forever. I'm not waiting for their conversations to be over. I'm hungry and exhausted. I'm eating. 

The other big ones are that I'm supposed to do the lions share of the dishes (even though other people volunteer, I'm supposed to turn them down) and I'm supposed to turn down people who offer to give me some money to offset the bill. At first at least. I can accept it, but I'm supposed to play this weird game of acting like I can't accept the money a couple of times. I'm also expected to say the prayer even though I'm an atheist. I mean, that one's not that bad, but I'm also very much NOT into public speaking. My cousin's a minister, but I can't ask him to pray because I'm the host. There are a lot of other issues, but they're little ones that don't bother me like table cloth color or whatever.

Guys, I don't know what to do. I understand that tradition is really important to her (and maybe it's important to other family members but they're just not speaking up). I don't know where to draw the line I guess. Am I making a big social faux pas by not going along with all these traditions? I feel like I'm making a big sacrifice taking this on. I'm totally happy to do it and I really love my family, but she acts like I'm ruining it by not following this exact script.

31,"Me [22F] with my brother [25M] who is an almost perfect guy and turned into my standard for men. Everyone falls short. This is unhealthy


My parents have two kids, me and my brother. We had a pretty vanilla upbringing bordering on boring. Our parents always kept us comfortable, and we fought here and there but because there's a three year difference, we didn't have a lot of overlapping things to fight over. 

My problem? My brother seems like the perfect guy and it turns him into a standard by which I judge men. And none of them are able to measure up. He has a graduate degree, an amazing job, he's kind, he does charity stuff for fun. He paid off my parents' mortgage a year after getting a job. He treats my mom like a queen, he makes sure my dad's needs and concerns are always met. He fixes random things around my parents' house whenever they are broken without being asked. Our aunt was in the hospital and her kids couldn't fly in from overseas the next day. So he called off work, bought my dad and himself a ticket, and flew there himself. 

He simply hears that one of my lights are out on my car and a day later he's already replaced it. He takes care of himself, he's been awesome to every girlfriend he's ever had, including the one he is with now. He's strong, capable, and accomplished. He's funny and good with kids, and the only thing I've hated about him is when he stopped including me in his social life when he was a teenager and treated me like a nuisance. That lasted for a couple of years and then we ended up back to friends who could enjoy movies together and have a good time. I hate saying this but he's just.....a seemingly perfect man who takes care of his shit and then acts like he has no stresses in his life. 

I have had a number of healthy relationships, but I've realized I have a really unhealthy problem. None of the guys I date are able to ""measure up"" to the standard for what a ""good guy"" should be that I have in front of me all the time. I know this is not healthy, and I need another way of looking at this. I know I need to recognize that he's an outlier in at least some ways. None of his friends are where he is in any aspect of his life.

TLDR: My (22/F) brother (25/M) is an almost perfect man, and has turned into the standard by which I judge men I am involved with. They all fall short. That's unhealthy and I'm not sure what to do about it. How do I separate the example in front of me, from my own relationship/romantic life?"

I didn’t want to make the last few weeks of living at home more stressful, as they were already unhappy I was moving period. 

I have a lot of clothes, both which I bought myself and my mom bought for me left at my parents in my old room. I couldn’t fit all of it in the moving truck so I just packed the necessities and thought I’d pick the rest up during the holidays. 

I have nice work stuff. Dresses, blazers, shoes, boots, luggage, you name it. A whole closet full. When I’ve asked for them back before, my mom always just says, “Well some honesty needs to come to the table and we need to talk about all of the lies because it’s in my house.” My brother says she barricaded my closet so no one can get in. I don’t want to talk about my life decisions.  It’s my life. I don’t want to feed my mom’s desire to know every personal detail of my life.  My dad is very passive and does whatever my mom wants and I don’t think he would be much help. 

I’m going for Thanksgiving in a few weeks but I really need my stuff back. It makes me and my boyfriend very angry she is doing this.  What should I do?

36,"I'm [31F] having mixed emotions about my friends who are having kids.


 
  **tl;dr**: I feel like a terrible human being for being kinda bummed that all my friends are getting pregnant.

Basically I feel like a terrible person and can't admit this to anyone. I'm 31 and getting married somewhat late for my group of friends. I lived abroad and took some time off before changing careers when they were all getting married back home. Almost of them have babies, or are starting on their second. FH and I are preparing for our upcoming wedding next year and I know one of my bffs is going to start IVF next month. My absolute dearest friend in the world who I'll ask to be my MOH just called me before I could ask her now to tell me that she, too is pregnant. For some reason this hit me like a ton of bricks. It's not as superficial as 'omgggg we can't party like we used to!"" but more of a sensation of nostalgia and longing for the past. And even a twinge of jealously if i'm being completely transparent..I'm having a realization that things will never be like they used to be. I view my friend's infants as these little responsibilities that are essentially stealing my friends away from me. I know how ridiculous, immature and self-absorbed I sound. And anyone reading this would probably think I just flat-out hate kids. But that's the thing, I don't, I adore kids (I'm a teacher). I'm just in a really weird place now and feel kind of sad. On top of feeling guilty and self-absorbed for not feeling 100% elated for my friends! Can anyone else relate? Am I an awful human?"
37,"I'm (F/27) not sure how to approach a situation with my little cousin (F/8) because her fundamentalist christian dad (M/45) ripped up and threw away her princess costume because it's ""the devil"".


Hi everyone.

My heart is broken because today my little cousin Liz (F/8) called me today to tell me what her dad did to her dress. My cousin comes from a troubled family. My aunt (F/45) is schizophrenic, depressed, and morbidly obese, and her husband is a fundamentalist christian and alcoholic. Not the best recipe for parents. Unsurprisingly, my older cousin and Liz's older brother Jay (M/25) is in the state pen serving out a 3 year sentence for assault I believe. 

I live about 6 hours away from my parents and Liz, but I always make it a point to visit her and pick her up and take her to places. I try to be a positive influence because I know she has it tough, and I realized I had to step in when she called me via FB messenger when she was 6 and asked me if she could get a Christmas present from me because her parents don't have money this year and her brother is in jail. This was about 2 years ago, and since then, I've made it a point to call her a few times a month and chat about school, reading, her friends, and her goals. 

Last year, I took her to Disneyland for the first time. We were there from opening until closing and she never complained even once about how tired she was until I realized it when she wouldn't wake up while I was shaking her for 20 minutes after our car ride home. She had a blast!! My sisters (F/32 &amp; F/ 21) also came with us and my little sister worked on a princess autograph book and helped her get signatures and pictures with all the princesses so she could have that memory forever. I bought her a yellow belle gown which she wore proudly that day as she received many complements and was just beaming with confidence. My older sister bought her a crown and some costume jewelry and curled her hair. It was amazing, and she talked all about it and all the rides and princesses for a year. 

Well next week, I am picking her up for a costume birthday party of another niece, and the theme is Beauty and the Beast. I thought how perfect, I could take Liz, and she could wear her gown again. So she was very excited to attend and after we made all the plans, I told her to make sure she brings her gown so she could wear it. Then the conversation went like this:

&gt;Liz: ummm I don't really want to dress up next weekend.

&gt;Me: why not Lizzy? its a theme party and ill be dressing up too. plus you have a beautiful dress you can wear!

&gt;Liz: ummm I don't know. Sometimes I like to wear normal clothes to parties. 

&gt;Me: Ok thats ok if you want to wear your clothes. Are you sure you don't want to just bring it and wear it for an hour then we can change you into something more comfortable?

&gt;Liz: Yeah, Im sure. Ill just wear my clothes. 

&gt;Me: (I sensed in her voice some sadness and reluctance) OK, do you still have the dress?

&gt;Liz: (whispering) I don't want you to get mad at me.

&gt;Me: Im not going to be mad at you. Thats ok. you can tell me. Did you give it away? Don't worry Lizzy Im not going to be mad at you for telling me the truth. Its ok.

&gt;Liz: Well its because my dad ripped the dress up in front of me because he said its the devil. 

&gt;Me: Aww thats too bad Lizzy. Do you still have it? Maybe I can fix it for you.

&gt;Liz: No he ripped it up in front of me then threw it in the trash. I tried to tell him its just a princess daddy! But he said no its the devil. Then he took my photo book and ripped and threw away all of the pictures with the yellow dress. The other princesses he left them because he didn't know who they were and even belle in the blue dress he left because he didn't know who it was. 

&gt;Me: aww im so sorry he did that honey. It will be ok. and don't worry about the dress ok? Im not mad at you and what he did was not your fault.

&gt;Liz: OK. (lightened up) It made me really sad because its a princess. but he told me that the beast looks like the devil so I can't wear it anymore. 

Reddit, I am livid. It broke my heart that he could take something so positive that we did for my baby cousin and destroy it in front of her eyes and confuse her. We had chosen a belle dress for her because belle loves to read and we thought it would make a great influence for her, because she lives in the projects and the best chance she's going to get is through working hard in school, which we are trying to make sure of. She's currently working really hard trying to earn student of the month so that we can take her to Disneyland again. This is the kind of parenting that really screwed up my cousin Jay- always restricting him from normal things and trying to instill this deep fear of god which didn't even work! He just grew up resentful and rebellious.  

It makes me so angry that her dad could 1. be so ungrateful about the whole experience that she cherished so much and that we provided for her 2. make her confused about what is good and what is bad aka ""the devil"" 3. display so much aggression to a sensitive 8 year old child by ripping apart her cherished princess dress. I am so angry and don't know how I should handle this when I see her. On one hand, I want to tell her that what her dad did was wrong, and its not true that princess belle is a devil. But I worry that this may confuse her further as I would be instilling doubt in her dad and her trust in his parenting and teachings (despite how wrong and awful I may think it is, he is still her dad). I also feel awful that all the kids and adults will be dressing up next week and she won't because her dad ripped up her costume in front of her. She sounds really excited about the party and Im not sure if I should just buy her a second dress, maybe the blue one, and give her the option of wearing it or not, and definitely not allowing her to take it home this time. And finally, my mom (F/55) found out and she's pissed. She wants to call him and give him some choice words and yell at my aunt who is her sister, but I worry that this will cause him to be angry at Liz which I definitely don't want. I want her to be able to confide in me and trust me. So I told my mom to hold off on that.

So, what do I do? How do I explain to her that her dad is wrong for doing what he did. Should I buy her another costume? I was wanting to buy her a science kit for Christmas this year but now I fear that her dad may disapprove and break it also. He's that crazy and thinks all science is bad because evolution is a teaching of the devil. I also worry he will tear apart her Disney princess story book I bought her last year. I'm just not sure how to proceed. Please, any advice is helpful. thank you for reading.




**Edit** First of all, thank you all for your taking the time to give me advice on this terrible situation. I am reading every single comment and taking it all in. 

Also, I have received a few messages with people wanting to help in some way. I was thinking it would be so amazing for her if people could donate books at her reading level since she has none except for the large princess storybook I bought her last year. It would be great to start a little library for her that maybe her dad won't rip apart. Im going to set up a PO box for her if there is enough people interested in donating. Please private message me if that is the case. Thank you all for your kind words. 


**Edit 2** Hello again everyone! Someone suggested I make an Amazon wishlist in case anyone wants to send Lizzie a book. Thank you in advance for helping me make a negative experience for her into something ultimately positive. Here is the list:

http://a.co/967rNCV

Any risky books will be kept for her safely in my moms home in Lizzie's corner that I will set up for her safekeeping. Other less risky books I will have her take them home. I'm thinking of setting up a reward system for her to submit summaries to me in exchange for fun prizes. Please also message me if you think of a good book that touched your heart when you were 8 years old and want me to add it to the list! Thank you everyone for your amazing suggestions and input. You have all truly brought me to tears with your kindness and caring words. I will update soon.

Should I allow my mom to yell at him for being so cruel?"

My brother is 6 years older than me and in his very early 30s. He is married and has 2 children and one of the way! He has bounced around between jobs in the last 5 years.  The company he is currently working for is going under and he has been applying for jobs. However, it isn't working out for him and he is very stressed. He is great at sending out resumes and continuing applying. However, where he lives is not a good place for his career. In addition, he is pretty new still to his field.

I am in my late 20s and I am in business. I love networking and have a huge passion for it. I love connecting people and helping people get jobs. A couple of years ago I set my brother up with a very high up manger (very high) in the field my brother is in. I called him afterwards and he told me he didn't show because he changed his mind. I was furious because that connection is now used up and I could have helped somebody else use that network. In addition, is ruined my reputation with that person. I moved on though and didn't say anything.

However, yesterday my brother came to me really stressed. He has applied pretty much everywhere and nothing is working. He needs a job now and need insurance for the new baby coming etc. His wife is stay at home etc and he asked for my help in networking and getting him a job. 

It was a long talk; however, I told him I would think about it. He left very upset and angry. I didn't lay anything out in detail; however, told him he burned me in the past and will think about it.

Reddit, I don't know what to do. My brother constantly changes job (7 jobs in the last 4 years!) and does the bare minimum. I do not think he is a great employee at all. He always does the best for him and is willing to jump ship whenever. My sister set him up somewhere and he changed jobs within a couple of months. 

I love networking and my connections. I have a couple of people I could talk to that have great positions available. However, I don't want to burn those bridges if he screws it up. In addition, I am very proud of my networking skills and have a lot of respect and professionalism towards networking. I feel my brother just uses it to get what he wants. He also refuses to dress professionally and ignores dress code mostly to dress in jeans or looks like a mess is wrinkly clothes. 

On the other hand, is my reputation more important than his happiness and stability? It makes me feel so selfish!

Help! 

Tldr: I networking for a lot of people and am known for my connections. My brother who is very flaky and changes jobs all the time is asking for my help. He has already sunk one of the most important connections I had and I really don't think he is a good employee. What should I do?"

Hi guys &amp; gals! I have a bit of a situation and I'd really love some insight. Long post ahead.

As the title says, I've known this guy for about 5 months - he's a coworker in that we work in the same department but on very different projects, so I don't work with him directly. He's a cool person, and we've become close friends in the past few months. **However, he flirts with me constantly.**

Early on, I disregarded it and told myself that was just how he acted with everyone. I confronted him about it and he said it was all in good fun. That's fine - simple, occasional playful flirting is harmless. However, some of the things he's done over the past few months have been waaaaaayyy over the line for ""friendly"" flirting. He's talked often about sex positions (particularly sex positions he'd like to experience with me), he's playfully partially unzipped my skirt ""to see what color my underwear is,"" and he's joked multiple times about us running away together and eloping (weird?). He's positioned himself in front of me and leaned in as if he's going to kiss me. We've also gone out together with a group of friends, and he repeatedly grabbed and touched me in ways that couldn't possibly be only friendly flirting. He's also told me repeatedly that I'm one of his favorite people, that I'm wonderful, blah blah blah - not flirting, but making me wonder if he thought of me as more than a friend.

Here is where I should mention that I've had a crush on him since like Day 2, and that's grown as I've gotten to know him to the point where I really really really like him. Here is also where I should mention that he's had a hookup buddy since before I met him. I've tried to ignore my feelings for him and stuff them down inside in hopes that they'll go away, and it mostly worked. The feelings recently came back full-force x 100000.

Fast-forward a few weeks to the present. I can't stop thinking about him and the fact that the feelings are again intense and front-and-center made me realize that they were never really gone. (Of note, my workplace doesn't have any kind of policy against romantic relationships and actually boasts about how many couples met at work.)

Reddit, you already know what is coming...I confessed my feelings for him. Being the stupid person I am, I did it via text (we text back and forth most nights after work). No response. For two days. He avoided me at work, so I sent him another text asking if we could talk in person. No response. Cringe. Sent him another message saying that I didn't expect him to feel the same way and that his lack of response convinced me that he considered me to only be a friend. I apologized for making things awkward and then said that it was a relief to be on the same page about it.

His response? ""We've never not been on that page."" He then reiterated what I said about thinking of me as a friend, and said that he has no interest in a romantic relationship with me. He also said that he was surprised that I thought he might feel otherwise. Ouch. What the fuck?

I got angry. Like the really deep, fuming kind of angry that you can feel in your stomach. I accept that he doesn't feel the same way, but I do not accept his behavior. I asked him why he continuously flirted if he was never interested. He said that it was all friendly flirting, and that I shouldn't have taken it so seriously. He said I needed to learn to ""take everything as the cat and mouse game that it is."" I then asked him why he flirted so intensely and brought up specific instances where I thought he very much crossed the line if it was all in fun. He didn't have an explanation. I feel so manipulated, humiliated, and most of all, furious. Honestly, what the fuck?

Okay Reddit. This is where I need some help - please be harsh if necessary. If he has never thought of me that way, then why did he flirt so intensely? Why did he continue if he knew I was falling for him? Why did he refuse to respond when I told him how I felt? Why was he an asshole when he finally did respond? What was the fucking point? Where did I screw up? What am I missing? Why does he think he did nothing wrong?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your responses! It can be challenging to see things clearly when emotion is clouding your vision. Ended up sending him a message saying how it wasn't right for him to lead me on and that I really misjudged his character. His response shocked me, and further solidified the conclusions that you all made: he's a fucking scumbag.

  tl;dr: Friend's extreme flirting led me to think he had romantic interest, I confessed my feelings for him, and he insists that it was only ""friendly flirting"" all along"
50,"My [26 F] husband [31 M] of 4 years said disrespectful things about me to BIL and his friend. My feelings are hurt and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.


[removed]"
51,"I [29 M] kicked my friend [36 M] out last night for upsetting my friend/neighbor [25 F]


I live in an apartment with my friend [32 M].  We've lived together for over a year without any major issues.  There's a girl [25 F] that lives across that hall that we quickly befriended.  She hangs out with us all the time.  We cook meals together, watch tv together, play video games together.  She's over at our apartment almost as much as she's in her's.  It's important to note that she works for a professional sports team.

My roommate has a friend [36 M] that he regularly invites over to hang out with us.  I'm not a big fan of the guy.  I don't share his sense of humor, and generally find him to be loud, argumentative, and obnoxious.  However, I'm not about to tell my roommate he can't invite his friends to our apartment, especially when my roommate and neighbor enjoy having him around.  I try to tolerate his presence, otherwise I just retreat to my room.

Last night, I got home around 9 to find my roommate wasn't home and my neighbor and my roommate's friend watching the game of the team she works for, which is not unusual.  We have a larger TV, so she'll often come over to watch the game even if me and my roommate aren't home.  Everything was fine until I had to take a phone call, so I went into my room for about 15 minutes.  When I came back out, my neighbor and my roommate's friend were having a heated discussion.  Like I said, he can be very argumentative.  Sometimes I feel like he starts arguments just for the sake of arguing.  Again, not anything new and not anything that has ever caused any significant issue.  This time was different though.

From what I gathered, they were talking about the players, and he asked her if she would accept advances from one of the players, to which she said absolutely not.  He dismissed her response saying ""I don't believe that.""  My neighbor found this incredibly offensive.  The way she describes it, it's hard enough being a woman working in sports trying to be taken seriously.  It's even worse when people think all women in sports would jump at the chance to bang a player.  She considers herself a professional, and was incredibly offended by the thought that she would jeopardize her career and her reputation to hook up with a player.  It was obvious from her voice and her body language that this was a very serious topic for her, and not one to be taken lightly.

Apparently he kept trying to deflect, and instead of apologizing for offending her, kept trying to say that wasn't what he said, and that wasn't what he meant.  He just kept continuing an unnecessary argument that was obviously a big deal to her.  This was around the time I came in, so I said to him ""You should just stop.  You're talking yourself into a hole.""  But he didn't get the hint.  The argument kept escalating, and I kept getting increasingly uncomfortable.  At one point, he asked my opinion on something, and I replied something along the lines of ""I just want this conversation to stop, because I'm getting increasingly uncomfortable in my own apartment,"" giving him another chance to drop it, but he wouldn't.  He kept trying to explain why what he said wasn't so bad.  Meanwhile, my neighbor is clearly getting more and more upset, to an extent I had never seen before.  She tries to explain why she's  upset, and why she's even more upset that instead of apologizing and moving on, he keeps rehashing everything.  She says ""Whatever, I'm done,"" and tries to disengage.  He says ""I'm done too"" but then immediately goes right back into it.  Saying stuff about how we always make him out to be the bad guy.  I say ""Obviously you're not done, because you won't stop talking about it."" 

It keeps going like that for a while, and everything just feels tense.  It's obvious emotions are running extremely high, so when they both agree to drop it, I hoped it was finally over.  Which it was, for about 15 seconds of uncomfortable silence, until he starts back up again.  At this point, the argument had been going for 15 minutes from when I walked in.  It's already starting to get late, and the game is almost done, so I say to him ""Maybe you should just leave.""  He says, ""What, you're kicking me out?""  I say, ""I mean, I don't know what to say.  Obviously we can't get past this.""   He agrees to leave, and leaves about a minute or two later.

I didn't know what else to do.  She was visibly upset, and looked like she was on the verge of tears.  Did I handle that correctly?  I just don't get how someone couldn't see how upset she was getting and couldn't let it go.  I've got a brother on the spectrum, and even he knows to drop it when someone tells him to drop it.  Also, how should I frame the discussion with my roommate when I see him tonight?   He's almost certainly going to ask me what happened.  Even more importantly, what should I say to his friend next time I see him?  We work together (he actually helped me get the job a few years back), so even if I don't see him at the apartment soon, I'm sure to run into him when I see him.  Can I just pretend it didn't happen?

54,"Ready to end an almost 5 year friendship between me (27f) and this couple (both 30, m, f) over their disrespect


So I met this couple through my BF, almost 5 years ago. I've always got along well enough with them, but they are definitely more my BF's friends than mine. They are each 30, and me and my BF are late 20's. He grew up with both of them and has known them his entire life. 

I'm ready to quit the friendship, or at least stop putting any effort into it on my part. They are chronically late people, when we have get togethers. Like, they will arrive anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours later than they said they would. It doesn't matter if it's meeting for dinner at a restaurant, going to a movie, meeting at our place, or anything. They are late. 

They used to get upset we preferred not to car pool, and we would be eating our food at the restaurant when they arrived. We would wait up to 30 min before ordering our meals, and be nearly finished eating by the time they arrived. They don't get upset over this anymore, because we no longer go out to eat with them. 

Me and my BF have two toddlers, and this couple has one toddler. We thought it would be great for our kids to play together, but our friends would only want to have play dates at their house instead of ours, because they don't like the time it took to load their kid up in a car seat, and we snapped on them one too many times about showing up to our house late, and having our kids napping by the time they arrived because we have schedules to stick to and planned for them to be there at a certain time for a reason. 

Anyways, that's the gist of the chronically late history. 

My BF and me moved and bought a house a few months ago, a couple hours away from these friends. We've been planning to have them come visit and spend the night since we moved and they keep cancelling last minute. So finally they agree to come this weekend. 

Only now, the girl has texted me and changed plans half a dozen times. First we agreed on them coming at noon, staying for dinner, and going home. So me and my BF made other plans for sunday. But now, now they want to spend the night, and not show up till 8pm because they want to visit other people in our area too. I told them this doesn't work for us as we had plans with them for one day, and are busy the next. They then flip flopped on the time they will arrive so many fucking times that this morning the final plan was that they would be here after supper, stay the night and leave in the morning. But now they are showing up before dinner, and bringing their dog! The dog is a problem. We explained we don't want the dog in our house, but it's welcome to stay outside the whole time. The dog is too excitable, attacks our cats and children, and is not allowed in our house. Pretty basic and understandable rule. It's our house. We don't want to stress our kids and cats out with your beast of an untrained animal. 

The girl is throwing a fit over text to me now about how the dog is her baby and she doesn't want to visit anymore because it's too cold to keep him outside and why can't we lock our cats in a room and keep all the kids in the play room all evening. Omg. 

Also, I didn't plan for dinner for extra people, am out of groceries to cook more food, don't have ingredients to cook for this girls special diet, and we can't afford to eat out at a restaurant this weekend. 

I've passed the communication over to my BF and told him to deal with the mess and that I don't want the stress of having his friends over to visit anymore. They've stressed me out for a week flip flopping on plans, and the day of our plans they change them again. I don't feel respected one bit. 


TLDR 

My Bfs (28m) long term friends, both 30 years old, have flip flopped on plan making for as long as I've known them. They've given me a headache all week with changing things around, as I'm trying to schedule and budget and plan my own life and families life around their upcoming visit, and they just threw a wrench in the spokes. They also treat their dog better than their kid, or our family, and I can't stand that either. I'm ready to quit the friendship because these people are just chronically late, and horrible to plan things with, and assume I'm made of money. "

58,"Me (27F) and my husband (32M) of 5 years, he is constantly touching me sexually and I don't like it


My husband touches me constantly and it's bothering me more and more lately. I would appreciate advice and/or ideas on how we can resolve this in a way that works for both of us.


I'm a SAHM to two kids, ages 3 and 5 months. I love my kids and I'm happy as a SAHM but I think this is also part of my problem here. I used to like being touched, sure there were times he went too far and it got annoying but I was fine with it most of the time. I want to get back to that place where I liked it and took it as a compliment but I just can't for some reason. I love my husband and I feel bad about rejecting him as well as some of the thoughts I have when he touches me. 

That said, I do find it annoying and somewhat disrespectful. He will sit next to me and try to kiss on my shoulder and neck while rubbing on my back, underneath my shirt, as I breastfeed our baby. He comes up behind me in the kitchen and feels me up out of nowhere. I'm usually caught off guard and scared when he does it. My mind is on a thousand different things while I'm cooking and sex is rarely one of them. I don't want to be groped while I'm preparing food, cleaning, and usually going over all of the things that still need to get accomplished before bed. 

On Saturday night (nearly midnight) he tried to get some while I was folding laundry totally exhausted, like half asleep kind of exhausted. I pushed him away and started crying, which caused him to ask what he did wrong and it spiraled into a small argument. I want him to respect my body and give me some space. I feel like I only exist to fulfill other people's needs, like they're all just waiting for a piece of me. In addition to that I feel incredibly guilty about it. This has put me into a weird place mentally and I'm a mess right now.

My feelings about this make no sense, which makes me even more frustrated about the situation. I'm physically attracted to him. He's a good father and husband. His ""worst"" quality is that he wants to have sex with me. I don't know what to do about this but I know something has to change. I hate that I feel so deeply disrespected by the man that I love more than anything in the world. I'm not exaggerating when I say this has really messed with my head. I *know* he has good intentions but I have negative feelings about it anyway. I feel used sometimes and it hurts my feelings when I think he only wants sex. It's hard for me to switch from one mindset to another, more so when we haven't had much emotional connection in months. I'm having emotional episodes frequently. I cry almost daily. We had sex yesterday and I wasn't into it at all, I was thinking about everything I needed to do after he was finished. I'm always tired. There is always something I need to do. I'm constantly behind these days and can't seem to get caught up. I feel like I'm failing at everything right now. I'm overwhelmed despite having a pretty easy life and I hate myself for it. 

I'm not sure how to move past this. I don't expect my husband to change dramatically but I don't see myself being receptive to the kind of touching (and frequency) he likes any time soon. Is there anything I can do to change my feelings and/or reactions? 

**Edit:** Someone suggested I edit this post to include we have an active sex life. I take his needs seriously and we have sex on average four times a week right now. I keep track of it with an app just to help prevent me from falling off in that area of our relationship. I love my husband and I don't take him for granted or see him as a walking paycheck. I honesty feel terrible about myself over this and I know it's my fault. It isn't fair to ask him to compromise but I think that's something I need at this stage in life. Also, I think it's worth mentioning that the last 4 years of my life have consisted of being pregnant or breastfeeding. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask my husband to give me a little space and time to adjust. 

Instead of ""His ""worst"" quality is that he wants to have sex with me."" I should have written the ""worst"" thing about him is that he wants to touch me sexually all the time. I do not think he expects it to lead to sex every time he touches me. 

**Update:** I want to thank everyone who gave me advice on this, a lot of it helped and I was able to use your advice when we talked last night. We didn't have much time and I was really tired so we're going to talk again tonight but overall I'm happy with the outcome of our conversation.

Reading through the comments helped me realize that this is about me mostly but I can still reach out to him for help while I work through this. He actually needs and deserves to know how I'm feeling.

I think I did a good job of communicating my feelings without being accusatory or making light of the way he expresses love and affection. He didn't seem upset or offended at all, he actually said he was glad I opened up about it. He wasn't aware that it was a much bigger deal to me and causing me to feel disrespected or like my body didn't belong to me anymore. He listened to everything I had to say and I think we came up with some ideas that will help me to feel better and hopefully more like myself eventually.

- we're going to work on getting the baby to take a bottle

- the kids can be left with other people, I need to get over my anxiety

- I need to be less obsessive about the house, laundry, and other chores

- we're going to prioritize time for me to be alone or get out of the house more, I sometimes go 2-3 days without leaving and didn't realize it until we were talking about it

- he's going to be more understanding in general about the touching and make more of an effort to do it in a non sexual way. thanks to those who mentioned this because it hadn't occurred to me but makes a lot of sense. 

I feel better now that we've talked. I'm glad I posted this and thank you again for the advice, it was helpful and very much appreciated.

62,"Love my [37 M] girlfriend [37 F] of 2 years but her demanding hobby puts me off further commitment


I'll try to keep this fairly short, I've been with my girlfriend for just over two years now and whilst it's not been perfect she's the best thing that's happened to me and we've had some wonderful times together.  We live in different cities 50 miles apart so other than holidays we typically only see each other at the weekend from late Friday evening until Monday morning.  We talked about moving in together at the start of the year but for various reasons have never made any progress on this.

Last week we went away on holiday and had a great time while we were there.  The day after we got back we attended the wedding of one of her friends and whilst sat around a table socialising with some of her married friends they were making comments about how she'd come back from holiday without a ring on her finger.  Now, we have discussed marriage in the past and I know it's something she wants, the trouble is her hobby almost takes over her life 3-4 months of the year and during this time I feel very much second best.

Her passion is music and singing so she's in an operatic society.  She's on the committee and is one of the principal singers, most of the year they'll have a rehearsal on Tuesday from 8-10pm then after that go the pub until midnight, then on Fridays they go for a meal at the pub from 6-8pm.  Plus one Monday evening a month they have a committe meeting.  This was her schedule when we met and is perfectly reasonable, it makes her happy and therefore I'm fully supportive of this.

The problem (for me) is during show seasons, they perform a show on three consecutive weekends in the Autumn, two/three in December, and a full production for a week in late spring.

So her schedule for Oct &amp; Dec typically looks like this:

Monday - committee meeting 8-10 (one a month)

Tuesday - rehearsal 8-10, pub 10-12

Thurday - principals rehearsal 8-10, pub 10-12

Friday - pub meal 6-8

Saturday - Show 7:30 - 9, pub 9-11

Sunday - Principals rehearsal 2-5 (if there wasn't a show on the Saturday)

For April &amp; May it looks like this:

Monday - committee meeting 8-10 (one a month)

Tuesday - rehearsal 8-10, pub 10-12

Thurday - principals rehearsal 8-10, pub 10-12

Friday - pub meal 6-8

Sunday - principals rehearsal 2-5

She takes a week off in May when the show is in the theater, it typically runs 7:30-10 Tuesday to Saturday.

Whilst all this is going on I barely see her and even when I do she's often exhaused from working a full time job and spending time singing.

I've talked to her about this schedule before now and she agreed to give up being the society secretary at the end of the year, come the end of the year she does do this, I thought she'd then get Monday's back but no, she's not given up being on the committe so it just means she no longer has to minute the meetings.  We've also talked about her stepping back from being a principal and going back to being a member of the chorus but apparently even they still attend multiple rehearsals as show season approaches so she think it will make much difference.

So reddit, what am I to do?  The last thing I want her to do is have her give up singing for me as I know how much she loves it and that'll just breed resentment.  I've got enough hobbies and friends to keep me occupied during show seasons but I'm increasingly getting annoyed with how much time it takes up and feel like the relationship suffers because of it.

I've met, spent time with the group and get on with them, they'd like me to join but I can't sing to save my life and don't like the music they perform either so getting involved with the society is a non-starter for me. 

We're both 37 and I know she wants marriage and children but the last thing on my mind during these periods is progressing the relationship to the next level, in fact it's precisely the opposite.

I decided to go to a therapist last week, even though my husband told me that God should be my therapist, and now I am questioning whether she is good for me.


I have never really been happy in my marriage. We have been married for 4 years and have 2 kids. Long story short: I was raised in a Christian cult, turned 18 and kind of had to marry in our group. My now husband was the only option and I did not like him. Desperately wanted to escape my parents house so I spent time with him to try and fall in love. Felt physical attraction and married 3 months later. While we were saying our vows I asked myself what in the world was I doing. Relationship has always been unhappy for me, though things have gotten better in the last 2 years. 


Fast forward to recently, I told my husband that I do not believe in God anymore and it opened my eyes to his treatment towards me and that I am no longer will accept being in a marriage like this. There has been physical and emotional abuse, both which he claims either has not happened or is my fault. There's a small list of other issues including sexual incompatibility, but I won't bore you with the details.


I decided that I needed to go to therapy, I have a few personal issues to deal with besides my marriage. So I had my first session last week. I told my therapist the story of my marriage, obviously one sided. She asked me some questions like, do you even like him? She basically just asked some interesting questions that made me think about our relationship and how I truly feel about it. Most of our session was spent with her just listening to me talk about my life and her writing things down.


When I got home I told my husband pretty much everything that we talked about. He has not been happy and even called her a b*tch. He says that she is trying to turn me against him. I get that she is only getting my side of the story, but I am not fabricating issues. I even emailed her afterwards about a situation where there was physical abuse to clarify my part in it.


We are seeing a marriage counselor together this week, I am hoping that will allow me to focus more on myself with my personal therapist and less on the marriage to prevent bias since she doesn't know my husband. Anyways, how likely is it that I am receiving bad counsel from my therapist? I did like her and I felt much better afterwards. Any thoughts?

He has a citizenship here and chose to live here. For the most part he lived in France for most of his life. 

He asked if he could meet my parents soon seeing as I met his. I spoke to my parents, and they are simply not interested.

68,"I [25F] may have hurt my terrible sister's [28F] feelings by telling her not to get married


My sister is essentially a human disaster. When she was young, she would end up in juvenile detention centers because she would get in fights, or steal from stores. It was so out of control that my dad shipped her out to a boarding school. They sent her back. At eighteen, she shaved her head in the middle of the night, and refused to make eye contact with anyone the rest of the day. She carried on normally, just wouldn't stare at us directly. The next day, she glared at everyone, even if it was inappropriate for the situation.

When she was nineteen, she got married to a boy she had met at a bar and had been dating for two months. She got pregnant, and told everyone that she was going to make her baby famous. At that point, she was still living at my parents' house. She left her baby in his crib, and left in the morning without telling anybody where she was going. She turned up three years later, and demanded they ""give back what they stole."" My parents did not.

Since then, she's been married twice more. Her first husband divorced her over the baby abandonment- she never told him what she had done, and divorced him almost the second she found out she was pregnant. She was married to her second husband for five weeks, and he divorced her after she shoved him off a pier while drunk. Her third husband was her longest marriage, lasting a whopping eight months. They divorced when she ripped up family photos when his mom expressed disapproval over their relationship.

My sister has been seen by mental health professionals, and she's basically just a dysfunctional and awful person. She lives on her own now, near to my parents' house so she can visit her son. Most of her visits consist of her showing up, drinking their wine, and leaving having only said hello to him.

Now, my sister has announced that she's marrying a man who got her pregnant after dating for three months. My parents told her that she should reconsider, but she declared that it's for her baby's sake, as she wants to raise this one ""right."" They told her that she should at least try to raise her son, and she rolled her eyes and called them selfish for trying to ""take attention away from her baby.""

A few nights ago, she asked me what I thought about her fiancee. I told her that I didn't know him, but I felt like she was making a mistake. She asked me to elaborate, and I told her that she had gone through too many men to make this work. Because I can't shut up when given the chance to speak, I reminded her that she already had a baby that she'd been failing for the past eight years. I made sure to hammer in the point that she barely knew this man, all he had done was got her pregnant.

She got very quiet, then told me that I was a shitty sister, and she didn't want to talk to me again. I told her that she was a shitty person, and walked out. After that, my parents called me, and said my sister had told them about the conversation, and that while they agreed with me, they said I should've been nicer as she was very upset.

I haven't talked to her since, as I've been trying to strategize what to say to her. My sister is still my sister at the end of the day, and I want her to make the best choices she can. My nephew is also my nephew, and her new baby will also be my blood, and I love them all and want the best for them. What she's doing now won't work out for any of them, and I feel like in trying to articulate that, I just fucked up our relationship.

Can I go back on this? I meant what I said, but how can I make it better? Is there a way to apologize?

TL;DR I tried to tell my sister not to marry a man because he got her pregnant, and now we're not talking.

EDIT: Typo."
