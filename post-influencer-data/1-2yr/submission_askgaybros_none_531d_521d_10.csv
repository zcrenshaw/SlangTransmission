"Update: I was too rough with my boyfriend, not knowing he was abused


The first week after what happened was tough on both of us. He had a few panic attacks and couldn't sleep some nights because he would have nightmares about his ex. So of course I comforted him and told him not to be embarassed (he's a reserved person + I have never seen him like this) 

One night, he couldn't sleep so I stayed up with him. We were watching his favorite show and suddenly, he tells me he's surprised I still want to be with him. Then he started insulting himself and said something about not being able to satisfy my sexual needs.  It hurt to hear him say that because his ex is the reason why he thinks this way. So, I told him that I'm with him because I love/care about him and his well-being is far more important than my sexual desires. I don't want him to think I'll be mad at him for not doing things that make him uncomfortable. 

While we were cuddling before finally getting some rest, he told me no guy has ever made him feel this safe and at ease. :)

Also, he's going to start therapy.

I want to thank everyone who took time out of their day to give me some advice. "
"Signed up for reddit just to ask gaybros a question... ugh... this is awkward...


(Background info: I’m a 36 year old atheist mom of a 14 year old boy...) so, he had a shitty day a couple of weeks ago and was in tears so of course, we sat and talked... he decided to tell me he was gay and I told him that I’m grateful he could tell me(honestly... I’ve known since he was about 8 or 9). He’s really on the verge of making it public. I don’t mind, I’m not ashamed or embarrassed. I’ve told him I don’t care about his sexuality and we can figure out the grand baby situation when he’s older... he won’t be getting out of that responsibility. I say that half joking. (I’m literally going to be the most cookie baking, picture taking, vacation planning, granny’s house every weekend, Grandma that there has ever been) my question is this... am I doing this right? How do I prepare him for the backlash of a small southern religious and ignorant town? Is it weird I’m ok w him being gay but not with him dating? (He just turned 14... I think it’s a bit young) I’ve been waiting for years for him to tell me... I’ve researched statistics... I know the risk of depression, suicide and dependency in young gay men... but how is it prevented? If anything bad happens, it’s my fault. I’m his mom and my job is to prevent that... but now that it’s in the open, I feel like all the preparation I’ve tried to do means nothing. It’s like he’s my little gay egg and I’m afraid some asshole will crack him. People suck... and I will be sitting in jail w/ a smile and no regrets, if someone hurts my kid. I’ve waited so long, but now... I have no idea what to do to make sure he grows up to be a mentally healthy and happy man. Any advice is appreciated and please don’t give me shit about being overly protective.... I already know... he tells me every day... every... damn... day... 😒😒

Edit for clarification: when I said too young to date, I meant one on one dates.... group hangouts, cool... texting and flirting, cool... coming over to hang out, cool... one on one, not so cool. My other kids had the same rules, none of them died. They all have to deal with having a totally lame ass mom... and the grandkids thing... yup, I want grand babies but I don’t think he owes me any and I’m cool with a grand puppy... I’m drawing the line at a cat though.. 
I’m loving the advice and taking mental notes, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Thank you"
"I finally drew 500 dick pics from Grindr (among other places). I wanted to share my 50 favorite dick drawings with you! Some of my favorites include a professor, a movie actor, and my friend's husband (:


Hey guys!

Awhile ago I posted how I drew 100 dick pics from Grindr and decided to set a goal to draw 1,000 different dicks. Well.. I finally reached 500 dicks over the weekend. To see them all, go to my Tumblr: www.1000dickdrawings.tumblr.com A lot has happened since I first posted; I finally got the courage to come out of the closet, I was interviewed for Playboy, and I currently have my drawings in an art show! I want to note that I'm not doing this for money. I'm simply doing this because I think it's interesting and funny. (Although anyone is more than welcome to commission me if they'd like a drawing of their dick to display.)

[Here is an album of some of my favorite dick drawings](https://imgur.com/a/G14Ko) I've received from guys on Grindr, Snapchat, Twitter, and Tumblr. I attach a little note with each and every drawing as well. Ever since I started to draw dicks, things have certainly changed. For an example, I get recognized not only on Grindr for my drawings from Reddit, but I also get recognized in person too. A gentleman told me he liked my art while I was at work yesterday! (He probably just saw it on Grindr tbh)

My main goal is to someday have as much impact as artist like Robert Mapplethorpe or Andy Warhol. Right now I have a collage of my drawings in what is called the ""Gayla"" a gay art show at my university. Reactions from the guys in the collage vary; some guys have literally congratulated me on getting so far, others are scared that they'll be recognized and want their dick out of the show. It would be a dream come true if I could get into a gallery someday. My Mom is worried that because I'm getting so much attention from my dick art that I will attract bad news; she has literally expressed concern that I'll draw some guy's dick and he'll get so angry that he'll hurt me or something.

There's so much I'd like to say, but unfortunately I have to work on my presentation for my gay art class. But what I hope to achieve by drawing all of these dicks is more of an acceptance and self-love for our bodies and what we're born with. Dicks come in all shapes and sizes and we should appreciate that. I hope you find the gallery of my 50 favorite dick pics at least interesting!"
"Father of gay son, need help giving advice.


Good afternoon everyone.  I am a father of 8 kids.  6 girls and two boys.  the boys are book ends with the girls in the middle.  I kinda wanted to give you an idea what my family is.

My youngest son whom is a young teenager told me years ago that he was gay.  I have been supportive(i think) talking to him about the same stuff i did with my other kids, like who they like, whom is cute etc, about life stuff.

But we live in a community that the school he goes to doesn't have many people whom are out.  He is proud of who he is, and so am i.  He is the light that makes my days warmer.  

He is just so sad.  He eats alone in the school office so people don't see him.  He really doesn't talk to people, if he does, it's girls and the jealous boyfriends get angry. 

I talk about how it will get better out of high school.  But does it?  He's afraid he will never meet someone.  He's drowning himself right now into video games so he has people to talk to.

Please if anyone would be willing to give an old man some advice to help his son, I'm really worried.

Thank you for even taking the time to read this.

"(update) how best to support my little brother who came out today


just wanted to say thank you again for all the advice you guys gave me [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/87etqn/how_best_to_support_my_little_brother_who_came/). 

For the next couple of days my brother pretty much avoided me, which I told he might do. but today I took him to see Love, Simon. this meant he was stuck in the car with me for like 45mins since he didnt want to go to the close movie theatre, so I took him to a mall further away. on the drive there we just talked about stuff that we usually did (basically anything not related to him liking guys). He said he actually found the movie online but he didnt watch it because he wanted to go together, that was cool. Cool movie, he really liked it, but apparently the book was better lol.  

The movie also made it easier to talk to him about some of the stuff you guys had mentioned, it provided a good segue (I just learned that the word isn't segway today). He said he related to a lot of the stuff that Simon was going through, so I guess the movie helped me understand how he feels right now. this is especially so because I think our household and neighborhood attitudes share a lot of similarities with the movie's. 

 Talked to him about safe sex with condoms always, for him right now. We also talked about how he's potentially more vulnerable to be pressured into doing things he doesnt want to if someone decides to use his closeted status against him, so he may have to be mindful of that, but regardless if he needs help or advice im always here. and like a couple people DM'd me we also talked about grindr, and i told him that until he's of age grindr isn't for him, and it can lead to trouble for him and the other guy. its wrong to lie about his age because that puts them both at risk, and if he's honest about his age (as a recent 16yo) then the people on grindr who would still meet him anyway are definitely not people he should be meeting. im hoping he finds a boy his age to date tbh. 

he showed me some of his current celebrity crushes, all over the place they were, included one of actors in the movie. biggest surprise of the last week tho was definitely that he insisted he pay for the movie tickets. let me tell you, he has never insisted to pay for anything before. if you tell him that you'll cover something he'll usually put his wallet back in his pocket at Flash speed. that blew my mind. 

thanks again for the help!"
"I got a free haircut off grindr last night


I was drinking with some buddies last night since it's my day off today, got home and went on grindr. This dude who has been hitting me up for years, like years. Think since I was 18 but messaged him back like a normally do.

Asked him what he did for a living, told me he was a barber. I needed a haircut so I'm like ""wanna give me a haircut?"" And he's like im down. So he picks me up at like 12:30 since I'm in no state to drive, go to his house, he gives me a pretty solid haircut and then we just drink and chill. Didn't hook up because he ain't my type but turned out to be a chill dude.

I'm writing this from his bed while he's taking a shower before work lol.

"So, I started wearing a rainbow wristband.


I had read a few posts here about using them to put yourself out there in a subtle way, and after a friend gave me her old one, I started wearing it at work, and two guys asked me for my number yesterday! I'm really shy and don't like to put myself out there too much, so it feels really nice that I have something that can identify me in case someone doesn't know if I'm interested in guys or not."

"gay men who say “gays aren’t meant to be monogamous” or “monogamy is for straight people” should be ashamed


I HATE when people make this disgusting assumption about the gay community and the fact that some gay people enforce this narrative is disgusting. it’s okay to want to be in an open relationship if that’s your own personal decision but don’t lump in the whole gay community by reducing our sexuality as a whole to just a sexual attraction. i personally would never ever want an open relationship and would never date anyone who wanted such. god i wish the stereotype that gay men are just horny pigs would just be dispelled already but you guys make it so hard 

EDIT: READ THE POST. I stated that it is completely your business if you want to pursue an open relationship. fine. do what you want. But trying to make being in an open relationship the norm is ridiculous. This post is clearly aimed at those who try to make open relationships the epitome of homosexuality and if you’re mad you’re probably just one of those people. sorry not sorry.

EDIT: i’m not reading you guys’ long ass comments. i said what i said and i meant it. god i wish i weren’t gay."
"Aren't you sick of having to come out repeatedly ?


When I got my gay membership card, I was informed coming out would be one time affair. 

BUT NOOOO 

Aren't you annoyed by constantly having to come out over and over again ??? Having to go through with the ""oh will he turn out to be homophobic ?"" process is a constant struggle with every new friendship... "
"My friend's brother opens up to me...


The other night I went to my friend's house for her brother's birthday. It was just me, his roommate, his girlfriend, and some of his family. The guy doesn't have a lot of true friends so I was happy to be there in support.



The night goes super well. We're drinking, playing board games...the usual shenanigans. I volunteer to take my friend's brother (we'll call him David) and his roommate &amp; girlfriend home as I ended up pretty sober that night. Fast forward a bit...we make it to David's house and he asks if he can talk to me alone. I say sure.


He asks me how my family reacted to me being gay. I told him that my mother actually asked *me* and said that she had known all along. I think that acceptance is why I'm pretty open about my sexuality now. He nods and then hesitantly says, ""Well I think I might be gay, but I'm not sure, and I'm so confused and scared."" He starts like hyperventilating and I felt stunned. He talked about how he was so afraid to tell his family, how his sisters would make fun of him if they knew and not take him seriously, how he feels obligated to continue his name/bloodline (which made me feel weird but I went with it). He also tells me that sex with his girlfriend is always initiated by her and he never enjoys it.


Now here's the thing. I feel really bad for this guy because he's in a weird position at the moment. His girlfriend is extremely lazy but also extremely clingy. Anytime he is close to breaking up with her, she pulls some shit...like faking a pregnancy. It doesn't help that his girlfriend's parents actually legimately hate him too. He has been dealing with a lot of substance abuse issues (mostly drugs), his roommates bring people around that steal things from his house...his sister (who is my very good friend by the way) often has to buy him groceries, help with rent, buy him things he could really use (like a phone) because they've all just got a mess on their hands. All of this is running through my mind as he tells me his dilemma...and he says he feels stuck.


I really didn't know what to say. Eventually I told him that at the end of the day it's about his happiness, and that we've got short lives here, so even though he may step on some toes along the way...it was what you needed to do for YOU. But I also said that he shouldn't feel obligated to come out, and that he was on no one else's clock but his own.


I don't know how much of this would have gotten to him considering he was a bit drunk, but I just felt so bad for him. I didn't know what else to say beyond what I did, and that I would be here if he needed."
"I am a twink in the body of a cub


I am a 6’3 guy, big, muscular hairy guy. I am funny and charismatic bla bla bla

But the thing is, even though my body says one thing, my mind says another: I may be big but I feel like I am very small, on the inside I am extremely sensitive, very gentle and soft, I just want to be hugged and protected. Traits attributed to twinks (I don’t know why).

It’s frustrating because every time I am looking for a guy, they see me and they immediately think I am an emotionless dom top -they are basically objectifying me-, and I don’t know what to do. 

I am very young (20) but I am trying to learn.

Thank you for reading 😊."

"Uodate, spoke to my little brother.


*Update not uodate. First of all, I want to thank everyone who gave me advice.

I was mentally a mess trying to decide what to do. A part of me was saying to go into his room and demand him to delete those pics and stop being a creep. Another part of me was saying just pretend it didn't happen, like I said, towards the end of this year I'm leaving for at least 6 years so avoiding wouldn't be a problem. A part of me was saying just talk to him and figure out what's going on.

We aren't really close, he's over ten years younger than me and I moved out when he was turning 7 and before then we didn't  spend much time together because I was in multiple after school clubs and a soccer team. 

Anyways, I go to his room and knock on the door. I go in and let him know that we need to talk. He freezed up. A part of me just wanted to walk out the door. I just wasnt prepared for this. 

So I'm like, I want to talk about a few things that happened recently, I'm not mad or anything, I love you kid, i just want to set some boundaries.

I saw what was on your phone after I walked in on you in the living room.

He broke down and started apologizing.  Turns out I was right, he is gay and had been suppressing it until about a year ago. He started exploring, that's when he made an Instagram and started following a bunch of male model and youtubers. Turns out he likes fit dudes.

About that time I started visiting more often (mom's injury) and I'm used to living alone so in my apartment I sleep naked, walking around naked, do some naked basic workouts/ stretching. It's comfortable now. Also, once I started visiting more he wanted to hang out more so we did.

So when I stay over I would still sleep naked, under a blanket, work out in the backyard in just shorts, or wear some very light weight clothing that didn't leave a lot to his imagination I guess. 

He said he started getting feelings for me when he would see me working out in the backyard in just basketball shorts. He felt disgusted with himself because he would get a boner and he eventually jacked off to me.

I interrupted him there, something a few people said on my other post really hit me hard when he was saying all this so I was like, *name* you're starting to go through puberty, your body is a mess of raging hormones and I fit your type. Does it make me uncomfortable, yes, but it's not your fault you're getting a boner, and I probably should cover up some more. I thought I was alone out there, so I was freeballing and shit. I'm sorry. (I could access the backyard through my room so I didn't have to walk by anyone through the house and no one ever went outside which is why I never covered up more).

And then he continued. He said he knew it was wrong, and his head was a mess. He didn't have anyone to talk to. Like I said, we didn't have a close relationship so he figured getting closer to me would make those feelings go away. Horniness would be replaced by brotherly love.  It didn't.

It made him more confused. He had strong feelings for me but he doesn't know what it is. If it's the need to get to know his older brother, plus me constantly being barely dressed and him into fit dudes like me and being honey 24/7 and his stupid way of trying to figure it out was walking into me in the bathroom. 

He kept apologizing and I brought up the pictures he took. He swore he deleted them and showed me his phone, I told him they were on his OneDrive account and he deleted them, told me he forgot they would also be there since his oncedrive automatically uploads his pics to the cloud. 

He told me the WiFi wasn't working (router is in my room) so he came in while I was asleep and he found me naked. He took the pictures but felt bad and deleted when he got back to his room. He apologized a million times cried harder. 

Kept going on about how he's so confused, doesnt know why he's gay, why he did the things he did. How he hate himself and has no one to talk too.

I fucken hugged him. Told him he can always talk to me. That I'm not holding anything against him  we stayed like that for a while.

Anyways, I suggested we go to a therapist together, and he agreed so I'm a research that right now, probably gonna pay for this out of pocket so I can keep it between him and I.

Again. Thank you guys for helping me out, giving me some talking points. I'm a log out of this account now.

"Thank god you are not Latino (racist experience on Grindr)


So as the title says I had a racist experience, and it really upsets me.

This happened a while ago, I am Spanish, but I was living at France at the time (I spend the summer there to study french), and you know... I was living in another country, I had no family there to watch me over so..... I wanted to have a little bit of fun. And I decided to instal grindr.


I was in grindr minding my own business when this cute guy starts speaking to me, he had all the requirements I look for in a guy (that he was a dom top basically haha) and we were having fun until he said “I almost don’t talk to you because I thought you were by your name that you were Latino, thank god you are spanish”.

I was baffled by that and I asked him why did he said that and he answered “you know, Latinos are poor and dirty, I don’t trust them, spanish are European. And we europeans are far better than them”. 

I got so upset that I deleted the conversation and blocked him.

And then I stared looking profiles and some said “no Asian”, “no Arab” and “no Latinos”, wtf? How can you discriminate people for the color of their skin? Not only that but how can you feel superior to them because you are more pale?"
