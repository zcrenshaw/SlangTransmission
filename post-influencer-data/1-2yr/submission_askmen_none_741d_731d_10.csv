"What is the strangest thing you've done where you've actually gone ""what the fuck"" in hindsight?


Just hoping to realise my mishap wasn't as bad as what it was. A couple months ago during my hometowns 5 day event I went on a bit of a bender (as everyone does my age (20 y/o) that is a local for this event) and about 3 days in, in a very posh bar with a dance floor I lost my friends so I went to the bar. I started speaking to other people at the bar and one was a middle aged woman who was also absolutely steaming. I was speaking to her for about 15 minutes before we started dancing (I'm very overly friendly when drunk) and we started kissing. Then somehow it led to me fingering her on the middle of the dancefloor in front of loads of people I grew up with and people my parents know. I have literally no idea why I did that but I've been torn to shreds about it in my group chat ever since. 

Please let there be other weird/embarrassing things people have done to make me feel better"
"Why does toilet paper fall out of my guy friend's pants?


My friend group has noticed that toilet paper falls out of one of friend's pants very often and none of us no why. &amp; by often it seems to be about every day. His roommates also notice an abnormal amount of little rolled up pieces of toilet paper on their floor. When it falls out of his pants in front of people he will quickly step on it. One time one of the girls noticed it and asked and he just said he has no idea what she is talking about. 

This has been a huge mystery for our friend group and none of the other guys can figure it out too. So does anyone have an insight? "

"How does one realistically date someone who's way more attractive than they themselves are?


Now firstly, I very well know that this sub firmly believes ""leagues don't exist"". And honestly, I pretty much feel the same. But inspite of all this, I often get told things like, ""She's way out of your reach man"", or stuff like ""A 6 like you could never get that cute 9, so forget about it"". And being just a ""regular"" guy myself, I often get filled with doubts when approaching someone much prettier than that I could realistically think of being with. 

Seriously though, all these stereotypes not being considered, do you genuinely believe an average guy can score someone ""way out of his league""? (as cliche as that may sound). 

And fellow men who managed to do so, please tell me how! Is it all about confidence? Does having hobbies, and goals and ambitions, or success in professional life make up for one's lack in the looks department?"
"What's one thing that irritates you about men on Reddit?


The biggest one for me would be when people on here say ""Only top 1% of men can get laid... us bottom 99%ers can't find any women at all!!!""

I saw on /r/Tinder when somebody was talking about looking average and getting 3-5 matches a day. Everybody was yelling at him and exlaiming ""you know you're in the top 1%! You're ripped!!""

The dude was pitifully average. It was obvious he went to the gym, but he wasn't like jacked. People on here make it seem like getting women or being attractive is 100% impossible. Like going to the gym 3 days a week is unreasonably hard.

What other things do Redditors say that are annoying?"

"How often do guys fantasize about their female friends?


I'm (25f) close friends with a guy (23f). Developed some feelings for him but don't want to risk the relationship (plus, he's still in his hooking up phase). The other night he said to me ""I think I want to f*** _____."" I got a little jealous, but then I stared to wonder -- If you're friends with an attractive female, is it normal to fantasize about them (even if they have a boyfriend)?

TL;DR do most guys fantasize about female friends they find attractive, and are these strictly fantasies the majority of the time?"
