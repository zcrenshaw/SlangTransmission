"What can I do in NYC that is outdoorsy, and NOT related to drinking or eating?


Hi all, moving to nyc next year and feeling bummed and not excited. I am an outdoors person and when I was there I felt that most people just eat out/ go out as recreational activities. 

What can I do in NYC that is more active/ where I can meet people that share interests like biking, rock climbing, nature stuff, animals...idk etc. 

But I am a little nervous I won't be able to meet people and make friends with people that don't want to be constantly dining out and drinking. 

Thanks! "
"Where do you look for jobs in NYC?


Aside from the standard online resources (Monster, Indeed, Craigslist, LinkedIn, r/nycjobs, etc.) are there other places you look for jobs? Any good NYC-based Facebook groups, Meetup groups, slack teams...etc.?"
"Rush hour F train conductor


There is a rush hour F train conductor who is very lyrical, speaks out all the announcements himself and notably has a strange way of saying ""please move to all available doors, stand clear of closing doors"" at congested stops in a way that really makes you pay attention

Roughly he reaches 14th st going uptown at about 6:30p-6:45p and I have now gotten him 5 or 6 times. Because he is so distinctive, I am fascinated by this conductor and want to know more about him.

Anyone know him and can get him to do a subway conductor AMA? I know we've had events like that before here!"
