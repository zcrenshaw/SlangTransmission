"What 3 books have you read that you think expanded your mind? Changed your view of the world? Had the most knowledge?


I pull security at a construction site 12 hours out of the day. There is not much to do. Every now and then, I get out of my car and walk the perimeter to make sure no one’s stripping anything from the grounds. It gets pretty boring and I want to put my time there to good use. I want some good book recommendations for learning. No topic is too boring or esoteric "

"What is a physical ""flaw"" that you've come to embrace?


I'm talking about things like hair loss, not being able to grow a beard, scars, etc.

For me, it's got to be my height. I'm 5'7"" and for most of my life it didn't bother me. A few years ago, when I realized I wouldn't get any taller (I'm only 23), I started to feel really insecure especially after I heard girls talking shit about short guys or how attractive they thought tall men were.

I came to embrace it partly by having short ""roll models"" who I could identify with like Kilian Jornet (arguably the best ultra marathon runner in the world), Lionel Messi, Yuri Gagarin, Gus Grissom, and Rivers Cuomo.

For a while in my early teens, I was a bit insecure about wearing glasses even though I've worn them as long as I can remember. Like with height, I started identifying with famous glasses wearers, plus I got a better frame and I feel that they make me look smarter.

At this point, I wouldn't change either trait even if I could (though I might consider LASIK just for convenience). Both are part of who I am."

"Men of Askmen, how do you get people to start respecting you?


A little background. Yesterday I just broke off a very unhealthy friendship with a girl who regularly disrespected me and crossed the line. I still feel like shit for things I said but I'm mostly angry for allowing it to build up to that point and not setting healthy boundaries. The one time I did try and tell her something was not cool she flipped out and wouldn't speak to me for days. This girl would use me for rides, coffee dates, and other things when she had nothing better to do. 

She would never invite me out when she had a party, or gatherings. I was only a ""when she had nothing better to do"" guy. So when I decided enough was enough and put my foot down she no longer wanted anything to do with me and acted as if she could care less. All of this is my fault and I shouldn't have allowed this to go on for so long.

I'm always scared to make boundaries with people. The times I have, people regularly cross them and I'm too scared of letting them go. I woke up today and came to the conclusion that I'm tired of people treating me disrespecting me like this and flipping out if I try and draw any lines in the sand. Do you have any advice on how you came to start demanding respect or how you earned it from people? "
