"Askmen, how do you enforce the patriarchy?


I tighten all the jars in our house so my SO can't open them and has to ask me for help."
"Men of AskMen, what is one small, silly thing that makes your day?


For me, it's when I'm scrolling through a thread and see someone at 68 points and I upvote them to make it 69. Then, I always say, ""Niiiice."""
"I compliment my male friends but they seem to be emotionally closed off. What am I doing wrong?


I (26F) have a few male friends and I have been trying to give them compliments ever since I found out on this sub that men rarely receive them. I want them to feel appreciated. So, when I'm talking to them, I'd casually throw in a 'hey your hair looks really nice' or 'you look really handsome today'. I cheer them on when they show me their workout/lifting vids. I'll praise their mad gainz and I'd even gone as far as telling them I appreciate them for spending time with me. My compliments seem to throw them off, they get baffled, don't know what to say or they'd ask me why I'm being super nice to them. I'm like 'huh?'. I simply wanted to let them know what I think or feel. One particular friend, he's like devoid of emotions. When I compliment him, he doesn't seem to acknowledge it and just steer the conversation into something else. I don't understand that response. I often wonder if he gets shy or if I said something wrong. 

Are compliments THAT really foreign to men? I always thought that guys have it easy. I used to think they get praised all the time as opposed to girls. "
"Everyone's heard of fuckboys by now. What is the biggest ""fuckgirl"" thing you've ever seen?


* Got sent unsolicited nudes by a friend from school three times while she was engaged to another guy who she was abusive towards apparently.


* Got a message from a woman on Snapchat. Cool, exchanged photos of ourselves, then she asks me to put a cucumber in my ass for her and record it."
"Guys, how did you meet your SO?


I'm feeling a tiny bit extremely lonely tonight, so I could use some hope.

Woah, I went to bed and woke up to 300 comments. Thanks though my dudes, I feel less lonely and hopeless.




BTW if you know any female salads, hmu"

"How do you guys deal with touch starvation? Are there any ways to simulate hugs?


Ok so here's the deal. I'm a twenty three year old dude and the last couple of years have been pure hell. I've head to deal with chronic illnesses, flunking out of college, ADHD, Depression, and all other kinds of fun stuff. And on top of all of this I have had no one to go to for comfort. On the few occasions that I have tried to open up to my sisters about my issues they get angry that I had feelings that they don't approve of and then try to correct me on how I should feel about things that they didn't experience. For the last few years I have desperately wanting things such as hugs, snuggles, or even just a simple back scratch. So my question for you guys is how do I find a stand in for actual human contact? The only thing that I can think of is to get one of those gravity blankets and I was wondering if there was anyone here who had any experience with those."

"Men that have felt 'catfished' on a first date from someone they met online, what's your story?


There have been a bunch of videos of guys circulating online of them getting pissed off at a girl for being different looking in real life than online - as in, the same girl but just different looking. 

what's your story? "
"When was the last time you felt appreciated?

"Ripped guys, how do you stay so shredded?


I've got a decent bit of ab definition but losing that last bit of flab at the bottom seems impossible. I also think I've neglected my abs a little recently which is maybe why they're not as washboard as I'd like. 

Obviously the answer is determination and a moderately strict diet, but is any one else in the same 'almost there but not quite satisfied yet' position as me?"
"How do I handle a bully at my job?


I (f) have to deal with a very rude co-worker (m) that will not speak to me except when he has something snarky to say to me. He will try to get others to join in on his fun but no one ever does. It's affecting my performance at work and he gets my blood boiling every time I'm around him. I am very soft spoken and new to this job. I want to get aggressive but I'm not sure how. I think it's pathetic that a grown ass man wants to push around a much smaller woman like that. In every single job I've had, there's always been one male that has been rude. I really don't understand this behavior and want it to stop for future instances.

"What are early signs of a partner being manipulative?


Those of you have have been in manipulative relationships, what signs did you notice at first that something was ""off""? And what did you do about it?

I've noticed that manipulation can be hard to spot, and often there is none in the beginning, then it slowly ramps up. So slowly you don't notice it happening until one day you take a step back and realize that if you were single you'd never willing allow yourself to get into that situation.  "

"What's the most bullshit ""I'm manly"" story you've ever heard from a guy?


For me, it was at the end of 10th grade. I was hanging out with a guy in my grade who was kinda in my main friend group at the time. This guy was 15 or 16, 5'5""-5'6""ish, and like 110 lbs with almost no fat or muscle on his body. He told me that he used to work out all the time and he was built with so much muscle that he was given a job as a guard at a police station, but he got his arms broken in a fight once and he had to get all his muscle mass surgically removed so the doctors could get to the bones and fix them.

I then asked him if he had any photos of himself before he got his muscle removed. He told me that he lost them all when his family's old house burnt down.

I honestly did buy it at first cause I was 16 myself and I didn't think someone could be stupid enough to expect someone else to believe that story if it was fake, but my bullshit detector went off around the ""house fire"" part. I pretended to believe him the whole time cause of how sorry I felt for him.

Also, pretty much any time the wannabe tough guy types at my high school would talk about fights they've been in. One guy would even post Facebook statuses about how he's ""never lost a fight"" and he'd talk himself up like some sort of fighting beast you don't want to fuck with. Any conversation you'd have with him, he'd find some way to bring up how tough he is. The guys I knew who had legit martial arts training and were good at fighting rarely brought it up and they were chill to be around.

What obviously bullshit stories have you heard from insecure guys trying to prove their masculinity?"
