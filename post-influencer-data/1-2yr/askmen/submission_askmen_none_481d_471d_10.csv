"Fellas, my girlfriend doesn’t believe me. How many of you put your hand on your junk when you’re just sitting around.


I mean in a non-masturbatory way. It’s just comfy to have your hand on your junk. Righty?"
"15/ Poor male/ Keep getting made fun of by rich kids in my classic what do i do


I’m 15, African American and live close to a decently nice city. I don’t live in a big house or anything and i have a lot of siblings so we don’t have enough money. As some of you guys know i recently got my first job andi’ve been saving up for 2 things  one of them being A nice chain because i’ve always wanted one. I worked for a couple months and bought it only for some rich white kids in my class to clown me saying it’s fake. It doesn’t bug me that it’s fake but it bugs me that they think it’s fake because i’m broke. They make fun of me for my race all the time and i stand up for myself but i don’t know what else to do. The chain is 14K plated with lab stimulated diamonds so of course i know it’s not valuable but it’s valuable to me. i’m a pretty shy kid and i only stay with my good friends, don’t really y’all to anyone else. Stood up for myself but what else should i do??"

"A girl is sending me semi-naked photos. What do I send back?


There’s this girl I have a crush on from my class that I just started texting, she’s already sent through some (very nice) photos of herself leaving little to the imagination, and she told me it’s my go. What do guys take pictures of that is the equivalent of that?"
"Anybody ever feel like they've ""outgrown"" their longtime friends? How did you handle it?


I've had these friends since early high school, and I just started college this year. Lately I've been struggling to enjoy myself around them, the things I used to find fun I just don't anymore. I feel like this isn't good because at their core they're good people, I just don't find myself enjoying what they call a good time. I have an interest in new hobbies that they don't have an interest in, and are pretty content with living the same life they've been for years. As a group when we have conversations they don't have much depth or relevancy to much of anything and it's mostly just insults and mocking that they find funny and I don't. I try to find it funny but I just can't. There was a time in the past where I did, but now I don't, and this change hit me suddenly over the past few months. In a nutshell I feel like I'm growing and they're not. I don't want to lose them as friends, but I'm wondering if it's best for me to limit the time I spend with them and pursue new paths and new friendships? Has anyone else ever been through a similar situation, if so how did you handle it and what did that result in?"

"How do I deal with being lazy/not a hard worker?


I am 22 years old and always had big goals and ambitions in life and I have always wanted to be that hard working guy that puts in the hours and the work to achieve it. Lately I have come to terms with myself that I am the opposite, I can be very lazy and actually dislike working hard. It feels like the worst combination of personal traits to have and I dont really know how to get around it or even use it to my advantage. I have always looked up to people that are winners, famous and hard working. Would love to hear about other guys that goes through the same and hopefully also older guys that have been through this and came out on the other side."
