"Suggestions on how to dispose of a sex doll?


I need to dispose of a 4’, 80lb sex doll in the near future. 

Any suggestions on how to do so?  

Driving to a dumpster/construction site at 2am and dumping it wrapped in a blanket seems like a really sketchy idea and I’m sure there would be cameras around. "

"My friend that I was in love with committed suicide due to a losing fight with cancer, what do I do?


Not long ago, my best friend since middle school, and woman that I loved, chose to take her own life rather than allow the cancer that just refused to go away, to waste her away, take her dignity away from her, to take her life. She did so by breathing in Nitrogen sp that she simply went to sleep rather than feel like she was suffocating.

All throughout my years in school, she was always there for me to help me recover from my surgeries. During one of my major procedures, she was recovering from some major surgery herself for cancer. I stayed with her and her family. I remember so many nights when she would call me at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying, terrified, tired, exhausted, alone. She just wanted to chat. I would ask her if she wanted me to come over and she would just answer please. Nothing more. I would say be there in a few. I would get dressed, drive to her house, shed let me in. We would just go back to her room, sit/lay on the bed, and I would just wrap my arms around her and hold her close. We wouldnt say a word, there was nothing that needed to be said as it had all been said already. This was in my upperclassmen years of high schools. Her parents were perfectly fine with it and my parents never knew since I usually stayed in my room when at home, making virtually no noise. I didnt even make noise when walking, earning me the nickname ghost from my own family.

I loved her, more than what I thought possible. She loved me. We never did anything about it because of both of our medical issues and in all honesty, probably to protect each other. Instead we were just there for each other in ways that no one else could. We were always there for each other no matter what. She was there the very next day  after I found out my ex was cheating on me while I was in the ICU following spinal fusion surgery.

It feels like someone has ripped out my heart, my stomach. It feels like I have a fist in my throat. I feel empty,  and weak. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to the funerals of those I love most because I cannot see the faces of those I love and see them dead, I cant have that be my last memory of them. I couldnt go to the funeral of the by far most influential man in my life, my grandfather, the man that taught me everything.

She had a friend of hers post a letter after she had passed and I got it. It hurt so much to read, I cant find the words to accurately describe how it made me feel. I had resolved to do the exact same thing should something ever happen so that I have final word on how I go out rather than let something else make that decision for me, so I would have that final act of mine, that last thing to happen to, to be of my own decision and to choose my own fate, rather than have it be chosen for me. I never once told her this though, it was even the exact same method. She did everything the exact same way that I would.

I want her back. I want to feel her in my arms, to smell her hair, to hear her laugh, to feel her breath on my neck, to see her smile. 

I dont know what to do. Help. Please...


Edit: as if to make things worse my chronic pain is having another spike so im laying on the ground, too weak and in too much pain to stand, waiting for my pain killers to kick in... thank god she never saw me like this. She never saw me when the pain was bad...

When I say I dont trust others, I really mean it. I dont even trust either of my parents enough to ever give more than banal chit chat. I never reveal anything serious to them anymore because of how they responded in the past when I tried talking with them about anything serious in my life.



I just want someone to hold me..."

"Using your dick as a catapult, how far can you throw something?


Also what's the heaviest object you've been able to throw? In before ""OPs Mom.""

Edit - my thought on a standardized method:

Lay on your back, find object (American quarter or closest equivalent?), place on head of erect penis holding in place with hands, cock the penis downwards towards the feet, release grip on penis and ammunition letting fly, ???, profit."
"How do you deal with difficult periods in your life when you have no outside support.


Lately I been going through a rough phase and the truth is I don't have anyone to go to for advice, or to lean back on for support. I have gotten use to dealing  with things on my own, but lately it's started to become unbearable. I feel as if I have no one I can go to for advice, for help, for support. In a world filled with billions of people, I feel utterly and completely alone. "
"(Serious) Has anyone 'rented' a date (NOT prostitution) for a Wedding or Event and How was your experience?


If anyone has had experience with this, whether using a service, providing a service, or knows personally of someone who has done either, could you share your story with me? 

The reason I ask such a specific question is I've heard of such services, I've found some on google, but I don't know how trustworthy the websites stories are or how people's experiences with this sort of thing vary. 

As for why, the short story is I have recently gotten out of a relationship and my ex will also be attending the event with someone she ""met shortly after"" and *definitely* did not meet while were still dating. Needless to say, my reasons may be petty, but I really just want to get through this event and never deal with this again. 

Therefore, I have decided that just for this upcoming event I would just like to hire someone to attend the event with me as a date. I live in a large city, and I'm willing to pay for these services, but I wouldn't want to hire a prostitute... The extent of such services would only be to attend the date and stick to a predetermined story, maybe take a few pictures, and then we would be on our seperate ways. 

Any help with learning more about something like this would be appreciated."
"how can i lose feelings of embarrassment and anxiety when i am naked?


i think it is best to preface this saying i have a small penis, and i am  short at 5'6 or 5'7.  i was sexually assaulted by a few women who basically took advantage of me by taking pictures of me naked and taunted me by telling me i had a small penis. they also later sent the pictures to their friends and those pictures spread. even my own friends knew that i had a small penis.

ive worked out quite a lot and i am happy with my physique. ive gone on dates and the ones that were successful ended being failures. i was pretty much met with faces of disappointment and ""ghosting"" midway or after. 

i honestly thought this happened in movies and not in real life. i guess women really are disgusted by small dicks. i dont know. 

ever since ive always felt so ashamed of my body and i have feelings of in adequateness and my experiences still haunt me whenever i meet a new girl. 

what can i do to get rid of these feelings? 

edit: please stop taunting me in messages. "
"So I was invited to a party by this girl I’m involved with, but she also invited another man I know she’s talking to. Anyone ever been in a situation like this and if so, what did you guys do?


A little back story. This girl (my best friend) and I have been on and off for about the last two years. We rushed things when we first met and it eventually burned out the passion. We stopped talking for a few months until my brother passed away and I told her about it. She was really supportive and instrumental in making sure I was okay through that whole process. Going through that together created a bond that neither of us can break even if we wanted to. There have been times when I try and get distance from her and she just keeps coming back into my life. We’re basically best friends at the moment but she keeps mentioning how our time is coming and all that stuff. I’d like to be in a relationship but she’s still not sure what she wants and with who. So we both do our own thing with no repercussions. But she constantly gets jealous whenever I mention another girl or is always grabbing my phone and “letting other girls know I’m still around” type thing. She’s super affectionate every where we go and only brings me around her parents. She’s confusing to say the least. The question is, one of her friends is having a birthday party on Sunday and she invited me to come. She also invited one of the guys she “talks” to, to the party. It would basically be her friend, that guy, her, and myself. Would I look like a bitch if I don’t go? I really would rather not be put in that position and have to interact with some dude I could give two shits about. I’m a very jealous person myself and I just know nothing fun will come out of going to this party. What do you guys think? FYI I’m 24 and she’s 23. "
"As a single male, how often do you get physical contact with someone else?


I’ve always wondered about this. Women, single or not are much more inclined to cuddle, hug, or whatever with a friend when they need it. But as a single guy, do you go long periods without any sort of human contact? Does it make you sad? Sometimes I see guys that look like they just need a fucking hug and it makes me sad. Am I needlessly worrying for the male population? "
"How risky is it to ask a close female friend on a date? And if you ever did so, what was the outcome?


I know this girl for about 3 years and we are good friends (we share the same group of friends). I always liked her somehow, but I was in a relationship for most of the time we knew each other and I therefore I never made any moves. The thing is that now I'm single but I'm afraid of risking: if she says yes, all good. If she says no, it is also good for me because I will be able to move on without regrets, but I'm afraid the friendship might be affected by that and she will start to avoid me or act weird.

The input of women on this case is also very much appreciated :)"

I work at the cash register a lot and sometimes I see people that I like something about and want to compliment them on but I am only comfortable complimenting clothes. It’s easy with girls because their clothes are uniques. All the guys wear the exact same thing. Is there a way to compliment any part of their body without seeming flirty? "

"Just had to take custody of my younger siblings and my little brother is being a total dick, what can I do to discipline and help him?


My (27m) mom went to jail for drugs and I now have my siblings, a 13 year old girl and 11 year old boy to take care of. My sister is great we relate well and she knows her mom is a drug addict and treated them like shit. She just wants to stay with me forever and never go home. My little brother though has been heavily affected by all of her manipulation and see her (our Mom) as and angel who can do no wrong. 

He is terrible all the time. Attitude, smart mouth, talking back. You name and he is doing it. I've talked to him on about 5 different occasions and I get nothing. He'll behave for about an hour afterwards then it's right back to the shitty attitude. I've tried being nice, I've tried explaining the problem to him and I've even tried to get him to tell me what's going on in his brain. I've explained to him that I was right where he is 15 years ago, that I know exactly what he's dealing with and he just doesn't seem to care. Nothing ever comes of it. I'm at my wits end. He treats my sister and I like shit and won't even give me an inch in the other direction. He nice and we'll behaved about 25% of the day on a good day.

What can I do guys? I need advice on how to handle this kid. I don't know what to do."
