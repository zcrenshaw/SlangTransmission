"Mod Post: ""Journalists"" are taking your content


Sup shitlords,

So despite what you may believe, there are sites outside of reddit.  Most of them are bad sites, but moderately worse than this one.  At any rate, writers for garbage dumps like Buzzfeed, Elite Daily, Medium, and others have often posted questions with the intent of using your answers in shitty ""articles"" that are mostly comprised of a creatively stunted desperate ""blogger"" in need of money copy-pasting your answers directly into an article.  

While we can't get these articles taken down or ban the perpetrators (unless they're stupid enough to use their real name in their username or something), we will find it best to remind you that despite the echo chamber that our sub has become, we still have almost 500k users coming to this sub.  The likelihood that your answers will make their way into the hands of creatively bankrupt flunkeys like this is high enough to remind you that if you are worried about someone you care about seeing your answers on this sub and thinking ""wow that person is a shithead"" even if they don't know it's you, maybe don't be such a fucking shithead.  

I am by no means giving license to those deplorably idiotic scavengers who can't string two words together so they must copy the words of others, I'm just saying that we can't control what they do.  So yeah, you might get published on some website if you give a stupid answer.  If you don't care, more power to you.  If you care, sucks to be you.  Maybe get over it.  Or don't get over it but watch what you post.  So clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose would be my advice to you here.

Love,

The Mods"
"What was normal in your family that you later found out was something not every family did?


Couldn't think of how to phrase this but my god on my way to work this morning listening to the local talk radio show, there was a story of a guy that had a ""poop knife"" growing up.  
  
The poop knife was hung up in their laundry room and was used, as you'd guess, to make larger works smaller prior to trying to flush. He thought or assumed every family had a poop knife and only found out at the age of 22 that wasn't the case when he asked his friend for the poop knife while at their house.  
  
Anyone else have things similar to this from your childhood family? I'm so intrigued.."

"My mother just died, what do i do?


So... i haven't fully realized it yet, but i got a call from my sister an hour ago about our house smoking and burning. A few minutes ago she texted me that the amublance people told her that our mother is dead. 

I'm honestly not sure what to do now. I just feel numb. Probably in shock. I don't want to talk to my girlfriend or close friends yet, since i don't know what to say anyway.

Has anyone gone through something like this and has any advice on how to handle the first few hours and days?"

"For you married guys out there, did you, and when did you, stop fantasizing about your wife? Has sex changed for you?


To the guys out there married for a few years plus....after you've bonked your wife a gazillion times, after kids, when you guys no longer look like the sexy models that you were when you first met... Is there a point when you just stop having any sexual fantasies about your wife (perhaps shifted to the hot young college intern at work), and start seeing her rather more like an emotional mate and someone with whom you have, for lack of a better phrase, a friendly sexual contract so you both get off, but minus the thrill/passion of yesteryear? Just curious how things play out years down the line..."
"What's your go to ""poor meal""?


Be it a meal you make because you're poor, or a meal you prepare that just makes you feel poor. Wife's not home for dinner tonight and I'm cheap as hell so let's hear it.

I used to go with a bowl of cereal and a PB&amp;j in college and have recently switched over to meatless pho, but tonight I'm looking for something else"

You’re welcome

"How do you feel about the statement, ""If a guy is attracted to you, he WILL ask you out""?


I recently read an short article (written by a man, not sure if it's relevant) pretty much saying something along the lines of, ""Ladies, if *you* have to be the one asking a guy out, he is not into you. Only date guys that ask *you* out!"" He further elaborated his point by saying that for centuries, men have been the ones pursuing women because men like to go for what they want, and so if he is interested in a girl, he *will* go for her. Furthermore, when I talk to my guy friends irl, they all say things like, ""If he wanted to date you, he would have done something about it by now,"" or ""If I like a girl I will make the first move on her"" (and they actually do) or ""Yeah you can ask him out, but I guarantee you it won't work"" (they were right). My female friends and I have all been told things like this by different guys.

On Reddit however, I often see guys say things like, ""Girls should totally make the first move, we love it and she may actually *end up with the guy she wants*!"" and that a guy won't ask a girl out because he is ""intimidated"". So it's a bit confusing when hearing advices that seem to contradict each other. Of course as a girl who rarely, if ever gets asked out, I would like to believe Reddit's fluffy way of looking at things. But outside of Reddit, the ideas of ""women should make the first move"" and men being too scared to ask a woman out don't seem to be hold as much merit (for lack of better word)?

EDIT: Reading that article kind of sucked too because normally I'm all for women making the first move if she likes a guy.  But then the writer of this article goes in says shit like: 

* ""Ladies,  if you have to make a move,  he is not that into you""
* ""The best relationships start out by the man asking the woman out""
* ""My make friends said that none of their LTRs started with the woman asking them out""
* ""It's a part of nature for men to make the first move""
* ""Men are never too shy for girls they like""

Not gonna lie, I kind of feel discouraged from making the forest move ever again after reading that. "
"After going on a date and unsure if it's serious or just casual for the girl, what's the best way to ask?


Basically what I'm saying is what's the best way to ask if she sees a potential relationship

Edit: thanks a ton for all the replies, really solid advice, makes me feel a lot less pressured now that yall say to wait several dates/a month to ask her about it, feel free to continue to contribute if you have something to say that hasn't been said yet."
"Men who lost sexual desire for their partner then gained it back, what happened?


My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and the past probably four months or so the sex has been nearly non existent. I’m talking once a month tops, and only after I get upset at him for it. I’m wondering if our relationship is a lost cause, or if he will become sexually attracted to me again? Our relationship is great, except for this one thing. 

Notable: we live with our parents and have to find conspicuous places to do it (car parked etc). But that’s never stopped us before, when we used to do it multiple times a week. I haven’t gained any weight since I met him and I think I look fine/haven’t stopped putting in effort into my appearance. He said he stopped watching porn and masturbating. 

**TLDR; boyfriend doesn’t want to have sex with me, will it get better or should I move on?**"

"Single men with vasectomy, how do women take it?


For the most part women I've dated/slept with were insulted initially but always curious. Some would even propose no condom on random hookups assuming I was bluffing. 

It seems that when the choice of children is removed from the woman they arent sure how to handle it. On one hand they are insulted, on the other they seem intrigued by a guy who would make such a choice."
