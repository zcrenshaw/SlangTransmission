"What would you do if your girl wanted to be celibate after a year of sex?


This girl I've been dating for about 10 months says that she wants to be celibate now, and that she will give me a couple days to see if I want to accept her. We've had a pretty intense sex life, but it seems like whenever she goes to church she will say she wants to be celibate but then always slips up in her old ways of sleeping with me(I've never pressured her). Over the summer we broke up for 2 months and she even slept with a guy who went to her church so this is really confusing on how she just all of a sudden is so serious about it with me but not the couple guys she slept with over the summer.

Anyways, I really dont want to wait years to sleep with her again. I love her and want to be with her but as of late our relationship has been pretty bad anyways. All weve been doing is arguing and not getting along, letting the little things spark up argument. Im not sure how I feel that she let randoms have sex but wants to make her boyfriend wait so she can have a ""pure"" relationship.

What would you guys do? Feel free to share any past experiences.

P.S. She got mad at me last night when I said something along the lines of how she wanted to be celibate with her boyfriend but not the guy from church and the other guy over the summer. She said let it go. While she is right that still doesnt read to me. If you shouldnt be letting anyone fuck then its the randoms, not your boyfriend.

Edit: I ended it. Not only because of the no sex but because of the fact she wants to hold on her boyfriend but not randoms. 

Edit^2: The plot gets thicker gentlemen. She called me tonight and said she wants to be with me, and the only reason she took sex out is because we were arguing a lot (when she said she wants God to bless her relationships). ""Im the man for her"" and all this nonsense. She said that we can have sex again. But on top of the arguing, her rash decisions, emotional unstableness and her tendency to be easily swayed with little evidence (like she's the type to believe anything she sees on the internet). I still chose to stay separated. Thanks guys for opening my eyes. "

Hooked up with this chic in a club 15 minutes after meeting her. Turned out to be my best friend's new girlfriend, well shit."
"What do I do about my roommate jacking it (loudly, with sound effects) when I'm obviously not sleeping?


Living in a dorm, btw.
Like, I get it. We all have urges and shit. But I was obviously awake, playing some game on my phone, and he comes in the room (from our living room) and starts jackin' it. I ignored it and this morning I asked him if he could do it in the bathroom (our floor shares a communal bathroom) or when I'm not home, but he blew me off and acted like I was overreacting. 

It was just gross, and honestly I'd have had no issue if he'd at least made an attempt to hide what he was doing. Right now, I'm really grossed out and just uncomfortable being there.  

Edit for clarification: rather than reply to everyone individually, I can clarify a few things. Yes, my roommate is gay. I am not. But this isn’t about that at all. I’d be really uncomfortable if he were the most straightiest straight dude to ever straight in this case. 

I’m not traumatized or anything by this. Like, I’m disgusted and grossed out, but if it gets worse I have other places to go and stuff. 

The most uncomfortable part was the loud moaning the whole time. Even if I was asleep, that would have woken me up. 

I had a lamp on and was sitting up reading a book when he came into the room. There isn’t much ambiguity, he definitely knew I was awake. "

As an example, when I find myself worrying or stressing too much about something I tell myself ""Just do your best. As long as you do your best, the rest doesn't matter."" I repeat this mentally a few times and usually feel a lot better."

"AskMen, I know one of my close friends is cheating on his girlfriend. What are my ethical obligations as a bro who does not want to be a sleaze-enabler?


Here's the lay of the land:  Close friend of mine (let's call him Jake, obv not his real name) going back to high school has been with his girlfriend for close to three years now.  They're living together but as far as I know, not ready to take it to the next step (i.e. marriage) yet.  I know Jake has been waffling a bit like many guys his age (he's in his mid-20s) because he's not sure if he's ready for that stage of life.  His girlfriend seems nice enough, but I really only interact with her when Jake is around, so I'm not friends with her going back.  So recently I heard through our mutual friends that Jake has been hanging out with a co-worker of his on the side.  It's basically an open secret among our circle of friends.  No one mentions it when he's around, but there have been sightings, and the co-worker at least brags about it to her friends that she and Jake are a thing (unclear if this co-worker knows that Jake is taken).  They must be fucking, and it's been going on a few months at least.  Now here's my question.  What, if any, are my obligations as a guy not trying to be a total douche and turn-the-other-way enabler, but also as someone who is cognizant that I'm friends with Jake, not his girlfriend?  What would you do in this situation.  My sense is that I just need to keep my mouth shut but damn if I don't feel sorry for Jake's gf for the train wreck that is coming.  She's clueless enough that she drops hints about them having babies and getting engaged down the road.  I don't make eye contact but really don't feel good about all of us knowing Jake is fucking his co-worker behind her back.   Advice?

TL/DR -- My close friend is cheating on his girlfriend and I'm not sure what to do about it, if anything.  "

"Here’s a thought experiment: If you took sexuality out of the equation, how many of the women you’ve ever dated would you actually be friends with? Some? Most?


If I was honest with myself, I’d probably not even talk to 90% of the women I’ve ever dated without my sexuality guiding me.

Edit:wow first on the controversial list, Didn’t realize this was such a touchy subject."

"How do I ask out the FedEx guy at work?


I do admin for my company and sit at the front desk so I always receive our packages. I'd like to receive a different package, if you're picking up what I'm putting down. 

I'm all for being forward and not waiting for the guy to make the first move. We always make eyes at each other but he's only ever in for a minute or so. Today he complimented my shoes so I think he wants to bone. 

I normally would just ask a guy if he wanted to grab a drink sometime, but it feels weird in this situation being that I'm at work and he's working too. All I can think of are inappropriate, bad jokes about receiving packages that I wouldn't actually say anyway. "
