"My friend got a gf. But she’s changing him. He makes fun of me now because I don’t have a gf and I don’t enjoy his company anymore. what do I do?


His gf is just obnoxious as hell. but I valued our friendship. It’s becoming almost toxic. He’s a sophomore in high-school I’m a junior. I know it’s highschool drama but I don’t have many friends. He also sends me things like “I love you bro you’re a great friend” but still can be a jerk to me. And his gf thinks that I should do whatever she says. Like for example I was with both of them. And she hands me his homework and tells me to help him on his trig homework Because I’m in calculus. but as I try to help they just start making out. It’s pissing me off. 

Edit: wow thanks guys! I’ve been trying to cut it off not talking or hanging out. but it’s hard to avoid him online when we play games together and share a discord. I appreciate the support! thank you all so much. I also hope he doesn’t see this trending....... "
"I'm uncomfortable with escalating things physically with a girl unless she makes it extremely clear that she wants to. How can I get over this?


I'm 24, but pretty inexperienced when it comes to getting physical with a girl. I'm fine with just making out, but I rarely push it further than that unless the girl makes it really clear that she wants to (by initiating things further herself).

Is this normal? What can I do to get over being uncomfortable about this?
Thanks."

"Men on OkCupid, does it suck for you as much as it does for me? Also, if you could invent a better app, what would be different about it?


In the last couple of months, OkCupid has basically been in a downward spiral, as I am sure many of you know. Here are some issues I find with the current app:

- It is incredibly clunky to use and is not a fluid experience (tons of pop ups, inconsistencies). I feel like I am being forced to behave in a way I do not wish to behave
- You have to like someone to message them
- They seem to be Tinderfying themselves...I tried going with their flow, and just liking a lot of people, and now I am blocked from liking and see the message ""We're glad you like so many people but...Try messaging someone you liked and set up a date"". I did message people and I am still blocked

In real life relationships, there is something called [Stonewalling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201212/how-ruin-perfectly-good-relationship-0). Stonewalling is a refusal to communicate or cooperate, and is a behavior that typically leads to divorce or otherwise broken relationships. 

Now if you look at the world of Interaction Design (app design) much of our assumptions are based on psychology research. Believe it or not we have relationships with apps. With this in mind it feels like I am being stonewalled by the app, I do not feel like I can express myself within the app any longer. 

One obvious thought is ""Hey! I could do way better if I made an app!""
I work in the field, and I would very much like to make a competing app. But I am not sure what the value proposition would be – and I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you would do different than the options we have today (all trash as far as I am concerned).

Edit: My main man /u/fasterfind has a really good point - less images and more words - which I agree with. I have had much more success with women who actually have stuff written down in their profile (I actually have the most success with those who write a healthy amount, not just a few sentences).

Some other suggestions in this thread:

- Move to Coffee Meets Bagel (never heard of this before now, but they also limit use, and as far as I am concerned it is another app with a broken experience).

- Quizes/questions (OKC used to stress this more, with a relevant Match percentage, but the Match percentage is now diluted and you can't tell what is a good Match)

- Match people according to the number of images they have, if they have no images, limit their use (some kinks need working out here but I generally like this)

- Enable message filters to filter out messages with a certain length, so that if someone is interested in long messages they will see those. I would also add that we have technology that can gauge relevance (ie if someone messages me about Breaking Bad, because it is on my profile)."
"Men, how can a woman make you feel better after a slightly uncomfortable sexual experience?


I hope this isn't too situationally specific, but I'm interested in what a variety of people would want to happen. 

Long story short, I've been flirting with a guy for a couple of months and we finally hooked up last week. There was lots of making out and groping and all, but when we got to the actual sex part he had a lot of trouble staying hard so we didn't end up doing it. It really wasn't a big deal, I had a lot of fun and would like to see him again, but he's been acting weird ever since and I don't know how to convey that this was not a problem and I don't want him to feel bad. 

Two factors that might be important: we're both fairly young (23), and he's in grad school so I only actually see him when he's home on breaks. The day after we hooked up he went back to school which is why I can't just ask him to coffee and bring him back to my place."
"Girls pretending to be interested in me for fun - how to prevent being a target?


Let me give an example of what I'm talking about:

One time I was at a friend's houseparty, a group of random girls comes up to me and says 'one of our friends thinks you're hot, come with us' I recognized this situation as bullshit, but went along with it just in case, and of course this girl was playing some shitty game where she was faking to be interested in me for fun... almost like a dare or some shit

This never happened in such severity again, but from time to time some girls try to play this game with me. I can't quite wrap my head around as to why any sane human would do this, but I guess it's some sort of power play?

This really crushed me the first time it happened, and I was convinced it's because of my looks. I'm also very wary when meeting new girls that show some interest because of this aswell.

But I always dress nice and fashionable, have a nice modern haircut, pluck my eyebrows, wear cologne etc etc. So I thought it could only be my physical appearence. I really don't think I'm ugly enough to warrant these things, I'm maybe a 3-4 / 10

But after some time I'm pretty sure it's because these vindictive girls smell weakness or some shit, and my lack of experience with girls shows more than I thought.

How do I avoid getting picked on like that in the first place?

Thanks for any advice!

"Men who were thrown back into the dating pool with zero tinder/online dating experience: how's it going?


Personally, I'm having an absolutely terrible time doing this stuff when I thought it would be fun and interesting.  90% of the time a girl won't respond.  If they do, they'll ghost you eventually.  This seems like a complete waste of time to me.  I haven't had a single meaningful relationship come out of this so far."

"How do I flirt and tease with girls I like?


How do I flirt? cause i honesty never flirt with the girls I really like so I end up friend zoned over time because of my ""normal friendly"" conversations. I even put them into the friend zone without wanting to because they thought I didn't like them because I didn't flirt or tease?  I need help, I do not want to be single with like another 50 good friends that are girls this year. (btw I will be starting year 12 very soon)"

"What is the best way to gain willpower and remain focused?


How do you guys build willpower? As in, how do you stay motivated and focused on what you need to study/work ok?

Context:

I feel so tired most of the time and I long for whenever I don't have to focus on clinical trials and epidemiological studies. I thought medical school would make me happy, or more precisely, make me feel like my hard work would be worth it, that my family would recognize how much I've invested in it, and that I'm contributing in a relevant way to society (don't get me wrong, I know I will contribute eventually), but I must admit that the day-to-day life is a bore, everyone is very demanding of my professional success, I feel zero passion for most subjects — I pretty much study because I need to but I have no interest in going on with this forever, the population has a strong notion that doctors are all money-sucking assholes, and Im constantly berated by some less-than-patient professors that like to pick on a student to intimidate.

Im sure most of you are thinking of how much money I'll be able to make, but I dont want too much money, I want quality of life, and I've realized Im not really getting much of that in the long run. Funny thing is, before I entered college, everyone talked about how medical school would be highly competitive, and yet I've found that the real competition has not been my peers, but my family's pressure for success, my mental and emotional exhaustion, and my dissatisfaction with the professional life that Im supposed to lead. Im already 2/3 into the duration of the course, Im a decent student despite my lack of interest, and I feel like human garbage. I cant help but think that I'd be perfectly ok with the professional interaction with the patients, the time of work and the regular study to keep updated, but only because I feel like I'd get some personal satisfaction in return, and Im simply not getting that satisfaction. At all.

I've tried talking to my family for years, but the pressure is there and not going away anytime soon. The economic struggle in Brazil is getting tougher by the hour and all I hear is money talk and how Im supposed to have my graduation pay off in a large way. I've tried to rethink my career, but the only other thing I see myself doing is either trying law school (which has an actual terrible environment of competition, an abnormally high number of professionals that devalue the diploma, and is better suited for fast-thinking and people-oriented personalities), or pursuing a career in the movie industry (which is more of a personal passion and a distant dream than anything realistic to achieve).

What Im trying to say here is: I don't really have a better option than to buckle up and keep going with a life that I've realized to not be half of what I expected it to be. Part of me feels guilty for not thinking of my life as incredibly privileged (in a sense, despite the economic struggle to make ends meet, I confess, it is), but I cant lie about how I feel and what I wish to receive in exchange for so much hard work.

That said, what makes you people feel more determined and focused to keep going and do a good job?

Thanks for whatever help you manage to provide, even if it's just solidarity."

"What annoys you most about porn?


To me it's the portrayal of the doggy style position. no pounding and no jiggle anymore because of that weird annoying angle for the camera

Edit: Oh boy, after ~150 comments there seem to be a couple of very clear themes: 

1. porn is waaaaaaay to fake/unrealistic for everyone. Fake boobs, fake moans, stupid positions, overly descriptive ""dialogue"" etc. etc.
2. incest porn seems to annoy people
3. no enjoyment on behalf of the actors. doesn't feel real but very unnatural. no realistic feelings involved whatsoever
4. huge dicks
5. to rough or to vanilla
6. unrealistic anal
7. to many bodily fluids (sperm, spit etc.)
8. an unnatural focus on dudes ass holes in straight porn and cut scenes with very bad timing
9. sounds from the male actors and any attention to the actor at all
10. weird positions that were made specifically for cameras

So, it seems to converge on mainly one thing: people want more normal sex, with real people, no fake stuff (boobs, screams, moans, orgasms, length...), realistic scenarios and actors who enjoy themselves. 

Ahem. Porn industry: pls produce more of the stuff people actually want. 

A couple of recommendations have been made here where one can actually find that type of porn: Erika Lust, X-Confessions, Viv Thomas, X-Art, Sexart"

"I recently started spending more money on better, more spicy mustard. What mundane luxury do you give yourself?


Sandwiches are easily one of my favorite foods, so I find myself near the condiments a lot. I remember one day I saw this little spit of a jar of mustard selling for $3.50. Normal French's comes in a much larger size and can often be gotten for a dollar. I would tell myself ""one day I'll just deal with being out three dollars to find out what expensive mustard tastes likes."" Lo and behold, I now use it almost all the time."
