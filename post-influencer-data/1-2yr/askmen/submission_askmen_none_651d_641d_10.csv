"What did your date say that put you off so hard your dick went inside your body?


I've had a date recently, the lady came over and we started watching a movie. We talked a lot and she casually mentioned the fact she watches Rick and Morty, then she showed me that her t-shirt, shoes, and socks are all Rick and Morty themed. Up until that day I thought the ""verysmart rick and morty fan"" is a joke and no one is like that in real life. Up until that day. She started going on and on about how it's SUCH AN AMAZING AND INTELLECTUAL SHOW and how she's not like that 1 guy you see REEEE-ing at McDonald's because there's no schezuan sauce. She's not like that person at all, she's ""one of the smart fans who watch the show"". All of this and much more, 100% serious.

We finished the movie, talked a bit more, I walked her to the bus station and she went home, we talked and I told her I'm not interested in more dates.

I thought these people were only a joke, I wasn't prepare for this.

Anyways, what happened to you?"

"Men who are shy, how can we tell if you're NOT interested in dating us?


Because shy men don't openely share how they're feeling towards someone, its hard to tell whether they're into us or not, What are sign that you're not interested in someone?"

"Men who never had a relationship until a ""late"" age, what do you wish you knew?


I just turned 23 and I've never had a girlfriend. I'm not sweating it too hard, but I feel like there's a lot I don't know that a typical guy in his early to mid 20s normally should. I'm straight btw."
"How often do you judge a girl's name when meeting her?


I'm female and my name is a very uncommon arabic name and is usually assigned to men (even google images proves this.) It's brash, it's hard to spell and pronounce, and frankly just not pretty. It's not a name I like introducing myself with in a work environment or socially, especially men. 

So i'm changing my name.

I really like Russian girl names because they sound sophisticated and interesting but I'm not sure if there's a rule of thumb of choosing a new name that will match my looks. I'm of East African descent so...

I really like the names like Sabina, Yana, Dinara, Arina, Calina, Lusha, Amaliya, Haleena, Maryana, and some more. (I'm avoiding names like Svetlana, Polina and Anastasia just because those are very traditional Russian names that are common and I feel like although they are pretty, they completely clash with my ethnicity lol.) 

Do you ever think certain names don't go with certain faces/ethnicities? "

"Men of Reddit, how many of you grew up in the 2000's and what do you miss about it?


I'm currently on a nostalgia bender, and as this decade slowly comes to an end, I can't help but think about the past one and how much I enjoyed growing up as a kid then. Anime was becoming mainstream, pop music was surprisingly enjoyable, technology played a role in our lives but wasn't as isolating as it is today, and visiting Blockbuster on the weekends was exciting as hell. It was a much simpler time. 

How many of you feel the same way and why?"
"How can I seriously stop being on my phone so much. I honestly think I'm addicted to being on my phone wether it's scrolling reddit or watching pointless YouTube videos. I'm aware of how unhealthy it is but I always end up relapsing when I try to kick the habit, can anyone relate? How can I stop?
