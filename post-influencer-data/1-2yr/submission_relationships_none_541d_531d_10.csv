"[Update] I [17/F] think my dad [40/M] holds resentment towards me because I'm not his biological child.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86zkye/i_17f_think_my_dad_40m_holds_resentment_towards/

This update is a thank you for all the wonderful advice I received. I'm sorry for not replying to anyone in my original post. I don't have any siblings, it's just me, my mom, and my dad.

On Monday morning I told my dad that I wanted to get lunch with him, like a few people suggested. He was surprised, and looked happy that I wanted to do something with him. My dad took me to the restaurant that we used to go to when I was little. It was awkward. My dad and I didn't know what to say to each other, so I talked about what I wanted to do with the rest of my spring break, and I asked him about his video games. 

I gave my dad a hug afterwards when we came home, thanked him for taking me out, and told him that I loved him. My dad began crying, and he said he loved me too. 

I told my dad that I thought he resented me because I wasn't his biological child. My dad admitted that it was hard for him to get over my mom's cheating, but he loved me just as he would his own child. My dad said I was the most important person in his life, and he wanted to spend more time with me but thought I wasn't interested because I hangout with my mom all the time. He also apologized for not being affectionate with me because he grew up in a family that never said they loved each other. He promised me that he would try saying that he loves me, and giving me more hugs.

I said I wanted to build a relationship with him before I went off to university because I was going to miss him. My dad said he would try to find stuff for us to do, and even though he didn't like fishing he would take me out one day. I also said that I wanted to play video games with him, and he told me he'd teach me how.

It went a lot better than I thought it would. I expected that it was going to take more time before I felt comfortable telling my dad everything that was on my mind, but I'm glad we had that talk. I'm very excited to actually start doing things with my dad, and to know that he loves me but he's just been afraid to express it.

**TL;DR I had a heartwarming talk with my dad. I also gave him a hug and said I loved him. He said I was the most important person in his life, and me not being his biological kid didn't cause him any resentment. My dad and I agreed to spend more time together, and I'm looking forward to building a relationship with him.**"

"My boyfriend (27M) took photos of me (29F) after being told my sister (20F) had died; he wants to put them online to “raise awareness” of mental illness


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 3 1/2 years. We’ve been doing great, and love to be together. During the time we’ve been dating, my sister experienced a very rough battle with mental illness. It’s been extremely draining and difficult to get through, and my boyfriend has been- not to sound cheesy- a rock for me through it all. His passion is photography, and he’s done some beautiful shots of my sister and I. It’s just so incredible- he always listens, makes me dinner, gives me all the love I could ever ask for, surprises me, cares for me. I cherish him so much. He’s so considerate and so respectful of me and my sister’s struggle. I love him dearly.

Last week, my sister ended her life. Despite what had been going on, it was very unexpected and extremely hard to process. I just broke down when my mom called, and my boyfriend consoled me for a while before I asked him to stop and give me space. I laid on the floor and cried, and I sort or blocked out what was going on. I think it must’ve been 1 or 2 hours before I got up and started to engage. My sense of everything was out of whack- I wasn’t aware of time or place or people, I was just fuzzy. My boyfriend got me into bed and I calmed down enough to make some calls to family and such.

Yesterday, my boyfriend came to me and told me he’d taken a few shots of me on the ground after I’d been told about my sister’s death. He showed me the photos, and I didn’t like to look at them. They looked so sad, so desperate. I was red as a beet and curled up on the floor crying and screaming. I told him it made me a little embarrassed and was making me feel just weird, but he said he wanted to put them online. My boyfriend told me he thought the photo was gorgeous, and the unpleasant emotions I was feeling were exactly the kind people needed to feel. He told me he wanted to post the photos as a type of awareness for mental health, and to show the impact that suicide has on families.

But I feel weird. I know it’s a good thing and it’ll jumpstart some conversations, but it feels weird to have that picture of my worst grief posted out there on the Internet. He told me he plans to post by Friday night, so I’ve got time to think, but I’m not sure. Is it wrong to try and shut down his creativity? And is this bigger and better than me?

TL;DR: My sister passed away, and my boyfriend took photos of me after being told and wants to post them online. "

"My [19/M] best friend [19/F] of 10 years pressured me into a relationship. She's been treating me poorly, and I need to leave her but I'm scared.


I've been dating my best friend and roommate Emily for a month. She admitted to being in love with me, and afterwards pressured me into a relationship. She said if I was really her best friend then I would give her a chance. She made me feel really guilty, so I said yes to the relationship, despite me not wanting to be in one.

Emily and I aren't compatible with each other. Her sex drive is much higher than mine, she constantly wants it, but I can't give it to her, and it makes her upset. I also don't think she can handle an adult relationship at the moment. She has tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants, and she's been making fun of me for no reason. I've told her how I felt and she dismisses my concerns. She doesn't like communicating her needs and thinks I'm supposed to magically know what she wants. 

I don't understand why Emily has been treating me like this since she started dating me. Her behaviour is extremely abnormal. She has never made fun of me before, until now. 

I need to leave the relationship but I'm genuinely scared what will happen if I do, and the fact that she's my roommate makes things more complicated. Emily has made subtle hints towards self-harm if I break up with her. I'm worried for her mental health. I feel so trapped in this and I don't know what to do.

"Me [19f] with my aunt [40f]. I agreed to do some artwork for her business. I thought we agreed she would pay me, she said she is giving me experience. What should I do? I'm worried how this will impact my family.


Where to begin on this. 

I am currently in a very expensive art school, it's always been my dream to be a paid artist and I think I'm very good at taking peoples ideas and turning them into reality. My parent's have been awesome and they saved up so much money for me to go to school that I only have a small amount of student loans but any paid work I get is a huge, huge help. 

My dad has two brothers, both are married. So lets say their wives are Aunt Kay and Aunt Jay. Last year Aunt Kay asked me to paint a picture of the view of the mountains from her dads gravesite. I did a very stylized acrylic that I thought turned out excellent, in fact it's one of my favorite things I've ever done. Aunt Kay actually broke into tears and I was so moved that I tried to refuse payment from her because her appreciation meant so much to me and she isn't wealthy by any means. But in the end she insisted on paying me and paid me far more than any of my artwork is worth, the money was so helpful this past year. 

So Aunt Jay contacted me at the beginning of the year talking about how impressed she was with Aunt Kay's painting and asking me if I would be willing to work on some designs for her new real estate business. I 100% remember telling her that I was really busy this semester and that as much as I hated to, I would have to charge her for my time because it would cut into my free time. I also swear on everything I am positive that she said ""don't worry about anything, I'll pay you"" but it came out very nice. 

Well she wanted a lot of stuff done, logos, office painting, a design for a mural in her office, a design for those magnets that go on cars and some other small things. 

Things got weird from the start, I did some initial sketches for her to see if we were going down the right path and she actually got sort of mad at me because I was wasting her time with non finished products. I told her that's kind of how I work because I don't want to waste expensive materials on ideas that she may not like. I actually have this in text and she said ""my time is just as valuable as your materials, so please don't waste it."" I was like ok, so I spent the next week doing a very elaborate oil painting from which her business logo would be taken. I even UPS shipped it to her. She hated it and got mad at me again for wasting her time. I tried to explain to her this is why I like to do sketches so there's no misunderstanding. She agreed this time and I finally came up with things she liked. I'd spent a lot of time on this project already, not so much that my grades were slipping but it was costing me time with my friends. So I did final versions of the oil painting for the office, did what I think is a really cool logo and a really nice mock up of the office mural. I was out quite a bit of money for the materials and shipping and it was very stupid of me to not follow up about the payment then. 

Things got really weird when she accused me of dragging my feet on the car magnet design. I said that what she should do is take the logo to a local graphic design place and they could easily do it. I also told her I thought we had the materials to make them at my school but I personally didn't. She accused me of not working hard enough for her. I was really taken aback and just decided enough was enough and I would just stop doing things for her. 

This is where things get really ugly. She contacted me out of the blue and thanked me for the advice on the magnets. She said that now she was ready for me to fly out and paint her office mural. I said that was pretty much impossible as I had classes and any decent mural painter could take my mock up and make it happen. She said she wanted me to do it. So I talked with my teachers to see if I could take a week off, all were supportive, so I looked up tickets and told Aunt Jay what it would cost to fly me out. She said that she assumed I would pay for it since I'd get to see my family anyways. I said I was really sorry but I just can't afford it but maybe if she paid me for the work I'd already done for her, maybe I could see if my parents would split the cost of the ticket with me. 

She literally exploded on me. I mean exploded. She accused me of showing favoritism to Aunt Kay because I'd tried to refuse payment for the gravesite painting, she accused me of dragging my feet and as quote as I can ""I wanted this shit in January and it's almost fucking April."" I tried to break in and say that we agreed I'd be paid and she called me short sighted and said something like (not a quote) ""do you realize how much doing work for someone like me can mean for someone like you? I'm giving you free advertising because hundreds of people will come in and out of my office every week!"" She then said she had given me valuable experience that is worth more than any amount of money. I was shocked and I said, actually her work was pretty easy and I'd done tons of pieces like that when I was in high school. She then said I was insulting her intelligence and hung up on me. 

That was yesterday afternoon and I'm still in shock. I haven't told my parents, I haven't told my uncle and I definitely haven't tried to call my aunt back. I'm worried that this is going to cause a big rift in my family and since she gets to see everyone on at least a weekly basis she'll get to tell her side of the story and I'll look like a greedy jerk that expects money from family. The art is a mute point because I can just stop and I can't afford a ticket with my own money so that will have to go to the wayside but I'm worried about the effect on my family. 

What should I do here?

*tl;dr: I agreed to do some art work for my aunt's business, I swear we agreed she'd pay me but she is so mad at me for asking for money and said I'm lucky she was giving me experience. What should I do?*


edit: This totally blew up! I've been working all day and got to check in once in a while. Sorry I didn't get a chance to reply. I tried to call my parents and tell them but didn't get an answer but I'll keep trying. I did get to talk to one of my favorite teachers and she was pissed. She is best friends with our schools licensing/legal affairs advisor and set me up with an appointment in the morning to find out what recourse I have. Thank you so much for everyone and the advice. I would love to update but I have a feeling this might get removed or cross posted, but if it doesn't I will absolutely put an update when I'm able. "
"I [27/F] have just found out that I am not my father’s biological daughter. Our family friend [60s/M] is my biological father and my parents [60sM] have known the entire time.


**Edit:Thank you for all of your responses, I was a bit overwhelmed at how many I have received but they've all been really helpful and it's starting to make me realise that none of this is my fault. And because this got asked a few times - I didn't tell Ben's family. Ben told his wife and James, but this was only after my sister found out and I suspect she threatened to tell Ben's wife.**




I am a long-term lurker on here but decided to create an account as I am facing a problem that I have no idea how to deal/cope with. 

The **TL;DR** of it is – I recently found out that my father is not my biological father, and that my biological father is my sister’s godfather/a good friend of the family. My parents and bio dad have known for years but kept it a secret from me. Now everything is awful.

The longer version is – I grew up in a happy home with my mother Anna, father Peter and sister Jane. Anna and Peter had a good marriage, they were loving parents and the only complaint I would make is Peter had a very demanding job that meant he wasn’t around much but now in hindsight I see that when he had the time he would spend it with us and his job meant we went to good schools and never had to worry about money. My sister Jane is 3 years older than me, and she has a godfather named Ben. Ben went to university with my mother, and he and his wife were close family friends growing up and I am friends with his son James who is about a year older than me.

I look a lot like my mother, like splitting image while Jane is a good mix of both of my parents. One of the things that bothered me growing up was that I didn’t seem to inherit any behavioural or physical traits from my Dad, and when I went through puberty I shot up and was much taller than the rest of my family. My mother explained this away as being probably some kind of genetic throwback since her grandmother was quite tall, etc. There was also a few times where James and I were mistaken for siblings, which again we just thought was funny at the time and presumed it was because we grew up so closely we must’ve given off that vibe.


Things came to a head a few months ago when Ben asked me if he could take me out for lunch. I first was worried thinking something was wrong with my sister or James, but then he just told me that he couldn’t keep this secret for much longer – he told me that there was a chance he was my biological father. He told me that my parents temporarily separated before I was a born, and during this period he slept with my mother a few times but she was also still sleeping with my father. When my parents reunited my mother was honest with Peter and told him that she was pregnant with me and she couldn’t guarantee that he was the father. She told him that Ben may have been the father, but apparently Peter didn’t care and wanted to raise me as his own. Ben put two and two together when my mother was pregnant, and apparently confronted her but she told him Peter believed I was his and that was that.


He told me that he’s struggled with this for years, and has tried to tell me or make my parents tell me but they refused and he was afraid of his wife finding out. He said the final straw was finding out there’s some hereditary health problems in their family that James is being tested for and he was worried about me. I felt like my world had fallen apart – I confronted my parents and they finally confessed. My mother begged me not to talk a paternity test as it would “break my father’s heart” but I did it because I was worried about my health. Ben is my biological father, and luckily I didn’t have any of the health problems.

I don’t know how to cope with the aftermath. I feel like I have destroyed two families because my parents are having problems, my sister is so angry with them and Ben and she was so close to Ben growing up. Ben’s wife has left him and James is refusing to speak to anyone, and he sent me a long, abusive email saying I have destroyed his family.

I also don’t know what to do in terms of my relationships with Peter and Ben. Peter raised me, and I see him as my father but it’s hard for me to ignore the fact that Ben is my biological father. I feel so so angry at my mother as well – I feel like she’s the one who’s manipulated both men into staying quiet for her own benefit and it’s now torn us all apart. How do I navigate this?"

"I [17/F] think my dad [40/M] holds resentment towards me because I'm not his biological child.


My mom [40/F] had an affair during her first year of marriage with my dad, and that resulted in my birth. I have never met my biological dad, and I never want to. My real dad is the one who raised me since birth.

It feels like my dad holds resentment towards me though. I don't look anything like him. I have blonde hair, and blue eyes, while my dad is the opposite with his brown eyes, and black hair. My mom and I are very close with each other. She's like a friend to me, she takes me to the mall, we go to the spa sometimes, and she drives me everywhere (soccer practice, friend's houses, etc).

It makes me sad to know that my friend's dads take them out to go fishing, or hunting, etc. My dad doesn't do any of that. I never spend any quality time with him, and I don't remember the last time he said that he loved me. He's like a stranger to me. I also don't know much about my dad, other than he plays video games sometimes.

my dad probably never wanted me. I can't blame him though, what my mom did was terrible, and I'm a daily reminder of that.

I love my dad, and I want him to recognize that I'm his daughter. I want to give my dad a big hug, and say I love him. I want to build a relationship with him before I leave for university this year, but I don't know how to start, or if he even wants anything to do with me. Is there any way I can fix my relationship with my dad???

"I [22M] found out I was a result of an affair after my mother's funeral, I tried to contact my biological father [50something M] who is dying from cancer, his wife and children think I'm trying to ""weasel"" in for money


My mother died in a car accident several months ago. I found evidence proving my ""dad"" is not my actual father. My mother as far as I know was never a nice woman, being all sorts physically and emotionally abusive to me and my half siblings ( 30s F and M). In fact me and my ""dad"" were literally the only people to turn up to her funeral. My ""dad"" used to just zone her out and had hardly anything to do with the family 80% of the time he was downstairs listening to music while drinking when he was home. My mother always said 'no one is going to profit from my death' so she left a little bit of cash to my siblings so they could use it to pay for her funeral, I got nothing, and the rest was donated to a shelter somewhere.

Because she's dead and my ""dad"" didn't care I looked into some of her old stuff, I found another copy of my birth certificate with a different man listed as my father and some type of DNA results matching this man and not my ""dad"" as my father, also some old letters with an address. My ""dad"" and my mother have been married for at least 35 years and are both in their mid 50s.

The man lives in a different state and I decided to contact him, when I mentioned my name and my mothers name and said that I was his son he immediately wanted me to fly down to see him even offering to pay for my flights. So I went down and met him, he invited me to stay at his house. He's fairly well off.

I met his wife and 2 children who are both mid teens, he told me about the obvious affair then my mother tried to use me to get cash off him, when he mentioned that he said he would pay child support on the grounds that he gets visitation rights thus making the affair known to my ""dad"" and ruining my mother's fake 'happy families' portrait, she noped out with restraining orders, false accusations of harassment and abuse, while regularly moving to avoid contact during my childhood.

The man then later met his current wife and had kids with her, said he regrets not trying harder contact me but wants me around since now he's dying from cancer (having somewhere like 3-5 years max left). While staying at the place I noticed the wife and the eldest teen were passive aggressive to me and fake nice to me when he was around, his youngest teen seems oblivious to everything including his sibling's/mother's behaviour so he isn't a problem.

One day while I was sitting in the kitchen, the mother with the eldest teen lurking in the background she told me she knows I am only here for money, that I only have interest because he is dying, and I'm trying to ""weasel"" in for a piece. She left then the eldest teen attempted very poorly to intimidate me, I wasn't going to hit him or anything yet he tried to basically square up and threaten me (sort of like a school bully) unfortunately for him I'm taller, fitter, and stronger than he currently is so when I stood up he immediately back off.

I ended up leaving a few days later because the place is just hostile and awkward to be in especially with the mother's/teen's behaviour, the fact I don't really know the guy that well, etc yet I said I would keep in contact and try visit more. I sort of do want to but I also don't want to travel to get treated like shit, made to feel uncomfortable, and accused of wanting money.

TL;DR finally met my biological father, his wife and teen think I'm only there for money"
"I [23F] received a shitty diagnosis and I want to travel the world before it's too late. My parents [60 M/F] are angry that I want to leave. How can I make them come around?


I found out that my cancer has metastasized to my brain and while it's not spreading at the moment, I'm terrified that it will soon. I want to avoid doing this trip on a wheelchair, which may likely happen in the future so I really think the best time would be within the next year. After I told my parents about how I want to leave university/the country, they got really mad and I hate feeling like this. I love my parents and I don't want to leave if they're going to resent me for it.

How can I make them see reason? I don't want to die without experiencing all the cool shit there is out there which honestly I might still feel like shit but at least I can say I've done it all. You guys have cool advice sometimes so I'm willing to hear it all.

TLDR I'm dying and I want to travel and my parents aren't taking the news well. What should I do?"

"I[43M] let my daughter[14F] go out on a ""date"" with a boy[15M] from her school. My wife now thinks that I have acted irresponsibly and I should have never allowed it.


This is a weird one. I mean my wife never acted like this before and I am at my wits end here. 

My daughters (19F,14F) and I were on a vacation almost a week ago. We had a grand old time together and it was quite fun. While I was walking around the town in which we were staying, Alice (the younger) and I met a family from our hometown that was there as well. They have a son (15M) that is a year older than my daughter but they go to the same school. So my daughter was talking with him while I was talking with his parents. 

So after about 10-15 minutes of talking, we part ways and on our way back to our hotel, Alice told me that the boy asked her out to go see a movie tonight. I stared at her for a bit and she just shrugged her shoulders and said that she was surprised as well since she had no idea he wanted to go out with her. 

Now I absolutely love my daughter. She is a very smart and bright kid and I am so proud of her. But when it comes to boys, she is completely clueless. It was apparent from miles away that this kid had something for her. I noticed that he smiled at her a lot, made a lot of eye contact with her, tried flirting with her. But I guess at this age, everyone can be a bit clueless. 

So I asked her if she wants to go and Alice said that she definitely wants.  My other daughter, Nicole was really helpful once I told her what's going on. She took her little sister out for shopping, she got her some new clothes and, later on, did her hair and make-up. 


So about 7:00 my daughter's date comes and picks her up in a cab and they are on their way. Nicole and I went out for dinner, then we went bowling and around 9:30 Alice calls me and asks me to come pick her up. I pick her up and ask her how it went. Alice told us that she had a great time. After the movies, they went to get some pizza and after that, they had a nice walk in the park. 


She literally wouldn't shut up about it for the next day or so. She said that she can't wait to tell her mom about it but since my wife was out of the country and nowhere to be found on social media, this had to wait to a few days ago when my wife finally came back from her trip. 

Here is where the problem begins. Once my wife[41F] found out that I let Alice go on this date with this boy, she flipped. Not in front of Alice but in a private conversation with me and Nicole. Apparently, we shouldn't have let her go, that we were irresponsible, that Alice is too young to be doing this, something could have happened to her, the list goes on and on. 

Now because of this, my wife is mad at us, more with me than Nicole because I am the adult and I should have known better. I am apparently an irresponsible parent and I have ""overstepped"" the boundaries. The term ""whoring out our daughter"" was used or at least implied. 

I am genuinely baffled at this. My wife has never been like this and I am at a loss for words ever since this has happened. I mean I don't think that my daughter going to see a movie with some boy from school would hurt her. I mean our other daughter is currently dating someone and my wife has no issues with this. But God forbid our other daughter do the same. 


My wife's been in a really crappy mood because of this and is extremely pissy with the both me and Nicole and I don't know what I should do. Do I apologise for doing something wrong? Do I try and make it up somehow? I am extremely confused over what's going on and I need some help with dealing with this


tl;dr I've let my daughter go on a ""date"" with a boy from her school. My oldest daughter helped her sister out in preparing for her date. My wife says that we made a mistake, that we shouldn't have done this, that we were acting irresponsibly, that she is a way too young to be thinking about dating and as a result of all of this, my wife is now mad at me. I don't where I went wrong or if I did something wrong and I could use some help in making it up."

"My (25F) best friend (26F) unfriended me and is mad at me for pointing out her child is disrespectful in my home


Longer than intended...tldr at bottom.

I have been friends with this person for a decade. She's a single mom to an almost 4yo and when I became a single mom our bond free stronger than before. I help her out sometimes by babysitting her kiddo - at minimum of once a week since September/October. That has since stopped mid February when her schedule changed. Kiddo is super smart...to the point of knowing proper names for almost any dinosaur, bird or fish (Like she says plecostomous vs sucker fish) and can point them out at random.

Which is why it baffles me when she comes to my house she's very defiant. She knows the one rule is to not stomp in my house (pier and beam...original 1940s hardwood floors...noisy af) and do not wake the baby. You can ask her what my #1 rule is and she will repeat that back to you. 

But she does it anyway. Each and every time she's over. She stomps thru my house (gallops really...shes on a horse lover kick) and wakes my baby. She does say sorry....but she never means it. It's like she shrugs and says I'm sorry and that's that...then a few minutes later is back to stomping.

Saturday was the final straw. My daughter and I have both been sick all of spring break. We had both gotten very little sleep and had been cooped up in the house. I had gotten a new puppy as a foster and they came to see it. I had *just* gotten my daughter down for the night after both of us only getting about 5hrs a sleep the night before and only a fitful hour nap that day (she normally will take 2 2hr ones). I told her when she got there were going to stay in the front yard and that she needed to not wake the baby and to be quiet. 

I propped the door open so I could hear if she wakes. We play with the puppy all fine and dandy. Then, while my friend and I were talking kiddo RUNS into the house and gallops across the floor. For no reason.

Cue baby waking up and me asking them to leave. It takes me TWO HOURS to get baby back to sleep. I'm livid. Exhausted, sick, pissed off but calmly message my friend about how I felt disrespected. 

She tells me ""She was just excited about the puppy and she said sorry"".

Which I would excuse if it was just that one time. But it's every time. And she knows that.

So we talk a bit more and she decides that because I said her daughter was being disrespectful to me and my house, I was calling her a shit parent. Which I wasn't. I was just trying to relay I felt disrespected and felt that she was old enough to understand not yo do something she clearly knows not to do. I just wanted to bring it to her attention - again - about the blatant disrespect. Bc kiddo is reminded each time what not to do...but does it anyway. 

Lo and behold she unfriended me and I didn't find out till later. I understand she's mad, I never meant to insult her parenting and tried to relay it as such. I don't make friends easily because of my anxiety so losing one of the three I have is difficult for me...especially over something i feel is so minor over a decade long friendship. When I asked why she unfriended me she said she's mad, doesn't want to talk and she doesn't get mad often so her being mad at me right now is a big thing and to leave her alone. So I said ok and left it at that.

Question now is what do I do if she suddenly decides to be friends again...and was I wrong to point out the disrespectful attitude and rugsweeping my friend and her child have towards me and my household? I asked my sister who is a early childhood teacher and early childhood psych major and she said a 4yo should have the understanding and if reminded each time she shouldn't easily forget. Which led her to believe the child was purposefully doing what told not to do because she knows she will get away with it if she says sorry. 

At this point I don't really want to see the kid in my house again...shes defiant in many other ways, it's just that one that frustrates me the most because it impacts my child. I also feel like maybe her reaction is not something I can willingly let go if she decides to be friends again...like I can't tell her if I see something ""off"" in fears she'll just blow up like a high schooler again (like I can understand not wanting to talk to me, but to unfriend me is a bit much imo).

***Additional Info: the child is blatantly disrespectful each time she is over. And that she screams ""I want my mommy"" for up to an hour and 20mins (because she didn't want to go to bed) or anytime that she is disciplined for throwing things, hitting the dogs, not doing what I asked her to do etc.

Her mother's solution to anytime that I need to discipline her and she screams this (which is every time) is wait for her to stop screaming or give her what she wants.***

Tldr: decade old best friend's defiant child constantly disrespects me in my home. When I pointed this out she rugswept the behavior and ""is so mad at me"" for doing so then unfriended me...what do I do?"

"Just found out my husband [33M] has been seeing a lawyer without telling me [31F].


He is currently away for work and while doing some clearly today I found a lawyer's bill for about $3000 dating two months ago. I tried googling the law firm to see what their practice area is but they're a large and multidiciplinary firm.

I'm very confused about why he's seeing a lawyer without telling me. We've always had good communication and never hidden things from each other, or so I thought. We've been together for 7 years, married for 3 and no children.

I called him to see what he'll say and he said it's not something that I should worry about and it doesn't really affect me or our marriage or anything about the two of us. 

Am I going crazy thinking this is a big deal? I feel betrayed and mistrusted. What reason could possibly be that he is seeing a lawyer that wouldn't affect me or isn't my business too? I don't know and I've been thinking and thinking and overthinking this for a few hours now.

Can you help me please see things more clearly?

"My SO [27m] of 3yrs and I [32f] found out another girl [23f] has an Instagram account full of posts about my SO.


This might be a little long and all over the place, but I'll try to make it make sense. 

When I first met my SO, he was casually chatting with a few other people and feeling out possible relationships. We ended up clicking really well and started dating. 

One of these people he was chatting with, we'll call Jane. He and Jane chatted on and off after we started dating, but he was very open about it (I have a bit of trust issues) and on his side, it was strictly friendly.

Unfortunately Jane is a younger, and slightly socially awkward person. After finding out he was in a relationship she joked about friending me on Facebook. I'm super private with my FB and I don't like a ton of people being part of that. He mentioned that to her and suggested she leave me alone. She agreed and passed it off as a joke. Well wouldn't you know it, that night she added me, and told me not to worry or feel threatened with her and my SO. I shared all this with him and he was less than impressed. He spoke to her about boundaries and not listening to his wishes. She apologised but was very unconvincing with her explanation.

Over the next few months Jane's messages and actions were increasingly concerning. At one point my SO and I talked about how I was getting uncomfortable with her and that I felt that he needed to very clearly set boundaries with her or it was going to keep getting worse. He felt I was over-reacting and assured me she was harmless. Eventually I just asked him to just stop telling me about her messages.

Jane then shows up at my work. She tells me she just wanted to talk and get to know the person her favourite guy friend was dating. I politely, but very quickly found an excuse to hide in my office to get away from her. I'm uncomfortable talking to her, especially in my work place where I need to be professional and polite at all times. I let a co-worker know the coles notes and she watches Jane wonder around a bit and let's me know when she finally leaves. At this point my SO is finally seeing that this might not be as harmless as he thought. He decides to have a brutally honest conversation with her and eventually blocked her number and on all social media. There were a few small incidents afterwards but it very shortly petered out.

Fast forward 2 years to yesterday. I posted a silly picture on IG and got a notice a few hours later that someone I didn't know liked it and immediately unliked it. So of course I creeped them. It's Jane! Well that's slightly unnerving... I showed my SO who has zero understanding of how IG works and tells me *'so what, it's not like she is stalking you. I'm sure she just searched one of your obnoxious hash things.'* I was less than convinced so I tried to creep her account, and suddenly I'm blocked. I search her user name and another site shows the pictures she's posted. There are multiple screen shots of conversations with my SO and several of his pictures. 

The screen shot convos are all *2+ years* old but she has cropped out all of the time stamps to make them all look recent. She also has posted birthday wishes every year to him and calls him her best guy friend and has even made a **#instagramless[SOs name]** hashtag for all of his posts. We're both super creeped out at this point and have no idea how to react. 

We're concerned that contacting her will just be enabling her, but neither of us are comfortable doing nothing. Any advice would be appreciated. 


TL;DR - young girl has an obsessive IG account about her and my SO after being blocked by him for years. Secretly stalks my IG and accidentally likes a post revealing it all.

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice, I'm reading every comment and it's all been very helpful. We've both locked down all social media and blocked her on as meant as possible. I got a few screen shots of her IG posts before she blocked me. I've also spoken to my boss about the situation and he's being very supportive. "
"[[UPDATE]] Me [31F] with SO [30M] of 10 months - He wants me to quit smoking pot, but I feel like this is a power play rather than a serious concern.


My post wasn't terribly popular, but I did have a couple of people interested in hearing where it went, so here ya'll go :) 

Previous Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8474xp/me_31f_with_so_30m_of_10_months_he_wants_me_to/

TL;DR of original: My SO cannot stand the smell of pot. I smoke rarely, but cannot wrap my head around his point of view on this topic. I was worried that this was a power play. The best compromise I found with the help of Reddit was to suggest using a vaporizer. 

Now, there was a bit of a roller coaster since my last post. Before I was able to meet with him (he's on split shifts, on nights, which is why the conversation ended up happening over text) to discuss the vaporizer option, he sent me a text basically reneging on his previous comments about edibles being ok and smoking with my family being ok - he doesn't want to be in a relationship with a stoner. 

I was disappointed but stuck to my guns and said (personal info redacted), ""If there is no room for compromise, then there is no relationship.
I was going to suggest a vape pen to help eliminate the smell... Since you were so adamant that it was about the smell, but clearly its not.
What you're asking for is too much for me to be comfortable with. I'm sorry.""

His reply boils down to, ""I know I fucked up. If anybody asked why we broke up, I'd say it was from my lack of communication skills. I never thought in a million years that you'd compromise, or that vaping was an option. I thought you'd just leave me, so I pushed.  If I ever have an issue in the future, I'd talk about it right away."" 

He isn't totally wrong, of course I compromised, but I wasn't ready to fold and would have left if it was all-or-nothing. I have confidence in where I stand on this issue and ended up telling him, ""This is where I firmly stand, you are the one who keeps moving the line, this is the compromise I am comfortable with and you need to decide what your boundaries are.""

So... We went to a smoke shop! It was kind of awkward (but also secretly hilarious) - the whole shop was hot-boxed and one of his buddies from high school was there. He chatted with the customer service guy, his friend, and his friend's buddy (who's married to a woman who doesn't smoke). After both of us learning more about it he offered to *buy me* a vape to use; I said I would take him up on it when we're ready to move in together (because I don't need it now). 

Furthermore, on Tuesday I had been able to get a last minute appointment with a counselor. I spoke to her about this issue (even though we had found a compromise) and also my general concerns about us having some differences based on the way we were brought up (the pot is the most obvious). She asked me some questions to help flesh out where we are now, what my perfect relationship would be, and about reasonable expectations of your partner. 

In the end, I do strongly feel that this man is a good match for me. We had a hiccup, it wasn't handled very smoothly, but I do think we've both learned from this experience and I can say I'm about 87% certain that any problems in the future will be *discussed* in a healthy way instead of acting on assumptions. He flip-flopped a bit, but we never raised our voices or were disrespectful towards each other - we are also similar where we both tend to need time to fully digest new information (""I gotta sleep on it"" was said at least 3 times during our discussions). It wasn't fun having him go back and forth and try to make up rules, but I do think that it was because he was trying to decide for himself how he felt, rather than anything malicious or manipulative. 

I think that about sums it up :) If I missed any points let me know.

TL;DR: We had an adult conversation, got some education, found a compromise, I got a counselor's opinion, and I think we're on track to build a pretty solid foundation. 

**Edit** some people were concerned about the sunglasses thing mentioned in the comments; I brought it up during the smoking-compromise conversation, his reaction was ""Well, don't hurt your eyes because of me! That's the last thing I want you to do!"" :) "

"Aunt (50+) accused me(16)of stealing her ring 2 days ago


On Saturday evening I was at my aunt “Laura’s” house .  Me and my mom were going to sleep over there for the night. My other aunt “Becky” comes in and tells my mom she needs to talk to her about me. I’ll try to make this short as possible. She tells my mom she’s “here because of what she stole” while looking at me . When she said that she pulls out a ring and I’m like ????? . Cause first of all, I would never NEVER ever steal something, I’m not that type of person . Second of all, I’ve NEVER seen those rings . So before I could defend myself she proceeds to tell this story about how her sister in law went to jail because she started doing frauds. She basically said she didn’t want that happening to me . My mom was like tf, I was like tf, and I was shocked tbh. So I asked Becky “what makes you think it was me ?” And she told me “I know it was you because that day you went to my house” and then I asked her “okay so if I “stole” the ring how come you have it ?” And she says “because I found it 3 days later in the back sit of my car” honestly all of this was making me so angry/sad . Like that doesn’t prove anything she could’ve just left the ring there. Then she also says I “left a note that said ‘I shoplifted without my mom knowing’ “ and that she asked my cousin “Gabriel” who’s handwriting was it and he said it was mine. I was really hurt at this cause I felt my own cousin turned his back on me, plus he’s Never seen my handwriting. Okay long story short my mom doesn’t believe her cause she knows me plus like she said “it’s not just because she’s my daughter I know the things she would and not do”.   Then Becky tells us she told the whole family !! I was so embarrassed. Cause her ring went missing 6 months ago. And me and my mom were the only ones to not know ! Also later on that day Gabriel called me and told me the note doesn’t exist and that aunt Becky made that thing up. Honestly I’ve never done anything to her and I feel she’s against me. I won’t be visiting her house anymore 

TL;DR: How do I deal with this ? Honestly it’s been 2 days and I still feel down ."

"Me [28 F] with my coworker [32 M] 1 year, just berated for ""performing psychological warfare"" on him.


I am in a training program (think like a medical residency) with about 10 other coworkers. Last week, five of them were studying for the first part of boards. This is a very difficult test, and they are given 2 weeks off of work to study. I am a first year, and I know the tradition in the past is for people early in the program to get cards and study/relaxation treats (chocolate, ""smarties"" candies, trail mix, etc) for the people taking boards. This is both to encourage them and remind them they are not alone, since studying at home for 2 weeks tends to be isolating.

So, I got everyone in the department to sign cards, put them in the treat packages, and dropped them off at everybody's house (since they would not be at work before taking the test, and in some cases, for some time afterward). I got addresses from having been invited to their house before, or from other coworkers if I hadn't. Most packages I left at people's doorstep and e-mailed them to check their porch, including this particular coworker. 

Today, the coworker called my office, and told me to come to his office to talk. When I did, he immediately started yelling at me. He told me, ""That is some psychological warfare you pulled."" I was so confused, I just said, ""huh?"". He went on, saying he only looked at the package because he thought it was for his son's birthday, ""otherwise he would have thrown that shit away to begin with,"" and ""don't ever fucking do that again,"" and that he wasn't the only one who felt it was a deliberate act to remind him of the pressure he was under. I was so shocked I just agreed I would never do that again and left. 

Shortly after, I sent him this e-mail:
[Coworker],
Your behavior this morning was totally unprofessional. I am sorry you were displeased with the card and felt pressured by it. I can assure you that was not my or anyone else’s intention; rather, we wanted you to know that regardless of the outcome, you have the department’s support. However, to call me over to your office in order to berate me, using multiple curse words, was absolutely uncalled for. If you have an issue in the future, I would appreciate professional communication, in writing. 

[Me]

Ten minutes later, he called my office again asking me to come by and talk again. I was out, and when I got back I ignored it because I didn't feel comfortable talking to him in person again. Later, he came by my office and tried to explain how uncomfortable I made him. I kept saying, ""please, I asked you, I only want to discuss this over writing,"" but he wouldn't leave and kept talking over me.

I am so hurt and in shock right now. He does have a reputation for being blunt and rude, and (I was just told) has been known to push a cup of coffee of a desk that an office mate brought him it. No one mentioned any of this to me when I was collecting signatures. I understand that I may have been wrong to drop them off at peoples' houses because a private person could feel like their privacy was invaded. However, I would never expect to be yelled at the way I just was. My coworkers are encouraging me to report this to our program director. I wasn't going to, except the coworker continued to harass me after I sent the e-mail asking for professional future communication. Should I talk to the program director?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the feedback! I totally understand the people who felt the house drop off was inappropriate. For context, we live in a small town where everybody lives around the corner from another and the program is very close knit, with frequent socializing, so the invasion of privacy aspect didn't even occur to me when planning the cards (also, that is how it had been done in the past). That is my fault and I won't ever do it again. I would have been okay if he had approached me calmly about not liking it. I would even have been okay if he had gone to our director about it. It was the yelling and cursing that was not okay. I ended up reporting the incident to our director, just because I don't want this to happen to other people, and I at least wanted this incident on record. Again, thanks for the perspective from both sides, and the kind words that helped me though a really terrible work day. 


TL;DR: Dropped off study care package at coworker's house. Got yelled at until I was in tears. Handle it myself or talk to program director?"
"I [late 20s F] don't know how to tell my biological mother [40s F] that she won't be my children's ""grandma"" or meeting them


Thank you in advance to anyone who reads and replies to this. I'll try to keep it as short as possible and stick to the essential details while still explaining as well as I can, but you know these things can get out of hand quickly. 


My biological mom was very young when she had me and my 2 siblings - 3 kids under 4 by age 21. When we were old enough to remember but still younger than 10, we were taken into foster care and it became permanent about a year later due to my mother's inability to beat alcoholism. She moved several hours away and we didn't hear from her for over 15 years, until a few years ago when she joined Facebook and added me as a friend. We chatted a little, and I ""forgave"" her for my rough childhood in the sense that I wanted us to have closure and move on instead of dwelling on the past. We still message a little bit here and there and talk on the phone a couple times a year, but otherwise I try to keep my emotional distance as certain random, small details remind me too much of bad memories from when I was a child. 


Until the next part, I am/was comfortable with our relationship, since I can control how much contact we have because it is 100% over Facebook or phone/text. So once in a while - I'm talking a handful of times spread over the last several months at least - she has made comments on photos I've shared of myself and my fiancé, along the lines of ""make me some grandbabies"" or ""I want to be a grandma."" I've never addressed them besides ""laughing"" reactions and once I replied something dismissive like ""not for a few years haha"" because honestly it made me nervous and felt invasive - let alone how presumptuous and bingo-y it is in the first place since she had no way of knowing if we are childfree or just haven't had kids yet. 


My dilemma? I don't know if I will ever be ready to see her in person again. So, obviously that means my future children won't be meeting her until they're old enough to make that choice themselves; I'm not currently expecting a baby but could have one anytime from 10 months to 10 years from now if I'm being realistic. When the time comes, they won't be calling her ""grandma"" and they will probably only know of her when they are in their teenage years and old enough to be told about my childhood. 


In fact, I have thought about making new, heavily locked-down social media accounts in the future for extra privacy (and to avoid turning my regular ones into the inevitable baby-spam), and preemptively blocking her and other biological relatives from seeing them before even posting anything. I also feel a bit of pressure since I'm likely the only way she will have grandchildren; one of my siblings is childfree due to being traumatized by our childhood and fearing passing on the emotional issues caused by it, while the other has a medical condition that makes it so they will never biologically have children. 


I feel guilty about all of this and I don't know that to do. Do I continue to laugh off/dismiss her comments and wait until I'm ready to announce my future pregnancy before breaking the news to her? Or next time it happens, do I message her privately and tackle it right away so that she doesn't hold onto false hope for an indefinite amount of time (months, years) only to have it shattered later? 


Some info that may be relevant for context but I didn't know where to fit it in: The main reason I am able to forgive her for the past is because I see her as someone who was weakened by her childhood (much worse than mine) and then pushed down even further by her addictions and the toxic people she chose to have in her life. She never directly abused us kids, but did let us witness/experience some questionable things due to her impaired judgment, which makes talking to her difficult since she seems to not remember most of those years.

And while she insists she barely drinks anymore, she has called me intoxicated a few times and it brought back so many faint but negative memories with very strong emotions attached to them; the idea of those thoughts/memories being around while she oohs and ahhs over my future child makes me feel sick. I don't feel any attachment or sense of familial duty toward her, and don't feel like I ""owe"" her anything as far as my future family is concerned. I do however not want to rock the boat or hurt her feelings, because I feel like she has suffered enough (or will) from her mistakes and I don't need to add to that since I decided to forgive her and let us both have closure as much as possible. 

**TL;DR** I haven't seen my birth mother in almost 20 years and have only had contact with her online for less than 5. She talks about seeing my future children in an excited, normal, future-grandma way and I don't know how to tell her she won't be fulfilling that role for them, or when to tell her (either wait until I am expecting a baby, or tell her soon so she's not believing a lie for months/years).

"Me [17F] with my peers [14-18M/F] I started a knitting trend in my school. It's started to take up too much of my time and I can't seem to set boundries.


Hey guys,

I learned to knit a few years ago. I attend a tiny private school (under 40 kids). I knit in class to help myself pay attention and keep anxiety down.

My school started a knitting club during study hall after several kids expressed interest in learning after seeing me do it.

I **love** that people have started to knit. However, I find that my peers and teachers are expecting too much of me.

I was placed in the club against my will (I prefer regular study hall) and was told by the admin I was expected to teach.

I find it very stressful as I am constantly asked for help and to teach people. It sounds mean but I don't want to teach at all. I don't like doing it.

I told my school that I wanted to leave the club and they told me that I couldn't because people were ""depending"" on me. The staff makes me feel bad when I say I can't help.

Yesterday, someone came up to me while I was eating. I will admit my response was harsh. I told them that I was obviously busy and it wasn't a good time. They insisted it would just take a moment and I told them no and that they were being rude.

The headmaster overheard us and pulled me into his office and scolded me for being mean. He told me it wasn't fair to try to keep knitting to myself and that I wasn't being a good community member.

I DON'T DISLIKE people knitting other than me. I just do not want to teach them or help them.

How do i make it clear that I cannot help people? How do i stop getting in trouble? Am i really being so mean?

TLDR: starting a knitting trend at my school. expected to help peers and scolded when i refuse. i don't want to help anyone and i've gotten in trouble for refusing. How do i make it clear that I cannot help people? How do i stop getting in trouble? Am i really being so mean?"

"[UPDATE] My (19M) girlfriend (24F) and my older brother (26M) don't get along and it's causing our relationship a lot of stress


[Original] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7vl0dy/my_19m_girlfriend_24f_and_my_older_brother_26m/)

Okay so I realized I never updated and while this is also an update it's also another question, kinda?  So the arguments continued happening from my last post for quite awhile until I eventually told my brother that he either needed to give me a damn good reason for his dislike of her or I wasn't going to argue with him about it anymore.  I left the room and went to my room.  Our parents weren't home as usual and so it left the house really quiet after our fight.  My brother finally came into my room and asked if we could talk.  I agreed though I didn't really feel like it.  My brother took a long look around my room (he hates how messy I keep it) and I thought for sure he was waiting for me to apologize.  I wasn't about to, so I continued to stare at him, waiting for him to start.

He eventually decided to lean against the wall and (here's the surprising part) apologized to me.  I was kinda thrown off but wasn't about to stop him from apologizing.  He felt bad for putting me in such an awkward position and felt bad for the way he'd been acting.  I told him I just wanted to know his reasoning.  I swear guys it took like 10 minutes for him to stop looking around the room and answer me.

My brother is gay and had dated my girlfriend's younger brother (23M).  My brother has never mentioned this before, or even hinted at being gay.  Our parents are both pretty homophobic and, as far as I know, my brother has never come out publicly.  Apparently, he was worried that my girlfriend (who knew my brother and her brother dated) would tell me (whether on purpose or by accident) so he didn't want me to date her.  He admitted he was wrong and apologized a few more times.  He made me swear not to tell mom or dad or anyone else.  I agreed, of course, it was all pretty emotional, though my brother isn't a very emotional person so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  My brother thanked me for listening and left and it hasn't been spoken of since.  

He's become more accepting of my girlfriend and will nod to her if he see's her (though not much more than that).  Our parents came home a couple days later and the first couple days I noticed my brother always lingering in the room if it was just me and them but that's gone away too.  All in all, things have gotten better, though still kinda awkward because now when our parents make homophobic jokes around us I feel really guilty or like my stomach drops instead of laughing.  My brother still laughs and plays along and I don't know how he does it.  I feel disgusted with my parents when I hear them make jokes or use gay slurs (I always have but more so now) but my brother makes no comment or flinches, or even makes a face.  I have no idea how or when my brother became such a good actor but I know my parents have noticed me acting differently and have asked about it.  I'm not as good an actor as my brother and I know they see right through me.  Every time they ask me and my brother is in the room he gives me this side-eye like he's mentally yelling at me to pull myself together.  I know I can't tell them because I'd never do that to my brother but it's hard pretending like nothing's changed at all.  I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks guys.

**Tl;dr:**  My older brother is actually gay and shortly dated my girlfriend's younger brother while in high school.  My parents are extremely homophobic which is why my brother hasn't come out publicly and probably never will.  I'm forced to act like their jokes and stuff aren't offensive (just like I always have) but now they hit closer to home and they're starting to notice I'm acting weird.  Having a hard time holding up appearances but I have to for my brother."

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hhehv/my_22m_girlfriend_21f_has_left_me_for_another_guy/)

Thank for everyone who commented last time I really needed the feedback just like anyone else. In the end because everyone including some members of my family said she should move I decided to confront in Dec 2017 her and tell her she needed to leave as she's with someone else now and I told her that it's not fair on me and should tell her new boyfriend to find her a place.

She then kept on telling me that he's not working also and doesnt have enough money yet for that to happen, then we went back and forth for a while I would say suggestion she would make excuse. I then went on to say she wasn't my responsibility anymore and she is the one that broke up with me. She then replied and said this was proof that I never really loved and now she knew she made the right choice, and she was very angry at this point with tears coming down 

She then refused listen or interact with me, and started packing and she took all the stuff that was mine which was a gift from her, and then left. I felt a bit guilty as I should have handled it better so I sent her an apology text but she didnt reply and I havent spoken to her since.

Afterwards I was depressed for a couple of weeks even thinking about suicide (which is why I didn't update sooner), I quit my job and had to move back in with my parents on the east coast but im getting better and feeling okay again. I still feel upset if I think about her too muh but im just trying to focus one me now.

We broke up a little over a year and a half ago, back then he was kind of just starting to get a following on YouTube and our goals just didn't align so I ended things. I just didn't think we were headed in the right direction together, nothing personal. I didn't end things on a bad note but he had a hard time accepting that I was moving on and done with him. 

Well last week I started getting messages on Facebook from random people all over the country saying how terrible of a person I was and all kinds of nasty things. I was so confused but I had a feeling about where it came from so I went and checked his channel and, yeah, he made a video about our relationship.

He didn't come out and just blatantly call me names or anything like that but he detailed how I was emotionally abusive(I wasn't), how I was talking to other people(Also wasn't), and just kind of winking at me being a bad person. Then he named dropped me in the video!

"Me[22M] and my deceased girlfriend's[19F at time] favourite song has now become my mother's[53F] favourite song and is making me lose it every time I hear it.


Nothing really much else to say since the title explains most of it but I'll go into a bit more detail.

We first started dating when we were 15. When me and my now passed girlfriend were both 20, she was struck by a car while she was crossing a road and later passed in the hospital.

Two years later after a long battle with grief and depression I was finally able to get back to the closest thing to my 'normal' life. This was close to three months ago (around the start of the year). I still live at home as universities here are close to my house, which means I am still exposed to everyone's everyday habits and whatnot.

Now that a bit of backstory is over, I'll talk about the current situation. Recently for about two weeks now, my mum has found a new favourite song and I regularly hear it through the house every now and again. As said before, this was the song that me and my girlfriend shared tons of memories with together and every time I hear it, I feel a range of emotions hit me like a truck. I feel angry at times, feeling as though it was my fault, but it always ends with me feeling absolutely horrible, overwhelmingly sad and depressed for hours at a time.

I'm asking for help on how to confront my mother about the issue. It may not sound like a big deal to some people but my mum put our relationship off as a young and dumb type thing and yes she was there to help me through the passing but she never really saw the whole picture. Most importantly she has never seen me as someone who feels the way I have explained but more of a tough tall kid who can take anything.

I hope I have explained enough and any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks

TL;DR Me and my deceased girlfriend's favourite song has now become my mother's favourite song and is making me lose it every time I hear it.

Edit: I'm currently super busy so don't have time to personally respond to each comment, so I'll just do it here. Many many thanks to everyone for their helpful and kind responses! I've taken all your words into consideration and have decided I will just confront her and be straight forward about the whole situation. Thank you all again."
"My [31F] friends [early 30s Fs] dumped me last year. They just invited my husband [30M] to a party without me.


I've been friends with Sarah and Angela for about 10 years. They started hanging out with a group of women they went to high school with after reconnecting at an alumni event in late 2016. These new friends are very much Mean Girls types, and have been pretty consistently rude to me whenever I've been around them, so at first I was turning down big group events every now and then, just trying to limit my interaction with this new crowd. As time went on, however, I realized that Sarah and Angela weren't inviting me to *anything* anymore, even though they were still including the rest of our old social circle. I figured I'd take the initiative and try to organize several girls nights and things like that with the two of them, but every time they blew me off, once even leaving me holding the bag on the deposit for a reservation. 

I tried to have a conversation with them about it, but they turned the whole thing back on me, saying that they stopped including me because I never invited them to do anything. I pointed out that I'd planned multiple things with them, only to have them bail on me, and they pretended like it never happened. When I tried to discuss how badly their new friends treated me, they said I was being too sensitive, and I just didn't get their sense of humor. At that point, I realized there was no point in arguing anymore.

Then in the fall, Sarah didn't invite me to her birthday party (which I know she had, as she posted tons of pictures on social media), and every subsequent party since then. I figured it was probably out of the group for good.

Meanwhile, my husband is good friends with both Sarah and Angela's husbands (Brian and Dave, respectively). He was pretty mad about the situation on my behalf, but I encouraged him not to let it come between his friendships, so the three of them continued to hang out every so often.

I didn't think anything of it until he came back from hanging out at Brian's last weekend. He told me Sarah kept asking him about me, and telling him how much she missed me. Then she asked him if he was coming to the party next weekend. 

I knew that he and Dave had made plans to hang out with some of the other guys in the group on that night, but neither he nor I realized it was a full-fledged party. He went back and looked at the Facebook invite, and, yes, it turns out that it's actually a party, Sarah and Angela are both going to be there, along with all of their awful new friends, and I am definitely not on the invite list. Needless to say, he decided he isn't going now that he knows this.

I honestly can't wrap my head around this. I don't know why Sarah made a point to tell him how much she misses me, while also making a point to not include me, *again*. I assume it's just a big stab in the back but it doesn't make sense why she'd bother when they've made it abundantly clear that they're done with me.

My husband also seems to be having a hard time coping with it. I feel bad that his friendships are being damaged over my stupid drama, especially since he's not very good at making new friends. He says he has a hard time understanding why Brian and Dave wouldn't have insisted on inviting both of us if they knew. Brian and Dave have always acted like they didn't have a problem with me since this crap started, and I was always under the impression that they didn't particularly like the new friends either. None of it really makes sense, it all feels extremely high school, and I'm not really sure how to proceed. Should I call them out on this or just keep ignoring it? Should my husband cut back on hanging out with their husbands?

**tl;dr:** My friends dumped me, byt my husband is still friends with their husbands. One of them told my husband how much she missed me, before they invited him to a party I wasn't invited to."

"My [20s] half-sibling [9] keeps trying to video call me and I don’t feel comfortable


Hi there, a bit of a weird one (not as weird as others I suppose) but I have no one to go to for advice. 

I have a half sibling. This was an illegitimate child that essentially broke up my family and caused a lot of heartache (not their fault but fault of the adults involved - I understand that). 

The parent we share has passed away. They passed suddenly years ago and this was a contributing factor. Recently my half sibling and I became friends on Facebook and they started messaging me. English is not their first language so the conversation is basic. 

Since we have started talking, they always want to call or video chat (something popular in their country) however I am not ready for this. I inherently hate talking on the phone and video chatting however that’s not the real issue. 

I return from working and there are multiple missed calls and messages asking if they can call. 

The circumstances surrounding their existence bring up a very traumatic time in my life that has taken literal years to be able to bounce back from (I still can’t function normally but can leave the house now). Due to their age and language barrier, I don’t feel comfortable discussing this with them. 

I want to be there for this sibling as much as my full siblings but it’s very hard to do this. I can’t discuss this with my living biological parent because it makes them beyond upset. 

Part of me wants to ask to speak to their parent and explain the situation but I don’t want to come off as cutting the sibling off. I also hold resentment toward their parent for the pain they caused to my family. 

I’m just not ready to have them in my life right now and I think partly it’s because they are still dependant on their parent who brought a lot of pain and suffering into our lives. 

What to do? How do I communicate this?

TL:DR - Half sibling has connected on social media. Half sibling was a result of infidelity that caused a lot of pain. I’m not ready to have them in my life. Don’t know how to explain this adult stuff to a child. 

Edit: Will go through responses properly but I wrote this quite late, tired and confused. I just want to clarify:

I DON’T NOR HAVE NEVER HATED THIS POOR CHILD. STOP COMING FOR ME ON THAT ANGLE!! Reading it back it looks like I worded it that way but I don’t hate this child or blame them for what has happened."

"I (23F) Started treating roommate (20F) like an actual roommate, am I being mean?"
"Ex (30sM) is upset that I (30sF) am filing for child support for kids


OK, backstory: we are 4 years out from our divorce. Our marriage was really bad. My ex constantly wants to get back together, I don't.  He swings between pledging eternal love to me/hating me for divorcing him. I try to just keep things civil because we have 2 kids and have to co-parent.

As for child support, he is supposed to pay me $700/a month according to our settlement. He usually pays me about $350/month, cash. I have brought up going through the courts so it is more formal, we both report it on our taxes, he gets it recorded, and it is automatically deducted from his check. He always gets mad about this because, obviously, he would rather pay under the table and pay a lesser amount. 

I have a heart condition and right now I'm getting evaluated to get put on the transplant list. I'm applying to get help because a heart transplant is *really* expensive. I am also trying to sell my house and rent a small apartment that is easier to maintain. Long story short, there are financial situations coming up where I will need documented proof of all my income. I get Social Security Disability but I want to finally file with the court system to get child support ""officially"". I also could use the money because sometimes I'm barely able to make ends meet. I told my ex that today and he was *pissed*.

I get his concern. He will being paying twice as much as he has been. I told him it's better for him too, because he will have proof that he pays. But he's really angry. I stress out about this. I want us to co-parent peacefully. My kids are teens and know what's up. What can I do or say to smooth this over and get him to understand I have to file?

**TL;DR:** I need to file for child support through the court system, my ex-husband is not cool with the idea."
"Chinese-American [25 F] worried my boyfriend [27 M] may have yellow fever - how can I tell?


I'm ethnically Chinese, but was born and raised in the U.S. Culturally I'm 100% American; I have not even been to China. I've been seeing my current (white) boyfriend for 4 months, and really like him a lot. He's never displayed any sign of having a fetish (no roleplay, no fake accents, no racist stereotypes). But recently I've started noticing a few things:

* He's more interested in China and Chinese culture than I am. He speaks Mandarin and studied abroad in China during college.
* He has had three serious past relationships, all with Chinese-American women. However, the last woman he dated was white.
* He says I should get more in touch with my Chinese heritage. Like I should visit China or Asia, or change my traditionally-American-sounding name to include the Chinese name my parents gave me.

Reddit, should I be worried? The main thing is how he seems to have mostly dated Chinese-American women, which seems weird. However, he is in a tech field with many more immigrants and non-white Americans than white Americans, so maybe that explains it. How can I tell if he has yellow fever?

tl;dr I (25 F) am an Asian girl dating a white guy (27 M) and am worried he has yellow fever. He is very drawn to Chinese culture but hasn't done anything obviously bad."
"I (26F) am tired of my sisters (both 27F) getting mad at me over the stupidest things all the time. Not sure what to do about how they act towards me


Hi there!

I’m 26 and my sisters are both 27, soon to be 28. They’re fraternal twins. 

I think some background might be helpful here:

Growing up we were pretty close, but then I moved 2.5 hours away to go to university. They attempted to go to uni but dropped out after two months or so. I’m in a professional career which took 6 years of schooling. 

My family has never been very close. Our father is an awful person and our mother is just... complacent. She tries to make everyone happy and often goes without so others can have more. My sisters and my mom are close. They see each other everyday.  I only go home a few times per year and not for very long. Since I moved to the city my family has never been up to visit me. I moved in 2009. 

My sisters are the type of people who will ask your opinion and then get angry with you if they don’t like your thoughts. I essentially have to side with them no matter what or they get angry with me. I admit I used to be like that I, but after attending uni and learning how to better communicate, I don’t do that anymore. My sisters used to delete me off Facebook all the time when they were angry but that hadn’t happened for a while. 

Recently, my sisters were arguing amongst themselves about something. Both of them called me to ask my opinion on that matter. I gave my honest opinion to one, she didn’t like it, got mad at me and hung up the phone on me. We haven’t talked since. That was about 2 weeks ago. I recently discovered that she deleted me off Facebook. I don’t know why she has to act so immature. At this point, I don’t think I should talk to her unless she apologizes for her actions. She was angry and said I shouldn’t have put in my ‘two cents’ (even though she specifically called to ask my opinion’. I just don’t understand. 

Once my parents pass away, my sisters are all I have. We have no other family really - no one close at all. Just each other. But with the way they act, how am I supposed to maintain a relationship if I’m constantly afraid to speak my mind? I just don’t know what to do or say anymore and I’m tired of the same cycle repeating. 

Any advice on how to handle this?

Tl;dr sisters get angry if they ask my opinion on something and I don’t agree with their own opinion. The latest event led to my sister deleting me from Facebook. "

"My twin sister and I [19 F/F] are frequently identified as ""the twins"" and are the butt of lewd or stupid ""jokes"" just for being twins. Is this a common thing for twins everywhere or is it just assholes around us?


We're identical twins and I guess that's a rare thing for most people, but it gets ridiculous sometimes.

When we moved to a different high school in 9th grade we were suddenly ""the twins"" and people frequently identified us as ""one of the twins"". There were also all sorts of weird jokes about us. Package deal, 2 for 1, take one on a date get the other one for free... like, stupid lewd stuff boys passed around on notes or text messages.

Once, a male cousin that looks nothing like us was walking holding our hands in school and a few boys gathered to say stuff ""What's you secret?"", ""Teach us you ways"", stuff like that.

Now that we're in different colleges it doesn't happen as often but when people see us together (people that KNOW one of us and know we have a twin) they almost invariably make a stupid joke. My sister told me she once stopped feeling attracted to a guy she was dating after he said something creepy about us (he never knew me).

I once invited her to a party with people from my class/dorm and less than 2 minutes after we got there some random dude said ""So, are you gonna dance together or what?"". By the way his friends laughed it was obvious that it was some sort of weird sexual joke.

Sometimes I just want to grab these people and punch them, you know? This is getting to the point of harassment, WTF? Sometimes I kind of dread the moment of introducing my sister to someone. Why must we be told these things, what's so funny about this? The fact that my BF has never in 4 months cracked a stupid low hanging fruit joke about us is something that makes me respect him and feel respected. Is that weird?

Like, I enjoy a harmless joke among friends or family, but when it's random people or people who barely know us, I want to hit them with a golf club. Is this normal for twins, to be constantly reminded of it in unfunny or downright creepy ways, or were we blessed with being surrounded by assholes? I guess it's useless but, ny way to minimize these cases?

**tl;dr:** Identical twin and I have been the butt of unfunny or creepy/lewd joke for years. Is this a common thing for twins or just bad luck in being surrounded by assholes?"
"My (34f) boyfriend (35m) says he will kill me or destroy my future if I leave.


I live with my bf, and over the past 2 years he is becoming increasingly physically abusive.  Not often (about every 2 months approximately) but I'm beginning to actually get hurt (whereas in the beginning it was only pushes.  Now he's hit me a few times (open hand) in the side of the head.  He has twisted my arm and left bruises. He pushed me hard enough that I fell down and twisted my ankle.



=======================================


Each time he tries to convince me it's my fault and that I MAKE him hurt me.  It's crazy and I can't even believe the crap he spouts.  He was never abusive or acted this crazy before I moved in.


==========================================


I'm financially dependent on him now because I work for his business. He has told me if I leave he will either (a) kill me, or (b) wreck my life (make it so I never find work, call children's aid on me for who knows what, spread rumours about me, etc etc etc).  I know he's been very cruel and revengeful with his ex wife in the past, so I don't doubt it.


=======================================



I don't know what to do.  He's very well off and I am absolutely not. He is legally very savvy as well.  He's charismatic and everyone loves him.  He has a huge following from his website.  I'm just this quiet, introverted woman with no siblings, few friends.  Nobody even really knows about me even though we've lived together for 2 years.  I'm scared because I know he'll be furious if I leave (he fully believes it's my fault he has to keep hitting me) and I don't know what he'll do to me.  Right now I don't even have money or a job so I can't leave.  Threatening to go to the cops or get a restraining order doesn't phase him at all.  In fact, last time he hurt me and I cried saying he could go to jail he handed me the phone. I didn't call.

"Me [34M], my girlfriend [33F] and the sad realization that were not really a couple anymore


Tl;Dr : Sexless, no intimacy, no affection. i think she doesn't love me anymore.


For a long time, I used to wonder if all couples were like this. I used to believe that it was temporary. That it was just a phase. After all, we've been together for 10 years. We have 2 kids. Two little healthy energic monsters. I love them. But I came to the conclusion way before having kids that we are not a couple anymore. 


Like every new couple, the beginnings were pretty awesome. We had fun, we did stuff together, plenty of activities, we had sex often. It was great. After that came out first apartment. It was fun. She was fun to live with. 

Years passed. Sex was less present. Arguments became more frequent. We moved in biggers apartments. She started sitting in front of her computer more often. Talking to her family and friends on MSN messenger. No big deal. The apartment was messy because she kept alot of crap. She started complaining about almost everything: her family, her job. But it wasn't too bad.

Then a few years later, Facebook and smartphones came into the picture. The time spent on her laptop or phone was quite important, especially on Facebook. But we still talked to each other. Sex was once a month maybe. Arguments were still frequent. She started complaining alot about everything. 

Years passed and we bought our first house. We had our daughter. Sold the house and bought another one. Had our son. 

Now. This is how it looks at the moment. She's sleeping/watching TV in the living room. It's 11pm, I'm in bed ready to sleep (oh and I'm writing this!). I know for a fact she will spend the night on the couch. She's been doing that for a few months already. I get up to the bathroom and I go ask her if she'll come to bed with me. Her answer: ""shhhhhh!"" Or ""leave me alone"". That's what it looks like now.

Let's talk about the kissing and hugging. Nope. I can't remember the last time she hugged or kissed me. When I come home from work, just before picking up the kids at daycare, she's usually watching tv or on facebook. She won't even get up or hug/kiss me. When I try to kiss her, she often say ""what do you want"" and reject it. She never hugs me. When i hug her, she'll break it after a second or two, saying ""are you happy u got it now move"".

She says If you shaved your beard more often I would kiss you. Did it multiple times, nope won't work. 

Sex... Wait, what? I don't even remember the last time we had sex. Been to long. When I tell her that its been a while, she says ""if you're not happy call a prostitute"".

Is this normal behavior? I don't think so. The house is a mess. Every time I clean it up, her mess come back. She always let the drawers and cabinet doors open. She has no patience with the kids. She complains about everything, her job, her coworkers, her family, my family, our kids, me, our neighbors. She thrives on arguments. This is driving me crazy. My daughter often asks me if mommy loves daddy.
When I tell her maybe she has some kind of depression or another disorder she gets angry and says that she doesn't. 


But even before having kids, I felt like a roomate. Things are getting worse every day. When I ask her what's the problem, she says You are my problem.

I often hear her saying ""if it doesnt please you just leave me them""

A typical day:
I go to work. She wakes up at 8 and drop the kids to daycare. I call her or she calls me at noon. She usually complains about something. I go on with my day. Pickup the kids at daycare. At home, she's on the couch, watching TV or she's on her laptop or phone. Sometimes there's no dinner for us. I gotta xook something. She never wants to eat what i cook so she skip the meal. I give the bath to the kids. I put them to bed. She watches TV. I talk to her, i get a ""shut up I'm watching TV"" then i tell her I'm going to bed ""good for you""

I am exhausted. Seeing her on the couch on her phone or computer and hearing her complaining and getting into arguments all the time is seriously NOT fun. I come back from work happy but I go to bed angry most nights...

Shortly after my son's birth my husband and I discovered that I was expecting. We were shocked and terrified about having two kids under a year old but we were excited. I unfortunately miscarried last year.

She is interested in our profile and we plan to speak to her this week. She's not due until May and it's still early in the process but I shared this with my mom because I was overjoyed.

My mom sounded happy on the phone but later texted me saying, ""I am happy for you and (husband) but I am very sad that you miscarried. This baby will never replace my only blood grandbaby."" I didn't say anything back to her.
My husband works for a professional sports team and has to travel a lot so she comes to help out when she can. It started after I found out I was pregnant and then she continued to help out after my miscarriage. I love her help but she has been making some side comments that made me think she has never gotten over my infertility. I was putting together my son's newborn photos to show the potential birth mother of our second son and she kept saying things like ""Can you imagine how your own baby would have looked if you didn't miscarry"" and ""I bet you would have had a girl. I could have had a graddaughter"" and ""If you didn't miscarry you wouldn't even be adopting this new baby since you would already have two kids."" I explained that my son was my own child and she said that she didn't mean it like that. She just wanted to see me have a baby the traditional way and is upset that she will never get that opportunity since we only plan on having 2 kids.

I don't know how to deal with this. My mom is a great grandmother to my son and I know she would love another grandbaby regardless of his origins but I don't want either of them to ever feel like they are less than a biological grandbaby would be.

**TL;DR: My mother is upset about a potential second adoption because this means she won't ever have biological grandchildren. How do I deal with this?**"
"My (26F) boyfriend (28M) is constantly upset about our messy home but doesn't realize he makes the mess.


My (26F) boyfriend (28M) of 4 years, is constantly upset about our home being messy, but doesn't realize he makes the majority of the mess. 

He works out of town on a set shift so he's only home periodically. Last time he was set to go on shift, he left me home with a big mess he'd made - both sinks full of dishes, pans on the stove, soda cans not thrown in the recycling, laundry all over our bedroom. I cleaned it all because for one I don't want to live in a messy house, and for another he gets really quiet and angry if he comes home and the house isn't in top shape. He came home last Wednesday, and I had cleaned the entire house. 

Wednesday night I took a very nasty fall outside that landed me in the ER with severe back pain. I have been stiff and sore ever since, but getting better. 

On Saturday, he wanted to have some friends over for dinner. I do love to cook so even though I was feeling terrible, I agreed and cooked steaks, sides, and creme brulee for the guests. My boyfriend cleared the table and threw everything in the sink. 

I have been on and off with back pain ever since (and I work from home) so I've basically been commuting from my bedroom to my office across the hall all week. I haven't eaten much and mostly just dart downstairs to grab a juice out of the fridge or make a quick deli meat sandwich. It hadn't really registered that the kitchen was still a disaster. 

I'm finally feeling better today so I told him I would make a nice steak dinner for us. He was excited and said he was heading out to the garage for a bit but to call him in when it was ready. I showered and got dressed and went downstairs, to find that my kitchen looks like a bomb went off. He made eggs this morning and even just threw the eggshells in a dirty pan on the stove. 

He's right, I can be messy, but what aggravates me about this situation is that he constantly is upset with me for ""not picking up after myself"" and always informs all of our friends and family that he ""does all the cleaning here"", which couldn't be further from the truth. He does his fair share, but he makes a lot of the mess too.

I told him I wasn't going to cook dinner tonight and he's upset with me because I ""should have let him know earlier I wanted him to clean the kitchen."" 

What can I do to make him see that he contributes as much if not more to the state of our messy house as I do? 

TL;DR: boyfriend blames me for our house being messy without seeing how much I really clean or how much of the mess is really his; now blames me for not telling him to clean.

"I 28 F issued severely overweight husband 27M an ultimatum


My husband of 3 years weighed almost 350 pounds about 2 months ago. I knew he was very overweight, but didn't realize how serious it was getting until I saw a form from his recent physical lying on the counter.

Throughout our marriage of three years and relationship totaling 8 years, I have done my best to accept him as he is. He has always been overweight and it didn't seem like a huge deal for me until recently.

As he has gained weight, it has become harder for him to do things and he has grown more depressed and lazy in all areas of his life. I don't think that I can deal with this not changing or getting worse for the rest of our lives. I don't want to take care of him and suffer through his weight issues forever, so I told him if his weight got worse or he didn't get healthy I didn't think I could stay married. We don't have kids, so at least that is not a factor right now.

He says that this ultimatum does the opposite of motivating him, but he has started going to the gym more, eating healthier and losing weight. He recently lost his job, but instead of getting upset, I told him that this was an opportunity for him to focus soley on his weight loss.

The problem is that he is addicted to food and has been his whole life. Overeating is how he deals with tough feelings. When I see him overeating and not exercising, I end up telling him that he is not making good choices. He immediately becomes hypersensitive and depressed and we have a fight.

**TL;DR** How do I help keep my severely overweight husband on a healthy path? How do I motivate him when he is making unhealthy choices that affect my life and our marriage, but that I don't have any control over? If an ultimatum is wrong, how do I continue to respect myself while standing up for my needs in this marriage?"
"My wife [29 F] accuses me [32 M] of not pulling my weight after our son was recently born, but I feel as though SHE'S the one who isn't doing enough. Can't talk about this with her (without a fight) and nearing end of my rope.

"My (M, 17) parents M/F, 40s) are threatening to cut me out of their lives if I don’t go to the college they want me to


Hello everyone. I’m currently a senior in high school. I have been accepted to an average college that I am not interested in about 30-45 minuets from where I live now, which is the college my parents want me to go to. I also applied to a top college and my top choice school, 3 states away without telling them and got accepted! Now here’s the problem. I told my parents after I got accepted that I did in fact, get accepted and wanted to attend. I told them and they got absolutely furious at me, I’ve never seen them that angry. They told me if I decide to go to the out of state school, they would completely cut me off, they won’t pay for any expenses whatsoever, and they said I wouldn’t be welcomed back.

Now, my parents have a very weird parenting style. They don’t do much for me or never seem to put in interest. Academic awards? In the trash. Sports? Never showed up. I am graduating a year early, because I have been taking extra classes online each summer, plus getting A’s in AP classes. My parents had no clue and when I told them they were skeptical and didn’t believe me and I had to get my counselor to call them both in and confirm it. Despite not caring about me whatsoever, they also want to dictate every decision of my life example: this whole college thing.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I was so excited to go to college and learn more, but now this seems like a lose lose situation for me and it’s killing my motivation. If anyone has advise that would be great and I’d be glad to have any. :) thank you 

Tldr I got accepted to my top college choice, but my parents will cut me out of their lives if I end up going there instead of the local college by me "
"Should I [22m] tell my grandma [82f] she has a sister?

"I [28M] have been dating my SO [26F] for 3 months. She is the sweetest thing on Earth. We love each other to death. BUT my dad is vehemently against us being together, because her dad is mentally challenged. I'm at a complete loss of what to do.


**TL;DR**: *My dad hates my girlfriend before he's even met her, because her dad is mentally challenged.*

This girl (let's call her Amy) and I have been together for a relatively short time. But in these 3 short months, we've spent nearly every other day with each other, talking on the phone every day that we don't see each other. We've discussed nearly every topic under the sun (past, future, marriage, kids, careers, family, hopes, fears). We bond and mesh on so many different levels (music, style, parenting, scientific-minded, random stuff). Amy cooks for me and takes care of me in many small ways. I've met her family (cousins, godparents), and she's met my family (mom, aunts, cousins). My mom absolutely loves her. Amy is the best thing that has happened to me ever.

But there's one big hiccup. My dad disapproves of us being together. He hasn't met Amy yet, but he already legitimately hates her guts. ***Why***, you ask? Because Amy's dad is mentally challenged (genetic?). Amy on the other hand, is ridiculously smart. She did well academically, is very successful in her career, and is possibly mentally sharper than I am.

I thought I was being a good son by being honest with my dad, and letting him know beforehand of my GF's dad. Big oops. I hadn't expected my dad to react like that, and my dad now believes that Amy is going to cause me a life full of risk and stress if we ever get married (having to take care of her dad, her possibly having a higher genetic chance of displaying the same symptoms, or passing the genes onto our children).

My dad is skipping over all of Amy's amazing qualities even before meeting her, and automatically antagonizing Amy due to no fault of her own (no one can choose who their father/mother is). I'm now afraid of letting my dad meet Amy because he might say something to heavily offend her, and ultimately drive her away from me. I love Amy completely. There is no one who has made me as happy as Amy does, and the last thing I want is to lose her.

My dad even went as far as repeatedly insulting my mom for supporting our relationship. I haven't talked to my dad in weeks, and I'm questioning if he ever had my best interests at heart.

I understand that this situation is partly my fault (for pouring this information on my dad so early). I'm just at a complete loss of how to proceed now. Thanks to anyone who can give me feedback."
