"American woman who lived in Saudi for a year. AMA


So I met and fell in love with my husband who is from Saudi while in college. We got married and started a family in the states but briefly moved to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for a year in 2013.  I didn’t live in a compound, but in an apartment in the city.  AMA"
"I’m a closet atheist born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I’ve been faking out Islamic practices for 5 years in fear of being exposed. AMA!


I was born to a fully Muslim family in 1994. After travelling to Southeast Asia for studying abroad, I started having second thoughts about Islam. I spent 3 years reading, watching documentaries, analysing debates about Darwin’s theory of Evolution (which was a new concept to me as I’ve never come across it in school or elsewhere) from the likes of Carl Segan, Richard Dawkins, Neil DeGrass Tyson, Penn Jillette, James Randi, Bill Nye etc.

I often travel back to Saudi Arabia during my semester breaks, one time my mother suspected that I may be skipping my daily prayers and immediately had a talk with me the following day. They threatened to stop paying for my tuition and force me to come home if I don’t “fix myself” soon. I convinced them that my lack of prayers was due to laziness only and that I still am fully a believer.
My girlfriend recently broke up with me after revealing the fact to her, she was crying for several weeks until she decided we pretty much have no future (since her family will never accept a non-Muslim). Aside from her and Reddit, nobody else knows and I’ve decided to carry out all of the daily/monthly practices to avoid suspicion. AMA!"

"I grew up with Deaf parents and I am Hearing. AMA.


I am what's known as a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults). Both my parents are profoundly Deaf (you can scream in their ears, they won't hear anything) and BSL was my first language.

EDIT: I thought people might enjoy this too, it's me age 4 in an RNID book called Sign and Say, demonstrating BSL signs. : https://www.flickr.com/photos/missfrantical/albums/72157632971529239



Here are a few answers to the most common questions:

1. I signed before I could speak (started at 7 months). I did not have any speech delay as my parents made sure I was exposed to English a lot. My grandparents are all hearing and I saw a lot of them, and I went to nursery at 18 months. Some CODAs do have speech delays but it's not that common.

2. No, I am not an interpreter and I do not want to be one. It takes many years to qualify as a SL interpreter and while I am fluent in BSL, I am a lazy signer with bad habits and would not make a good professional interpreter. And it's hard work and the hours are rubbish.

3. I never really did sneak out without my parents knowing, despite being able to. When you're a CODA, your parents have to have quite a lot of trust in you and you tend to be fairly responsible IME. I understood that it was unfair to take advantage in a way that would be frightening for them because they'd be unable to contact me (I was a teenager in the 90s, before mobile phones and texting). I did however play my music loud and have very loud sleepovers. And I would just turn my back if I didn't want to talk to them, or hide my mouth behind my hand if I wanted to talk to someone else without them seeing.

4. I was making phone calls and interpreting for my parents by age 4. It did feel like an imposition sometimes, but the balance is that I grew up being able to take care of shit. I am good at sorting things out, making sure people understand situations, and generally adulting. I am also not shy at ALL. When you grow up with people staring at you for signing, you just learn to deal with it. 

5. For me, the deafness is not hereditary. My mum had meningitis when she was 2, and my dad they just don't know. There's no other deafness in the family.

6. My house was not quiet. It was in fact very loud. Deaf people don't know how much noise they're making, so there was forever a clattering of pans, doors banging, loud farting, stomping, shouting when they had friends over, and well, the less said about mealtimes the better.

7. Sign languages are not universal. I cannot understand ASL.


I know there are quite a few other CODAs on here so if they'd like to join in answering questions, or have different experiences than mine, that would be welcome.
