"""You must be her boss""


A long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I was a young soldier. I loved the army. I wanted to make it my career. I did it for a long time. 

I got injured. I couldn't do the job I was trained on anymore. So I got out and looked for other jobs. 

I do medical screening now. I'm older than everyone but two people in the entire building. 

On to the story. 

My immediate supervisor is 24. She's fairly young. 

A person didn't like her vitals and insisted that my boss did them wrong. There was absolutely no way her blood pressure was that high. You don't know what you're doing. 

That kind of horse shit. 

I came back from a break and this woman points at me and goes ""I want your boss doing it. Him! You! Show her how to do this"".

I said, ""Lady, she's my boss""

She goes ""I don't have time for this. Read my vitals and deal with her after"".  

My boss kind of smiled and I took her seat. I ran vitals again, and got the same result. I said ""Well, I got the same result. Unfortunately, I need a supervisor to sign off on a correction(Sort of true, but not really). Let me get my boss"". 

I stood up, and turned to her and said, ""Hey, when you get a chance, can you confirm these corrections?""

She said ""Yeah, I'm going to take a 10 minute break, but as soon as I get back, I'll knock that out.""

""Sorry, Ma'am. I can't overrule my boss. "
"""You have an employee here that SMOKES and TEXTS.""


I work at a pet store, primarily responsible for maintaining/caring for our fish selection, birds, reptiles, small animals, and the like. Sometimes I sell them to folks who actually have a clue about owning an animal. This happened yesterday.

I'm on a long 9-hour shift and having a smoke break outside of the shop. There's a long sidewalk, and I always smoke far away from the doors as we're a heavy traffic location and kids/animals are always coming in and out. I finish up and head back inside, where I'm immediately flagged by a family looking for a cat scratcher. The particular one they want is missing its tag and I can't find its location in its aisle, so I take out my phone and hang with the family, showing them our online prices, which we'll honor for them. They get the scratcher, hours go by, and at closing a cashier buddy comes up to me and tells me about this woman who was raving to her a while ago.

Cashier friend: She was going on and on about how 'there's an employee that smokes--SHE WORKS IN A PET STORE--and TEXTS! She should be spoken to or fired!' I just sort of shrugged.

Me: So, she meant me. Nice.

Manager friend is now walking by.

Me: Hey, (manager), I need to be fired. I was smoking directly into the animal habitats while snapchatting their purple faces as they shrieked and suffocated. Expect the corporate complaint any second now.

Manager friend: Oh damn. Yeah, you're screwed.

And then I went home, twirling my mustache, the most evil pet department worker ever. "
