"What do you wish you had discussed with your SO before you dated them or married them?


I'm getting married soon and I want to know what other women wish they had known about an ex or spouse before they got into a relationship. 

I'm planning a grill fest for the future husband. 

In depth answers appreciated. 

Edit: Heteronormative

Edit: the grilling part was a joke y'all."
