I don't know if it's because I'm about to be on my period or if it is because my friends are really getting to me. I just want to yell and scream at one of my friends because for the past few weeks I feel like I've been giving and giving to her and instead of being grateful or gracious she uses it to boost her ego. I'm at the point where I feel like I'm about to explode and spit bile all over her but I'm just locking myself in my room so I don't let it out. I feel like I'm crazy for having these feelings. How do you guys cope with having feelings like that?"
