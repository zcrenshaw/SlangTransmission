"Ladies who can French braid, Dutch braid, or cornrow their own hair — how long did it take you to learn to do it? What are your top tips for a beginner?


In 2017, I learned how to blowout my own hair with a round brush. I also started to cut my own hair, and will never look back! 

In 2018, I want to learn how to French braid, Dutch braid, and cornrow my own hair — but I expect the learning curve to be fairly steep given my general lack of coordination. 

I would love the context of other people’s timelines for encouragement! 

I’m planning to use YouTube as my primary resource. 

Thank you in advance for sharing, as well as for your tips and tricks :)"
