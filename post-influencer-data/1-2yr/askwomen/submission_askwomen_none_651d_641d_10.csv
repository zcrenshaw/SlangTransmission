"Have you encountered the ""softboy""?


Inspired by [this article](https://byrslf.co/have-you-encountered-the-softboy-7e95e2c7f3e7). For a quick summary, the author basically describes an emotional, artistic type who uses this soft facade to cover up for rude behavior. He uses art, music, deep conversation, etc. to get you to sleep with him and pretends to care about your feelings but makes it clear through his actions that he doesn't: ""He is emotionally intelligent but does nothing with this knowledge. He is artistic. He is aware. He is still a dick.""
