"Women of Reddit: What is the porn video you always come back to?


Inspired by AskMen thread. :)"
"Ladies, this might be a bit too controversial, but what do you think the difference between body positivity and normalizing obesity is?


I'm not trying to offend anyone! I just want to know people's thoughts on it. I love encouraging body positivity, everyone deserves to love themselves and their body! But I feel like the lines between body positivity and making obesity something that isn't seen as unhealthy is kind of getting blurred. Thoughts? Shouldn't need to be said, but please no one be demeaning or aggressive!

Edit: thank you for keeping this thread on track, mods!"
"Introverted mothers of reddit -- How do you deal with constant need of attention from your child?

"Why is the idea that a woman can easily find a boyfriend/significant other/partner so prevalent on Reddit?


Why does reddit seem to think that women rarely get rejected (I've seen nice women that look conventionally attractive get turned down or ignored too)? And how do you feel when you see this idea get pushed around? Is it easy as reddit makes it seem?

More in comments (original post removed for formatting)."

"What's the nicest thing your (current or ex) SO has said to/done for you?


The other rude thread really made me sad. I can't believe some people can be so unbelievably cruel.

Let's turn the tables a bit and get in some 'aww' moments to ease our souls."
