"Women who grew up in lower income homes, what hardships will middle class women never understand?


Filled out a survey recently, and it said I was in a middle class bubble. My first response was to say, ""wait, I know about some financial struggles, and I'm well aware of the lower income life of my country...!""

Then I thought,... maybe I don't, maybe I should ask other women about their experiences. "
"Married women who didn't meet your spouse until ""later"" in life, what was your experience like?


How, if at all, was your experience different than the dating/wedding/marriage experiences of friends/family who had met the ""right"" person earlier and gotten married younger? What were the pros and cons you noticed of being single in your 30s/40s and older? The pros and cons of getting married later? How'd you meet your spouse-- what was dating like as you got older, had you still been wanting/expecting to get married or was it something surprising that happened, etc? "

A concept I know exists but can’t explain. 

Edit: I read a comment on this sub a few days ago. Someone described having a very close and supportive friendship with a man. Once they decided to date she started to become callous;  overall, someone she didn’t recognize. His “worst” was also brought out. That is where my question is stemming from! "
