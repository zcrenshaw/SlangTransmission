*This got a lot more traction than I expected, so I would like to explain what I meant by breathe.
It was funny seeing people talk about lungs and such in your vaginas,  snorkels, and vaginal breathing. I laughed. But I meant the sweat that gathers like during the summer. "

"Have you ever had your hair cut against your will?


There was a R/ Relationships post some time ago where a lady described among other of her childhood abuses how her mother once cut her hair against her will. ""When I was 14 she thought I was getting too much attention from boys and felt it was unfair to my sister, so she cut my hair really short and threw away all of my makeup and beauty products."" Has anything like this happened to any of you or do you have any anecdotes of this happening someone you know? Is this a common form of abuse? I had never heard of anything like this before, or even about any mother trying to make their daughter less pretty on purpose. As a guy I cannot really relate much, so how traumatic would this be if it happened to you?"
"What are your real life ""Cat Person"" stories?


For those of you who have read ""Cat Person"" in The New Yorker this week — the short story about a college-aged student who has a short, disappointing series of encounters with an older guy that sheds all this light on the burden women take on of other people's emotions — what's your real life ""Cat Person"" story? (It is both validating and alarming to me just how many other women read this and related so hard!!) "
