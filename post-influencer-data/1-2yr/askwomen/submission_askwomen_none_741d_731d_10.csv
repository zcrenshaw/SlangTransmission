"What post or response stuck with you in AskWomen? [NSFW]


There was a response to a thread a while back about the unsexiest thing a sex partner has said during intercourse.

So yeah 52 episodes a season. So what kind of show would you create?

Also please keep this at least somewhat ""realistic"" because I don't want to derail it like the r/askmen thread."
