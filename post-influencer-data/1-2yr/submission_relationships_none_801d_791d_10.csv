"Me [44F] with my wife [42F] duration, with our son [17F]. Is it a valid reason to leave her over her treatment of our gay son?


[removed]"
"[Update] My family disowned me [26m] and now they want to reconnect


Sorry this is so long. Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hc92o/my_26_m_family_disowned_me_now_want_to_reconnect/

I talked it over with my adoptive mother and my partner and I decided to see what my sister had to say. As a few people here suggested, I made a new email address and told her to only contact me there. I also told her I would only respond to her, that I wasn't ready to speak to my mother yet. I asked her why she was contacting me now, why she didn't stick up for me then, and what what she wanted from me. 

She told me that when everything was happening my father had forbidden any of my siblings from talking to anyone about it or attending the trial. Everyone knew I was in therapy for being gay, but he told them that my ""legal troubles"" were because I had run away from therapy and I was selling myself and doing drugs and I refused to come home. None of that is true. I did have a drug problem later, but that's not what the trial was about and I never sold myself or ran away. I had to go to the hospital because I got hurt and the doctors there called the police. I also desperately wanted to come home but they didn't want me back. 

Earlier this year my sister was playing a game with her son that she used to play with me when I was little and she realized there was nothing her son could do to make her stop loving him. She started asking my mother why they didn't find me and make me come home, get off drugs, etc. and my mother finally broke down and told her the truth. My sister immediately started looking for me but it took a while to track me down because I changed my name. 

She says she doesn't want anything from me and I believe her. She said she's sorry for what happened to me and that she would have stepped in if she knew. We've been emailing back and forth a million times a day and we've Skyped. She still seems pretty conservative but she told me that she ""watches and enjoys Ellen"" and that my husband and I look sweet together in the photos she saw online. She still lives near the rest of my family, but she might come out here to visit. She wants to meet my partner and she sent a very nice e-card to my new mother to thank her for taking care of me. I'm really happy to have her back in my life. 

I'm not sure what to think about my mother. My sister maintains that she really wants to see me and that she's so sorry and that my father made her do it, but she's still with him. And I'm even more hurt now that I know they lied about me. I put up with literal torture for them, and they threw me away and then told my family I was garbage so they would stop loving me too. She kept up the lie for ten years, and who knows how long she would have kept going if my sister hadn't been so persistent. 
 
Anyways, thanks for all the advice I got here, especially from those of you who tried to be understanding about my mixed feelings towards my family.

"I [24 M] have to take my father [57] off of life support today.


I posted an earlier story about the events leading to this if you are curious.

My father has been on life support since he collapsed at 12am on 7/5/17. His heart had stopped for 8-10 minutes before he was treated. The hospital did a lot of tests to determine brain death, and yesterday they told us the bad news, that he was certainly already gone and the time of death was called. 

My family and I decided, knowing my father's wonderful giving spirit, should be an organ donor. Honestly my dad would be surprised and thrilled to know some of his organs are viable. So last night we signed the documents which prepare him for the donation process. 

Today, most likely they will take him off life support to try and recover the organs they can. I understand that he is already gone and he is basically now an empty shell/cadaver which they are preserving with advanced technology. But still, I feel it may be very difficult for me today to actually say goodbye and see him with his heart beating for the last time. Now I'm trying to figure out how to cope with this.

**tl;dr:** I'm trying to figure out the best way to cope with the finality of taking my father off of life support.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your kindness, I shared this post with my family and they are floored by how much advice and sympathy we've gotten. 

I felt the urge to show you all this picture of me, my dad and my brother. It is my favorite picture of us three and I will cherish it forever. http://imgur.com/a/hb6gS"

"My[15 F] mom [36 F] is like a different person when dad[39 M] is deployed?


My dad left for his deployment a few weeks ago, and when dad is here she's really happy, she does crafts and always makes us all a really big supper. And like, she cleans 24/7 and does her makeup before dad get a home unless she's working a nurse shift which she only does like twice a week now.

She also makes a big breakfast early in the morning before dad leaves for work but when he's gone we just eat cereal or toast instead

After dad leaves though, she goes into her bedroom randomly a lot and my brother [9 M] and me can hear her sobbing often. :(

Or like, she keeps the house clean but just the minimal effort. She'll stop doing her hair, and with supper she often just asks us what we want to eat then makes only enough for us and goes back to her room. She gets skinnier I think too.

Its really sad and often the last month before dad comes home do we notice she's starts to go back to her usual self, and like she doesn't ever yell at us or swear but she doesn't seem as interested in doing crafts or playing sports and she often tries to convince us to go camping or to grandma's with her instead of being at home and it's just so different and I feels sad for her.

It's like when dad is home she actually wants to live, and when he's gone she just tries to barely survive and she's not abusive or mean but we like a happy mom more than a depressed one and we miss dad too.

What do I do to make my mom happy again when dad is gone? 

***Tldr: My mom I think is depressed whenever our dad leaves for 6 to 9 month deployments. She's not abusive or mean but her ""sparkle"" definitely goes away and comes back when he's home.***"

[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6l2mac/my_30f_boyfriend_30m_2_years_keeps_pushing_me_to/)

There were a lot of details my original post was missing. I guess I never realized how bad our relationship was until I spoke with a friend about this particular issue.

We were never able to talk about problems. We'd have an argument and he'd bring up all the issues he has, but would be unwilling to talk about them outside of an argument. He would ask me back handed questions and get mad if I didn't answer how he wanted, then tell me I was being sketchy. My actions were questioned to the point of me not wanted to tell him what I was doing.

This was all in between me explaining how I felt I was shouldering all the responsibility on top of full time school and part time work. And him turning the blame around on me. And his unemployment.

Plus my step dad didn't like him. And he had a good read on people.

Once I realized all this, I was upset I'd let it get that far. But I was (still am?) in love with him. He accepted me fully and completely and he was supportive if I texted him about how frustrated I was. But he was never there to help me negate my stress -- he'd just get mad. So.

I broke up with my ex last night. It's a huge relief but we were such a big part of each other's lives, I know it will be hard to get over him. I will in time though.

TL;DR: realized how bad my relationship with boyfriend was. Broke up with him. Know I did the right thing. Now it's gym/lawyer/???? Time. Or however it goes. "

"My [30 M] wife [29 F] has befriended a young neighbourhood girl [17 F]. It's causing issues in our marriage.


a few months ago my wife befriended a young girl that lives a few doors down from us. she has had a bad home life for a while and doesn't like to spend her time in her own house. Over time my wife invited her own to spend time in our house when she wants to, even going so far as to give her a key to our place and her own security system pass code. 

I'm fine with all of that, the girl is nice, and doesn't cause any issues, it took a little getting used to, but I didn't mind the situation. We can't have kids and we've discussed adopting or fostering in the past so I kind of just thought of it like that. She usually chats with my wife, or watches tv, and doesn't get in the way at all. 

When my wife isn't home and I am we play some Xbox games together, and we've even had some deep conversations. She spends 3 or 4 evenings a week at our place, does her homework here a lot, has dinner with us sometimes, so she's become a relatively common fixture around the house for the last few months. 

The past few weeks however I've noticed she's started to get  a little more flirty when it's just myself and her and my wife is out or at work. Nothing major, but she touches my arm when we talk, and sits closer to me on the couch, laughs at my terrible jokes. All small things, but I'm a 30 year old man, I've been around for awhile and can recognise flirting by now. 

She only does it when my wife isn't around. It's making me a little uncomfortable because while she is of legal age (it's 16 in my country) I want nothing to do with it. It's making me feel uncomfortable in my own home. I've tried to not respond to her when she does flirt, and I've told her a few times that's not really appropriate, but she just gets all fake wounded and pouts for a few minutes then does it again. 

I brought it up with my wife and she laughed and said it was just in my head and I'm probably just reading into the girl becoming more comfortable around us.  I don't think that's it though. 

Any advice on my next steps?

"My (24/F) BF (28/M) constantly baby talks.. I'm embarrassed!


As the title states.. my partner of 2 years constantly baby talks! At first, it was cute but not anymore. It's embarrassing!

I recently started working in the city so we commute to and from work together  during peak times. Every morning on the train, he'd repeatedly tell me he ""needs to poo"" in a kiddy voice. He's done this every fucking day since I started the job.

Recently, we were on the train home and he kept doing the 'kissy' sounds to get me to kiss him. And of course, this guy standing next to me kept glancing at us weirdly the whole time. One time, a lady hit me with her huge bag so he kept pretending to spit in her bag and another lady saw it and was giggling.

I don't know how to tell him to stop this behaviour because it's gotten out of hand. I'm sick of starting my mornings hearing about how badly he needs to take a ""poop"" x100. When I tell him that I was tired of hearing it, he starts pouting and saying I don't love him.

I'm at my wits end. How can I tell him to stop without hurting his feelings?

"My BF (24M) of over 2 years says it makes him uncomfortable when I (24F) discuss our future.


My boyfriend and I just had a massive argument. We have been together more than two years, lived together most of that time, have a dog and multiple businesses together. I was of the expectation that I could talk lightly of the future - such as when we were watching a program with spoilt children I jokingly said ""Oh god I hope our kids don't turn out like that lol"".

However today he said something like ""my children"" and then he corrected himself and said ""Oh wait I mean our children. Lol but not really - we're no where near that stage!"". I was a little taken aback. I know we are not at a stage to actually have children but I thought it was acceptable to fleetingly talk about the future?

We talk about where the businesses are going to end up in 5, 6, 7 years so why can't we discuss us? He claims that I could turn out to be a bitch in 2 years and we break up, or I could get knocked down and die etc. Well yeah - anything could happen, but that shouldn't stop you from lightly discussing what you would *like* to see happening. 

I am in no way planning kids now - I have however voiced that it's important to me to have my first child before 30. I feel it's incredibly important to discuss your long term life plans with someone you're in a relationship with so that you don't end up spending 10 years with someone who actually wants different things. In my own words I said ""I would rather know now if you, for example, wanted to wait until you're 35 to have kids, because I probably couldn't stay in the relationship. It would be wasteful to spend years in a relationship that would end anyway if we had different goals so it's better to find out if we are on the same wavelength now"". He took this to mean that the relationship is ""worthless unless you get a baby out of it"". Which just isn't true. My life long goal IS to have a family and I can understand that someone might not comprehend this, but all I wanted was to make it clear that there really isn't a point to a long term relationship in my opinion if you are going to go separate ways 10 years down the line due to separate goals. 

He said that most guys would run away from me. That I'm neurotic and still a ""girl"" and much too young to be thinking about these things. Guys, I'm almost mid 20s. Of course it's young but I'm not a fucking child. I started crying and he said I was so selfish and manipulative crying to end the conversation. I was looking at my hands as I was so upset and FELT like a kid, and he said I didn't even have the decency to look him in the eye as he was speaking. I'm just so sad.

Am I completely insane to speak of the future the odd time? He says it makes him uncomfortable but it's going to really be hard for me to never discuss my future with the person who I WANT to spend my life with. How do I voice my opinions to him when he seems to think I'm neurotic and weird?

"My girlfriend [19F] was unwillingly spanked by a male coworker. Upon hearing about this, I [21M] uninvited him from a party I am having. Am I overreacting?


To sum it up, my girlfriend is really friendly with her coworkers to the point that some percieve her as flirtacious. One coworker in particular has a crush on her and makes it very obvious that he is tempted to ""oggle"" her and other things. Despite this, they are strictly friends.

Anyway, I am throwing a July 4th party at an apartment that I rent with my girlfriend. This coworker asked if he could come and she said he could. However, I learned today that he recently spanked my girlfriend, and his excuse was that he was just too ""tempted"" not to. My girlfriend wasn't crazy about it, and told him not to do it again as she has a boyfriend, but she forgave him more or less.

Me on the other hand. I feel that he violated her and he has lost my respect. I told my girlfriend to uninvite him from our party, as I don't really want to see him because I intend to vocally confront him about it if I do. She did not question my decision to uninvite him and said she would, which I thanked her for.

Anway, something I just want to know is if I am overreacting. If I am, what is the best way to act. For clarification, I'm not going to confront him where he works, nor do I intend to. I also have no intention to escalate this with violence.

**TL;DR:** Male coworker that is friends with my girlfriend spanked her while she wasn't looking. Before I knew this, he asked if he could come to a party I am throwing. My girlfriend said he could, but I uninvited him after learning what he did. Am I overreacting?

**Edit:** I edited her reaction to the situation to clarify that she did set a firm boundary with the coworker and told him that they will never be more than strictly friends. 

Thank you all so much for the feedback and for the exposure this post has gotten. Know I have read every one of your comments."
"My best friend's husband [32 M] confessed that he's loved me [27 F] since before their wedding day and I'm not sure what to do.


I've received very good relationship advice from the reddit community in the past, so I'm hoping I can hear some opinions regarding what to do now.

My best friend since kindergarten married her high school sweetheart (so I thought) and they've been married for five years now. She and her husband hosted a party over the weekend. I came over early and helped them prepare for it. 

After the party is when my best friend's husband finally pulled me aside and he told me (he was drunk, but not that drunk) that he's loved me since then and he can't stop thinking about me, and that he wishes he could have known then like he knows me now and etc.

I literally froze and didn't know what to do. So I dismissed him, said he's been drinking too much and that he should get some rest, and that I should go.

I left shortly afterwards.

I do know that my best friend and her husband have had little fights throughout the years (what couple hasn't) but from the surface, they appear happy.

My best friend and I talk about everything and always have. Now I feel obligated to tell her about this, but this is one case where I'm debating if saying nothing would be best.

"My [23F] boyfriends family is angry at me for telling him to go to a doctor because of his extreme blood noses.


My boyfriend and I are both 23 years old and have been dating for 3 years. We both finally decided it's the right time to move into together. We've been living together for about 3 weeks now. 

Last week I came home from work and he was leaning the kitchen sink with his hand covering his noise. I'm not joking when I say he had blood literally all over his shirt and arms. He looked like he had just finished killing someone. I was freaking out asking him what happened. He stated that it was just a blood nose and that he sometimes gets them. This is was not a normal blood nose. The guy was covered in blood. The towl he was using was drenched in it. He's one of those people where he'll only go to the doctor when it's a last resort. Just like my father was. I managed to talk him into going to the doctor. 

We went there and the doctor even told him it's not normal to bleed that much from one blood nose. I showed him the pictures I took on my phone. He did these tests on my BF and we need to go back on Wednesday. He told us he thinks he knows what's wrong, and if it is what he thinks it can be repaired by surgery. 

My boyfriends family is mad at me because now I've ""put this unneeded stress"" on their minds. They told me that and I'm not joking, have to prepare for the 4th of July party. The doctor told him to take it easy, and he can't go. Boyfriend has told them to fuck off, but they're making passive aggressive comments about it on social media.

"GF [25F] is hounding me [23M] about my lack of employment


The title sounds bad but it got your attention. 

Anyways I have been with my GF for approximately 5 months now. Back then I thought I would have a professional job in the area but things fell through. 

So for the last month (quarter system graduated from uni in june) I have been living at home and searching for jobs. 

Anyways my GF always brings up the job situation and that I need to find some sort of part-time work, or become an uber/lyft driver. 

While in most instances people will tell me to just ""get off my lazy ass and get a job"" (I would too) here are some things to keep in mind:

1. I wake up early everyday and from 9:00AM to 6:00PM (admittedly I get distracted as well as have lunchbut I am mostly productive during those hours) my time is spent sending out tailored resumes and cover letters to entry level engineering positions posted on Indeed and school job board, sending messages to alumni or people I know to ask about any engineering opportunities, studying for certifications, and practicing for interviews. In some cases I read blogs about how to get your foot in the door before bed. 
2. I live in a small town so I have to drive out far (think 2-3 hours for most interviews). One was 3.5 hours, so 7 hours on the road. 
3. Where I live the summer season is the off season so it will probably be almost as hard to get a part-time minimum wage job where I live. 
4. No I did not slack off in school or choose an easy major, my major was very very difficult for me, and was heavily involved in multiple clubs, design lead on one of my schools engineering design teams, and GPA is slightly above a 3.0. 
5. My car is ""too old"" for Uber/lyft 
6. We are not living together and both of us live with our parents, meaning there are **no financial issues**. 
  

edit: I should mention that **I did have a summer internship last summer** as many people are telling me. Also I have had another internship that was from a different major but someone tangential.

Anyway, that's exactly what happened and it was hilarious. But then when we told them it was fake, they all got really really angry and haven't spoken to us since. 

They're mostly mad at me, and I can accept that since I'm the oldest. I agree that it was immature and silly, but it was perfectly harmless? We prank each other a lot in our family. I'm trying to see it from their POV and I must be missing something because I just don't think it was THAT bad. Would really like some outside perspectives.

"Parents are mad at me [18f] for taking one day off work. Are they right?


Let me start off by saying my ""parents"" are actually my grandparents. I live with them. They are both in their 50s. 

So my parents are pretty strict with me and have always been the type to try and be in control of every aspect of my life. I graduated in May, and decided that I would get a job until I start college in January. My parents didn't really want me to get a job, but I got one anyways because I wanted to be more responsible. 

I typically work 4 days a week, 8 hours a day. In the past two weeks, I've worked an extra 5 days that I initially had off, because they were short on shift. That wasn't really a problem with me because I most likely wasn't doing anything that day anyways. So I'd just go in and work.

Well I was supposed to have this past Saturday off, but they asked me to come in and take someone's shift, so I did. Right before I went to work on Saturday, my real mother called me and invited me to her house for 4th of July. Of course I told her yes I would come because I didn't have work on the 4th, and I didn't have any other plans. I also don't get to see my real mom a lot, so I cherish any time I do get to spend with her. 

Well later on Saturday night, the manager asked if I wanted or work Tuesday, the 4th, from 4 pm until 11 pm. I told her I was really sorry but I had already made plans with my mother. 

If I hadn't already made plans, I would have went in to work no problem. This is the first time I've told them no. Like I said above, I've taken a lot of extra shifts the past few weeks. 

Well I told this to my parents, and they are extremely mad at me for taking today off. They think I should go into work no matter what day it is or what I have planned. I understand their side a little bit, but i also have worked a lot of extra time and feel it would be kinda unfair to myself to cancel a holiday with my mother to go to work on a day I originally had off anyways. 

My parents are completely shaming me now and won't even speak to me today. They told me they aren't sure if they are going to let me go to my real moms house tonight because I told my work no. They told me they are extremely mad at me.

I just don't know how to feel about this. I don't get why telling my work I can't come in on one day that I originally had off is such a bad thing. This is the very first time I've told them no. And now my parents are punishing me for it. Should I feel guilty for this? Am I being irresponsible and should have went into work although I had already made plans? 

TL;DR: originally had 4th of July off of work. Asked me to come in but told them I couldn't cuz I had already made plans. I've worked a lot of extra hours the past few weeks, but my parents are extremely mad at me for taking today off work. Should I feel guilty for it? 

Edit: just want to clarify some stuff. My birth parents divorced when I was a kid and I loved with my dad. It was a very abusive environment and my grandparents took me in. My birth mom would have but she wasn't and still isn't in the financial means to care for me. She is not on drugs or anything, she is a great mom to me and does her best to be in my life. 

As for my ""parents"", they are still mad at me right now and told me I basically ruined their day but causing so much chaos, aka not picking up an extra shift. a lot of you are saying that I'm 18 and they can't tell me what to do anymore, but trust me, they still treat me like I'm 10 and I have to ask to leave the house at any time. If I went out on my own, they would surely take my car and phone and everything away from me. 

Thanks for all the kind words of encouragement also.

"Friend [23F] thinks I'm [25M] being unreasonable by cutting contact with her if she gets back with her ex [24M]


I lived with my friend's ex when I was at university. He was an absolute waste of space, caused constant drama in the house by stirring the pot, which I partially blame for me ending up with depression when I was at University. It was an awful environment.

My friend started dating her ex in 2013. This is how I met her, and when I fully realised how manipulative my house mate could be. He used to make fake accounts to stalk her, while cheating on her. According to her he also hit her amongst other things. He was an abusive boyfriend and until recently she even agreed with that.

I noticed recently that she started to mention him more often. I tried to steer the conversation away from it because basically I detest the guy and would rather forget about him existing. Then she told me they went on a night out together and they're on 'speaking terms' now.

I told her that in no way will I be around this guy, and she's an absolute idiot for wanting to be in contact with someone who treated her badly. For my own mental sake (and hers really) as I want nothing to do with him, I told her that if she makes friends with him I will cut contact with her because I don't want any drama. This guy could find drama in an empty room so if he found out we still talked he would try and stir it up anyway. 

She told me that I was being way too harsh and that was it her life, not mine. I told her that yes I agree with that, but I also have the luxury of choosing who my friends are since its my life, so I basically gave her an ultimatum. I feel like I'm well within my rights to do this.

TL;DR: Friend has started talking to her abusive ex boyfriend again who was also my room mate. He abused her, and was a reason for me falling into depression. I have told her if she does properly forgive him, I will cut her off because I would not support her choice and for my own mental well being as he would likely start drama with me. She thinks I'm over reacting, I think it's a fair request considering the circumstances. What do I do?"

"My [25 F] girlfriend keeps asking 'are things okay?', which has started made me [29 M] anxious and unsure


Just over 1 year with my girlfriend, we have a really good open communication and talk about a lot of things, even things that we find difficult or are lying under the surface. There's a nice even ground when someone has an issue they want to talk about, which is great. It does get heated at times, like any argument, but there is an understanding from both grounds.
But, there are times, random occasions even when she's asks the question 'is everything okay between us?' or 'are we okay?'. For example, yesterday was a busy day in work after a few days off, I did text during the afternoon and we spoke on the phone later in the evening. We did text again in the evening, but I woke up this morning to ""is everything okay between us?"". She does suffer from anxiety and appears to be just a moment in time that it has cropped up, but that question does make me feel anxious (I do suffer from it at times myself) and makes me question, is everything okay?
She has since opened up and said she wishes she doesn't need to ask this question, but it just makes me feel uncomfortable and on edge that I need to text her constantly or if I am tired, I have to act all super happy and over the top to appease her anxiety. I know she wouldn't want this, but it's hard to not look for a solution to a re-ocurring issue.

"I'm (27F) pregnant with my first child. My best friend (27F) said she would rather be distantly involved due to my mother (46F).


My best friend for the purpose of this will be Aurora.

I've known Aurora since high school, we actually met the first day of our freshman year. She's one of the few people I've actively kept in touch with since then and she truly is a good friend. We've always been able to confide in each other and she's one of the few people I can truly just open up to and spill it all out and just knowing that she's there and listening is one of the most comforting feelings.

I got married a couple years ago to my now husband. Aurora was a bridesmaid for me and it was a fantastic wedding. The next day we had a brunch for the groomsmen, the bridal party, and our families as a thank you/after party-ish thing. As she was leaving, Aurora whispered to me that she believes that she had gotten on my mom's bad side. I didn't think much of it and told her not to either. We hugged and she headed off. 

Now, for my mother...

I love my mother to pieces. She had me at 19 on her own as my bio dad kind of ran off on her. He and I somewhat have a relationship but my dad, the man she is married to, is who I see as my real dad. My mom has always been a little into herself. Growing up, she used to degrade me a lot, calling me ugly and fat, telling me my boyfriends would leave me if I never lost any weight, etc. It really took a toll on me and Aurora knows it all. She was my rock going through college as for a year, my mother kicked me out when she found out I had sex with my then boyfriend now husband. I lived with my grandparents for a year and eventually, we made up but she still took digs at me. Prior to the wedding, she'd take jabs at me saying my husband would leave me if I didn't lose weight or he'd start looking for girls who would. I think part of this stemmed from her being overweight for a while but she got surgery to get the weight taken off. We have a relationship, a rocky one but it's there.

I sent out the news to my friends that we were expecting and Aurora texted me back, gushing with excitement. She and I talked for hours about decorations, clothes, names, etc. I told her I'd like her to be involved because I knew my mom was going to want to plan my shower and I wanted her to help. She paused for a moment and sounded uncomfortable. I asked if she was okay with that and she said she would rather not work with my mom on anything. I thought she was just saying it in a casual ""haha your mom is ridiculous"" way but she meant it. I pushed a little to understand but she said she would explain when she came up to visit that weekend (we live in separate states).

Aurora drove out, we sat down that night, and she laid it out for me. During the pre-wedding days, she had been helping me out getting the house set up (we rented a house for the bridal party and my immediate family to stay in). One of my aunts had cancer but to be fair to Aurora, she knew but she didn't know which one. I take the blame for this as I never specified which aunt or how bad it was, just that I had an aunt with cancer. My mom had snapped at Aurora for making my aunt get out of her seat to get into the back. Aurora apologized and told my mom that she knew but had no idea which aunt it was but that she was sorry. The day of, we were getting ready and Aurora's hair wasn't really holding a style or anything. My mom got huffy with her and told her that maybe if she had spent some money like the other bridesmaids, she could have an actual hair style. (I wasn't able to afford to pay for all of them for their hair and make up, so I told them the prices of both the stylist and the make up artist. My two sisters were bridesmaids, as were Aurora, my two aunts, and a friend from college. Aurora's job at the time wasn't great and they had cut her hours, so money was very tight for her and she opted to do her own hair and make up.) Aurora kept to herself but she and my friend were able to make her hair beautiful and the hair stylist helped a little for no charge. The next day at the brunch, she overslept and forgot she had to pack up. She was cleaning up the room she stayed in when my mom came up the stairs, saw her, and yelled at her for not helping clean up the house and prepare the house for the brunch. She explained but my mom didn't believe her and went back downstairs. Aurora hastily cleaned up and went downstairs to do whatever else had to be done as well as ran errands with my sister to pick up missing supplies for the brunch. 

She apologized for not telling me because she knew I had just gotten married but she just did not want to be around my mother anymore. I knew my mother was bad but the idea that she was treating Aurora like this or possibly anyone else is unsettling. She said she will do whatever else she can but she preferred to stay distant from the shower. 

My question is...what do I do with this information? I want her involved as she is one of my best friends but I know my mom and I can understand why she doesn't want to be. My mom always liked Aurora and even now, she still says she does but this is just a lot to take in.

**tl;dr**: Best friend doesn't want to be involved in my baby shower after multiple incidents during my wedding with my over the top mother."
