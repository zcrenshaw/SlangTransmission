Hello, I’m a 15 year old girl.

My mom died on January 19, 2017 when she got hit by a drunk driver on her way home from work. 

My dad is almost never home when we are during the week because he works nights. I take care of my 4 younger siblings.

My brothers:
Klyne, 3
Jasper, 5

My sisters:
Abby, 7
Lydia, 11

Ask me (or us) anything "
