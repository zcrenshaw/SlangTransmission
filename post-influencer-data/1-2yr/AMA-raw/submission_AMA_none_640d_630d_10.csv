0,"I just went to jail last month for the first time at age 42. Never been arrested before. AMA.


I'm a 42 year old guy. Accountant, two kids. Pretty normal, vanilla life. Never been in trouble with the law outside of a few tickets. A few months ago, I got a speeding ticket that I foolishly didn't pay. Last month I was driving to Wisconsin for Minneapolis (where I work) to do an audit, when I got pulled over for a broken tail light. Cop told me there was a warrant out for my arrest because I didn't pay the ticket. He arrests me, puts me in cuffs and takes me to county jail in Milwaukee. 

I get fingerprinted, mugshot taken, they pat me down and take some of my stuff including shoelaces, belt, phone, wallet etc... I get put in a holding room with like 15 other guys for several hours. Get to make my phone call to angry wife. Find out that because I was arrested on a Friday, bail hearings are not until Tuesday (Veteran's Day federal holiday). 

I get escorted to another room, have to get naked, get strip searched, shower, and get put in an orange jail jumpsuit. Spend Saturday, Sunday and Monday in jail. Get brought to court in chains on Tuesday, get bailed out and released a few hours later. 

So yeah, ask me anything. Also, pay your speeding tickets."
1,"I was a child sex slave and I have dissociative identity disorder... AMA


Here's my story... I was introduced by a babysitter to a trafficking ring. I was very young... under 6 is all I'm comfortable saying about my age. It lasted two years.

Contrarily to what you might think, there's little physical signs of rape on children. Their bodies heal quickly. My parents did not notice and my cries for help went unheard. In truth, without knowing the warning signs for abuse and trauma in children, they had little chance of finding out.

I have DID. This is a disorder that is on the extreme end of the dissociative spectrum. Dissociation means ""separation of consciousness"". For example, when you watch a movie that's so awesome that you lose track of time, you are dissociating. While most people score 1-2% on the Dissociative Experience Scale, a test used by therapist is to measure dissociation, I score 70%. To survive the trauma, my mind split off aspects of personality and gave them identities. Each shares a memory, each went through a part of the abuse. But the abusers also created those dissociative parts on purpose. They did it so that I would have amnesia for what they were doing to me and I wouldn't tell. 

I am trying to build a case against my abusers and it's incredibly difficult. I'm hoping to bring them to justice one day, but it doesn't seem like that day will be anytime soon. 

I was sold for sex, treated like a dog, shackled, tortured in ways that are difficult to imagine. 

About the DID, it's actually quite different from portrayals in the media. DID is a disorder whose goal is to make you go under the radar. It's completely hidden. My switches are not obvious, unless I'm comfortable enough with the people around me that I let switching be obvious (change in voice, mannerisms). One of my best friends could actually tell who was out by just looking at my eyes. I still don't know how she could do that, she's amazing. 

I don't hate my abusers. I practice gratefulness and compassion and I sometimes feel connected to the world in a very deep sense. I see the sameness of our essence in everyone, if that makes sense and that's why I'm able to feel compassionate to everyone. I can't do it all the time, mind you! But I try. I've experienced helplessness and I think that we downplay our power so much. So often we feel powerless, but we have little understanding of just how much power a smile or listening can hold. I consider that every little act of kindness offsets the balance of what was done to me. I want to heal for me, of course, but also because my abusers were too weak to do this work on themselves.

I decided to talk because I saw people, children, murdered before my eyes and I don't want them to be forgotten, to have died in vain.

Ask me anything.

PS: Sorry everyone. I had to delete and resubmit because I just can't get my title right. I'm blaming it on finals and end of term exhaustion!"

3,"I am a former trans identifying person, who realized they are not transgender and decided to detransition. AMA


Many in the trans community like to pretend that detranstion and transition regret does not happen, but it does sometimes. Not to say that it always happens, trans people do exist, and transition is the correct path for many of them. This is an AMA that needs to be done, to address some of the problems prevalent in the trans community.

For context, I was FTM. I started thinking I was trans when i was 16. I “developed” dysphoria shortly thereafter. I did not have any issues with my body or gender before this. I was never feminine. I socially transitioned almost immediately, and lived as male until I was 20. At 19 I started taking Testosterone. I felt good through the entire process, because I had a goal that I was achieving and that felt good. I stopped taking T after 10 months, when I realized that it didn’t make sense for me to be trans, and I had created it in my head for various complicated and personal reasons. Reasons include; a need for belonging in a community, issues with parents, and a tendency to absorb characteristics of groups I am immersed in. I did not let myself acknowledge any doubts for 4 years due to stubbornness and a hatred of admitting i am wrong. 

I started detransitioning a few months ago, and have adjusted fairly well since. I wear makeup, female clothes (nothing too feminine though) and am slowest becoming okay with being called a woman. I no longer care about pronouns, and am legally changing my name back. 

To be clear, this is NOT representative of all trans people. There are plenty of trans people who are authentic. Many of them have had actual dysphoria since they were very young. I did not. Any dysphoria was a creation because it’s what “trans people have”, and so I convinced myself i had it to fit the narrative. I in no way mean to discredit actual trans people, and make things harder for them. But what people don’t realize is that this issue is much more complicated than “everyone who thinks they’re trans is and no one ever is wrong.” 

I personally wish that there was more gatekeeping on hormones, as I was able to get them without any documentation of a diagnosis. I walked in, and had them in my hand a week later. It’s worth noting that i did have a letter from a therapist, and was in therapy for 2 years before starting hormones. I simply was in denial so I did not let it help me. 

Please keep your questions respectful and so will attempt to answer them the best I can. My comment history has a record of me stating that I (was) trans, and fighting for trans rights. Although i comment a lot so you may have to scroll. "

5,"I got a law passed in Nevada because of the abuse I faced in the foster care system - AMA.


When I was 15, I entered the foster care system because of abuse I was facing at the hands of my mom and her boyfriend. They would call me names like 'tranny', 'slut', 'bitch', and so forth on the daily. It got to a point where I attempted suicide and a social worker reached out to ask what was going on at home. When I told her, Child Protective Services was called and I was removed from the home.


In foster care, my first foster parent initially told me that she didn't have a problem with me being transgender. However, an incident arose where the other foster placement in the home was bullying me at school for my gender identity. When I told my foster parent, she brushed it off and told me it came with being transgender. She told me that I should expect to be bullied because I'm not normal. After that, she told me to stay away from her three biological children because I was turning them transgender. She would also lock me in her bedroom for hours of lecturing about how me 'changing my gender' was like her 'changing her skin color from black to white' in that it was never going to happen. She wouldn't stop until I was bawling, completely broken.


No one would listen to me. My attorney discounted my claims and said that I was exaggerating them to be dramatic for attention. My Department of Family Services case worker was also a part of the problem, asking me inappropriate questions about my genitals and generally harassing me every time we would meet. I didn't have anyone supporting me until I reached out to my local gay and lesbian community center.


They had a contact who worked for the Department of Family Services who was able to move me out of my first foster home. However, my second home turned out to be much worse.


For the first few months, it was like a family that I had never had. They treated me with respect except the occasional slip up on calling me by my correct name and gender. However, one of the family members had been diagnosed with cancer. We left the state to visit him, and while I was there, I was constantly being misgendered (called by the wrong pronouns). I politely told this family member that I actually went by he/him/his, and he was so embarrassed that he announced to the entire household my pronouns.


This greatly upset my foster parents who talked about punishing me on the trip back as if I weren't even in the same car. They withheld food from me. I was no longer welcome at the dinner table. The only thing I had to eat was a cup of expired M&amp;M's that I kept in my bedroom without their knowledge.


There would be weeks where we had no conversation because they had completely neglected me in their household, meanwhile the other placements would receive the benefit of their attention.


Finally, it all ended one night after they had come home from a dinner which I was not invited to (again). I asked the other placement where they had been, and when the foster mother heard me and my probing questions, she followed me into my bedroom and locked the door behind me.


After that, she started venting all of the frustrations that apparently she'd been keeping under wraps for months, like how I was destroying the household with my existence of being trans. She told me similar things to my first foster parent (I would never be a boy, I would be going to hell, so on and so forth) until I eventually stopped listening and just started packing everything I had in garbage bags.


By the end of the night, her husband had called me a 'freak', a 'transvestite', and said something along the lines that I should just do the world a favor.


So I did. I went to Carson City, NV to talk to legislators for Children's Week. When I told them my story, some were very touched. They assembled a coalition of influencers to form a committee dedicated to the creation of some sort of protection in place for LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care.


After about a year of drafting the bill, it was brought to the Assembly Floor and voted on. On April 4th, 2017, it passed and was signed into law by Governor Sandoval. The bill includes cultural competency training for agencies that handle out-of-home youth as well as protections for the youth themselves.
