1,"Can we ban putting 'bored' in titles


I think its annoying to not put a little bit more thought then ""I'm bored and on a train"" for example. "
2,"I survived a kidnapping, torture, and rape by a stranger when I was 16. AMA.


My story: 
I was taken deep into the wilderness and brutally attacked for many hours. I was repeatedly strangled and didn’t expect to survive the night. It was pitch black and I had no idea where I was but I could hear running water, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how he would surely throw my body in there when he was done with me and probably no one would ever find it but if they did I would be naked, and that felt really embarrassing. Eventually he told me he was taking me back to his home, where he forced me into the shower. I still thought I was about to die, and that he was just cleaning me up to prepare for dumping my body somewhere. He left me alone in the bathroom for a minute so I rubbed my blood into the grout in the corners of the shower, hoping that maybe someday someone would figure out that I’d been there and something really bad had happened to me. I couldn’t believe it when he walked me out, took my ID so he would know where to find me, and said he would kill me if I went to the cops or told anyone. Then he let me go. 

I went to the first place I saw with lights on, a hotel, and used their phone to call 911. I went to the hospital in an ambulance, went through a rape kit and spoke with the police briefly, then went into surgery to repair serious internal injuries I’d sustained. I spent five days in the hospital recovering from my injuries and surgery. He was arrested about a week later and eventually sentenced to 30 years in prison. It’s been 23 years and he’s still locked up so far, though he became eligible for parole after the first ten years so I have to deal with his parole hearings every couple years. 

Info on stereotypical kidnappings:
“The Department of Justice (DOJ) defines stereotypical kidnappings as those in which 1) the victim is under 18-years-old, 2) the kidnapper is either a stranger or a “slight acquaintance,” 3) the abduction involves moving the victim at least 20 feet or detaining them for at least one hour, and 4) the victim is either held for ransom, transported at least 50 miles, detained overnight, held with an intent to keep permanently, or killed. In other words, these are “the most serious” sorts of child abductions, as DOJ puts it.” (From the Reason article linked below)

Approximately 105 children were “stereotypically kidnapped” in the US in each of the two years studied by the DOJ (link below), 1997 and 2011. While that’s a lot of children who experienced an awful thing, for reference there were approximately 80 million children in the US in 1997, 73.9 million in 2011. (My case was in 1995 but I can’t find the statistics from that year so I’m assuming they were similar to 1997). Many more children are indeed kidnapped each year, but usually by non-custodial parents or other family members. 

In 1997 approximately 60% of stereotypically kidnapped victims were recovered alive, 40% were murdered. Thankfully things have improved in this area, and as of 2011 92% of victims made it home alive.

4,"I am a Muslim woman who secretly took off my hijab for work but kept it on in front of friends &amp; family for two years. AMA.


I am currently publicly not wearing it at all. All my friends and family know now. I kept it hidden from them for two years. I initially took it off because I wasn’t getting job offers until I took it off. "
5,"My parents raised me according to the book ""to train a child"" - AMA


Using a throw away because I want my personal life affiliated with my regular account. 

Basically, the book teaches you to beat your child (even as a newborn) so that you are totally obedient to them. It also teaches stuff like separating your children from society and not letting them play with most toys, but the child beating is the main staple of the book."
6,"I’m laying in a hospital bed having just donated my Kidney. AMA!
