8,"I [23F] realized I was gay in 30 seconds of finding a new friend attractive. AMA


There are always people that have known their whole lives they are not straight. That was not me. 

I realized in November that I was gay when I went to hang out with a coworker for the first time. We were outside preparing to leave. She said something funny, threw her head back to laugh, and in that moment I thought, “God, she’s beautiful.”

The pieces all clicked over time, I realized why I never felt attracted to men (I wasn’t and my definition of attraction was incorrect) and here I am roughly 8 months later.

The only way to bring about education is to have a platform to ask anything you’re wondering (with respect and the intent to understand). I’m sure there are other people out there like me or like I once was. Ask me anything!"
