3,"Iâ€™m an average citizen of Antigua and Barbuda ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¬ who is currently going through the preparedness for the monster Hurricane Irma AMA


Currently my whole country is being prepared for the monster Hurricane Irma honestly speaking weâ€™re terrified Iâ€™m a male 23 and Iâ€™m willing to describe the atmosphere of the country before this catastrophe and by gods will the aftermath 
  
 [update]

Iâ€™ll try and update as much as I can so far the rumor is that current will be off at 8 gmt Iâ€™ll rely on my service provider for internet after that but they as well are going to be disconnected I just donâ€™t know when.

[update] 

Putting my phone on airplane mode to save battery thanks for the well wishes guys Iâ€™ll try an update As soon as I can. I can hear the wind my gut feeling is telling me this one is bad guys. 

Godspeed. 

[update]

Got some sleep while I could the sound of the winds woke me up so far so good guys thanks for the wishes.

Presently weâ€™re in the what Iâ€™d like to believe is the middle of the storm my brother says the storm supposedly shifted a bit also that these powerful winds and gusts should be at its worst till 2 am gmt. 

So edit to previous statement turns out we were not in the middle of the storm apparently it was Irmaâ€™s red carpet. And yo what an entrance she made. 

Godspeed Antigua and Barbuda ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¬ Godspeed to the northern leeward islands. This is bad and my gut is telling me itâ€™s only the beginning. 

Update

So it turns out my brother was right maybe it shifted from us and our sister island Barbuda suffered mostly. The damage honestly guys thank god, is not much to talk about. Literally my fence has a dent a small dent so far all my neighbors are safe as well. No damage to cars or property so far and no flooding issues.

The latest NOAA advisory at 5am AST (10pm BST) puts Hurricane Irma about 35 miles east-south-east of St Martin, and about 145 miles east of St Croix

*Final update*

The prime minister has announced that no life has been lost in Antigua and so far he hasnâ€™t heard of any loss of life in Barbuda, but still no communication. I drove around no damage at all thank god my people, weâ€™ve learned so much from this experience so much about our houses that weâ€™d be prepared for the next.
