0,"AMA and then edit your question once I've answered to make me sound like an egomaniac.


"
1,"I’m a normal married dude with a wife, two kids and a desk job that I don’t hate. Ask me anything.


Everybody knows that person who thinks people give a fuck about what they think. They will say something like “I’m a successful entrepreneur, ask me anything”. This is my attempt to make fun of those guys who haven’t done shit. "
2,"Today is my 3 years clean from self harm, AMA!


"
3,"Recently celebrated four years clean after 15 years of crack, opiate, and alcohol abuse. AMA


"
4,"Lost my home to Hurricane Ike. 8 yrs later moved to a new house just to have it destroyed by Harvey. AMA


I live two hours away from Galveston and the gulf. Ike destroyed my home because once it hit land not only did the storm surge destroy Galveston but the extreme winds did a great deal of damage. The combination of fast winds and loose soil from rain caused a massive oak tree to flatten part of my house. 
Harvey destroyed Houston with driving rain that lasted for days. The hurricane literally stopped over Houston for a few days went back out into the ocean to refuel then returned for a few more days until it finally died out. Imagine the hardest rain you've ever seen happening day after day after day. The San Jacinto spilled over its banks for miles and destroyed my home. AMA"
5,"I’m a 25M who for the first time in 4 years, feel that I am out of the woods and in control of my depression. AMA!


"
6,"I’m Brian “Q” Quinn of Impractical Jokers. Ask me anything!
