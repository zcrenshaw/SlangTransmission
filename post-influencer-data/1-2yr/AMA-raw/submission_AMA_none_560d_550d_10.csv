0,"My newborn died from whooping cough 3 years ago; since then I have been attacked by the anti-vax movement for promoting vaccination. AMA


My husband [31] and I [30] watched our baby suffer and die from whooping cough - he was too young to be vaccinated &amp; pregnancy vaccination programs had not been offered in my country at the time. We went public with his death, encouraging people to vaccinate, and have been abused by the anti-vax movement for nearly 3 years now. We are both honest and not easily offended - AMA!"

2,"My grandpa is also my stepdad. AMA


Bit of background: about 3 years ago my mom and dad divorced because my dad kept losing jobs due to his unreliability. He would always be late, take off, leave early, etc. and my mom was tired of being the sole provider and giving him second chances. 

Well, my dadâ€™s dad, my grandpa, gave my mom a lot of help during and after the divorce with getting me to school and making sure she had enough money for groceries. They got romantically involved and married about 2 years after the divorce. 

On a throwaway because I consider the whole thing to be a bit embarrassing. "
