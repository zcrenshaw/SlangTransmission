0,"I saved a girl while she was being raped. AMA


One night I was at this party. I got tired of all the loud music and people so I went to a closet to have some peace and quiet so I could smoke weed. After a few minutes, the door bust open and this guy and a girl come in. I couldnt really see but I assume the guy pushed the girl on the bed and she was slightly drunk. She is crying and yelling stop and no and get off me. 

I was really fucking terrified but i knew I couldnt live with myself if I couldnt do anything. So I feel around the closet looking for a weapon or something and luckily I found a broken piece of wood from a desk. Then i get out, yell get the fuck off her, and hit the guy with the piece of wood.  At that point I knew i had to get the fuck out of there so i help the girl up, hit the guy again, and run.

I asked her if she was ok and her and her friends called the police."

2,"I remember someone requesting an AMA with a butler or estate manager of a Ultra High Net Worth individuals house. I am that person and have been so for 12 years. Ask me anything!


I am currently a house manager for one of the grandest estates in the United States. I oversee all operations in running this home. I will answer any and all questions I can, though I will not answer anything that could potentially lead someone to discover who I work for and who I am. This is such a secretive industry that I want to be able to answer general questions people have about this. Many people don’t even realize there are butlers anymore, but believe me, we are out there and there are many households that make the old mansions in Newport RI look shoddy. "

5,"I just did Ketamine combined with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in order to remove my severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Two hours after treatment, I’m seeing significant results. AMA.


I had a traumatic event very early on in my childhood that resulted in severe depression and anxiety. Medication (pills) has helped in the past, but I’ve never had a breakthrough. It hasn’t been two hours after my treatment, and I can already say this has helped me more than medication ever will; it’s not even close.
