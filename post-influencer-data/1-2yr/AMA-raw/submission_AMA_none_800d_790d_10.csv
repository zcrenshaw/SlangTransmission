0,"I was raised (illegally) isolated from society and with no education, by Scientologist parents! AMA


Hello. A little bit of background. So, like many Scientology kids, I received no formal education whatsoever. I was just told to read Scientology books and complete courses. My parents thought the public school system would brainwash me. They were extremely poor, so I spent my whole childhood either at the church where they worked, or home alone. Like, they left me home alone most days when I was only 6 or 7 years old. Because we were so poor, we had no TV and limited internet access, so I had no idea how the world worked or what was going on out there. I received no medical or dental care because they hate drugs. I have very strong and naturally straight teeth, but my sister has crooked teeth and is missing some now because of this neglect. Anyway, when I was 14 I realized I needed to do something to escape the situation and enrolled myself in public school. Ask me anything!"

2,"I Am The Victim of a Common Moving Scam


My family and I just relocated from Brooklyn to L.A. and fell prey to a common moving scam. 

Don't be a sucker like me. It's a common enough scam and there are lots of companies that do it. You just don't really ever get a chance to hear about it because how often are you interested in cross country moves?


Basically a low ball estimate and then come packing day, they pack your boxes with empty space to double or triple the estimate for space they originally quoted you. Inventory is poorly tracked and items get stolen. Due to poor packing, items also get very, very broken. 


Our particular moving company was https://longdistance-vanlines.com


They have operated another company called North Eastern Moving and Storage that got such poor reviews it looks like it's no longer active. 


The most frustrating thing about this is that there are so many laws protecting movers it's very hard to get anything out of them. They get enough bad reviews, form a new business, hire a fake review company, and totally saturate BBB and Consumer Affairs with 5 star fake reviews. When you're googling them they look really good at first glance. Dig deeper though. Read the reviews...is that how anyone talks that you know? Nope.


A lot of these companies are located in FL for some reason. I'm wondering if most of them are all run by the same few people.

Anyways, do your research and probably go with a bigger company. 

Check out https://www.movingscam.com/ but feel free to AMA. I'm here to help.

To date we're in the process of working with the company, have disputed the charges on our card, and have made this website:

3,"IAmA Male Victim of Domestic Violence (Female Offender), AMA


I am a male ""victim""/""survivor"" (I don't like those labels) of domestic violence at the hands of a female perpetrator. She was both physically and emotionally abusive, and while I was never in any real physical ""danger"", the danger came afterwards as I battled severe depression and suicidal ideations. I am here to talk about how male victims' experiences differ to those of our female counterparts and what support is needed (and not available) to address this. AMA."
