"I have had an imaginary friend since I was 11. He became my boyfriend somewhere along the way. I talk to him every single day. I’ve lived an imaginary life with him in my head for the past 13 years. AMA.


Thank you all so much for all of your questions! Please keep them coming. I love answering them. 

Everyone: please keep in mind I am not here for a psych evaluation. I have lived with this for more than half of my life. I’m here to share my experiences and answer questions. :) "
"Blind Redditer Here - AMA


Hi my name is Bradley, I'm here because I found out about Reddit through another blind friend of mine from the UK. I've been on here for a month and I'm just browsing around and checking things out. I'm trying to get my Karma thing up so I can make more posts, so ask me anything so ask me anything you like. All the Karma posts I can get will help out a lot as there are places on here that require to have Karma, else my posts will get removed automatically."
"I stabbed 3 people. AMA.


It happened 10 years ago, not recently.
It was in self defense.
I did not kill anyone, but did come very close to doing so.

For the sake of clarity, it was absolutely within my legal rights to do so. The police were well aware of it after it happened, and no charges were filed against me. Charges were, however, filed against those I stabbed, and most of them were convicted or plead guilty."
"I asked a lady out yesterday and she said yes!

"Retired Shoplifter. I made a good living. AMA


I spent 2 years shoplifting to support myself.  During that time I earned an average of £1,000 a week.  Fully retired now, not trying or attempting to justify my actions.  I was wrong, stealing is wrong.  But I started out of desperation and ended up being greedy.  I once changed the entire security policy of a national supermarket.  "
