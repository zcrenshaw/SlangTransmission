"What are your personal favorite romantic things to do in NYC?


I just picked up the book ""Romantic N.Y"" off a stoop in  Brooklyn. Curious to know what your personal favorite romantic places are, things to do are, etc.

Book has things like Morgan Library, Morris Jumel Mansion, Cafe Vivaldi, the Conservatory Garden.... Things along those lines?

"Support group / somewhere to talk if you're life is falling apart?


Hey... so this is kind of a long shot, but honestly I've just run out of places to turn... I'm living in NYC, my life has really fallen apart... I'm at the point where I'm completely alone in this city, I don't have a single friend to turn to, either here or at home, no family to speak of, my relationships have abandoned me, I've lost my job, I've nowhere to go, my money is running out and this just feels pretty ominous if I'm being honest... I've completely fucked up my life and it feels like it's ending... I can't believe it's got to this point, I can't even figure out where it all went wrong, but I guess that's not really important right now... I just don't know what else to do... maybe talking would help? I'm so isolated. I can't afford to go to a doctor or see a professional, is there anywhere in this city I can go?

Just a room with people, maybe I can talk? I don't know why I think that might help, but it's pretty much the last idea I can come up with. Like a community centre or something?

Maybe if you guys know of anything I'd really appreciate it."
"Short trips that are less than a two hour drive from NYC?


I know, I know, Google - but the lists are overwhelming. My boyfriend and I want something close and nice in October. The things I've seen in Google searches feel more like summertime/beachy destinations. 

I'd like an hour to two hours because he doesn't drive and if it's just me anything more than that feels brutal. Anything fun, close and good for early Fall? Open to just about anything :)

Doesn't have to be driving either _ I'd be willing to take a bus somewhere. Just in a rut for ideas. Thanks

**EDIT: THANK YOU and a huge hug to you all. I appreciate the recommendations. All of these sound great! I will read through these with him and decide. Much appreciated!**"
