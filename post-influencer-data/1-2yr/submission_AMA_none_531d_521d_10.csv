"""If Trump gets elected, I'm moving out of the country!"" I said it and actually did it. AMA


EDIT  I'm receiving a lot of questions that can be answered with the following: ""After much thought and reflection, the root of my disappointment was not necessarily Trump himself (although he is repulsive). The fact that approximately 25% of Americans went to the polls and voted for him (about half of registered Americans voted, and about half of those actually voted for Trump) was more disturbing. What does that say about my fellow Americans? At this point, I just see Trump as the representation of 25% of Americans. Is that something I want to surround myself and my family with? The answer is no, so off we went!

"I am a full blood Native, ask me anything.


I’m a full blood American Indian girl. I was raised in the culture and my father was chief when I was a kid. People have a lot of misconceptions about Natives and some people, despite living in America, have never met one lol. So ask me things about whatever! I’m here to inform and educate and give opinions. Hi!"

"I went 15 years without knowing I was colorblind, AMA.


My 8 year old brother had his eyes checked today and when he came home he told me and my mom he was colorblind. He has a history if making things up in the past so we said he was lying and pulled up a test and made him do it. as I was watching him do that I noticed I was having problems with some of them and then took it myself. apparently we have the same kind where it's like blues purples and greys. I guess that's cool because we're learning about colorblindness and genetic disorders like that in my Biology class right now.

I posted this on /r/teenagers and someone told me I should put it here too. "

"I Am a Former Police Officer that is Pro-Recreational Use of Marijuana, AMA


I was a police officer for 3 years, leaving the field a year ago. I always found it strange to enforce marijuana laws, and yet it is in my state (MO), still heavily encouraged to do so. I stopped arresting people for it for at least a year before I resigned, something really only possible because of the specific squad I was in."
"I grew up believing I was constantly at risk of being kidnapped by a crazy woman. Turns out my mother was the crazy one. AMA.


My mother was an abusive criminal who, back in the 80s and 90s (before she was trumped by technology) got away with some truly ridiculous shit.

My ""favorite"" being the time she convinced my father, our family, and our small community that my father had a stalker who, madly in love with him, was determined to kill her and kidnap me to ensure my father's love.

I had a security guard follow me around my elementary school, and my earliest memories are of being prepped for a kidnapping.

Ask me anything."
