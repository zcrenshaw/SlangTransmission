"What would you think if the girl you’ve been dating gave you a topless Polaroid photo?


I’m considering surprising my guy with a topless Polaroid photo in an envelope, and telling him to open it when he starts missing me (I won’t be seeing him for a week and a half). Would you find that weird or attractive?"

"As I enter my late 20's it's becoming more noticeable how flawed my parents are as people and their many weaknesses. Is this something you just accept?


So the older I get the more noticeable it becomes for me how my parents have a lot of weaknesses as people. To make this as brief as possible, some quick examples: my dad is super childish (my parents have been divorced for awhile and he'll get jealous if he thinks I'm spending more time with mom etc etc), not a good person in a lot of ways (he always tries to rip people off/take advantage of people), terrible temper and very emotional and then my mom on the other hand is not a very capable person at all because she has been a housewife for 40+ years so she literally doesn't know how to do almost anything.  

I guess the point of this is to ask: do I just accept this is who they are and love them for who they are? I guess it's normal as you grow up to no longer view your parents as these all mighty beings but as regular people who have their flaws and weaknesses like everyone else?"

"What are some ways a woman can make you feel manly and helpful?


Background info: I'm a woman with a crush. Yesterday my car got stuck in the snow and my crush offered to drive 45 min from where he was to come help me. The roads were bad and there was no way he would make it. I got help elsewhere, but I later realized I probably should have let him help me since I am interested in him. I've had to be a ""strong independent woman"" for so long that I forget and miss the times I should let a man help me, not because I am incapable, but because it is helpful and it makes him feel great. I've missed a lot of natural things. What are some things I could be missing? "

"Men of Reddit. How can I make an extra $200-$300 this month as a broke college student?


I've recently gotten a speeding citation two nights ago. It's a mandatory court date that I'll need an attorney for. Once I got home that night, I immediately started going to work looking up how to handle the situation, and what were the best routes to take. I've found an attorney and things are looking up, they've made me feel really good about this whole situation. However, I'm a broke college student. I'm already struggling with money working the job I work at, while also going to school. Now, I have to come up with $150 for the attorney, $30 for a driving test and around $250~ for court costs. It's something I simply can't afford when I already have rent, food and gas/maintenance to worry about. 

That said, I want to ask you guys some productive ways to make $200-$300 this month in order to cover the bulk of the costs of this ticket. I've taken responsibility for my actions, and I'm not looking for any hand outs or anything, just some ideas and advice on how to get my ass moving and make the extra money I need to survive and not go homeless or starve. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, guys!

**EDIT 01:** For those who are curious why I'm getting an attorney, I'm hearing that in my case (71 in a 45) it's foolish not to get one. Added to the fact that I'm required to go to court and not able to simply pay this citation off, it's a necessary step I'm willing to take. Plus, if an attorney goes in my favor, I won't have to show up, allowing me to make more money to pay the attorney in the first place. :P 

Secondly, I'm seriously looking into plasma donation. It seems like something I'd be able to do quickly and receive the money I'd need to pay for everything, so any advice or suggestions on that would be appreciated. Especially personal experiences! 

**EDIT 02:** Please don't think I'm some freak speed demon guys. i was going 71 in a 45 because I was coming off the highway into the city where I live. I was admittedly tired at the wheel, and wasn't paying attention to the speed limit signs, trying to keep my eyes open. By the time I noticed the speed change, I had already past the police car and knew I had messed up. Again, this isn't an excuse, and I'm taking full responsibility for my actions. I shouldn't' have been at the wheel tired, I should have paid more attention to my surroundings, and I shouldn't have been going so fast, even on the highway with the speed limit at 60. That said, I wasn't speeding in a residential area or populated area. I'm not that crazy! :P "

"What is a widely-spread piece of dating advice that in your opinion is garbage?


For example for me it's ""masturbate before a date to have a clear mind and don't come off as desperate"".

I've heard this advice so many times and I think it's just plain bad. After masturbation I'm completely deflated for at least 2-3 hours. I lose all my motivation to talk with women and especially to court them.

For me actually the opposite of the advice works - the less I masturbate, the better I do with women because my brain is working at full capacity, trying to find ways to fulfill the newly acquired lack of sexual satisfaction."
"Guys, if you’re sober and your girlfriend is pretty damn drunk, do you feel hesitant to have sex with her when she wants to?


I feel wrong doing that. I can’t shake feeling like she’s not in a straight state of mind and like I’d be taking advantage of her. Anyone else go through this or am I just weird?"
"How do you think your SO/girlfriend would feel if you posted shirtless selfies on social media?


My boyfriend constantly posts shirtless selfies on instagram/snapchat and I know girls DM him, compliment him and shit. He's very good looking and he bodybuilds so I can understand him wanting to show off what he's proud of, and the results of his hard work.

But it also bothers me that he feels the need to get attention from other girls when I'm always freely and genuinely complimenting him myself.

I know if I posted similar photos of me, half naked, I too, would get lots of DMs, but I'm not vain and don't need others' approval to validate my self confidence. I also feel that if I did what he did, it would upset him. 

Essentially it feels to me that he requires more attention than what I can give him. He doesn't want just one girl saying he looks great, he wants many girls saying it. It especially irks me because I know he still has his ex on insta and snap that recently admitted she's in love with him, as well as other girls he used to sleep with. "
"Are there things that women don't know about when it comes to men or their bodies?


Today I learned that men experience 'micro-gravity' when they're on a rollercoaster - aka weightless balls when in freefall.

This is the first I've ever heard of it and I'm almost 30. Makes me wonder if there are other 'little' things women wouldn't know? "

"When you go ""out for a drink"" with a girl for the first time, do you expect it to end in sex/something sexual?


I'm pretty new to actually going on ""dates"" with girls. I recently moved to a new city and I've gone out with about 4-5 girls now ""for a drink"" (met them all on Tinder) and every time the night has ended with the girl in my bed/me in the girls bed one way or another. Doesn't always end in sex but at least some sexual act usually. 

I don't really push for it, I'm not an overly aggressive guy or anything like that. It's mostly been the girl saying something like ""lets go watch Netflix."" Am I just getting lucky? Is it just a matter of the girls who I'm taking out are like this and it won't usually be the case? 

What are your guys' experience with the ""going out for a drink"" date, is it really just code for ""if we have a little bit of chemistry let's fuck?"""

"Do you ever have intrusive thoughts? What are they?


For those who aren't aware, ""an intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought, image, or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession, is upsetting or distressing, and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate."" Also, ""intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and generally have aggressive, sexual, or blasphemous themes."""
