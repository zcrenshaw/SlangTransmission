"How do I get rid of my girlfriends expectation to Skype with me literally every night when I go to sleep?


She's gotten into this habit over the last year where she Skypes me when she's trying to fall asleep and it has become an *every single night* thing. I don't wanna be a dick and tell her to go fall asleep on her own, because she'll just cry for 3 hours straight and take even longer to sleep.

I like to play video games and unwind at night, especially with friends. Literally the only time I can play games and talk to friends is at night. I'm growing more and more distant to my friends now because she takes up this time that I'd normally be spending with them.

I've already tried talking to her about this several times, and she'll say she's sorry, and then proceed to start asking me if I want to skype, rather than assuming it, and if I say no, I get the cold shoulder the next day, so I end up saying yes every once and awhile and boom we're back into the cycle where it's expected again.

Update: Alrighty, it's pretty concretely decided that I should end this relationship, I totally agree. Now the logistics of *how* I should do that, are my main concern. She gets out of work in about 2 hours (I think?) and I am supposed to be picking her up and we're going to dinner because she has coupons for it. 

Should I break it to her when I pick her up? Simply tell her when I pick her up and leave, or should I offer to take her out for some closure?

Should I wait till the night is over to do it? If I do that, she's gonna expect sex, and I am not about to do that with her with this on my mind, that's just wrong. She will wonder what is up, and probably immediately resort to crying. 

I could also be a dick and do it over the phone.

Any suggestions?

Update 2: Go figure, she had a co-worker walk out and quit mid-shift, so they asked her to stay until close. 

As a result, I ended up not seeing her, but I straight up told her I was gonna play games with friends and I might go to bed early. She whined for a few minutes but I stood my ground and she said ""alright"" and we proceded to not talk for the rest of the night besides saying good night.

Now I don't know what to do, because she actually respected my space for once. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel, or is this just another false positive?

I will be seeing her at 2 today regardless because we have an event at college we're both required to be at."
"How can I politely tell a guy I work with that I don’t want to socialise with him outside of work?


I work in a small company with a small group of guys. There’s one guy in particular who I had a fairly major falling out with a while back, and it completely changed my view of him. 
We’ve got passed it and we are civil and friendly at work and the peace is kept.
Before all this we hung out occasionally but now I have absolutely no desire to see him when I don’t have to be around him, but I don’t think he sees an issue.
It’s been brewing for a while that he wants to get together and I’m dreading the day it comes up because I don’t know how to politely say;
“You’re a terrible person and I don’t want to be near you unless I am actually being paid to be.”

Anyone had a similar situation?

EDIT: after reading the comments, I feel like I need to clarify.
I am also a man. This guy is just a knob."

"Men, If a woman was to ask you on a date, how would you prefer she do so?


I’m 21, but I’ve actually never liked a guy in my entire life. This is a serious case of firsts for me. All of my male friends say to just ask him out for coffee (I already know he’s a coffee snob) but not to offer to pay. I want to offer to pay since it’s me asking him, and so he knows I’m not trying to use him? But I don’t even know him too well, we only have astrophysics together. Need some realistic advice here.  "
"MOD POST: NO PERSONAL ATTACKS OR HARASSMENT


Sup douchenozzles (yeah you earned it this time),

So recently it has come to our attention that a user has been getting PMs and a ton of harassment even resulting in posts on this sub or others.  I just wanted to take the opportunity to remind all of you that doing this will get you banned sitewide. Personal attacks in the sub are not permitted in this sub, and if we find out they got taken to PM, they'll result in a site wide ban. 

Furthermore, I'd like to remind all of you salty little turd nuggets that if you have a problem with the way any moderator of acting, please message the mod mail. Making passive aggressive posts about ""muh free speech"" will just be removed and then we'll have a short internal discussion about your future on the sub (I say short because spending any amount of time on the losers who do this is honestly more cycles than are required). 

Oh yeah and if any of you salty peanuts decide that you want to go whine in other subs to try and earn sympathy for acting like idiots, just be aware that we know you're doing it and we'll find out.

Lastly, I wanted to point out the cognitive dissonance in users who simultaneously complain about a bad love life while harassing women on the internet with dick pics and other things. If you can't realize that the reason you don't have a partner is due to your hideous personality and behavior then I'm personally glad you don't have the chance to reproduce.

Have a nice day,

The mods"
"Fellow ugly men of reddit, how did you come to term with your ugliness?


Basically as the question asks, how do you come to terms with something that you can't change? It pisses me off that people will treat me differently because of something I can't control. I work out regularly, I do everything in my power to come off as presentable, but there's no way I can change my face which seems to be the issue. I live with a roommate who's a good looking dude, and he knows it. He will treat women like complete shit, even going as far as telling several girls that he's a ""fuck boy."" Yet they still go crazy for him. I know that being ugly is something that's apart of life, but it's bullshit how something someone has no control over can dictate how the world treats them. "
"How do I call off this date?


So I have a classmate who I like. We're friends but I have been making a move on her for the past 2 months. We already went on a first date (which went well).

 After a few days I asked her out again through text. She said she'll try to go which I do not doubt. I told her to give an update. 

However the next day (at school) she barely said a word to me, did not even mention our arrangement. She even gave a fake laugh when I told her a joke ( a one ""heh"" laugh ). She told me she was that way because she has a headache yet has no trouble talking with other people at all. She doesn't seem interested. 

I wanna call it off to save everyone the trouble and money but how do I tell her and make it clear it's not happening again. I don't want to be a dick and ghost her.







Edit: Thanks for the answers everyone! After reading lots of replies saying I should just talk to her, I've come to the conclusion that I will talk to her like a fucking human being. I'll see if I can still get the date. Hopefully it works out."
"What is the biggest coincidence you've experienced?


Mine was when I changed to a new bank a few years ago. When my new bank sent me the automatically-generated PIN for my new cash card, it was the same as that for my old, totally unaffiliated bank. Which I had chosen myself as it was the registration number of my car. I reckon that to be a 1 in 9999 chance."

"Fiance finds my lack of friends disturbing. How do I correct that?


I'm currently 31, and had a lot of friends drop off in my 20s. I have a few that are around, but as have their own lives and, while if I need to hang out or talk they are there, we have conflicting schedules so can't make it a regular thing. I'll admit, I work irregular hours and have a daughter as well that I get frequently. 

Any suggestions how to meet new people in this day and age while everybody is so busy with life? "

"Men of Reddit, do you go out to bars and clubs alone and if so, how do you not appear creepy?


I’m about to be 21, but I have no friends to celebrate with, so I’m contemplating going out alone. I consider myself to be a decent looking guy, slightly below average height, and I’m willing to converse with almost anyone. But I fear if I go out alone, I’ll look weird and awkward and people will try and avoid me. Wondering how many of you do go out alone and still manage to have a good time. Thanks in advance! 


edit: I used the word creepy to summarize being awkward and weird. It was a bad word choice"

"How to buy girlfriend engagement ring without her knowing?


We've been together for a while and we have a bank account together as well as a kid. Trying to find out a way to buy an engagement ring without her knowing lol. Do jewelers do anything like this to where you don't have to pay and they like put a card on file or something until she is given the ring?

&amp;nbsp;

edit: Not sure why i got any down votes, but thanks for all of the good tips fellow men of Reddit. Looks like I will most likely just either put it all on a credit card or strike up a deal with a jeweler then pay everything off right after the proposal."
