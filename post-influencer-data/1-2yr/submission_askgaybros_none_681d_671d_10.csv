My favorite part: they must have seen gay tourists fucking and been corrupted by their ways"
"PSA - Bi guys aren't secretly gay, not being greedy, not lying to themselves and not going to come out as gay in a few years.


The amount of shit I hear from gay guys is unreal. If one more person thinks they can ""cure"" my bisexuality i'm going to bite their dick off."
"Danica Roem has become the first open Transgender women elected and seated in a state legislature!


Best part is, is that she beat out a homophobe who had tried to create anti-transgender bathroom laws last year!"
"Does anyone find it gay to make friends hard?

"Straight new co-worker upset after I burst his ""Don't flirt with me"" bubble


Last Wednesday we were called to a meeting with new members of the department (they were from another area but they were reassigned to our department for reasons nobody seems to understand)

This guy was assigned to our area so once the meeting ended he started talking to us, just as expected. He's married with kids and uses a very misogynistic language, nothing strange from Mexican culture.

Everything was going relatively normal until our female coworkers went to the bathroom together
Then he told us how ""the Blondie one was a fuckable bimbo"" my coworkers zigzagged around the topic because she's a very respected member of the team but they didn't deny his words either.

I was trying to ignore all the chatting because as I said in other occasion I find socialization really stressing but when he noticed I ignored the question he approached me holding me by the shoulder and asked me ""What's wrong kiddo, do you like the Blondie or what?""

I had to quit his hand of my shoulder as I remained silent and he reacted as I was insulting him. One of the guys told him that: ""he is just like that, he doesn't like to be touched"" but then the guy shouted: ""then how are you gonna fuck the bitches if you don't want to get touched"" the same coworker told him that I was gay so I'm not interested in women at all.

After that he started to say how much he respected it but he wasn't OK with it, that he thinks gods created woman to please men and men should be thankful for that... Stuff that we hear a lot from straight people, nothing new. Then he dropped the bomb,
""I can respect you with no problem if you don't hit on me, don't flirt with me I love women"" the only thing that came from my mouth was:
 ""Do you really  think you're all that?, please check yourself on a mirror before opening your mouth""

The guy left the place while looking really upset, some time passed I was called to HR by my boss to explain the situation and why I ""Insulted"" him. 

HR guys understood the situation and I was free of any kind of penalty.

Now, our department is getting a talk on ""sexual harassment in workplaces and LGBT+ personal""
The problem my boss is putting on me it's that this guy is gonna work with us and he's afraid that we didn't get along or that our differences mess with our responsibilities.

TL:DR straight get upset because I told him he isn't attractive to me and accused me of ""insulting him"" now we're gonna work in the same area and my boss is worried that things get ugly


Have you found yourselves in a situation like this?
How you deal with it?"
"I had my first kiss last night!


['Part one' found here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/79tev6/im_going_on_my_first_date_on_thursday/)

(With a guy at least.)

It was a bit awkward, at least on my end, but I didn't expect it not to be. I dropped him off at his house at the end of our second date, which went super well, and walked him to his front door. We kind of stood there saying we had a really good time and the like, and honestly stopped making sense because I think we were just talking because we were nervous. But I went for it! And it was great. I think I weirdly hugged him afterwards, but it was still so cute. I told him afterwards he was my first kiss and he was super sweet about it. We're also definitely going to hang out again.

I don't know, being 20, it's such a cool feeling to finally do something actually *gay* when it's been such a part of my identity, it's weirdly validating. And it's kind of fun to do the whole 'kiss in front of his front door' thing at this age, like I can appreciate it more. But regardless, I'm glad we did it! I don't really have any gay friends to share this with so I thought I'd tell y'all. "
"Help! I don’t want to fuck my straight best friend!!


Why do I simply enjoy his company and friendship? Whenever I see him shirtless or I’m drunk I think to myself, “wow I’m so glad to have someone here for me who I can trust and confide in.”

Sometimes he even drops hints that I’m an important person in his life. To make matters worse we share a bathroom and respect each other’s space!

I’m looking for fun and creative ways to destroy and corrupt our friendship from the inside. Any suggestions?

EDIT: holy shit. "
"What's the most outrageous claim you've heard about being gay?


Share an absurdly false claim you've heard about gay men or what it's like about being gay.
 
For me, my mom has told me this one time that gay men have to wear adult diapers, because the penetration they receive from anal sex is too rough making the sphincter give out and... you can assume the rest. 

That lie was so *Disgusting and atrocious...*"
"A dad shoots his 14 year old son because he would rather have a dead son than a gay son


http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhZwz8TJHW3p6c3493

This is complete trash. How is the son possibly being gay affecting the father. 

Thoughts?

"Turns out the walls in this apartment are really thin and my roommate knows I'm gay


Not only that, he must have heard every conversation I've had with my gay friends from buying dildos and enemas to fucking guys and stupid jokes that won't really make sense without context. My annoying laugh, and all my many many rants about stupid shit from getting fucked really hard to complaining about guys on grindr. And all kinds of other awkward and embarrassing things and references from... drag race

When we see each other we're always like "" what's up, hows it going"" but deep down he's probably thinking how much I suck cock and talk about Nicki Minaj on the phone 

What do I Do? I don't feel like even getting out of bed tbh"
"Where do you go for porn?

"Today, I Got Raped.


First of all I want to start off by stating that I am very aware that I will get criticised for this post, the title, my choice of words, my decision to post this under a new account, consciously choosing my real name, the length of this text, and many other things. I have been debating all day whether to talk about this online or if it os a waste of time and the truth is that I don't care about the reaction, I just need to get this out of my chest. 

I am Harry. I am 23 years of age. I was born in a very conservative, picture perfect family. My mum is a fashion designer, my dad a CEO. I grew up having everything that I wanted and needed and so much more. I grew up in private boarding school, gated communities and got chauffeured everywhere I needed to be. I grew up in an environment where bad things aren't supposed to happen to you. 

I officially came out at age 21. I was in college and for the first two and a half years I was still debating internally on who I was and what I wanted. 
It can be very hard finding yourself at that age, specially as a gay kid who is figuring out what you want in life. Throw being shy and insecure about your body into the mix, and you can get dangerously addicted to other people's approval. I grew up as a gay person surrounded by wrong ideals of what a gay man should look like and those gay, older men knew exactly how to make me feel to get whatever they wanted out of me. 

I was always very reserved and conservative, so that had always ended in heartbreak only. God truly must love me because he has kept me from so many situations. 

After all the heartbreak in my life, I had a little ""screw it"" moment when I turned 23 earlier this year. A friend convinced me to download a dating app and the very same day I had a very nice date with a guy two years my senior. He was very sweet, we had a nice meal and then we walked for a bit. He asked me to his apartment, I naively agreed, he expected sex and I said no, so he hit me and kicked me out. 

I felt bad, deleted the dating app and swore off men for a bit. I never told anyone. 

Then, all of the sudden, as it usual happens, I meet an amazing guy. He's everything I ever wanted and more, everything is going great, I love him, he loved me, he's slowly becoming not only my soulmate but also my best friend and then he gets his dream job and I get mine. I have to move to Berlin, he has to go to NYC. 
We decided that we couldn't make it work, he flies out with me to Berlin, helps me move in, keeps me company while I start getting settled into my new job and then we take a trip together which ended last night. 

We said goodbye at the airport and this morning I was surprisingly upbeat. I was bored at work so I figured I might download the dating app again to try and keep my mind from thinking about him. 

Once again, I match with a guy within seconds, he's nice, he's close, he asks me if I would want to get lunch with him. I agree, we meet outside his office building. 
He tells me he forgot his wallet and that he has to go back to his office to get it. He tells me to come in because it's cold. I naively agree. 
He closes his office door, takes out his penis. I am in shock. He asks me to take it in my mouth. I say I don't want to. He grabs my head forcefully, puts it inside and I try to pull it away. Until I don't. I went from pushing his legs away to just closing my eyes and trying to breath. He inserts it really furiously in me until I am crying and he ejaculates inside me. All I remember is feeling it dripping down me and me wanting to vomit. He pulls his pants up, says ""that was hot, baby"", kisses me on the forehead and leaves. I couldn't get up. 

I walked out feeling like the biggest slut in the universe. I was glad there wasn't no one there in the office and thought I was safe. Until I walked out on the street and felt everyone judging me. I wanted to cry, to puke but I had to go back to my office. 

""How was lunch?"" I have never had a harder time faking a smile. I brushed my teeth and went talking about interior design for three hours like nothing had happened. Except my eyes looked dead. And I felt dirty. I could still smell him and, after multiple showers, still can. I can feel my stomach closed up. Like I have a giant web inside me. 

I can't eat, I can't drink. I still can feel him inside me. I can still feel his hand on my head and his kiss on my forehead. 

After faking it for hours and pretending to be ok, I decided to just move on and never tell anyone. Until I read about Kevin Spacey. And it made me feel guilty. Like I was trying to cover up for the guy who hurt me today instead of supporting people who have had the courage to speak out about abusers. 

I am crying as I am writing this. I don't know what to do. I'm scared of how people are going to react, if I chose the right words. If the purpose of this was clear. 
I don't know if I am going to be able to wake up tomorrow and feel normal again. If I will always have this sensation in my mouth, my stomach. If I will ever see him again. If he will even remember me in a week. 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this. "
