"Introducing... AssCredit!


Hello everyone!

We have some very exciting news! AskReddit has always been an amazing community for people to share their experiences, opinions, and knowledge with the rest of the world. We decided that it would be a fun idea to organize some of the best threads from our 10 years as a community on a website to make it easier for you to enjoy.

So, we would like to introduce you to [AssCredit](https://www.asscredit.com) We want this website to serve as a sort of hub for some of the best that AskReddit has had to offer. For those of you wondering, the name comes from [a little Easter Egg](https://i.imgur.com/lbalVah.png) that has been hidden in our CSS for years.

We have started out with a few categories, however, we would really appreciate suggestions from the community for new ones. So, if you have any ideas for a category or for a thread to be featured in the existing ones that we haven't included, please let us know!

For now, please enjoy browsing what we currently have and have a great rest of the weekend!
