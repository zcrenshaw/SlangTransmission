"How does someone recover after accidentally insulting their boyfriend’s penis?


For the record, I’m an adult woman with a naive understanding of the male anatomy, and I’m very glad my boyfriend doesn’t know my Reddit username. 

So, after sex, we usually talk about how great and enjoyable was, as many couples tend to do. However, I made an observation about the curvature of his member. 

“Yes, it’s always been like that, Kerfluffle2x4. It’s not a bad thing though.”  
“No, I was just commenting on it. It’s not a bad thing at all! Trust me, babe, I love your dick. It’s great and gets the job done. I don’t know why I mentioned it. Forget I said it.”

Of course, now I’m getting a vibe that he’s self conscious about it. Other than sexual favors, how else could I get over this very awkward situation? I don’t want him to think I’m the back of his mind that I mentioned it for any reason other than scientific curiosity.

"Why do Americans guys use lube to masturbate? (if they in fact do)


I recently heard that using lube, or lotion, to masturbate was a thing in the US. Here in the UK it doesn't seem be as neither of my exes, and none of my male friends, have ever done it. So is it actually a normal thing in the US? Or even other parts of the world, and why is it a thing?   "

"Men, how do you deal with the ""I'm always right"" syndrome in relationships?


Recently I started taking the whole ""the woman is always right"" thing more seriously. I don't see it as a little stereotype anymore or a cute and funny part of straight relationships. But I started seeing it as one partner is having no empathy, sympathy, or care for the other partner's needs or what they want. I see a lot of selfishness in it now, and it's something that I can't imagine myself living with, even when it comes to small things. Constantly feel disrespected, and like my feelings aren't important, and my opinion is invisible even when it comes to things that directly affect me. And like I have to fight for every small, simple thing. How do you deal with it, and how extreme was it in your situation?"

"Why won’t men approach some women?


Okay, I’ve heard the whole “it’s because you’re too pretty! It’s intimidating!” bit before, but is that even a real thing?

I’ve recently started dating again and on dating apps I’m absolutely inundated with attractive men who seem great (they’re real, I’ve met many in person). But in the real world, men don’t approach me. Is there something about dating apps that make women seem more approachable? Something that women do irl that make them unapproachable?"
"Guys what do you do in a situation when you accidentally rip a huge ass fart in front of your female coworker?


I'm currently working a night shift type job and it's just her and I. Things have gotten awkward. I thought it was going to be silent but it surely was not. It happened, we got really quiet, and now we're not talking. Do I address the fart? Do I leave it alone? How do I repair this professional working relationship now? Has anyone else been in a situation like this before?"

"Formerly attractive older men of reddit, how have you dealt with the decline in your appearance?


This is a question commonly posed to women, and I'm curious what men feel about the inevitable process (for all of us).  
Whether it be weight, loss of hair, or generally just getting older, how have you coped with losing your former good looks? "

I have tried to grow a beard in the past, but I always get a few weeks in and bail. 

What are some encouraging signs of a good beard-to-be vs signs that it’s not in the cards? "

"Men of reddit, what advice can you give someone turning 20 so they don’t waste away the next 10 years?


I’m scared of the day I turn 30 and realize that I wasted the best years of my life, because they tend to pass by very quickly.

One idea I had is to make a bucketlist of fun things, and try to scratch off as many as I can."
