"What is going on in this sub?


Yesterday I read a post about the riskiness of bareback sex and it was filled with people condescendingly promoting it and downvoting people for talking about the importance of safe sex. I even got downvoted for saying people should make sure they use PrEP as directed if they are on it. 

Today I saw a post from someone reminding young guys that older men have no right to guilt or bully them into sex and people started shitting on OP for it. There was even a highly upvoted comment criticizing a hypothetical version of OP for dressing provocatively as a reason he shouldn't be allowed to complain about these things.

I know this is a diverse group of guys but I would think there would be some fundamental things we could agree upon. I just feel like everyone feels so entitled and has no sense of responsibility to their fellow man. Many do not seem to care about how unprotected sex can affect not just them but the entire gay community. And many seem to think they are entitled to sex. I love this sub but lately I feel less and less of a connection with it. I promise I'm not writing this to start shit. After the bareback thread yesterday I'm kind of burnt out on arguing. I just think we need to take a few moments to examine how our actions affect others once in a while."
"I think I died of embarrassment today - any advice?


So today I outed myself by accident to my parents in what i think is one of the worst ways outside of being caught actually having sex. A few days ago my mother bought a bluetooth speaker and I've been using it to listen to music (connected to my phone) as the sound quality is great. Today I instead decided to connect it to my desktop computer and all was going fine until i turned it off and went downstairs to charge it before returning to my room to watch some (you guessed it) hardcore gay porn.
 I was doing this through headphones pretty furiously beating my meat and then suddenly the audio disappeared, but i just kept going because I was really in the moment. A few seconds later my parents bust into my room because they'd turned the speaker on and it was blasting the audio at a very loud volume downstairs with all the windows open attracting attention from outside. I didn't even know they were at home. They came into my room to me with porn on a 21 inch screen and a dick in my hand. 
I actually fell off my chair and they just left the house and i'm still awaiting their return - in regards to me being gay i don't think there's an issue as they're very accepting etc, but does anyone have any experience of a situation like this? Do i just have to try to pretend it didn't happen or what? "
"37% of Pornhub’s viewers of gay-male porn are women. It is the top category for women over the age of 45.


This weeks' discussion topic. Comments?

Oh and here's some more:

“Straight guys” are very popular.

It was the second-most-popular category for gay-male porn in the U.S. and dominates the West, Mountain West, Kentucky, West Virginia, and New England. The first, “black,” rules the South, East Coast, and pockets of the Midwest.

The third-most-popular gay category is “bareback,” followed by “big dick,” “daddy,” “interracial,” and “twink.”

The most common search term for gay male porn is “straight first time” followed by “big black dick.” “Straight,” “straight friend,” and “straight seduced” are Nos. 4, 5, and 6.

On Father’s Day, searches for “dad” and “daddy” went up 1,361%.

Women are 46% more likely than men to search for “big dick” videos. They are 122% more likely to use the term “dick”; men are 94% more likely to search using “cock”.

"Hit on acquaintance at the gym who turned out to be straight.


A thread for those of you who love stories about asking out guys you don't know are gay. Obviously don't read wall of text if these stories bore you. Well, my instincts failed me. There's a handsome guy at my college gym who's been checking me out since last semester. Or so I thought he was. After chatting with him multiple times throughout the past several months, I finally asked for his # at the gym yesterday after a short conversation. 

""Sorry for putting you on the spot, but is it cool if I get your number?""

He hesitates, looks like he's debating with himself, then says, ""ok"". Then pauses again, looking at me inquisitively, ""Wait, why?""

""I want to get to know you better.""

""Are you... are you hitting on me?

(Half nod, small smile)

""Oh, I'm not...I'm not like that...""


I apologize, told him I was so sure, but it had nothing to with his mannerisms. He jokes that he gets confused for that a lot. I assured him that I didn't find this awkward and I'm somewhat relieved that he's straight. Now I don't have to worry about all the stress involved with impressing him if he was into me. So, he was nice about it, which I knew he would be because he's such a friendly and approachable guy.


Why I took the risk:


1)This guy was shamelessly making extended eye contact with me multiple times. The first time was in the locker room. He walks within inches of my face and smiles, looking up and down while I'm talking to my buddy.


2) He hangs out/works out with lots of girls. It's not common for good looking straight guys to hang out with unattractive girls. However, the last time we talked before yesterday I find out he's a nursing major, which explains why he has so many female friends.


3) He just plain looks happy to see me all time, versus other straight acquaintances who only notice female friends or awkwardly pretend they didn't see you. I also felt a connection with him whenever we spoke.


4)He doesn't have social media, so I couldn't find out anything about him.


5)He's non-threatening and approachable, the safest choice to ask a guy I don't know is gay out.


I'm glad I got to know him slowly and didn't hit on him in some trashy way. He started out as a crush, then I broke the ice and asked him to spot me, thinking he got the message since he keeps staring at me. Unfortunately, I'm not getting the college romance I've always wanted. I guess all the guys who are gay around my campus really are only on grindr and other apps. I just wanted to meet someone irl and know what it feels like to ""get the girl"". 

"
"Grindr is so predictable.


Hooked up with a guy. 

Had a good time. 

He invited me back over for his birthday.

Text him two days later saying happy birthday.

No reply all day.

Then he blocked me.

#*Imagine my shock*.

"Why do women treat us like pets? (rant)




Sorry for the rant, I just ended a friendship and I need to vent.

I used to have a female friend. Used to. We had a huge fight and I we won't be speaking again.

She was my best friend ever since we started school back in 2000. We got along from the moment we met until I came out.

The second after I came out to her, our relationship completely changed.

All of the sudden, I wasn't helping her with homework, or staying up late to calm her when she was hysterical, or going to her with parties because she couldn't get a date, or driving her to another city to see her sick grandfather.

Oh no. After that, I was only good for shoe shopping, going to the hairdresser, talking about nail polish shades, or if I wanted to join a cheerleading squad (I don't).

Listen lady, the fact that I'm a homosexual doesn't change who I am, my personality, my tastes, or whether now I have the power to tell you if x shoes go with y belt.

* Let's go to the mall and parade like the shops belong to us!

Lady, I have a job. I don't have time to go window shopping for hours (and not buy anything at the end of the day)

* Can you believe what x celebrity just did?

Lady, I don't care for (celebrity) gossip. I don't care what's on page 56 of Cosmo. And I definitely don't care if Mickey just broke up with Sue!

* Do you think that guy is into me or into you?

Lady… ugh. No comment.

* Which dress should I wear if I want to get laid?

Lady, I've never been into fashion. What makes you think that I know about this?

We got into an argument because I brought up all this (and many more things) and I wanted to know why she changed so much. And do you know what she said?

That I wasn't being a good gay friend to her.

A gay friend.

So all of the sudden I wasn't me anymore. I was just a bloody stereotype!

As I said, we got into a huge fight and I probably won't see her anymore.

Ugh!

My apologies. Rant over."
"If a straight person believes being gay is a choice, isn't he acknowledging he is bisexual?


I mean, if you think it is a choice, then it stands to reason that the person who believes that has to have been faced with the possibility of being with someone of the same gender and chose not to engage in it. "
"Son was being bullied for being gay


So my son was being teased at marching band today when learning drills (where you're walking, etc) and some kids started making a few rude comments towards him when the football team was walking towards the field for their practice, and it ended up getting to the point where the kids teasing him were getting aggressive and he ended up punching the kid. He got a three day suspension and I have no idea what to do. He's constantly stressed and I don't want to be too harsh, but I don't want to let it slide. What do I do?"
"Am I wrong to be offended by this?


So me and my friend, who's a straight girl are walking down the hallway and we see one of the very few out lesbian couples at our school. They're holding hands and that's it but this teacher who has already made a few homophobic jokes here and there, makes a big show of covering his eyes and acts like he's gonna throw up. So yeah I hate that teacher lol.

I told my friend I thought he was an asshole and he shouldn't be a teacher. My friend actually got offended and told me that teachers shouldn't have to watch gay students because it's not ""normal"". I got pissed because....well that is the most ignorant thing I've ever heard. I pointed out that the straight couples practically have sex in the hallways and no one seems to care. She just Scoffed and said that straight people shouldn't be exposed to gay PDA(holding hands?). I just walked away because I was about to say something that damage our friendship permanently.

Would you guys be offended by that? 


Update: she called me and apologized but said she still thinks it's unfair for religious people to have to pretend to be ok with LGBT people. I called her ignorant and said. Straight people don't have to be ok with LGBT people but they have to treat us equally. Then I told her I don't think we can be friends if she thinks like that. Tomorrow, I'm gonna report the teacher to the principal. He probably won't get in trouble because my district is a joke but I have to do something."
"To all the Gay Australians


Despite the hateful comments and campaigns going on right now from the ""No Campaign"", just remember that you are loved and valued despite what you see online or on the television, and we will eventually have equal rights within Australia. Stay strong, don't let the idiotic, barbaric views of some get you down. &lt;3 "
"Is it creepy to continue going back to a certain store because a hot guy works there?


I frequent this gas station on the edge of my town. There's this very cute, probably gorgeous, 18/19 year-old brunette farm boy who works the evening shift there. I have a younger friend who knows of this boy and went to school with him, so I was able to find him on facebook. Let's call him ""Z"". Anyway, Z is a farm boy. Probably doesn't have a lot of money. Just graduated high school, is working at his small town gas station. He hasn't left for college anywhere and probably won't. His FB doesn't have a lot of friends (like 100-and-something), so he's an undiscovered hottie. 

Z likes flowers. He posts a lot of pictures of them. He's single and is always sharing those ""relationship goals"" pics of a girl and guy hugging, so he's most likely straight. He also posts like EDM-type music, very unknown stuff. Anyway, so he works at this gas station I frequent. He's a cashier and usually cleans up during closing time. It's probably just my imagination but I catch him staring at me. One time, I was at the gas pumps filling up and he was walking towards the doors back inside. I was walking there too and he saw me, held the door open and waited for me for like 10-15 seconds until I got there. I thought that was cute. And then last night this other female worker was waiting on me, and he saw me standing there, came over ready to help and I told him I've already been helped so he seemed disappointed. He had the cutest disappointed look on his face though. He then said ""I got all ready too"" so I apologized. 

I go there all the time just to buy a soda or something hoping to see him. Am I creepy?"
