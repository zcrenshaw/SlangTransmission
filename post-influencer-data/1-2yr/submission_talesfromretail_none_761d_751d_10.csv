"My most disgusting cashier experience


This happened a few weeks ago. Over the summer before I head off to university I've been working at a grocery store to have enough money to live on. My job entails quite a few responsibilities but I'm mainly at the tills.

So I'm sitting at my till, halfway through a 10 hour shift. I'm about 15 minutes away from my break so that's pretty much all I'm thinking about. A pregnant woman walks up to the conveyor belt with a full cart of shopping. She has two young kids, one walking alongside and the younger one in the fold out seat in the cart. It's obvious that she is in a rush and has her hands full with the kids, so I offer to take the bags that she brought and pack the items as I scan them. She is very thankful but I tell her that it's no big deal.

This is where things got interesting.

She began to lift the younger child out of the seat because he was in the way of her getting the shopping. She turns him around to put him down and he proceeds to projectile vomit directly over all the shopping. I'm not talking a little bit of baby sick; more like Charlie in the limo in Always Sunny. This stuff just keeps coming, completely covering her shopping.

The woman was almost in tears, apologising as much as I think is humanly possible. I tell her that it's not her fault, after all there is no way to predict when your baby will be sick.

Now usually my team leader (pretty much my boss) would be there to help in a situation like this, but it was a very busy day and she was away dealing with something else, so I had to take charge.

Firstly I called the in-store cleaner to clean the sick from the floor and I closed down my till. Next I got a hold of my friend who was stacking shelves and got him (after some persuasion) to take the hazardous waste container that the cart had become through to the back of the store. I led the woman to some seats near the door and then asked if she had a shopping list, so I could go around and collect her shopping again. She said she couldn't let me do that, but I insisted. 

So I grabbed another cart and raced around the store completing her shopping list. I'd been working there for about 6 days a week for 3 months by then, so I knew where everything was. I got everything in about 10 minutes and was back at the checkout. I got my friend back to help me unload and pack the stuff back up. All in all it took me about 15-20 minutes from taking the list to getting all of her shopping scanned through and packed.

I went to get the woman and told her that everything was packed and ready to go, she just needed to pay. She couldn't believe it! It was great to see the relief in her face after seeing her so close to tears. She paid for her shopping and thanked me about a million times before she went on her way.

I went for my break.

Fast forward to the present day. My team leader comes up and tells me that a lady wrote a letter to her about how I had gone above and beyond the call of duty just to help her when she was stressed. My team leader told that if I ever asked her for a reference, she would just forward that letter, as it was the better than any reference she could ever give. I was just glad to make someone's day.

TL;DR Baby becomes violent vomit volcano, covers his mother's shopping. I fetch her a new cart of shopping and end up with a great reference. Be kind to everyone you meet :)"
"I got sassy.. couldn't help it


I work at a gas station and people always seem to think I'm a mind reader. 

This guy comes up to the window and just puts money in my hand and then he says:

""5.49""
Before I could even open my mouth to speak he says again,

""5.49""
This time a bit more aggressively as if to show that I should have known what to do with the money right off the bat. Keep in mind this is a busy gas station and not only do we sell gas but we also sell snacks, drinks, etc. Once again, before I can ask this tumor of a person speaks again.

""5.49??!!!! I gave you 10.49!!"" At this point I'm a little confused and quite frankly annoyed. When I notice he's about to speak again I cut him off this time and say:

""What do you want me to do with the 5.49?"" Immediately he yells out ""GASSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!"" and throws his hands up in a obviously-that's-what-I-meant-way. Before I could even stop myself I mimicked his same arm gesture and said ""was that so hard?????"" in exactly his same tone. I asked what number pump his car was on and he turned and probably realized that there were 5 other cars pumping gas as well so there was no way for me to know what he wanted and know where he was parked. After this, he seemed to calm down a bit and got really quiet but I couldn't help myself I had to keep going because I'm petty.

""I'm not a mind reader you know? I wish I was"" he didn't even respond to this. I gave him his change and he just muttered a small thank you and walked off. "
"Can't even be bothered to look in the back?


For a little context, the shop I work in is fairly small and has displays of all the items we offer, under and above those displays we have cupboards filled with the boxed up merchandise.
  A quick look around my store will show you two glass walls that look into the mall (it's a corner shop) and two cupboard-clad walls. Directly behind the till is a cupboard wall that is broken up by a closet door that stands approximately 8ft and is about half a foot wide (for our ladder), our smallest employee can just squeeze inside. 
  
  On a regular basis we have people asking us to ""check the back"" and normally we just point out there is not a back room, but today I had a customer who refused to accept it's non-existence...  after letting her know there was not a back room, she turned to her companion and ""whispered"" she's just too lazy to check"",  pretty annoyed from hearing that, I decided to open the ladder cupboard, pulled out the ladder and the little feather duster we keep in there, turned to her and politely said ""I am sorry, after checking the backroom, I can confirm we have no more"". The lady looked annoyed and told me ""you don't need to be so rude"".

I really love retail, feels good to be called lazy and rude when I was neither ðŸ˜…"
