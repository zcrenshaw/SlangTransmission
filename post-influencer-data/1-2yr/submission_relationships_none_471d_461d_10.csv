"UPDATE: Me [27F] in a relationship with [36M] for 8 YEARS. just found out he's living an entirely separate life WITH A FIANCE.


Hi, everyone. [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/563isl/me_27f_in_a_relationship_with_36m_for_8_years/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_strawberry-) was my original post. 

Clearly, it's been a wild time since this post for me. I just want to thank everyone for reaching out to me in comments, messages, and even some off-reddit contact I still have with some users! You all are gems and offered me tough advice in a time where I never thought I'd listen. 

I realize now I was completely manipulated by Ray for many years. I thought our relationship was common for two creative professionals. It **WASN'T.** 

After I made that post, Ray was ""needed"" out in California again. It was the perfect opportunity for me to pack up all my shit and leave. Once I collected my thoughts, I reached out to my long-time friend John (actually my age, now 30, who lived in Portland at the time.) He flew out to the east coast city I used to live in with fancy maple syrup, whisky, and my favorite coffee. I'll always remember this little detail. John helped me pack up everything, arranged transportation for me to fly back with him (and my cat) to live in Oregon with him, and brought me to the coast to bury a bunch of memories (photos, film reels, memory cards, etc). It was extremely cathartic. I was sober, feeling every bit of pain in that moment, but realizing it needed to happen. 

Once in Portland, Ray obviously came back to our former apartment and realized I was gone. Per John's idea, the only thing I left on the kitchen counter was my set of keys and a printed out picture of Cat with the engagement ring. I had blocked his number, but Ray continuously tried to contact me, first in fake consideration for my safety, then getting progressively angrier with me. He did not apologize a single time. He just got more threatening and said he was going to hire a private investigator to find me. John ended up hiring a lawyer for me to walk me through my legal options and spoke to the police about a restraining order, which we did file. It appears the order worked, considering Ray has not reached out to me since he was notified. 

I know some of you probably wanted me to tell Cat. I'll be honest, I never did. I'm sure she eventually found out, or maybe she didn't. I have no idea what happened with them, and I have no urge to. You were all correct; I had known some of his friends, but only professionally from working with them. He rarely took me out to social events. I did know his family, though. They were always pleasantly nice to me, but they lived so far away geographically that I only saw them for very special occasions. I don't know if they knew, but I don't want to hurt myself thinking about the disrespect and secrecy of everyone. I was lied to not only by Ray, but by a group of people who I thought respected me. 

I found a therapist who helped me process a great deal of these emotions, but I am certainly not completely healed. I finally feel able to talk about this with you all 1.5 years later. It simultaneously feels like it happened just yesterday and a million years ago. Some of it feels like an extended nightmare. All I know is that I'm awake now. 

Unfortunately, I did end up getting tested and diagnosed with HPV, which has since been treated, but I definitely got it from Ray. I was arrested that night for disorderly conduct as well because I got belligerently drunk in anger. I was sentenced to anger management classes and AA meetings. I was certainly not an full-blown alcoholic, but I realized I was numbing my pain with what I thought was recreational drinking. I have been sober for a year now, just got my year chip last week!!!

Overall, this is a happy ending for me, I promise. 

I started dating John at the beginning of this year. I now understand what being in an actual loving relationship feels like. John is completely honest with me about everything, even the smallest things. He respects me and understands my past. I can't begin to verbalize how thankful I am for him and how much I appreciate him being in my life. He is my rock and was there for me since my healing process began. 

For the record, I'm the one who initiated the romantic contact. We slept in separate rooms, had sex with other people, gave each other romantic advice. But at the beginning of the year, we were both single at the same time. He was making breakfast in the kitchen before he went off to teach. In that moment, I just realized he was always my ""what-if"" guy, since knowing him in college. I wanted him, and I truly loved him. I asked him if I could kiss him, just overcome with emotion and a lost filter. He thought I was joking at first and barely looked away from his eggs. But then he was like, ""Wait, really?"" I said yes and gave him a huge hug, then he kissed me. I felt this warmth I never experienced with Ray, even at our best. It felt like something finally clicked. 

Since then, John and I have been so happy, and now I know what it's like to be with your best friend, especially someone who knows you as well as he knows me. I couldn't be happier, and for the first time, I feel valuable. 

I went back to school part-time to learn some coding and stuck with it. Now, my current job is paying for me to continue my schooling, and I've been doing some web design work for them as well. My boss is the most amazing woman I've ever met and totally supportive. 

Guys, I feel whole. I really do. But even more importantly, I feel ready to deal with anything in my future, good or bad. I've grown up in a big way, and I feel like I'm not afraid of entering my 30's. I still have a way to go dealing with an eating disorder, but I've even gained some weight! I'm proud of myself, and I'm so thankful to everyone who has helped me at all. I'm not alone anymore. 

Thank you for reading.

"(Update) My girlfriend [20/F] is refusing to let me [20/M] see her while she’s in the ICU


[Link to the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/89lly9/my_girlfriend_20f_is_refusing_to_let_me_20m_see/?st=JHUS9GM7&amp;sh=b07cf639)

A huge thanks to everyone who gave me advice and support right now. I feel guilty for not updating for a while, but things have been hard. Ultimately, I made the choice to go out and make sure that I was there if things went south. My girlfriend’s condition had been slowly worsening, and her family was sort of urging me to be there. They really helped me in getting out to be there with her, which I’m very grateful for. I got on the soonest flight I could, and headed out.

By the time I got there, her infection had just really ravaged her. She was hanging on by a thread, and we all knew it. I was able to hold her hand as she passed away, and I’m forever blessed to have had that opportunity. My girlfriend was barely conscious, and not even with us, but I hope I provided her some small comfort as she passed on. I will feel guilty for the rest of my life that I disrespected her wishes and came to her, but I’ll also be glad. She was the light of my life, and I’m so thankful I got to see her one last time before she was gone.

I knew it would be difficult, but I’ve seriously just been at my lowest lately. School has dropped down to the bottom of my priorities, and I only ever want to talk about how amazing she was. But, I’m healing slowly, and I want to live the life that she didn’t get.

Again, thank you all so much for the support and advice you gave me. I’m sure that Charlotte would’ve been thankful for it.

Tl;Dr: My girlfriend passed away, but I was lucky to spend her last moments with her."
"I (35f) made my cousin (27f) a gift to celebrate her first born child. She never thanked me and now claims someone else made the gift???


So, my cousin, I'll call her Lindsey, has been married for over 5 years to a wonderful man. His family is very religious, ours is not. Lindsey was not raised in the church, but after discovering her ""dad"" wasn't her real father when she was 13, she started attending services as a way to find peace. I often drove her to and from school/church/activities and she would often tell her friends at school that I was her mom, as her own mother put men and work ahead of her children. 

Because of this, I've always felt a close bond between us. That's why I chose to make her baby a handmade gift. I cross stitched a quote about babies along with a cross onto a decorative cloth, then displayed it in a large shadow box I thought could be used as a memory keeper as the baby grew up.

Several family members knew I was giving Lindsey a shadow box, but only one of them knew I was cross stitching something for it- my mother. Lindsey's shower was a 4 hour drop-by on a day I had a funeral to attend, so I went early and dropped off my gift, said hello, and left after an hour or so to make the funeral. I wasn't in attendance when Lindsey opened gifts.

There were plenty of pictures posted to Facebook that evening, including some of her opening my gift. It's apparent that she really loved the gift because she was crying. It made me really happy to know she cared so much for it and that was about it.

That was 4 months ago and Lindsey's daughter was born just over a month ago. We live in different states, so it took me until yesterday to be able to visit. Lindsey was nice enough, but her in-laws were very cold towards me. I shrugged it off and focused on the baby and how Lindsey was doing. I figured Lindsey's lack of being get regular self was attributed to having a newborn.

When I went into the nursery, the memory keeper I had given Lindsey was just to the side of the crib, in full display. I made a comment like, ""I'm so glad you liked the gift."" To which she responded, ""It's probably the best gift we received, definitely the most sentimental.""

Then Lindsey's mother-in-law (MIL) said, ""Yes, *MY MOTHER* made that herself. For her *FIRST* great grandchild.""

I'm sure the look on my face was one of utter confusion, but I was so taken aback that I didn't think before saying, ""No, *I* made that.""

MIL stated arguing with me and I eventually asked Lindsey when she received the gift, as clearly she could straighten the issue out. Lindsey sheepishly replied she wasn't sure and MIL got a smug look on her face. The baby was going down for a nap, so I excused myself and left the room. I gathered my things and thanked them all for their hospitality before leaving.

I'm just in shock over this and I'm not sure if it's a red flag. Lindsey is not likely to forget receiving the gift, plus there are pictures on Facebook where she opened the gift at her shower in her hometown, not the shower her in-laws threw her in their town. I thought it was odd I never received a thank you note for the gift, especially when Lindsey so clearly loved it.

I asked my mother about it and she told me that I might be mistaken and it was a different shadow box?!? I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. I know Lindsey just had a baby and we've not been as close since she went to college, married, and moved away... But she has been ""herself"" every time I've seen her up until this previous time. This is also the first time I've been around her when she was surrounded by in-laws on ""their turf"", as previous interactions with them were at the wedding and at my aunt's home.

Am I over thinking this or what?

#TL;DR: Gave cousin a sentimental baby gift and she loved it. Her mother-in-law is claiming that the gift was from grandmother-in-law and cousin is acting out of character. Could this be a red flag or am reading too much into it/need to let it go?"
"[Update] My [20F] boyfriend [24 M] of 8 months told me that he loves me doesn't know if he is in love with me. We live together.

**TL;DR: Boyfriend didn't know if he was in love with me. Turns out he was. We are engaged now and getting married next year!**"
"My [26F] boyfriend [27M] of 6 years met a girl abraod


Hi reddit, I'm devastated. Apologies for the wall of text to come.

I have been with my boyfriend Chris for 6 years now. We've been so in love this entire time, or at least I thought. We've never had an argument that has lasted for more than an hour, we communicate well and make an amazing team. I helped him through addiction and he was there for me through some of the worst times of my life. 

Recently Chris was offered a two\-week internship in Spain. We were both so excited! I was so happy for him because I knew how hard he had worked to get this. We had a trip planned to visit our potential new home state once he got back. Also, we just moved in to our first place together two days before he left. Before he left for Spain, he told my parents he was going to ask to marry me on our planned trip. I know this because I walked in on them all crying and hugging each other and my mom kept saying how happy she was for us. 

Chris leaves for Spain, everything is fine and normal for the first few days. He is the only guy in his group of 20 interns, but I trusted him and wasn't worried at all. He facetimes me with everyone, they all seem super sweet. About a week into it, I start getting suspicious. We share a google photos account, so I got a notification of some pictures that were taken. Him and this girl Bethany are cuddled up together on the couch, hugging in front of beautiful buildings, just taking extremely couple\-y photos. I don't want to seem overly jealous, but I'm very concerned, so I text him and confront him about it. He says she's just her best friend on this trip and that they're good friends. Okay, sure, whatever. Then I see that they are going on dates with eachother. Actual dinner dates. Wine and dine type of shit. Now I'm furious. I send him another very long text, telling him I understand that crushes are normal, and he's in a very romantic place with cute girls but this is very obviously crossing a line. I ask him if something's there, if he wants to date her. And he tells me, honestly yes, the thinks it ""might be worth trying out.""

Obviously I am heartbroken. I haven't eaten in days, I cry every waking moment of the day. My boss sent me home from work because I looked so sick. We JUST moved in together, he literally told my family he was going to propose once he got back. We have cats and dogs together. We've been through hell and back together. And this is what I get in return. Some girl he's known for two weeks is worth throwing away everything we've built? I feel like I'm living in a nightmare, but I can't wake up from this one. I never thought this would ever happen, I trusted him since the beginning. 

He gets home in two days and we take our trip the day following. I don't know what to do. We aren't broken up at this point, but I know it has to happen. Do I still take this trip and just go out and do stuff by myself? Because even once we break up, I still want to move out to this state, and I still want to take this time to find areas to live. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years goes to Spain for two weeks, meets a cute girl and decides to throw away everything we've built together."
"My [24 F] boyfriend [37 M] was upset by how I reacted to the idea of possibly being pregnant.


Last week, I was feeling unexpectedly sick. Just woke up at 3 AM super nauseous, and vomited. Then kept vomiting well into the day. I couldn't keep food or water down, and I eventually realized I ought to go to urgent care because I was becoming dehydrated and lightheaded.

I called my boyfriend Harry, asking him if he could drive me to the clinic, because I thought it would be unsafe to drive myself, and he came to get me. 

He asked what was wrong on the drive, and I said ""I've got no idea, maybe a stomach bug, maybe I ate something funny?""

He said ""Maybe morning sickness"" 

I joked ""Oh god no, don't say that, you're going to make me sick again.""

He asked if I was really going to be sick, and I said ""No, it was a joke.""

He started saying how it was a kinda immature joke, how shitty it was that I'd react by saying ""I'm gonna be sick"" at the idea of pregnancy, etc.

I tried to explain myself, saying we hadn't been planning on pregnancy, and having an unexpected pregnancy would actually probably make me sick from stress

He said then that it would be funny if I was actually pregnant. I was just sitting there thinking WTF at this point.

----

We got to the clinic, and the doctor gave me a pregnancy test just in case. I wasn't pregnant. I got an IV and some meds. I told Harry to go, I would be able to make my own way home on the bus after I'd gotten my fluids back up, and the nausea had subsided.

I'm super weirded out by how Harry acted in the car. I was being honest, a pregnancy at this point in my life would be devistating to my career goals, and financial and life goals, and he knows how important my career is to me.

---

Tldr - My boyfriend acted really weird when I got sick and my symptoms resembled morning sickness.,"
"GF [26/F] can't make decisions and it's destroying our [25/M] relationship of two years.


I'm at my wit's end /r/relationships. I want to salvage this relationship but am ready to just move on. This is going to be really long. 

My girlfriend and I have known each other for years and started dating two years ago. She's the kind of person who likes to think &amp; talk everything to death, but after we got together it started to verge on the absolutely bonkers. She acts like a TV character who can't make decisions, acts like every decision, no matter how minor, is the most important thing the world has ever worked on. Dinner and her future are given equal weight and both require copious therapy and mimosa sessions. 

Everything, from the most minute decision to major life changes, are an existential question that she has to mull over for eons. It requires numerous therapy sessions, drinks with her ""girl squad"" and talking about them ad nauseum. The problem is, by the time she comes to a ""decision"" it is always too late. By the time she's made a dinner decision it's like 11:30 and I decided ""fuck it!"" and got food. She got accepted to graduate school but she ""thought about it"" for so long that they rescinded her admission - she was accepted in March and submitted a reply in July. Once they told her they cancelled her admission and she'd need to reapply she was floored. I had been telling her all along she needed to consider her options and make a decision quickly. I even offered to front the deposit. 

Our sex life is a similar problem. For the first ~ year of dating she was terrified I had seen her butthole. We had sex in a single position and certain activities were curtailed so that I wouldn't see too much of her. Even after two years and things have become a little ""freer"" in the bedroom, she won't tell me what she wants. She will hint that she *wants* to tell me, but instead goes into this existential crisis mode and the end result is: she just ""can't... not yet, it's too soon. I can't say."" To be perfectly clear, it took two years to tell me she liked oral sex. Two. Full. Years. To get to that point I had to plainly state that I had seen her butt, that she needed to accept it and move on. There's obviously other things she wants to do/try but she won't say anything. It's so annoying. She brings the subject up, dances around it for 45 mins, and then drops it. 

Recently I've been ""included"" in her therapy sessions and honestly, they make ME feel like I'm crazy. GF and her therapist go around and around around on the same subject. An hour and a half can be spent talking about the fact that she couldn't make a decision on what she wanted to eat for dinner. The therapist lauds me for my ability to make such decisions. My philosophy is that dinner will happen again tomorrow and the day after and then the day after that, so if I'm not entirely satisfied with tonight's dinner, I'll try again. 

We started talking about what we want in the future and she just can't envision things beyond the next hour. Kids? A wedding? I made a mistake a while ago about saying that I wanted kids - she convened the girl squad and they got bombed on shitty wine spritzers and the broad consensus was that I was ""scary intense."" Really? Intense? I didn't demand kids now or suggest even in the near future but I would like a family. She couldn't handle the concept that sometime in the future I want kids. About a week later she apologized for getting upset when I said I want kids and she said that in the future she wants a family, too but she just can't really think about it. 

I started grad school last fall and am now half way done with my MBA. I'm planning on making career advancements, working on job options and looking at where I want to land. I've been thinking about my future and the gnawing question is whether I want to continue with this relationship. More and more it's clear that we'll need to relocate for our careers but I'm not sure I have the strength to go through 12 months of existential crises, crying, fighting and anxiety. I'm worn-out and a lifetime of this is scaring me. 

I've tried talking to her directly and asking if she should find another therapist to help with this but she thinks she's getting better. She's not, she's getting worse. Her therapist is a $125/hour friend who indulges her issues. I'm not sure what to do, all I know is that I'm emotionally worn-out. 

---

tl;dr Girlfriend of two years turns every minor decision into an existential crisis and every major decision is paralyzing. After two years, and anticipating major changes in the next 12 months, I'm not sure I have the strength left to fight for the relationship. Really considering just walking away. "
"Would it be rude to univite my (f23) gf (f23) from family camping trip?


My gf and I have been seeing other for 9 months, dating for almost 6 months. She is going to be moving away by the end of next month probably (depending on some stuff), and decided she doesn't want to pursue a long distance relationship with me but still be ""close"". I understand why she doesn't want to be in a LDR, it really hurts my feelings, but I accept it mostly.

However my dad is coming into town in a couple weeks, and we'll be going camping for a few days. He's been planning this trip since last year. I don't see my dad often, once a year, but he's very important to me. I don't typically like to bring a lot of people around him either. He is a loner, and also he's a bit insensitive so it's been hard to have him around my friends in the past. Also, this would be the first time Ive brought a gf around him. Also He's not against me being a lesbian totally, he's just weird about it. Basically, its a big relationship step for me to have someone meet my dad.

Ive been thinking on it, and I'm not sure if I should have my gf come now. I had already invited her and she seems excited to come along. I just don't see a point in having her meet my Dad and having her come now on the trip now since she doesn't want to continue a relationship with me later.  Am I just in my feelings? 

 **TL;DR**

GF and I are temporarily together. I invited her to go camping with my family and meet my Dad but now I'm not sure if she should come. Would it be wrong to uninvite her? Am I just being dramatic?"
"My (17f) moms (55f) boyfriend (43m) of 5 years just started crying because I won’t call him dad. He and my mom break up every week so I’ve always thought why bother but should I just to get him to shut up?


So yeah, child of ugly divorce and stupid parents here. And yeah I’m so out of here when I turn 18 it will make thier heads spin so don’t need that advice, but yeah...

So my mom had been with Marc for five years. He’s a total creep on most days and on the others he’s just annoying as hell. I spend most of my time just avoiding him. The deal is my mom and Marc fight all the time and break up to include angry packing of suit cases ALL THE TIME. I don’t even panic like I used to anymore it’s so common. So one top of feeling no fatherly connection with Marc, he or my mom have never acted like this is a long term thing even though they’ve been with for 5 years.

Oh yeah Marc is like the most psych medicated freak you can ever imagine so he has CRAZY mood swings depending on when the uppers and downs hit.

My car was in the shop so Marc was driving me to pick it up and I admit I was being pretty shifty to him because I kept saying things like “ok Marccccccc.” Where I’d really emphasize the hard C in his name. Then he said “I don’t see why you won’t call me Dad, I’ve been around long enough.” I said I just didn’t know and clearly indicated I didn’t want to talk. Then he just started balling and saying that neither me or mom respect him and me not calling him Dad is just an example and I mean BALLING with tears down his face. We got to the car place and I bailed so fast but Marc ended up coming in with me and sat with me as they finished up doing my car kind of sniffling still trying to connect with me. I paid for my car and awkwardly left Marc but I actually felt bad for him.

Should I just call him dad for like the next 5 months until I turn 18 and either get a job, go to school or sell my body for dollar bills on stage? (Just kidding...should I just call him dad?)

**tl;dr: should I call my moms boyfriend or five years Dad because I feel sorry for him? I feel no fatherly affection towards him at all and am bailing in 5 months when I turn 18 anyways son it would just be a short time.**"
"Everyone is expecting things from me [25f] parents want financial support meanwhile bf wants to quit his job and twiddle his thumbs


Where do I start ? 

My parents migrated here when I was 12. I think my childhood ended right around that time. 


I went through a lot in a short period of time but to cut a long story short my parents decided they wanted me to have a larger ""support"" and family by having 4 more kids after we migrated. 


But the problem was it was complicated pregnancies that were back to back. I was either at the hospital with mom after schools trying to interpret a language I could barely speak or I was at home looking after young babies cause mum was pregnant again and needed to be hospitalised several times through her pregnancy.


It sounds horrible but I hated her pregnancies. I constantly prayed she wouldn't fall pregnant again as a kid. I wished she didn't have kids so much but she kept having another. 



Don't get me wrong I love my siblings now but I was a teenager looking after 3 young kids while mom was pregnant with the 4th. I had to cook and clean for them. I had to change their nappies. Make them sleep. Etc while Learning a new language and going through exams because that was expected. 



I made it through in one peace and I actually do feel like I have 4 kids now. The kids are closer to me then they are to my mother. 



I managed to get full scholarships to uni, did really well and I have a nice job atm. I take home over 6 figures


I dont mind helping the kids with what ever they need. Anything they need for school I get it for them.


I didn't mind this as my dads pension is their only income atm. Dad stopped working after being diagnosed with a metastasized cancer. The treatment went well but he decided to just not go back to work.


The other day he was telling me that he regretted quiting his job but then he said that he felt he didn't need to since he knows the kids have me to support them and that this was what family was all about.


I dont know why but this rubbed me the wrong way.


Why were they building this large family and basing it on me ?!! I was somehow expected to do well enough to take care of them. Why ? It's so not fair. 


I didn't even have a childhood because of their decisions and yet he was making it sound like it was all done for my benefit. They migrated so that I could have a better education and that id be away from the war thay was occurring in our home country, they had more kids cause they didn't want me to be alone bla bla bla.


I know they sacrificed a lot and I'm trying to be grateful but I worked and put myself through uni. I had to work hard to get scholarships because they didn't have much money for themselves let alone me. As soon as I had extra I was giving it to the kids. They made me have 4 kids when i was a child myself. Yes the circumstances were the issue. Mom was hospitalised every second week, dad had to work to support us. They didnt have anyone in this country to help them out. I was it. 


So it's unfair to be mad at them ? Especially since I wouldn't give up any of my siblings for anything now. But I'm still hurt. 


Im currently giving my mother 20k/year to help with the kids expenses and that doesn't include the things I buy separately e.g. presents/phone/school books/laptops/school shoes/orthothics/ graphics calculator (a recent expense for the oldest 2). The list goes on. Plus I like to take the kids out cause if I dont they're stuck home. So that again costs a tone for 4 kids. 


I want them to have all of the things I didn't have and I'm so happy to do it and I'm not upset with the kids at all. But my parents.. I just, I dont know. They chose my life and I can't change it. Not without giving up on the kids which I Absulately won't. I have no idea how long dad has as the cancer is now in his brain. He had the kids beforw he was diagnosed but again I feel like he ruined these kids lives. They have to go through this so young because of him. I can't handle it and I'm a full grown adult whos trying to hate him but I'm not ready for that either.



Now on to my dear bf Mike. We've been together for 4 years and he lacks compassion and sometimes I think humanity but he has mild aspergers so I'm being quite harsh(kind of). He thinks I'm a moron for supporting the kids and that I should be using my money to live my life.

He hates his job becuase it involves interacting with people and wants to quit to stay at home. He thinks I earn enough to support us both comfortably. Thus he wants to stay home for a year and invest his savings.


Sure I can but I don't want another person to look after. I just dont want it. I use to want kids but I don't think I even want my own kids anymore because I don't think I can give them the best with the other 4. I love kids in general so who knows maybe ill adopt one day if I feel like the other 4 are grown enough. But either way I dont want to be responsible for my partner. 



If he was laid off work for what ever reason, I'd support him no questions, if he wanted to go back to school, I'd again support him in fact Ive offered for him to to back and do that but nope. He doesnt want it. He wants some get rich quick thing which won't happen.


Instead he wants me to stop supporting my family and support him instead. 


I wish I didn't have to support anyone and I dont even know how i got into this but I can't change it and I dont want an additional responsibility ontop.


We agreed to not talk about the money I ""give away"" since we always pay for things  fairly (if anything I pay a larger share 60-40) and i still have a large chunk left for savings but I don't know if this is just going to cause issues with Mike later on. 


For backgroun - Mike is earning 90k himself so although it's not as much as me its still a very good income. But Mike does splurge on finer things where as I'm more frugal and smart with my money

Id really appreciate some tips on how to balance mike and the kids and also not let resentment build 



Tl;Dr: forced into being mummy for young kids. I'll have to look after them financially by the looks of it because of parents irresponsible decisions. I feel like I can't blame anyone yet I want to be able to.

Bf isn't okay with the setup as he thinks if I didn't do it he could quit his job "
"My [27F] Husband [28M] is addicted to porn and has 0 interest in me. I've been supportive, but reached breaking point. What next step to care for my own mental well-being?


I don’t have to explain porn addiction.

""The situation"" is me venting, you can skip that to get to my actual question. Thank you!

#The Situation

At first I was patient, comforted him that it’d be okay. It was good he was aware of it, don’t be so ashamed of it. I think at that point he was procrastinating with porn? I’m not sure where the line is to call it addiction… I gave tips on self-forgiveness and preventing it from getting worse. My focus was 100% on being non-judgemental and encouraging. 

I didn’t mind that he was disinterested in sex or affection. Lower libido, not related to porn, right?

It got worse. 

I started feeling really starved of affection, so I focused on that. Made a lot of advances on him all day long. Aggressive advances and just small gestures of love, like rubbing his shoulders or kissing his head. I didn’t get rejected… I didn’t even get ignored. I just didn’t get noticed. Mentioned it in couple’s counseling. It doesn’t have to be sex, but I’d like it if you reciprocate me kissing you etc. He tried. Awkwardly. The disinterest was painful to see. It was so obvious he was forcing himself.

I asked for things. Can you do this or that? Can we have shower sex? I scheduled sex together with him. Tuesday evening. Tonight. It didn’t happen. I combined the planning with seducing him - getting us out of the door for a date, dressing up in exactly what he’d like, sending naughty pictures and messages to prepare… No matter how physical the advance, like naked and rubbing oil on his genitals, it wouldn't get a rise out of him

I've bought gifts for him and left notes.

My face is not the prettiest, but goddamn I have smokin’ hot body. But with the combination of lucky genes and daily hard work on myself, goddamn I know what I got now.

So I’ve tried to make my own selfies and videos - I’d spent 2-3 hours daily for a few weeks to get the best possible with self recording, so he had least could show appreciation by having me on his screen for one out of ten fap sessions or I don’t know?

I remember that I’d dress up and we’d go out and he’d be so proud. Now he’s ogling every 
woman out there.

Like if he sees a woman with long dress, he needs to fap to porn of women with long dresses. If he sees a jeans ad, he needs to go fap to butts. If there’s a blond girl around, … You get the gist.

I’ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. Not even every time… just… I want something.

I’ve encouraged more sleep and exercise, I’ve overly enthusiastically praised him for having fun with friends. He’s not depressed (yes, got checked out by a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he doesn’t want therapy anyway because he thinks everyone should fix themselves).

Eventually I outright begged him to get better (I left time between each time I asked to not overwhelm him). In person, in voice messages, in text messages. I explained how horrible I felt. 

I outright told him ""I've been feeling secondary to porn"". I'v explained exactly how I felt, how he could help by just showing some interest in me... just anything, you know?

A few days ago he said ""I still think you're attractive"" and yesterday he said ""Your selfie is nice"", but... that's all. That's all.

It’s not even about fapping, I think, he doesn’t seem horny at all if that makes sense. It’s just porn, porn, porn. He’s got things going on, a part-time job and some freelance work and he’s dropping the freelance work. He’s got plenty of friends and hobbies, so I don’t see it being a cop-out for boredom or loneliness (I think it started as procrastination and got out of hand because porn is inherently addictive?). 

I’ve begged him to find help/support. When he didn’t, I figured he didn’t know where to start, so I’ve made a document with therapy options and helplines, that he didn’t download or open. I’ve sent to porn addiction helpline to his phone so he could just tap it to call. 

#I'm giving up, what now? 

I seriously can deal with not having sex. I'm a horny woman but I'm also patient and considerate. It’s this horrible feeling of being unwanted, absolutely unwanted, by the only man I want to be desired by. I feel so crushed. I rocked this situation like a champ but the past three weeks it’s finally become too much for me. Now I feel devastated, alone, I’m crying so much.

So… I’ve tried everything. I give up. What now? I’m not ready to divorce, but I wonder if a separation would be good? Not to shake him awake, but for my sake… not being around him, not being confronted with him prioritizing porn over me or our marriage. Would that help? Because moving out would also rub it in my face how bad it has gotten. I’m also not sure what a timeline would be before divorce happens. Do I wait one year? One year till what, effort to get better or being addiction-free? 

**I want to shift priority from being supportive of him to being supportive of me.** What do I do? I'm in therapy, but we're discussing work anxiety (I work from home &amp; recently botched a big project, that's been rough on me). Note, my husband also can't support any other aspect of my life like work, health, general concerns.

Because it's an addiction without a doubt, I'm actually not mad at him. But it reached breaking point and I'm suffering. I cannot help him. How do I help myself? 

I need to stop thinking ""I can find *something* so I can help him"" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day. 

 I've not been wanting to talk about it with anyone, since it's waaay too personal information about my husband, that would be a breach of trust.

I'm gonna repeat this for emphasis; I do not want to divorce yet. I will consider other drastic steps like moving out. Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. I've bought donuts for myself, lol, but that didn't make me feel better. They were yummy though!

**TL;DR** So yeah, while half of the post is about being affection-starved, my actual question is: ""What do I do for self-care, when feeling devastated that my husband isn't there for me?"". "
"UPDATE: My (30F) friend (31F) hasn't lived a full adult life and is getting reliant on me in overcoming this. I don't want to do this for her.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8mgzve/my_30f_friend_31f_hasnt_lived_a_full_adult_life/

Thanks everyone for your responses, they were very enlightening and helped me process a lot of what I had to do. Unfortunately I lost my temper with Cath and I could have handled it better, but I did manage to use most of everyone’s advice.

Cath was texting me like I was what one commenter called an “emotional garbage dump”, about how she felt old and how younger people around her had so much more to offer. This was a great opportunity for me to put in practice everyone’s suggestions about diverting her etc.,and I did this very diligently. Predictably she called me out on it and said I must be mad because she had been such a burden, and that she would leave me alone and stop bothering me with her problems since she was such a chore.

I laid down the speech suggested in the comments about how I really did care, but couldn’t be her therapist and that this would help her make her own decisions. She then said that she agreed she had been wallowing, that she had wasted all these years and that she had not done enough to help herself, that she was old and a waste, didn't blame me for not wanting to help, etc etc.

At this I lost my temper (sorry!) and said that this was an example of unhealthy self-talk that I shouldn’t have to fix for her. Cath said that at the very least I could respond with advice when she asked for it, instead of ignoring her this way. I responded that there was no point giving her advice because she doesn’t follow it, especially regarding the last guy she fell for.  

Since we were having it out, I also said I felt uncomfortable that she lied to me about her interest in him and misappropriated things I had said to apply to her pursuit of him, e.g. she asked me about my relationships with my male friends or boyfriend, and applied what I said out of context to pursuing the guy she liked, without me ever knowing she was interested in him. 

I  reminded her that I had said all this to her twice before without her ever responding to it, and that I had also told her I didn’t like the fact that she had been routinely canceling on me to supposedly study with him, when actually she had been canceling on me to pursue him.

In Cath’s view, she kept all this from me because she didn’t like being teased about a friend of mine who had expressed interest in her. She responded to all this by saying that she was sorry I felt that way, but that the guy she had liked was closest to her in her post-grad class so he was important. She then went on to say she was tired and could we wrap this up as she had had class from 8am that day. (I’m not leaving anything out from her responses - this is everything she had to say in response to me.)

This really angered me - I cut short the conversation and pointed out to her that when she had called me crying at midnight the previous week, I had worked a 15-hour day that started at 7am and was ill, and yet I heard her out even though her issues were unrelated to me. In contrast, when were were having a discussion about our friendship, she couldn’t be bothered to listen. I wished her the best and blocked her.

I think the time out is good and also that everyone was right in their own way. Cath is emotionally under-developed, can be kind, can be entitled, but isn’t going to change until she gets professional help. And like everyone said, being on her own is really the  best thing for her, because she has to make her own decisions. it’s the best thing for me too, because I think she’s behaved in a very selfish and at times, dishonest manner. Our other friends are unsurprised by this (they've cut off contact with her long ago).

I’m sorry to everyone that I lost my temper with her - I wish I could just have kept on with your advice and maybe she would have taken the hint at some point. But I do think I’ve gotten an assessment of my value to Cath. As sad and hurt as I am that I’ve lost an old and dear friend, I really hope this is right for both of us. 

TL;DR: Tried to put in place everyone’s advice, but then lost my temper, realized friend doesn’t really care, and ended the friendship."
"UPDATE: My [31F] BF [38M] of four years broke up with me in a tough (crazy?) way, and I will need to see him tomorrow. Help?


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8n3v3f/my_31f_bf_38m_of_four_years_broke_up_with_me_in_a/). Basically, my BF of 4 years had dumped me via text while I was out of town, and I had to return to the house and see him in order to pick up some things. He'd lately gone through some worrying changes, and I was anxious about that interaction \(among other things\).

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Thanks so much for your support and feedback on the last post! I got back to my house on Wednesday night. I decided to have the property manager standing by when I went back to the house, and also had the police non\-emergency number ready to dial on my phone, just in case. Fortunately, I didn't end up needing either.

When I walked in, the house was a huge mess. I'm a neat person, and had left the house very clean. Now there was furniture piled in various corners, piles of papers/electronics/clothes/DVDs all over the floors and tables. You couldn't even reach the bed, and I had to move several stacks/tubs of junk just to get some clothes out of my dresser. Several moving boxes had been packed up. For some reason Charlie had taken all of the books off the shelves, rather than just taking the ones he owned, and then had stacked up all of the books he deemed ""mine"" all over the floor of my office. My houseplants were also on the floor, completely dry and dying. It was pretty hard to see my home torn apart like that.

Charlie was on the back patio, grilling. I was worried from the comments on the last post that he might be drunk, but he wasn't; in fact, I didn't see any evidence of drinking at all. He was really surprised to see me, and kind of flustered, but not \(initially\) angry. I was friendly but business\-like, and told him I'd come back to get my car, my bike, and my cat, and that I planned to crash on the couch for the night and leave in the morning. I asked him if he could give me the set of keys he had to my car as well as my own house key. \(I'd originally left it behind for the cat\-sitter.\) He looked kind of upset, and went digging through a bunch of piles. He finally gave me the car key, but couldn't find my house key and said he'd mail it to me later.

I started gathering up my mail and searching for some of the things I needed, and Charlie started to do a sort of huff around/slam doors/pointedly avoid me kind of thing, which I tried to ignore. At one point he seemed to be acting friendly; he came in and made a joke about a gift I'd given him that he'd always secretly disliked. I laughed about it and then showed him a bottle\-cap fortune I'd gotten the day he sent me the breakup texts, one that said something like, ""A change of heart will lead to a new living situation."" He did not laugh at that; instead, he got kind of sour and said he hadn't had a change of heart, that I had just been misunderstanding the relationship for a while. It felt like he was trying to draw me into an argument, so I just shrugged and said okay, and went back to work.

Charlie disappeared into the other room and then suddenly came back and announced that he was going to call an Uber and get a hotel room for the night because I ""was freaking him out."" I could tell he was getting pretty agitated at this point. I just said I'd text in the morning when I was leaving, so he'd know when he could return.

I left early the next morning with my cat. We actually have two cats, but each clearly belongs to one of us: Charlie acquired one while he was living alone, and I adopted the other this year after the death of my old cat. So I couldn't take both of them with me—which was pretty fucking heartbreaking, I'll be honest. I really love Charlie's cat. I cried pretty hard when I said goodbye to him \(I'm kind of tearing up now\), and was grateful Charlie wasn't there.

I spent all of Thursday driving back to my parents.' It was clear from the state of the house that Charlie had a huge amount of work to do, since he planned to leave on Friday.

Since then, I've texted Charlie maybe 5\-6 times about various logistical stuff \(please remember to mail me my house key, can you transfer this utility to me before the end of the month, keep an eye out for a certain important document I couldn't find as you pack up, etc.\). His replies have usually just been ""okay,"" but this afternoon he got mad, saying that he had a million things to do and that I needed to stop bothering him. I told him that I was busy, too, and was sorry he was frustrated, but pointed out that he'd set the timeline himself. He announced that he was blocking me, and told me to communicate only via email.

So that's where we're at. I do know that he left today for his dad's house. I'm still worried about the state he ultimately left the house in, especially since it was such a huge disaster Wednesday night. I don't have any way of knowing what he's packed up and decided to take with him, either. The utilities are now all in my name, and I asked him to turn off the A/C &amp; unplug the electronics before he left, but who knows. And he's still on the lease, and technically on the hook for half the rent, which he said he'd pay until I found a roommate to replace him once I get back for good—but again, who knows.

To be honest, I can't shake a bad feeling that this isn't over. But the trip is over, and I'm relieved that it went about as smoothly as it could have. Everything feels so surreal; it's almost like I haven't been able to feel heartbroken over the end of the relationship because the breakup has required so much else of me. One day at a time.

TL;DR: Nothing scary happened. Charlie was surprised and then upset, and ended up getting a hotel room for the night. I'm not out of the woods yet."
"[UPDATE] I [24F] don't feel like my SO [27M] prioritizes me because we mostly spend spontaneous time together rather than planned, intentional time. Is this a compatibility issue, or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8kupvs/i_24f_dont_feel_like_my_so_27m_prioritizes_me/)

While my original post didn’t get a ton of attention, I really appreciated everyone’s insight and advice and I thought I’d update you guys with what happened.  

Mark\* and I came up with a great compromise to do weekly date nights in addition to the spontaneous activities we usually did. It went really well for several weeks, and I truly thought we’d surpassed this little blip in what was an awesome relationship.  

However, this weekend he suddenly told me that he didn’t want to do this anymore. I was very confused, since we’d been able to communicate so well on our problems up until now and we were in a good place with everything. Our relationship seemed like it was getting more and more serious \- I'd met his parents, we'd talked about future plans, etc. Honestly I was pretty blindsided by his decision. We talked about it for days, and in short he’d been experiencing problems with anxiety and depression and couldn’t see a future with me, or with anyone. Our relationship had become “too real” and he had a gut feeling of panic and anxiety and couldn’t give our relationship what it needed and deserved. The fact that we had been actively working on our relationship and reaching good compromises was likely, counterintuitively, contributing to the problem.  

I think to an outside party it might seem like a cop\-out, but I understand why he did what he did. Our relationship has a history of this \- I’ve always known about his commitment anxiety and I’ve always patiently worked through it with him since I knew how well we worked together. He’s “broken up” with me once before, but we stayed in frequent contact and continued have sex exclusively. That time, the break\-up didn't feel real \- we still talked and nothing really changed between us except the technicality of being a couple. I knew then that the problem wasn't with his feelings about me, but something nebulous and scary as a result of anxiety issues on his side. This time felt pretty similar to me. We had made plans to see each other again and continue hanging out just a few days after the initial “break\-up.” In fact, the night he told me he wanted to stop doing this, he broke down, questioning why he couldn’t be happy with me, and wondering if he could be happy at all if not with me. I comforted him, and we wound up having sex and he slept at my place.  

I processed all of that for about two days, since we needed to meet for unrelated reasons two days later. Over lunch, I realized that I really, really wanted to continue spending time with him and support him through his issues, but that I’d always be hoping for things to turn around again and for us to get back together. We had another long conversation about his feelings and why he needed to remove the aspect of responsibility and commitment between us, and I came to really understand that his issues are far deeper than what is within my power to help him with. In fact, I’d probably be enabling his avoidance of facing his commitment anxiety by continuing to be so emotionally supportive of him while not technically being “together.” On top of that, it was so painful for me to spend time with him when I knew we still cared about each other so much.  

It was really hard, but I told him that I couldn’t be a part of his life anymore. He cried, I cried, we probably just held each other sobbing for about 30 minutes \(it was VERY melodramatic haha\). When we stopped crying enough to catch our breaths for a bit, I told him that I love him. He said it back. This was the first time we’d said it to each other \(and wow, I guess it’s also the last time we will\). It’s also the first time I’d said it to anyone, but that’s neither here nor there. 

 Anyway, I don’t really know why I’m sharing this... I always appreciate when people update on their issues, and this sort of seems like a surprising/dramatic update to a relatively minor issue, so... if nothing, here’s some entertainment for y’all? It does feel good to write this all out... it’s helping me make sense of it in my head. I am planning to go to therapy this week to deal with all the confusion. It helps a lot to talk about it.

I’d appreciate some advice on dealing with a breakup when both people are still very much in love. I’d also really like it if someone would validate me in the decision I made, haha. Also open to insight on whether I did the right thing.

TL;DR: Previous issues were likely symptomatic of deeper problems that SO needed to work out on his own. We broke up, for real. I’m deeply sad and still love him but I think this is the right thing to do."
"I (21M) found out that my girlfriend’s (22F) friends make fun of my stutter when I’m not around. They even encouraged her to break up with me because of it.


I’m in my early twenties and have stuttered since I was a little kid. It fluctuated over the years but has been severe for most of the time. I’ve always been very shy/introverted because of it and never got into a proper relationship.  However a few months ago I started dating this wonderful girl that approached me. We chatted for a while and she eventually asked for my number (I genuinely thought it was a prank but fortunately it wasn’t). My stutter gets worse when I’m nervous so it was particularly bad at that moment but she didn’t seem bothered or uncomfortable at all. We’ve been together for four months now and I’m very, very happy. She’s amazing, fun and very caring. I’ve met her friends too and they all seemed friendly. I always got along with them very well. 

Yesterday my gf emailed me a bunch of pics from our recent vacation (she took the pics on her phone). As I was going through them I noticed a few screenshots of her group chat conversation with her female friends. It was definitely a mistake and I wasn’t going to snoop but then I noticed my name several times. I read their conversation and it was pretty shocking. Almost all of them were making fun of my stutter and asked her how she puts up with it. They said that I’m “at least good looking” which is, according to them, the only positive thing about me and the ONLY reason my gf is with me in the first place. They also asked her a lot of personal questions about me and asked her if I stutter during sex. Then they proceeded to theorize what I sound like during sex. 

The worst thing was that they encouraged her to break up with me. They said that she should dump me and date someone “normal”. That honestly felt like a punch to the gut. My gf defended me and sounded pretty pissed off but they just told her that she was wasting her time with me. I know I shouldn’t let stuff like this get to me but it really hurts. My confidence has gone down and so has my self esteem. Now I have all these bad thoughts in my head, like that she deserves someone better. I’m seriously considering taking a break from this relationship. Is this a reasonable idea? Should I tell her about the screenshots and come clear or just leave it? 

**TL;DR My girlfriends female friends make fun of my stutter in their group chats and presumably talk badly about me whenever I’m not around. They even encouraged her to break up with me to date someone ‘normal’. This has severely affected my confidence and I’m starting to think they’re right. What should I do?**"
"I (24F) could have serious pregnancy complications, fiancé (26M) isn’t bothered


Just a bit of background, I’m 8 months pregnant with ‘Jack’ and I’s first baby, we’ve been together 3 years. Our relationship is mostly good, but this issue has been bothering me and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or not. Jack works literally 5 minutes away from the hospital, for a business run by his father, who I have a great relationship with. 

My pregnancy has been fairly low risk up until about two months ago, where some of my results started coming back abnormal and showing markers for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition characterised by high blood pressure, and protein in urine (both of which I have), and can lead to fits, a stroke, or in severe cases maternal and/or fetal death. Diagnosing it has been a problem, because asides from the BP and protein, I’m asymptomatic- but I am under close observation due to a family history of it, and am being monitored in hospital every two days for changes. My protein levels are triple what is normal in pregnancy, and my blood pressure is measuring from borderline to severely high. My doctors have advised I stay well rested, relaxed, and as stress free as possible.

I was called into hospital for the first time a few days ago for monitoring, and I was terrified. I text Jack to explain what was happening, and over text he seemed very concerned, asking me to update him ASAP. Luckily my mom came with me so I wasn’t alone, and in total I was in hospital for about 5 hours having panels of tests done. I was sent home and told they would call me if my results were worrying. That night Jack came home complaining about his day, and sat down on the opposite side of the room and pulled out a game on his phone. It took him about 30 minutes to ask how I was feeling, or even just hug me, which I was desperate for. 

The next day, the hospital called and told me to come straight back in, because they were concerned. I text Jack to let him know, and got a taxi to the hospital as I don’t drive. Once again, Jack asked me to keep him updated, but otherwise didn’t offer to ask his father if he could take the rest of the day off to be with me, or even take his lunch break at the hospital with me, since he’s only a few minutes away. My mom came down once she found out Jack wasn’t with me. I was hooked up to monitors again for a few hours, and had more tests done. At this point I was exhausted and tearful, and one of the nurses botched a blood test (when she eventually got the needle in, it only clipped my vein and sprayed blood all over the floor) and worried for both myself and my baby. They were discussing inducing me early, which I relayed back to Jack, but ultimately decided against it that day.

The senior consultant was due to come and see me at 5pm, the same time Jack finished work, and both myself and my mom assumed he would head straight to the hospital to be with me. Instead he text saying ‘am I going straight home when I finish?’

This upset me, since it felt like he was waiting to be asked to come, instead of taking the initiative and supporting me when he knew I was having an awful day. In comparison, I booked three days off work last year, without being asked, to be able to accompany him to his hospital appointments for an ingrown toenail, yet when there’s potentially dangerous complications in my pregnancy, he isn’t bothered about being there. I text back quite bluntly (immature, but I’d had enough at his point) saying ‘up to you. If you go home can you install the car seat in the car please.’ 

He went home. Half an hour later I was still waiting for the consultant, so I text Jack asking how things were coming along. He told me he was just having a beer, but he would pick me up from the hospital once I’d finished and he’d do it when we got back. 

Once we were home, I was trying not to be noticeably down, but I felt so upset and alone. I told Jack what the doctors had said, and that they want me to come in for monitoring every two days for a few more weeks, and he gave a half hearted attempt at sympathy but then told me he’s volunteered to work the rest of the weekends this month so he’d have more money. We’re not struggling for money particularly, but I didn’t say anything. Again, there was no offer for him to accompany me to any of the appointments I’d been given.

That takes us to today. I text Jack that I hope he was having a good day at work, and that I was relaxing with my feet up (as I’d been advised) to see if that brought my BP and swelling down. He replied saying he wished he could have an easy day. This isn’t unusual, as since I’ve been on maternity leave he seems almost jealous that I’m not working any more, which just sounds ridiculous to me! It’s hardly relaxing being 8 months pregnant with all the stress I’m going through, and having to keep the house clean and cook dinner every single day. I think I’d rather our positions were reversed! 

Am I overthinking this? Maybe expecting too much? I don’t know.

Tl;dr: possible preeclampsia, fiancé doesn’t seem to care"
"Wife [29 F] wants me [30 M] to snuggle her in bed much more than I'd like. What's the best solution?


I am talking about weekends. Most weekends, we run errands on Saturdays, maybe go out that night and on Sundays we either stay at home, go out for a peaceful lunch or meet her family, who tends to gather on Sundays after church (we don't go to church).

The thing is, I am used to getting up around 6:30-6:45, while she prefers to get up around 8. When I get up early, I do my thing in the bathroom and start making breakfast, but sometimes she wants me to stay with her until she wants to get up, usually 45 minutes later or so.

For some reason, I can't stand being fully awake but just doing nothing in bed. I like cuddling her, but after 15 minutes I feel I need to start doing something else. Sometimes I get up while she is still asleep or being lazy in bed (no offense, being lazy after a week of working is OK), and a while later tells something like ""Oh, I wanted to snuggle a bit longer"". Maybe if had more patience for wandering in bed I would do it, but I can't. I just feel the need to do something else.

Also happens we have sex early. I can cuddle for 15 minutes but if she falls asleep again off I want to go. I just like the morning breeze and drinking coffee before 7, and feeling productive from early in the morning.

Is any of us being somehow unfair? SHould I stay longer? Should she not expect to stay longer?

**tl;dr:** My wife wants me to cuddle her until she wakes up around 40 minutes later but I like getting up earlier. Is that OK? Or she we compromise something?"
"My mom (F56) found out I'm (F17) not a virgin and sees no worth in me


About a week ago my mom found out I had lost my virginity to my boyfriend of 2 years. She is extremely religious, believing that having sex before marriage is the ultimate sin. She completely flipped out, took my phone and blocked his number from the landline phone. She doesn't look me straight in the eyes, ignores me and won't pay for anything for me anymore.  I'm not allowed to leave the house, except for school, and I never see my boyfriend anymore. Through this, I lost everyone close to me and the only person I have is my boyfriend. He is everything to me and it kills me to not be able to see or talk to him. I don't want to go to my guidance counselor or trusted adult because I'm afraid my mom will freak out even more. I really don't know what to do.

**TL;DR**: My mom found out I'm not a virgin and sees no worth in me what should I do?"
"UPDATE: My bf (28m) and I (31f) just moved in together, my incontinent dog is making bf's life hell.


Hi everyone. My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8mzbsh/my_bf_28m_and_i_31f_just_moved_in_together_my/). It didn't get a ton of attention, but I wanted to provide an update anyway.

My dog got significantly worse over this past weekend, to the point where I was expecting him to pass away at any moment. On Monday, I called an in-home euthanasia service to come out and send him peacefully over the rainbow bridge.

It was really, really hard, but it needed to be done. My boyfriend and I have spent the last couple of days reminiscing and crying and just being there for each other. I didn't realize how hard he was going to take it, since he'd only lived with my dog for a week, but I guess it just proves how special my doggo really was.

Thanks to everyone who offered kind advice on my dog's situation.   It was hard to recognize that things had advanced beyond the point where I could do anything about it. 

Here's a picture of [Ares](https://i.imgur.com/x5e5gwv.jpg) during better days. Thanks again.

TLDR: Doggie is no longer with us, so the issue is resolved. Go love on your pets for me, please."
"My dog died on my best friend’s watch, and she’s ghosted me since.


My friend V (50f) volunteered to watch my 7 lb Yorkie Tink while I was out of town this weekend.  She has 2 small dogs herself..a Shih tzu and a Papillon. V called me at 6 am on Saturday to let me know that Tink had gotten out of the fenced back yard through a small gap in the gate (apparently small enough that her larger dogs couldn’t squeeze through) and was hit by a car and was killed. 

My husband and I immediately left for home, arriving at V’s house 8 hours later to pick up Tink’s body. I had called V approximately 30 minutes before we arrived to let her know we would be arriving soon.  She wasn’t home when we arrived, and her boyfriend gave me my dog. V pulled into the driveway just as we were loading back up in the car to leave. I was grieving/crying so hard I couldn’t speak or look at V at all. 

About 7 pm that night, I called V and spoke words of forgiveness, letting her know that I wasn’t blaming her for a tragic accident. 

V hasn’t bothered to call or text me since to see how I’m doing. It’s now been just over 50 hours since my dog died and I’m devastated.  There hasn’t been an hour without tears.  The last phone call I received from V was the call to let me know Tink had died. 

I can forgive the accident. I can’t forgive V for not reaching out to see how I’m doing.  We’ve been friends for over 15 years, and I’ve been by her side through her divorce, the loss of her father, and her child’s illnesses. Now when I’m in need, she’s not there for me. 

tl;dr:  My dog died while best friend was dog sitting. Friend has ghosted me since. I’m done with this friendship - not for the accident, but for the lack of compassion.

"I (21F) am not Very Smart, and it is Affecting My Relationship with My Husband (30M) (Together 2 years, married 3 months)


TL;DR: I say and do things that do not make sense. My husband who is tired from work doesn't react well to it causing us to fight endlessly

I have been with my husband Michael for two years. We met in my home country where he worked for almost two years. After having been together for a year, he received an offer for a better job in a country foreign to both of us. I agreed to move with him, and to make things easier \(company benefits, visa stuff, etc\), we got married. I gladly left school for the time being to adapt with my new life. Michael is a wonderful person. He had proven himself to be responsible, kind, and caring. However, I have noticed that when things do not go well to him, he can get very short tempered. Throughout our relationship, he had broken up with me over what I consider petty issues like me not being answering his phone for example. He also has a way with words in which he is able to immensely hurt me. Additionally, Michael is very intelligent, making him quick to notice flaws or weakness of others. Thus, not only does he get impatient with other people, he also makes sure that every time an argument comes up, he doesn't lose. 

Throughout the two years we have been together, Michael has always had the tendency to criticise everything. From some things as simple as the way I eat, the things I post on my social media, to the way I dress. I have brought it up several times, but it always ends with him telling me that that is simply the way he is and telling him to stop means attacking his sense of self. Since then, I have stopped bringing it up because it is simply not worth the argument that could possibly ensue. 

Recently, Michael's job has become even more stressful. He wakes up at 7 every morning and comes home by 8 in the evening. He is constantly on his feet, managing people, and being under endless pressure. Understandably, he comes home tired and irritable. I have tried my best to be understanding; making sure he does not have anything to worry about. I make sure he eats enough, takes his medication, come home to a clean house. However, when he is not working, he always blows up at me over things I consider not worthy of getting angry over. 

The first time was over an apartment that I liked while I went apartment viewing by myself. I went to see a couple units during the day then later showed him the ones I liked. He got angry at me because ""after he had shown me what luxury is I liked an apartment that looks like a nursing home"". I thought the apartment looked nice, and while I understood why he was not fond of the layout, I truly believed it was not worth the angry rant that lasted that whole night. I put a lot of time and effort into looking at those apartments. In the end, he said he didn't trust me for looking at apartments anymore. He then proceeded to create his own list of apartments for me to view. I felt absolutely terrible, mainly because he had mentioned plenty of times how stressful his work is, and I have seen it myself.

Michael had always picked on me when I say or do things that he deems as ""not intelligent"". Which happens frequently. Normally it is just a passing comment. But recently, it has gotten really bad to the point where he calls me stupid and said how miserable I make his life, that I am useless in life. He said he would rather stay at work and never take a day off because the sole thought of being around me makes him miserable. Or that he looks at other women and wonder if they would be smarter than me. For an instance, in one hour I forgot to bring cash for the taxi that was taking us home, misremembered details of his work, bought food that he did not like without consulting with him first. I do have to admit that I can be very forgetful throughout the day and absent\-minded. But when he shouts at me and becomes increasingly mean in his words, I become even more nervous making me furthermore prone to making mistakes. 

I understand Michael works extremely hard to provide for us. And never have I questioned his dedication to become a good partner, however, I do not think I deserve to be talked to the way he does to me. I love him, but I often think of times where I was happier before I met him. I realized that I am happier when he is not around because I am able to converse freely with people without having to worry that I will be judged. The second I see him I freeze and I become too terrified to say or do anything. I don't feel like he respects me. He never mistreated me, but his recent demeanor makes me feel like I am a burden to him. We have tried discussing it and he says that he gets impatient with me when he is extremely tired. But he is also tired having dealt with my 'unintelligence' for two years and not having seen any change, especially because I am someone he loves and supposedly would spend the rest of his life with. I personally have tried my best to not mess up in daily life, but calculation and rationale does not seem to be my strong point. 

I am tired of being in a relationship where everything seems to be perfect except for the fact that I am not intelligent enough to perform in daily life. I love him, and I can tell he feels the same about me. I only wonder how much longer he could bear with me. 

Is this a relationship worth continuing? Is there any way we could resolve the issue regarding my unintelligence?"
"Just found out my [30F] best friend [30F] of 10 years stole $20,000 from me.


A couple of weeks ago, I discovered several unauthorised Uber Eats orders on one of my credit cards. I cancelled the card immediately and informed my bank.

While waiting for my credit card company to give me an update, I messaged Uber directly with the full list of fraudulent charges (a total of 688 over 12 months) and they gave me the name of the person who was linked to my credit card. It's an uncommon name, so I knew immediately who had been using it.

Over the course of 12 months, she spent $20,000 on Uber eats order and Uber rides by using my credit card without my permission.

I'm honestly at a loss here and don't know how to bring this up with her.

So- what would YOU do? At the moment, I'm leaning toward ghosting her and letting the bank deal with it, but I don't really want her to get a criminal conviction, which I have been advised could happen.

TL;DR my long-time friend defrauded me of $20,000 on Uber and I don't know what to do about it."
"My [26M] girlfriend [24F] was snooping through my texts and is now pissed at a message I sent.


Last night my girlfriend blew up at me after snooping on my phone (which I have never given her permission to do). She is giving me the silent treatment and had a big yelling match at me, but the thing is that I don't think the message she was upset about are very bad at all. She was almost wailing like a baby and I really am boggled here.

The text she's upset about is this: I've had a buddy, Jack, who I've been friends with for over 10 years, much much longer than I've known her. We joke about dumb stuff sometimes. Yesterday he sent me a text saying ""Are you and [girlfriend] still on for the roadtrip at the end of June?"" to which I replied ""Sorry, [girlfriend] and I broke up, meet my new boyfriend, Harmon"" and sent a picture of a full erect nude model. He sent one back with another model and suggested we have a """"""boys"""""" trip. All a big joke but whatever.

She says that even joking about breaking up with her to a friend and turning gay makes her rethink the entire 3 year relationship. She knows that we pal around like that though. She said that breaking up with her is not to be joked about ever.

Is that something to be so upset about?

tl;dr Pretended to be gay, girlfriend not having it."
"My partner of one year [22M] had a mental breakdown and I [24F] took them to a psych ward.


My partner (let's call him X) is usually the sweetest thing in the world. X gives me back rubs every night, sex is 10/10, he's just wonderful. The ""fights"" we have are resolved in less 10 minutes. He is thoughtful and bubbly, a little introverted and awkward. He has Asperger's. He is bipolar as well. In the year that we have dated, I have never seen anything really that bad. He goes to therapy and was stable on meds.

I came home to my partner saying that he could hear voices, and that he was scared someone was watching him. My friend (H) was there babysitting X until I got home. He was sunburned from walking around so much, and appeared agitated, and a little disoriented. I took over and tried my best to figure out what was happening. X told me how she went to work, but just kept walking past the building. He ended up in a park with no recollection of how he got there, and then took a nap on a bench. He was having unbelievable mood swings, laughing maniacally to sobbing, then angry yelling. For anyone that cares, X's heart rate was 110 at rest, pupils constricted.

Things only got uglier from there. We had a video game party for that evening, and 20 guests were there. X started yelling at everyone to get out. Everyone was uncomfortable with him. X got in people's faces (X believes fighting is the lowest form of communication). It was a complete nightmare. Everyone left because X was either on the floor screaming at everyone and sobbing hysterically in the shower, or slamming doors and screaming. Then X gets confrontational with another roommate, D. It almost looked like X was possessed, or sleepwalking almost. The eyes looked so lifeless and piercing. I watched X take steps to get into D's face, and I really thought a fight was going to start. It ended with my D shoving X into the wall, and knocking the wind out of him. The cops got called that night, but they wouldn't do anything.

The next couple of days were even worse. The mania kicked into high gear, and X stared becoming even more paranoid. Everyone was lying to X, according to him, and that he was smarter than everyone else. At one point, X asked me if I was lying. What motivation do I have to lie at this point? In their words, either I'm ""lying or this isn't reality"". He stared throwing things, breaking things, and screaming. The cops were called again, but they still wouldn't do anything. I decided enough was enough and made my partner get in my car, and drove to a mental hospital.

I had him involuntarily admitted for the following reasons:
Hearing voices, paranoia, restlessness/agitation, mania, delusions, difficulty with recalling details of events that just occurred, crying spells, mood swings, and extreme sensitivity to stimuli.

I feel *massively* guilty. Did I do the right thing?

*TL;DR:*
My partner started acting manic and paranoid, heard voices, started fights, and I took her to a psych hospital. I'm a little upset. What do?"
"Wife [26f] got drunk and cheated on me [29m]. Told me right away.

Wife (26f) got drunk and cheated on me (29m). Told me right away.Infidelity
submitted 29 minutes ago * by Disturbedfuel15

Hey redditors, I need advice. I'm 29 years old, marine veteran, and about to finish up my bachelor's degree so my wife and I can start a family. I am the last one with my last name in the foreseen world and that is all I've ever wanted-to be a little better than my dad and raise smart young kids with my best friend at my side (American dream I guess). I found this with her and thank God every night for the unbelievable gift He has given me. My last relationship ended 6 years before I met my current wife, and that was because I had serious, serious, mental trauma from what she did to me. If I need to explain that I will, but long story short, it caused me to lose all confidence in my sexual abilities and I didn't have sex with another woman except twice in all that time.

My wife and I got married 9 months ago. I teared up as she walked down the isle. Ever since I met her four-ish years ago we have been best friends. If we ""fight"" it is more of a debate that we come to conclusions on together. Never yelling. We have sex about ever few weeks, something she brought up about a month ago that bothers her more than me, but I get it, and I've bought toys and stuff like a ""magic wand"" that she used every time. She always has an O and then I do afterwards. Sorry if TMI but it is the root cause I guess.

I heard her and wanted to start doing better. We had sex five days ago that I felt was passionate... It you need me to describe, I guess I can edit this post, but we both 'got off'. So she planned on going up to her best girlfriends house last weekend. I made sure her tires were all filled up, car was running sound, gave her a car charger in case something happened on the way so her phone could be full of juice to call me. I worried about her driving out there because it is a 2.5hr drive and I never want anything to happen to her. As the mother of my future children, I'd stand in front of her and take a million bullets if I could and had to.

She got drunk with her 'friend' on Saturday night. A guy drove both of them home. That guy fucked both my wife and her friend that night...

She called on the way home and I knew something was wrong. She said stuff like ""oh thank God, I just wanted to get out of there and hear your voice."" When she got home, she pretty much immediately told me, to where I immediately removed my ring, got in my car and drove to a nearby parking lot to cry. I talked to my parents, sister, and best man, who were all completely blown away that she would do this. I felt like my best friend died yesterday.

When I was calmed down, I came back and asked her to explain. She said that it all happened so fast and she got caught up in the moment of feeling 'hot'. She was crying, devastated, said she can't belive what she did and doesn't want to imagine life without me. She said I am the best man she has ever met and all she wants is to have kids and grow old with me.

We brought it up before that the only way we would get divorced is if one cheated on the other. So I am completely confused and don't know if I will ever be able to get the image of another man with her out of my head. She is moving out and staying apart from me for awhile and we will meet up only for counseling. I don't want to lose my best friend but I don't know what words a counselor can possibly say to get that image of her cheating out of my head. I don't know if I can ever even have sex with her, or any other woman again if it comes down to it. If I thought I had confidence issues in the bed because of my previous girlfriend, this just compounded it tenfold.

I am in desperate need of advice. I know you don't know me but I want to thank you in advance if you read my post. I'm beside myself. Bless you.

**tl;dr** my wife and best friend got drunk and cheated on me. She immediately told me and is very regretful and upset. I don't know how to forgive her, or even if I should but she truly, truly has been my best fiend like nobody, no other woman has ever been. I don't know if any amount of counseling can get the image out of my head of another man inside her. What should I do? "
"I (29F) am not comfortable with my fiancé’s (30M) relationship with our landlord/neighbor


I (29F) have been with my fiancé (31M) for 4 years. We got engaged in February and have a 14 month old son together.

In October we moved into a new apartment where we live right next door to our landlords (A married couple in their 30s who have a son just a few months older than ours). The female is our primary landlord, as her husband travels frequently.

Shortly after we moved in I started feeling uncomfortable about my fiancé’s relationship with our female landlord. At first I noticed he was texting her a lot, but it was always about innocent things—questions about the apartment, recommendations for local restaurants, etc. I remember commenting to him that he might want to stop texting her so frequently as it might be annoying to her. He responded that it wasn’t too much and that he was just being friendly.

Two months later I was paying our phone bill and noticed that he had gone WAY over our texting limit. I looked into it and found that he had sent her over 800 texts within the past month. They had been texting back and forth all day every day including on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. At best I thought his behavior was inappropriate, at worst I thought he was having an affair. I confronted him and he acted like I was insane and told me it has all been completely innocent and he was just being “neighborly”.  I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him being in constant communication with her, even if it isn’t sexual, and since then the texting has seemed to stop.

I thought all was well, until recently when the weather warmed up and she started spending time outside. EVERY time she is outside my husband finds a reason to go out and spend time with her.  We live next door to each other and have kids close in age, so I certainly don’t expect him to never spend time with her, but it has gotten to the point that I am feeling uncomfortable. For example:

-Last night in the middle of dinner we heard her out on the porch with her son. My fiancé suddenly decided he needed to take the trash out right at that moment and didn’t come back in for over an hour because he “bumped into her” and got into a conversation 

-Last weekend I had a bad cold and he suggested just relaxing inside—until he saw our landlord outside with a few of her friends and decided to spend the night having a bonfire with them while I sat alone on our couch

-I took our son for a walk to the park, and instead of joining us he decided to stay home and spend time with our landlord and her son because “we have a perfectly good yard and no need to go to the park”

-On several occasions I have found myself inside with our son playing, eating, etc while he spends time outside with her and her son.

He hasn’t done anything explicitly wrong, but I just have an uncomfortable feeling. I brought this up to him and his response was again that I’m crazy and that “he just really likes being outside”.  Am I justified or am I being overly paranoid?

TL;DR My fiancé’s relationship with our landlord has been making me uncomfortable, but I’m not sure if I’m justified or being paranoid."
"My (44m) mom (74f) is demanding that I ""take care of"" my brother (42m-who is 100% able bodied, just an extreme mama's boy and narcissist) after she passes as a condition of being in her will. Do I say no and kiss ~$200k goodbye or do I lie and say I will?


Like most r/relationships posts, this could go post could go on for years but I'll try to make it both succinct and readable. 

My brother has always been the baby of the family and was indulged in every way imaginable by my parents (I can't deny that we were both spoiled, but I was never outright indulged the way he was). As such he's become an extreme manipulator, liar and all around anti-social person. Things in my family were tolerable until my dad passed away and then it was almost my mom and brother are one meltdown shy of Mama and Norman Bates. As an example of things that they have done are:

1. My mom forged letters of recommendation to get him into graduate school. 

2. My mom has paid for his car insurance since he graduated college (20+ years now). 

3. My brother has an extremely hard time meeting women and when he does, maintaining relationships with them. When they break up, my mom has called these girls up to 100s of times (each) to try to get them back together. 

4. My mom showed up in court to try to talk my brother out of a speeding ticket and then was held in contempt when she wouldn't shut up about how the cop was just railroading my brother. 

5. My brother has never had anything to do with my kids (thank god) but every year she sends the kids heartfelt letters and presents in her handwriting as if they were from my brother. 

Like I said, this list could go on for ever and every bullet item would be equally as pathetic. However, my mom is now very much facing her mortality and I think it's hitting her that when she's gone my brother will have very few skills to attack life on his own and it's scaring the crap out of her. 

Last week my mom said that she needed me to continue to look out for and ""take care of my brother"" when she passes away. I asked her what this entails. She said that she needs me to continue to do what she's done (which she insists is just ""help"") I asked if this meant to pay his car insurance, call his ex-girlfriends or talk him down if someone is gives him mean glances at him on the bus (another instance of pure crazy). My mom said ""he would do it for you."" I said that in over 20 years of living away from home, my brother has never reached out to me once so I don't believe that he would do any of that for me. She said that he doesn't reach out because he's ""scared of you."" I said well that's a great reason why we should probably continue to live our separate lives. My mom then said very directly ""if you can't or won't take over for me when I pass then I have to leave my entire estate to him."" I asked her if she was serious. She said yes. 

I have no doubts that she's serious. I could never, ever be involved with my brother, on my mom's terms or otherwise because very basically he's an anti-social creep who scares my wife and a person whom I'm afraid to have my kids around. 

So the question is simply this:

Do I be honest with my mom and kiss away anywhere between $200000 and $400000 (her estate is probably worth a million total in property and investments, how much is left depends a great deal on how much care she needs as she continues to age). 

Or do I lie to her and say I will and then after she's gone and everything is settled, I truly never go NC with my brother?

**tl;dr: My mom insists that for me to be involved in her will and estate, I have to ""take care of"" my brother. Do I lie to her and say I will continue to carry out her insane levels of involvement in his life or do I kiss away a serious chunk of money which could pay off our house, send our kids to college, etc..."""
"Am I (23F) being too sensitive, it is my boyfriend’s (23M) fake displays of “manliness” making me look bad?


Hey reddit! I need your opinion on my situation with my boyfriend, who I will call Dean. We are both 23 and have been dating for five years. Lately we have been talking about getting engaged within the next year or so. Please keep in mind that he brought this up. We talked about it and decided that we’re both ready and he hinted at proposing to me within the next year. I know we are both young, but plan on having an extended engagement to save up money and prepare for this big step. Dean seemed just as excited as I am, he sometimes brings it up in conversation randomly. Like we will just be hanging out in the living room and he will turn to me and say something sweet like “I would marry you right now if I could.”
 
Anyway, this weekend we attended his older sister’s wedding. It was a lovely ceremony, and I got to meet a lot of his extended family that I haven’t met yet (he has a huge family and some live far away)
They all seemed very kind. At one point, a few of Dean’s uncles and male cousins were talking with us. They started joking around and saying things like “looks like you two are next” etc. Dean sort of recoiled away from them and said things like “not anytime soon”  “no thanks” and “don’t give her any ideas” etc. I was kind of disappointed and taken aback because I thought we were on the same page with the whole marriage thing and he was the one who brought it up. 

Later on in the ceremony Dean saw the centerpieces and said something like “would you want this color for the wedding” and I said “I thought you didn’t want to rush into it anymore?” He was confused so I reminded him about what he said to his male family members. He said “I didn’t mean that, I was just saying it because that’s what men say. It’s a masculine thing. We are supposed to not want a wedding.”

Reddit, I don’t know if that’s a thing that men do. I figured if you want something, you just say so and don’t act like it’s the plague or something. I feel like, by saying those things he made me seem like a nag to his family that hardly knows me, and like if we got married I would be sort of forcing him into it. Maybe I’m just being sensitive, but my sister’s husbands were both excited to marry them and let people know that. Neither one of us are from any hyper masculinity cultures... I just wish he would be excited to be with me around others like he is when we’re alone. Do I need to grow up and get over it, or he being a bit dickish? Be honest with me.

Tl;dr: my boyfriend recently brought up wanting to propose to me soon, I was on board. At his big sister’s wedding, his male family members mentioned us getting married and he acted horrified. Later told me he was being fake macho. Am I being overly sensitive?"

"Me [17f] with my mom [40s] who is very upset at me because I cut my hair before an important event. I feel responsible for the arguments she is having with my dad... did I do the right?


My dad is also in his 40s :)

My sister got married about ~a week ago. I used to have long hair down to my waist. Very thin, very damaged hair. Lots of split ends. My mom had been talking to me about making an appointment so I could get my hair fixed for my sister's wedding, but honestly, it was just such a huge burden to deal with my hair because I used to shed hair like a dog and it was annoying, so I decided to cut it past my shoulders. It's really cute now. It's ""short"", but not exactly a bob... I don't know how to explain it. But it makes me look more sophisticated and the condition of my hair is much better and healthier now, and it's so much easier for me to make it look acceptable in the morning.

I didn't warn my mom that I was going to cut my hair, because, well, the hair is mine... I didn't feel like I owed her an explanation. I have a job, so I paid for it myself. I cut my hair about a week before my sister's wedding, and my mom freaked out when she saw me. She was actually in shock. She said ""so you won't have long hair for your sister's wedding?"" and I was like... no? Did you want me to have long hair for my sister's wedding? When she said she wanted me to get my hair fixed, I didn't think she meant she wanted it long. I thought she meant she wanted me to do a few treatments because it was dry, so I went one step further by cutting it. She was focused on the wedding in the week leading up to it, so we didn't talk much, but once the wedding was over, she started arguing with me and saying that she couldn't believe that I didn't check with her before doing that (cutting my hair) and that all she wanted was for me to look good. My dad defended me, and now they're having constant arguments because my mom has been snarky to me and my dad thinks it's unacceptable. I'm siding with my dad, but I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing? I must mention that my mom has  always been a lot closer to my sister, and I've always had a better relationship with my dad.

tl;dr: my mom is upset with me because I cut my hair before my sister's wedding, she's having arguments with my dad."
"How do I [31M] assure my wife [26F] that she has nothing to feel bad about while being a SAHM?


Hey. I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do about my wife's guilt about being SAHM. 

My wife has had a rough life and has always had to work to support herself and her siblings. Shes never had a moment to herself or to really relax. Shes always been taking care of other people emotionally, financially, physically. She worked as a secretary for most of the time I've known her \(Don't worry. She wasn't my secretary. Its not that kind of story\).

I was lucky enough to have parents that came from money from a rather large business. I never wanted to be a Beverly hills brat that didn't go to school or work for any of their own money. But its worth noting that I had an account open last year and I will again in 9 years. About 6 months ago I got a promotion at my job.

What I'm trying to say here is that there is a class gap in our marriage. I've never cared about that. I love my wife and our children \(6 year old boy, 4 year old girl, and 6 month old boy\).

Over a year ago she started to seem really exhausted with everything. Pumping at work, not working in a great area, and feeling guilt about not being around the kids. I suggested that she could quit work if she wanted. I didn't want to pressure her into it so I only mentioned once and then I mentioned it again a week or two later. She asked if I was sure, was being serious, and if we'd have enough money to be okay. I assured her we would and she put in her two weeks notice.

Shes a kick ass SAHM. Shes great and I'm happy she can relax some. If anyone deserves it \- I believe its her. I know just from reading around on Reddit that even for SAHM getting the cleaning done can be stressful. So I still have the maid service coming in twice a week. 

My wife still volunteers and has a life of her own.

I'm trying to get to the point.

My wife feels insanely guilty over staying at home. I've assured her its fine. She switched out all of her kind of expensive skin products with cheaper ones. On Mothers Day I got her a necklace that was about 1k that I thought she'd like. She was appreciative and really did like it. But later on admitted to me that she felt bad I had spent that much money. 

She shops at low end stores. Which all of this is fine. I'm not mad at her for doing it. I just don't want her to walk on eggshells all the time that if she wants to go out with her friends for drinks or a spa day we're suddenly going to go broke or I'm going to be upset with her. She doesn't feel this way about the kids \(or at least doesn't show it\). She only seems upset when I spend money on her. The only thing with the kids is if I buy the kids something nice she gets really worried over the object/clothing/whatever and if it breaks/gets a stain/etc. 

I want my wife to have whatever she wants. Shes the sweetest, kindest woman on earth. She contributes so much to our relationship and family. I don't care that its not money.

TL;DR My wife is a recent SAHM that feels intense guilt over me spending money on her that is more than $20. I don't know how to assure her that its fine to go about her life, do things that she wants to go, and not replace anything with the cheapest version just because she isn't contributing money."
"My (16f) younger sister (8f) had been talking to an older (19m maybe?) guy she met on Minecraft and it got creepy.


So my 8 year old sister is not a very social kid.  She has no friends in school and her only friends are people she’s met on Minecraft.  My family and I have been okay with this as long as she doesn’t share personal information about herself, which we are very strict about.   She lied about her age to her online friends and told them that she was 13.

She started talking to this guy, who said he was 16, and they became “best friends”.  She stopped talking to any other internet friends she had, and told him that she’s 10.  Then they skype called each other and we caught her doing it and she got a long talk about talking to strangers and whatnot.  The guy DID NOT sound 14.  At best, maybe 17 or 18 years old.  Two days later my mother checked her skype to see if they’d been talking and found messages between them saying “I love you”, and “We have to keep this a secret!”.  They even referred to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend.   She sent him photos of her face and he was like “omg ur so pretty i love u even more now!”  She’s 8!!!!  You can easily tell that she’s 8! 

My parents disconnected her from the wifi and she’s only allowed on internet on a laptop with supervision now.  I went on the minecraft server that the guy made for the two of them and called him disgusting and told him to never contact my sister again. 

My sister does not understand why this situation was bad.  I’ve been trying to get her to truly understand but she just interrupts with “i know!!!” And brushes me off.  Also, I feel bad because she’s just unexpectedly been forced to cut contact with her only friend.  What can I say to her, how do I make her feel better?  

Tl;Dr
My eight year old sister was “dating” a guy online that is probably 10 years older than her and we forced her to cut contact.  He was her only friend and I’m worried about her and don’t know what to do/say to her.

"My (29F) mum (60F) is acting irrational because my wife (30F) (Doctor) yelled at my mum to stop Google diagnosing our son (3M)


This spans across several days, and has honestly turned into a bigger deal than it should be. 

On Thursday night my son and I were visiting my parents. My wife was going out with her younger brother (12M) to see the Avengers movie. He lives with us while my Father in Law is away. We thought it was a good time to divide and conquer things we've been meaning to do. While I was there my son started to complain that his ear hurt. I thought it was nothing and he just got water in it from the hot tub. I told him it would go away in a little bit. 

When he was eating dinner he started to cry that it really hurt, and that he wanted his mum. My mother tried to comfort him and he was having no part of it. He wanted my wife. I tried to call her, but as usual she turns her phone off during movies. My dad said we may as well take him to the Hospital down the street if it was really hurting him. I just left my wife a text telling her what was going on. 

We went to the hospital and we were in the middle of getting him looked at when they could finally see us. My wife is a doctor at the Children's Hospital. I think mentioning that is important going forward in this. My mother busy on in the internet the entire time Googling what it is. The doctor we saw even told her that it's not smart to Google for medical advice. My wife arrived just as we were been told we can go home. My wife saw the message when the movie was over. She spoke to the doctor for a little bit. We went home after that. My wife mainly dealt with giving him his medicine. He didn't want it, but she knows best how to deal with sick children. She actually had a feeling something was wrong with him the night before the whole episode. She wanted to take him in for a check up to his doctor. She can't be his doctor for some reason.

My mother has been still been Googling medical crap on the internet. Saturday night my mother was talking about all this stuff she thought was wrong with our son in the living room. My wife was on the kitchen, and she slammed her hand down on the counter. She proceeded to say, ""Hannah, for fuck sake, you're not s doctor. Stop trying to diagnose, Phil, with every thing you find."" My mother took extreme offense to this. She told me that my wife is an elitist doctor who thinks everyone is wrong of not diagnosed by a doctor. She told my wife that people like do nothing but scare the shot out of kids that go to see the doctor. It was a big argument that woke both our son and her brother up. My mum stormed out of the house and drove away when we heard the two of them wake up. I had to drive my dad  home because she left my dad at my house. 

My mum now is planning to move to Tasmania because she doesn't want to be around a grandson that doesn't need her. She's pissed off at me for not taking her side. She and dad are fighting. She's blocked my wife on all aspects to contact her. She called me a traitor for taking my wife's side in the argument. Because it would have totally worked out for me if I sided with my mum against my wife. Especially when it comes to our child. 

Do I do anything? What is your take on this situation? 

**TL;DR: My wife and mum got into a big argument on Saturday night. My wife told my mum she's not a doctor. My mum is now acting completely irrational.**

"I [35 F] just found out I'm pregnant and my friend [45 F] is trying to convince me to give her my baby.


Edit: I posted this earlier tonight but I forgot to add a title. 

I discovered last weekend that I'm approximately six weeks pregnant. I am a college graduate with a full-time job with excellent benefits. I make a decent salary and own my own home. While I'm financially secure, having a baby will likely change that. This is the first time I've ever been pregnant and I'm considering either terminating the pregnancy or keeping the baby.The father [37 M] does not want another child but said he would be supportive of my decision. The father has a long history of alcoholism and if I keep the baby, I will do everything I can to coparent but will not pursue a romantic relationship. Basically, I know I am on my own if I decide to have this baby.

My friend [45 F] has desperately wanted a baby of her own for years. She's said she would prefer to have a baby when she's in a loving relationship. However, the five men she's dated over the last 10 years have made it clear that they do not want children. When she found out I was pregnant, she was thrilled. When I told her that I'm pregnant she immediately suggested I move in with her and she can help me raise the baby. I thanked her but told her that I'm also considering terminating the pregnancy but if I do keep the baby, we will live in three-bedroom home I've owned for 10 years. She said she respected my decision.

Two days ago, she called me and asked me if I would reconsider terminating the pregnancy so she could adopt the baby. I told her that I thought it would be far too difficult to see the child raised by someone else, especially since she lives so close by. She reassured me that I wouldn't be giving up the baby, I'd be doing it a favor. And I'd still be able to see it. She said it would be far more humane for her to adopt the baby instead of terminating the pregnancy. There's no way I could ever carry a baby to term only to give it to my friend, who has the financial resources to adopt. 

I do not want to give my baby up for adoption but she's adamant about it. I've told her no every time she's asked me. I don't even remotely consider this a viable option. She still won't stop asking. What do I say to make her understand that she will not adopt this baby and she needs to stop asking me?

tl/dr- My friend is continuously pressuring me not to terminate my pregnancy and allow her to adopt the baby.

"I [22F] am dating a guy [25M] and my parents are PISSED


let me start by saying im indian (not muslim), so my cultural values are somewhat different. i had a relationship in grade 12 where i was in a toxic relationship, and my parents found out about him and forced us to break up repeatedly. my parents are very much helicopter parents. it was a toxic relationship, as i later realized and was finished with him, but during this time my grades suffered, which indian parents do NOT like, or forget. ive always been told i cannot date until i get into med school.


4 years later, i got accepted into med school in the US and im with another guy (who ive been with for 6 months). we're in an LDR, and have never met due to being in diff countries (hes in US rn, im in Canada). the relationship has been quiet because we are waiting to meet, and then tell our families. well last night, my mom was eves-dropping and heard me talking to my bf. she was fucking pISSED, grinding her teeth, shaking, and clenching her fists. i was called down by my parents and told im wasting my time, that hes never gonna be with me, he just wants sex, i cant date right now cause im emotionally fragile and will fail med school, and they dont like that hes an engineer (with a masters), and that his mom was abused by his father so she left him.


theyve been right in the past so im afraid theyre right now too. i dont feel like they are, but i might be clouded by my judgements. im so sad they found out this way, and only my bf and i know how valid and true our relationship is. how can i convince my parents? they are FURIOUS and now are saying i cant date until 2nd year. im hurt that they are going back on their word. i am not doing anything wrong, im in MED SCHOOL for shits sake and im dating now that i got accepted, as they had previously told me i could.


im really upset and am sad they are seeing this as a childish fling. how can i convince them? they are shaking with anger for what i think, is no reason at all. they told me if i ever fail med school because of him or any other reason, thats it im financially cut off. in their words ""how dare you waste time with him when you can do dishes? help out around the house!!!! youre wasting time with him."" fyi, i do a lot of work around their house. their argument is that i could do more instead of talking to him. 


TL;DR my parents are really really angry that im dating, even though they said i could when i got into med school (which i did). they are very controlling and im not sure how i can get them past this anger. "
"I[22F] can't deal with my roommate[22M]'s girlfriend[21F]


I moved into this great house that is owned by my roommate about 4 months ago. I know the obvious answer is to just find another place to live, but this house has a big property that's fully fenced and it's great for my dog. I really, really don't want to move out especially because I have a feeling the girlfriend won't last.

My roommate himself is great and a very respectful housemate. His girlfriend, however, is driving me up the wall. She is really loud when they have sex. ""OH YES BABY HARDER OH YES AHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and this goes on for 30+ minutes. Full on screaming. I'm not judging anyone for their sex sounds but isn't it normal to keep things in check if you aren't the only one home?

She tells me, in great detail, about their sex life and brags to me about how great she is in bed. She'll then randomly turn around an accuse me of being too interested in their sex life (despite the fact that I never respond or just say ""I don't need to know that""). She's accused me of being obsessed with my roommate. Accused me of sleeping with him because she found my laundry in his room (sometimes we do laundry together)

She leaves used condoms in my bathroom--I'm very certain it's her doing this and not the roommate. No big deal, I just drop a tissue on top of it in the trash so I don't have to look at it every time I pee. I'll go in the bathroom hours later and the condom has been deliberately placed back on top of the tissue as if she wants me to see it.

If my roommate doesn't have a shirt on, she loudly accuses me of staring at him. It's awkward and embarrassing and now I actually do blush when he doesn't have a shirt on just because I feel like he's wondering if I *am* staring at him.

She walks around the house naked. I talked to my roommate about this and that it's a little uncomfortable because sometimes I have guests over. She literally introduced herself to my 70 year old uncle with her tit hanging out of a tiny silk robe. She stopped doing it when my roommate is around but continues to do it if he's gone.

I frequently cook dinner and offer them leftovers. Just found out she's been taking credit for my meals and saying she made them for my roommate. I don't need to be thanked for it but it seems very weird to me. If someone mistakenly thought I cooked something I didn't, I'd say: ""Oh no, X made this! Isn't it delicious?"" not ""Oh yeah I spent 2 hours cooking this just for you""

She's worn my clothing without permission and when I told her not to and mentioned that she'd stretched them out, she accused me of calling her fat and body shaming her. She had a great body so that doesn't even make sense. 

I had a conversation with my roommate about this and he was very surprised and I get the feeling that he isn't sure who to believe. I get that, he's known his gf longer and obviously is closer to her. But he told me he'd have a conversation with her and that I'm paying rent so should be comfortable. She did stop, but only when he's around. 

Now it's basically a ""he said she said"" situation. The girlfriend only does stuff that I can't prove she did. My roommate has stopped having her so much and that's helped, but I don't know to handle this when she is so manipulative and weird. 

**TLDR: Roommate's girlfriend tries to make me uncomfortable, accuses me of liking him, and lies to make me seem petty/crazy**

"(Update) My(22M) family doesn't believe I'm gay


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8meetr/my22m_family_doesnt_believe_im_gay/?st=JHPE8ZM7&amp;sh=2f39ed0b

A lot of people asked for an update so I figured I'd give one. I'll try to write as little as possible but there's a lot.

I talked to my cousin yesterday and straight out asked  wth was going on. Long story short, apparently my brother(the gay one) has been saying I'm straight since I came out(my parents didn't believe me at first, thinking I was too relaxed, calm and didn't look ""gay"").

Some background, obly to make sense. I had a very diverse and chill group of friends, we experimented a lot and the majority was pretty alternative. That being said, some of my best friends are the ""white male cis straight"" kinda guy, my best friend from childhood was pretty much the golden boy of sports and whatnot so our group was kinda protected too.

Besides this, the area I intend to work is much more liberal and chill.

My brother wasn't so lucky. His friends were pretty homophobic and had a hard time supporting him. He's working in a pretty hostile area. Our experiences are very different.

Apparently, after the lack of homophobic reaction on my friends part(they knew long before my family), and the rest of the school my brother convinced himself I was lying. That it was impossible for me to not suffer any kind of retaliation(which I did but I handled with my friends alone).

He became very bitter and started telliing to the rest of the family, as if I was using my family liberal views to gather pity and help. The family didn't believe right away but since I didn't became more ""feminine"", didn't bring any boy home and conveniently got a internet bf they started believing.

He has also said some pretty hurtful things like

1-when he saw my bf facebook he apparently laughed and said something like ""see, he's copying me, this guy is super my type. And even if (my name) was gay, there's no way a guy like this would date him""

2-that there's no way my bf would waste years in a LDR with me

3-when I told them my bf was coming he laughed off and told everyone I guy like me, even if I wzs gay, could never have a guy like my bf


Now I apparently arranged, lied or paid my bf to come here and create this little show. My cousin, realizing this was way too crazy started questioning this and came to the conclusion I'm probably telling the truth, as are the rest of my cousins.

My mom, on the other hand, just got more convinced of my lie and is even angrier I'm creating the huge lie. She also said it wasn't fair a guy like my bf date a liar like me when my brother was single and truly struggling in such homophobic world.

There were some other things I won't post because they're too personal.

After this I basically told my cousinto fuck off and that I needed to be alone. So far he has posted a picture of me, him and a couple of other cousins on fb saying ""the best time of my life, thanks guys"", a couple of family members messaged me saying like ""what's up"" or things like that

I'm sure my immediate family will ignore this and keep laughing behind my back so I'm unsure if I should send a message telling them to fuck off and only talk to me when they apologize or if I should discuss what I just found out

TL;DR: my brother was jealous and said I was pretending I'm gay to get the benefits(what benefits? More chance to be attacked on the streets??). My family believed him."
"I [25F] am not allowed at my boyfriend’s [23M] house because his parents hate me.


I wish I wasn’t kidding. My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. His parents have hated me from the moment they met me, mostly because they don’t want their son to date. His mom has always been very controlling and very invasive when it comes to his privacy. He moved out about 2 years ago but still lives in the same building as his parents (they own the building), and they have a key to his apartment.

Now whenever I go over, I have to park my car fairly far so he can pick me up, I am not allowed to park near his house as I can’t be seen with him. I have to duck because his mom looks out the window to check he is arriving alone and that no one is with him.
I can’t go out and walk around, I can’t go in the kitchen because the window overlooks the stairs outside, I can’t take a shower if he isn’t present because they will hear noise upstairs; and whenever he is out getting something his mom will go up to check if someone’s there and throw a tantrum that he has someone over.

His mom has personally collected my possessions from his house and brought them to her house to show him she is aware he is having a girl over.

He doesn’t want to move because he doesn’t pay rent there, so it’s easier for him, but I am at the end of my rope here. I don’t think this situation is normal. He refuses to draw boundaries with his mother because he says she is too stubborn to understand or comply.

Reddit, I am stuck between a rock and hard place here. What should I do? Am I just being a big baby about this?

Tldr: I am not allowed at my boyfriends house because his parents hate me, and he won’t move because he doesn’t pay rent. Is this normal at all?"
"25 yo SIL wants to live with me and my husband [30s] after accusing her parents of ""abuse."" I am reluctant but husband really wants to help. What do we do?


So SIL is the classic ""failure to launch"" story that every parent is afraid of. She grew up pretty normal, or so I hear, but flunked out of college due to poor grades and started living at home. Her parents have tried every year for several years to force her to leave but it's no use. 

Unsurprisingly I'm not fond of SIL. I think she's bratty and delusional. She blames EVERYTHING wrong in her life on her parents, including the fact that she can't hold a steady job or regularly attend community college. I've been to their house and her room is a pig sty. Leftovers IN the bed, dirty clothes everywhere, broken makeup on the floor, etc. 

She's a grown woman by now but acts like she's still a ""rebellious teenager"" if you know what I mean. Every time we see her at family events, she's complaining about her parents not letting her do this or that, not giving her money for things, or just not giving in to her demands in general. She complains that she can't hold a job because her parents never taught her the right people skills, and that she can't go to school because she has undiagnosed mental illnesses (which by the way her parents have taken her to see professionals multiple times who couldn't identify anything). 

She is the definition of someone who refuses to help themselves in any way possible, instead preferring to blame everyone around her. 

Recently she got a boyfriend who's the same as her. Lives at home at the age of 29, no job, addicted to gaming, and HATES his parents with a passion for being ""on his case"" all the time. Together they are simply insufferable. 

Well the in-laws finally grew a spine and are officially kicking SIL out this fall. They've gotten lawyers and everything and will be doing this process with no turning back. Apparently SIL kept sneaking in her boyfriend at night which the parents couldn't stand. She called their rules ""emotional and legal abuse"" whatever that means. 

So now SIL wants to live with husband and I (we live 45 min away) because she thinks we won't abuse her like her parents did. Husband is entirely sympathetic and believes all of her sob stories. I'm more skeptical because honestly she does NOT seem like a neat housemate so I can understand her parents' frustrations. Also, since she has no income, we'd have to support her including food, clothes, who knows what else. I'm not ready to deal with trying to make her find a job while she finds ways to avoid leaving the house. 

Husband and I are arguing because he thinks I'm being too unemotional and unsympathetic to his sister who is a victim of abuse and needs support. I told him I'm happy to support her from a distance, like help her find a job and a place to rent, but I'm not willing to let her into my home. I tell him that I'm not doubting the existence of abuse because I wasn't there, but I'm pretty certain that if there is fault, then there's fault on BOTH sides. SIL is not some perfect victim angel. 

What should I do? I'm definitely putting my foot down on this but am I being too harsh? How should we compromise on this?

--------------
TLDR: SIL wants to live with husband and I after accusing her parents of abusing her. Parents are kicking her out this fall for breaking their rules and being a mooch. I'm not willing to let her live with us, but husband is sympathetic and wants us to help her by housing/providing for her. How should we compromise?"
"My parents (73) want to kick my brother (45) and his family out of their house


My brother and his wife are both medical missionaries.  They have spent the bulk of the last 11 years in Africa through a Christian program that places them in understaffed hospitals.  They get a monthly stipend, funded by charitable donations, for living expenses.  They have two kids, now 8 and 14.

From one perspective, they have put themselves through tremendous hardships to help those most in need.  They have lived in rural housing without flushing toilets, home-schooled their kids while working in understaffed hospitals dealing with horrific diseases without modern medical equipment.  They have built up a small church community in rural Africa from virtually nothing.  And they've likely meaningfully touched more lives than most of us could ever dream of.

From another perspective, they are now in their mid-40s and they don't have a penny to their name.  Nothing for the kids' college or their retirement.  They live in my parents' basement when they are in the US, which they have been for about half the time the last 4-5 years.  They don't pay for groceries or utilities.

My parents recently shared with me that they are kicking them out.  When they're here in the US, they don't work, saying that nobody wants to hire a doctor for just a year (and that it would be sinful for them to deceive them).  They instead sit around the house and continue their homeschooling of the kids.  They won't say as much, but I'm pretty sure their retirement plan is inheritance, though it's hard to say whether that will be a sufficient amount.

My parents shared with me that they do not really want to kick them out.  What they want is for them to both get jobs, to put their kids in the local public school, and to start to balance their faith with reality.  My parents say they don't even care about them living in the house and not contributing financially, if they would just start earning and saving some money for the future.

My parents are begging me to help convince him to change his ways.  I've tried in years past to talk to them about money, but the conversation turns to the true riches of the kingdom of heaven and we get nowhere.  When I ask about funding for college they say God will show them the right path when the time comes.  It's like we don't even speak the same language.

My mother is increasingly stressed and she tells me she is barely sleeping.  She threatened to sell the house and downsize to somewhere my brother and family wouldn't be able to fit, but my brother talked her out of it (and she was bluffing anyway, she's lived in that house for decades and she doesn't want to move).  She yells at him about the damage to her dishes and her furniture from his kids, but he dismisses any concerns with material possessions as trivial and meaningless.

I really want to help my parents, but I haven't the slightest clue how.  My brother and his wife won't listen to us.  What do you think I and my parents should do?

TL;DR: Failure-to-launch brother and his family are saving the world but not a penny for themselves.  My mother wants them to either move out or get jobs, but they refuse, and are in an increasingly awkward stand-off."
"The guy I've liked for ages [22/M] asked me [29/F] on a date and I rejected him.


So I have this male friend who I've known for just over a year. We have history between us. When we first met we had this intense fling. He was this very troubled, charming, handsome young guy and I was totally infatuated with him. But he had a lot of demons and things just weren't very stable. He knew he had to get help and to work on himself so our romance fizzled out and we remained close friends. He started getting regular therapy, began volunteering and made some new friends. 

Over the last six months he's made big improvements and I'm very proud of him. Throughout this time, I still carried feelings for him but I was wary about getting back with him too soon. I didn't want the drama anymore. A few months ago, I confessed I still had feelings. He said he still had lingering feelings for me too but didn't think it was wise for us to get into a relationship at this point. 

Then a few weeks later, another close male friend of mine admitted he had feelings for me. He's always been there for me consistently and is a very mature, stable guy. I never really thought about him in THAT way but I decided to start hanging out with him more. He's taken me on a few dates and we've now begun sleeping together. We're not exactly sure where things are headed but so far things seem good between us.

But then yesterday, the other guy invited me out for a drink. He suggested that we try going on a date, telling me he was ready for something serious now. I had to confess that I'd just begun seeing someone else. He seemed quite upset by this and even started crying a little which shocked me. He tried to win me over, saying things like ""I don't think this other guy will make you happy"", ""no one compares to you etc"", ""I should have acted sooner etc"". He was really pulling at my heartstrings, but I didn't feel right just abandoning the guy I'm seeing now.

I'm feeling really shitty. If he had asked me on a date a few months ago things would be different, but he waited until it was too late. I feel a little torn. I'm pretty sure I've made the right decision to stick with the guy I'm seeing now, but why do I feel so bad about this?

TL;DR -- I've liked this guy for ages, but it was never the right time for us to date. So I recently started seeing someone else. Now the guy I liked is finally ready to date me but I feel like its too late. What should I do?"
"My (26F) boyfriend (27M) is making his weight loss my responsibility


We've been together two years and we live together. He was a bit chubby when we met but he has gained a lot of weight over the past two years. He's now obese by BMI standards \(BMI of 31\). He has expressed many times that he wants to lose weight, that he doesn't like how he looks, how his body feels etc. However, he does not change anything in his behavior.

Yesterday he made two hamburgers for himself for lunch, loaded with cheese, after he ate a package of chocolate cookies. A few nights before he was telling me again that he wants to lose weight. He also often tells me he has no clue about what's healthy and what's not. So I tried to explain nicely that two buns \+ two big beef burgers \+ loads of cheese \+ whole package of cookies does not make the best lunch. In hindsight, I should not have said that while he was still cooking. 

He freaked out completely and threw the burgers in the trash. He then said he cannot lose weight because of me. He said that he hates that I don't 'really cook' or that we almost never cook together. And he says that's the reason why he cannot lose weight. He says he cannot do it on his own and he says I am not trying to change, so he's not trying. This is not the first time he said something like this. But he was really, really angry and upset yesterday. 

We have really opposite schedules \(I work daytime, he works a lot of evenings\) so we rarely eat together \(on average we cook together once or twice a week\). I often make something really simple for myself or buy something premade when he's not home. This keeps me from overthinking about food. I have a history of anorexia and am still quite thin \(although at a healthy weight\). I'm doing good but I can still be a bit 'weird' with food and I still count calories, although I make sure to eat enough. I have come a long way, from inpatient and 'unable to work' to living independently and working 40 hours a week. I do know I'm not completely recovered and am still in therapy. 

And now I don't know how to handle it. I want to help him, and I've tried. I've suggested he keeps a food diary so we could look at his food choices and I could till him which choices are healthier/ not so healthy, but he doesn't want to. I've encouraged him to go to the gym with me but he went 3 or 4 times and could not stop complaining about everything. I've tried nicely but I've also been completely honest in that I'm worried for his health if he continues like this. Nothing works. What do I do? I can't be his mom and cook his every meal. I don't have time for that. 

Tldr; Boyfriend wants \(and needs\) to lose weight but says he cannot do it because I don't help him enough by cooking \(together\). I want to help him but is it unfair to put that responsibility on me?"
"UPDATE: My [34F] mom[50F] is an animal hoarder and I don't know what to do


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8khnn4/my_34f_mom50f_is_an_animal_hoarder_and_i_dont/)



My grandmother ended up calling the police and animal control, I called adult protective services. Nothing was done by anyone. The police found her in her car, she talked to them and they said everything was fine. She said she got out of the car so her dogs wouldn't bark! Adult protective services were unhelpful since she isn't diagnosed with any cognitive delays.




She tried to adopt another cat on facebook three days ago. She's at rock bottom and still digging. I called her this morning and told her again that she won't get to see me, my husband, my child or the new baby until she has it down to two pets. She said ""that's just not possible"". So that's where we are. I've lost my mom to this addiction, she doesn't want help, and not a lot of help is out there. I do want to thank everyone for the advice given. I wish I had better news.




tl;dr: She's still hoarding and there's nothing to stop her."
"I'm (30/M) Autistic and making life hell for my gf (26/F) of two years


Imagine a person very irritated by kissing, hugging and usually intimacy in general. Who can't stand loudness and rarely willingly takes part in social activities. Who can't act spontaneously, needs to plan everything in a day to be able to breathe, has very limited interests that just doesn't and can't include human interaction. Someone that constantly turns what is supposed to be casual dialogue or mild arguements into angry debates due to confusion.

Now imagine someone full off life and happiness. An outgoing, loving and caring woman that likes relationships, friends, attention and being all around colorful. She really shouldn't fall for the guy I just mentioned, right?

Well, we did fall for each other. We have been together for two years. In that time, I've watched her slow descent into depression and anxiety that our relationship have caused. She admits it, but even though I gave her many outs, she can't stand even the thought of being apart from me and I can't as well. Our parents are finally going to meet, this is getting serious, we already have a life together but we are about to take it to the next step.

Where we live, it was already incredibly hard to find counseling for autistic adults. It is virtually impossible to find couples counseling for our spesific issue of having brains that function very differently. I'm here looking for tried and proven resources, and experiences from people that went through similar periods.

I would appreciate any advice, thank you.

**TL:DR: I'm Autistic and I have very problematic human interaction, that extends to my GF of two years. We are getting serious and need advice from people who experienced similar things.**"
"UPDATE: My [21F] father [M55] lied about something crucial (at least to me) to his girlfriend [F45

Thank you all for your messages and support. Thought I owe y'all an update. A pretty predictable one, unfortunately.

So.

He didn’t want to admit it for good ten minutes, but I saw him acting sketchy and getting all worked up. Then I asked to provide ANY piece of evidence the bloody house ever existed \- e\-mails, contracts, tax filings,  a n y t h i n g. 

So after a lot of shouting he finally admitted that he made it up.  “So what?” (c)

So yeah… it was a drunk lie to impress GF in the beginning of relationship (which started three years ago), he completely forgot about it, and didn’t expect it to blow up. Well, it did, when they went on vacation. It was exactly the stupid one\-lies\-lead\-to\-another thing somebody mentioned in the original post. 

I explained to him in great detail exactly why it hurts (changing mum’s story, giving the new GF an entirely different picture of our family, etc., etc.), but I didn’t have the impression he even listens. He just kept on saying how much he sacrificed and did, and so on, so forth, that I idealise my mum, that he did spend a lot of money,

— I think that was a crucial point for him. He wanted to make all the money he spent (on I\-don't know\-what, it was free healthcare) a physical embodiment —

that he felt his support was under appreciated, how hard it was to get back to the dating scene, how insecure he felt and so it goes.

I understand his feelings. Kind of. Sort of. But there was no need to twist my mum’s memory to impress a new GF. He is not gonna tell his girlfriend the truth, though. Me neither (unless she tries again the “oh you\-and\-your\-ungrateful\-brother are gonna get your father in grave sooner or later” speech she tried once, but about that I warned him). I am not gonna tell my brother the story either.

I tried the whole “you don’t need to have a summerhouse to be loved, we love you as you are” speech, but he was unimpressed. 

I honestly don’t know how to feel about it. I find his lack of self\-awareness disturbing.  We all make mistakes, but at least have the guts to admit it was one. I also probably could have handled the conversation better. 

Anyway thank you all for very good advice you gave me. 

TL:DR; the house was a stupid lie, dad went first into denial then anger then whatever. "
"How can I (26/f) explain to my boyfriend (29/m) that we are equals in this relationship?


I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now and we have had an awesome relationship thus far. We have just moved in together and we're super excited. However, we've had a reoccurring issue where my boyfriend will take on a really passive role and treat me like I'm the only one who matters in this relationship. At first it was sweet, I would wake up to breakfast in bed, or he would come home with flowers from the store. But now, a year and a half later it's a little much. I am told how beautiful/smart/funny/special I am multiple times a day while he only says self\-deprecating things about himself. He thanks me constantly for being so amazing and wonderful, and shies away from whenever I say it back to him. He asks permission to do ANYTHING that he remotely enjoys, and promises he won't be too long whenever he does. Dinner/outing/date choices are all up to me, all the time. Even if I make him choose something, he'll choose something he knows I love.

I've told him multiple times how I feel as if he is putting me on a pedestal and we are equal partners here but I feel like all that does is make him try harder to please me because I've expressed some minor displeasure.

I don't really understand where any of this comes from, because outside of our relationship he is a strong, confident, put\-together guy which is what originally attracted me. He's extremely successful in his career, has a great group of friends and has done countless amazing things that I would never be able to.

Any ideas of what I can do to give him a little boost?

\*\*tldr;\*\* I want my boyfriend to take me off the pedestal and love himself more. "
"My [25 F] boyfriend [30 M] of 6 and a half years has gotten mean following the death of his mother.


R/Relationships...I need some insight.

I met my boyfriend when I was 18 and just graduated from
high school. He is the only person I have ever dated or been with! Things were amazing in the beginning. Had my first date ever, first kiss, so many new and exciting things I had never done before.

Last year, my boyfriend’s mom got sick. It was stage 4 brain cancer, inoperable. Since he lived with her and was suddenly alone while she was in hospitals and just away, I made sure to do his laundry, keep the house clean, grocery shop, and take him out to get his mind off of things. 

She passed away three months later, and obviously, everyone was heartbroken. We couldn’t believe it all happened so fast. She was 63. My boyfriend was deveatated and he told me it felt like his entire world collapsed. Shortly after his mom passed away, he has to get out of the house they lived in together and we both moved into a small apartment together. The more I tried to help him, it felt like the more I pushed him away. The man I fell in love with and thought I would marry someday is not him anymore. 

He grew into a totally different person. He ignores my texts and calls but will post on social media. He screams at me over small things like forgetting something at the grocery store or asking for sex. Last week I tried to give him a hug after a bad day and he pushed me to the ground. I don’t feel how I used to feel towards him. I feel scared and nervous and anxious that I will upset or anger him...I don’t enjoy myself around him anymore.

I want to leave him. My parents don’t live far, but I think I need to get out of there because he will never be the same. What is the best way to go about doing this? Is it normal to feel attached, even though he has put his hands on me and yells at me? Why do I have such a hard time letting go :( please help me. Am I making the right choice? Will the man I fell in love with ever come back, or does death really truly permanently change someone completely? Any advice is welcome. 

TL;DR: boyfriend of 6 and a half years lost his mother to cancer a year ago. Ever since then, he’s been very cold and mean, and I think it’s best to leave. Looking for advice."
"My [25F] boyfriend [27M] of 7 years told me he doesn't care about what I talk to him about.


Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.

It happened yesterday. We went out for dinner, and I asked him about his day. When telling him about mine, he suddenly looked up and told me ""No offense, but I really don't care about what you're saying"". He then got mad at me for not looking too pleased with his answer, because he ""told me nicely"". The day before, when talking about hobbies, I told him I like collecting stuff and he replied with ""I know, you have a bunch of useless crap"".

I feel like these two comments are huge wake up call for me. If I don't give him all my attention when he's talking to me about his day, work or hobbies, he gets mad. (I have ADD, so I tend to zone off during long conversations, but I apologize when I notice I'm doing it.) When he tells me about his coworkers, his work or his hobbies, I listen to him and ask follow-up questions, even when I don't know about it/it doesn't really interest me. To me, it's something a partner should do. But when talk about that kind of stuff, it's boring and he doesn't care. If I don't load the dishwasher the exact same way he does, he gets mad. He never makes a point of planning activities with me, I always have to suggest things and when I do, he never wants to do anything. When I wash the dishes, I don't wash them the way he does, and he comments on it.

His past two comments really opened my eyes, and I think I deserve better. I can't see myself spending the rest of my life with someone who doesn't see a relationship the same way I do. We're supposed to help push each other up, but all it feels like is he's trying to drag me down.

Anyone else ever experience something like this? I'm thinking of clearing things up with him later today, but I feel like it's gonna be another case of ""yeah I'll change"", and the changes will only last 2 weeks.

TL;DR: Bf told me he doesn't care about what I talk to him about, told me my hobby is shit, criticizes me constantly about small things and I feel like I deserve better than this."
"I [24m] have been dating a very cool girl [27f] for about 3 months. I went to her club beach volley ball game and she screamed and cursed at teammate, refs, other team. Is this a red flag or just competitive spirit?


So background on this, I've been seeing ""Mandy"" for about 3 months. She is a very cool, very smart with a really good job and working her way up in her company. It also helps that she is by far the best looking girl I've ever been with. I really, really like her. 


I know that Mandy played volleyball on a scholarship in college and even did some post college things like pro beach volley ball and I don't know for sure but she may have tried out for both the regular and beach volleyball national teams. I'm a huge sports fan but I honestly don't know enough about volleyball to know exactly how it works but I know she was/is very good. 

She's in a local club beach volley  ball league and last night for the first time she invited me to come watch. She forewarned me before the game that she turns into a different person on the court. I had no idea it would be as bad as it was. Think Walter Sobchak when Smokey crossed the foul line...except for an entire game. I mean she screamed at the other team and did like the old ""in your face"" thing, told them they would lose teeth to her spike, etc...  The ref's were mostly high school kids and she cursed at them, she told her teammate how stupid he was and even said ""I'm going to bury you in the this f---- sand if you don't get your head in this."" She was even warned by the owners of the complex that they had already warned her this season and any more ""conversations"" would result in she being banned from playing. That caused her to cut out the cursing but she was still overly amped up for what seemed just like a normal weeknight volley ball game to most people. 


So basically, with the picture I've painted here...is this a massive red flag or is this just her competitive nature showing itself?


She is ordinally very sweet to me, and other than some ""joy"" she got out of firing an employee a few weeks ago, the volley ball outburst was totally out of character or her. 

Red flag or just competitive?

**tl;dr: the girl I've been dating was out of control at her club beach volleyball game last night, so much so that she had to be warned by the owners of the complex that she could be banned. Is this a red flag or just here competitive nature coming through?**

"My father [M55] lied about something crucial (at least to me) to his girlfriend [F45]


My mother passed away five years ago. Since then my father got over deep depression and got himself a new girlfriend.

Now the problem: I randomly learnt that he lied to her that he had to sell off a vacation house WE NEVER HAD to pay for my mother's medical bills WHICH SHE DID NOT HAVE because of medical insurance. Now this is something completely out of character of him to do; I was completely baffled when I learned about it.

I am sure we never had it, because... why would they both hide something like that from their children? and  the house would have been in a foreign land \- and the trips thereto would be really hard to amiss... that's why I am quite sure it's blatant lies. 

One possible reason I can think of that my father is a struggling entrepreneur and super self conscious of not making as much money as he hoped he would and this whole lies must have been a show off attempt gone terribly wrong. Extremely childish and juvenile of him, yeah. 

I feel like WTF dude, my mother would never ever agree to something like that! She was pretty adamant of not getting our family into financial trouble because of the illness, that's why she opted for the cheaper \(but still good quality\) government healthcare insurance. Telling stories like that completely distorts her image and pisses me off to no end. 

Another reason though... guilt. What if we did sell off real estate and paid for more expensive treatment? Would she still be alive? Did we all try hard enough? Maybe he is making stories to make him feel better \- like we did everything we could.

How to confront? Should I confront him or should I just let it go? I learnt about that yesterday and decided to cool off first..

TL:DR: father made up some stupid lies about imaginary house he had to sell off to pay for my late mothers' medical bills"
"Husband [29m] doesn't like that I [25f] breastfeed for some reason. He's very critical of everything I do with baby and I don't know how to handle it ?


We have a 3 week old baby. She is by far the love of my life and I've been trying my best to be the best mother I can. But it seems like everything I'm doing I'm being judged for. My hubby doesn't like that I'm breastfeeding for some reason, he becomes very irritable and keeps badgering me to formula feed. There's no need for me to, I'm happy with what I'm doing.  

When I asked him why he just says it makes him uncomfortable. I dont know if he was raised with some different values or childrearing practices but thats not how im doing things. There's always something he has to say about something I'm doing. I'm pretty sure I know how to care for baby, considering I'm also a midwife. The last thing I need is this extra stress, but I really feel like he's being a little unreasonable. Especially since he won't tell me the reason. I don't know how to talk to him about this ?

"My (28F) boyfriend (28M) is obsessed with living frugally to the point of being controlling


I’ll try to keep this short.

Background: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years, living together for 3.

He comes from a family that is fairly well off but extremely frugal. “Waste not, want not” type of deal. Ex. One time I was helping his mom chop up some vegetables and when I was finished she went back to the stems and nubs I’d leftover to salvage an extra 0.5cm. Their default is to abstain from things if they could be considered a luxury in any way. I usually avoid running the dishwasher, but on occasions where it’s full/we’re out of dishes and forgot to run it the night before, I will run it during the day. This is a huge affront to him and if he’s around he will turn it off. We also recently got in a huge fight because he was convinced that leaving the roof rack on the car (instead of storing it in our tiny apartment) would cost more in gas, even though we live in the city and only use the car 3-4 times a month.

He gets a lot of his frugality from habits he developed with his family, but still spends lots of  his own money on beer, building a collection he’s been working on for years (maybe $30-$200 per month, depending) and going out to social events at bars a couple of times a week. 

When my boyfriend and I moved in together we combined our expenses and have a joint account that we pay into for rent, bills, groceries etc. This includes the hydro bill, which on average is $60-$80 per month for our loft apartment.

The issue: where we live, it’s getting HOT. Our bedroom is around 30c at night, plus humidity. I put in our window A/C a couple of days ago and I feel like he spends most of his time turning it off.

Thing is, I can’t sleep in this kind of heat. I will toss and turn all night, and wake up hours early, and that’s WITH the A/C on. It’s way worse when it’s off.

I have tried to explain that this is not a matter of luxury, that I need to be able to sleep to continue to be productive at work etc. I guess he thinks I’m being dramatic/gluttonous because he keeps turning it off when he wakes up, which is usually at least two hours before I do (he is naturally an early riser and I am naturally a late one). By the time I woke up this morning our bedroom was back up from 22C to 27C.

I finally had it this morning and told him that I would start paying the entire hydro bill during the summer, if it meant I could run the A/C as needed. But is that really a fair compromise? Considering that it’s my basic comfort and ability to sleep that’s at stake, I’m a little pissed that he hasn’t tried hard to compromise himself, especially since the increase in hydro costs would be relatively negligible.

I also don’t want to “agree to disagree” on things like this - and I find his behaviour when it comes to these issues to be extremely an unfairly controlling. Am I wrong? If not, is my only option really to start striking out on my own and footing the entire bill for shared expenses because I need to add $10-$20 of use each month just to be able to sleep?

As an added layer, we’ve been talking about getting married for about 2 years now. He insists that he wants to have more money saved, but can’t seem to conceptualize how much. I worry that he has an unhealthy relationship with money that negatively affects our relationship. We’re not rich but we do okay. How can I help him understand (and have him take me seriously) that from my point of view he’s being unnecessarily frugal, and that I find it overly controlling and worrisome?

TL;DR: My boyfriend’s frugality with money is affecting our relationship and when I bring it up he thinks I’m being gluttonous. What do?"
"My [22m] older brother [28m] has a history of abusing his girlfriends and I’m worried about his new relationship.


My older brother, as long as I can remember, has always had tumultuous relationships with women. When I was 16 and he was 22, his girlfriend at the time called the police on him for alleged violence. 

But since there was no physical evidence and she refused to press charges, nothing ever happened from it. Either way, she broke up with him not long after and he brother took it very hard. He ended up showing up at her place and harassing her and she had to get a restraining order against him. 

Since then, I have been wary of relationships he has had with women. I’ve noticed questionable behaviour he has had around his girlfriends since then, such as controlling who or when they see people and grabbing them by the arms in public, etc. 

Every relationship that has ended though has been, from my understanding, mutual and I’ve never witnessed anything that really required me to step in. 

But now, my brother is engaged to this really lovely woman and I’m worried that it will end up like all the previous relationships and he will do something to hurt her. I don’t think she knows about what happened before and I don’t know if he has really shown her what he is capable of. 

I can’t talk to our parents about it because our dad was an abusive pos to our own mom and our mom would not take it well and I don’t want to cause her more stress. 

I don’t know whether it’s my place to talk to his fiancée about what he has happened and what he is really like. I don’t want to overstep my boundaries but also I don’t want her to get hurt. 

What do I do?

Tl;dr: My older brother is now engaged and I don’t know whether to confide in his fiancée about his abusive past. "
"The ghosts [39M] of my [32F] past are coming back to haunt me. How do I deal with this?


tl;dr: Broke up with my ex of 4 years last year in October because he refused to take care of himself. Received an email from a stranger this week that he needs help and that she's afraid he'll die for lack of..well, everything, basically. Not sure how to deal with this.

I [32F] had a relationship with my ex [39M] for for years. In retrospect, I don't understand why I stayed with him so long. He's a nice, caring, empathetic, funny man, but utterly unable to take care of himself. He had a rough upbringing, which is why I felt sorry for him, which I apparently shouldn't have. 

I let him quit his job in order to give him a chance to improve his life (as in, get educated and lose weight, mostly), but no matter how much time, energy, and money I invested in him, he never actually took any steps into...well, any direction at all. He just spent his time in front of the computer. After about two years of me trying to motivate him to do things he should have done for himself my patience finally ran out and I told him to get back to work.

He refused to do so. His reasoning was that I would continue to pay for him if I actually loved him, and my demand was just me trying to get rid of him (because if he actually took care of himself and his life it would be easier for me to leave him). He told me that he'd only get back to work if I promised him that I'd never ever leave him, no matter what. All of this was so ridiculous that I left. 

I felt intensely relieved after leaving him. Taking care of his neverending needs was so tiring that I basically had a functional depression during the last two years of our relationship. I forgot how joy felt, I was constantly terrified of the future, I neglected my friends and my hobbies, and I had recurring thoughts that dying might just be the easiest way out of this. Now that I only have to take care of myself (which I'm perfectly capable of), all of my worries disappeared. I feel like I finally rediscovered who I was after leaving him.

Now (7 months later) I got an email from a stranger telling me that my ex needs help, that ""his life has disintegrated into nothing. He sequestered himself in his flat and hasn’t left in months. He completely neglected himself and everything around him in every way; he lost all interest in life. Perhaps needless to say, his physical and mental health have reached dire straits. He can’t afford to see a doctor for help. His therapist told him he does not know how to help him. His health is so poor he cannot work. His government benefits have stopped.""

The email goes on to tell me that he ran out of (my!) money (apparently because he never got back to work after I left, as there was still some of my money left on his bank account), and that he needs money to get his life back on track because his health has deteriorated so much (due to utter self-neglect) that he won't be able to work before improving his health, which might take some time.

I don't know how to deal with this. In short, my ex used my money to neglect himself so much that some stranger is scared for his life and is asking me for help. I don't think this is a scam, for various reasons. I would like to help him, because I feel sorry for him, but I absolutely don't want to have my ex back in my life, the relationship with him has been draining enough. I feel really torn about this and don't know what to do."
"Me [26 M] with my fiance [26 F] together 2.5 years, just found out her roommate was also former fwb


I just found this out yesterday and oh bonus points our wedding is in the end of June.

When we first started dating I knew that she was renting an apartment with, I'll call him Dan, and they had been roommates for about 2 years.  I wasn't very comfortable with the idea but she assured me that he was like a brother to her and that he had a very stable LTR and his girlfriend and her were great friends.

Again, not thrilled but I tried to not think about it and ultimately it became a non issue because after dating for a year she moved in with me.

Well it comes to light this week that if he was like a brother to her there was incest involved because for well over a year prior to us getting together they were mostly sleeping in the same bed and the part that takes this to where I have told her that I am not sure I am going to go through with the wedding is that for .5 of our 2.5 years she still was fucking him.

Oh believe me she tried to deny all of this but basically she has learned the very hard lesson that she should not piss off her sister who has a habit of drinking and then not being able to control her mouth.

Once I would not give in to her denials she ultimately collapsed and gave in.  Not all at once mind you, at first it was they had done it a couple of times, then it was for a few months, then when I showed her a screen shot of a text that her sister sent me about needing a plan B and it was dated two months into us dating did she finally break down and tell the truth.

I feel very foolish to be honest with you.  I feel like the two of them were laughing behind my back the entire time she lived there.  Additional bonus points, she had me over there several times where he would eat with us and watch movies and shit.  Yea that makes me really happy right now believe me.

She swears that it has been over for two years, which is probably true because he moved to the other side of the country 2 years ago.

I've told her I need time.  For one I consider her a liar so I don't know that I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who lied to me for 2 and a half years.  For another it pisses me off to no end thinking there were times I took her home from a date only for her to hop in bed with him.  I don't even see her as the same person right now.

She is a basket case at the moment.  She was completely surprised that this came up.  Believe it or not I am not mad at her lying tonight to try and cover it up because I know she was panicked and very few people will just up and admit to something that they know might upend their world.  I am mad though at the two and a half years prior to that.

She is begging me to not leave her and she will do anything to work this out but right now I just can't see it.  I really can't see going through with our wedding, however I know either cancelling or postponing that is going to be a nuclear bomb because this is a big wedding with hundreds of family members from both sides.  Her family has paid a shit ton for the wedding.  But as it stands the idea of seeing her come down the aisle in a white dress all smiles and happiness actually nauseates me right now.

I'm a a loss at the moment and would really like some advice.  

tl;dr  Fiance lived with ""room mate"" for over a year.  Told me he was just a friend when we started dating.  2.5 years later we are about to be married but I just found out the friend was a FWB even when our relationship started.  I am now doubting the wedding plans. "
"My [23/M] fiancé [26/F] and I of 1.5 years called my family classless this morning and I'm not sure how to move on.


Just to clarify the title: We've been dating for 1.5 years total, we haven't been engaged for 1.5 years. 

Now just for some background:
My fiancé comes from a very affluent, wealthy, well-off family. She's American. Her parents work in Corporate America, and I believe are a borderline part of the Top 1%.

I come from a lower-middle class family. I was born in America, but my family emigrated to the U.S. from Europe before I was born. My mother works as a babysitter, and my father works a trade job.

Now for the details: Her and I were planning our wedding, when she got frustrated when I told her that my family couldn't help out with the wedding so much because we don't have a lot of money.
I tried reasoning with her about what would be the best way to split the costs between my family and her family. She got really upset and said, ""(The people from the country that my parents are originally from) are so classless... do you know how humiliating it is to say your dad is a (trade job worker) and your mom is a babysitter? She didn't feel that there was anything wrong with this comment. When I asked her to apologize for her insensitive comments, she said ""I am sorry I hurt your feelings but that doesn't change my feelings or my reality"". 

Reddit, I'm feeling upset. What can/should I do about all of this?

Please help me. Many thanks.

My husband and I have been married less than a year, together 3 years and known each other for 15. 


His mom is someone who has always been bad with money. I have no idea where her money goes, and up until this point it wasn't my business so I didn't care. But for example, she RECENTLY had land and a large chunk of a will given to her, she sold all the assets and the money just disappeared. She's taken two mortgages out on her home. Their dog had an expensive vet bill (about 10k) that she put on her credit card and has yet to pay off. The dog has been dead for over ten years. Stuff like that.


To top it all off, none of this has gone to my husband. He was borderline abused/neglected because even as a kid she made such a huge deal about them not having money that it guilted him into not eating at home. He'd eat the charity school lunch and have nothing at home. He put himself through college and has been working his whole life and paying her rent when they lived together, so it's not as if my husband ""owes"" her for college or anything. 


On the flip side, since my husband built himself up from nothing I've tried to be super supportive financially, and make sure we have a fully stocked kitchen. He was in an entry-level, get your foot in the door type job when we first got married. So I happily footed a majority of the bills (think 80-20 split). I didn't care about this and would have been happy if that was how things stayed forever, cause I was providing for my family. 


Recently he got the job promotion he was waiting for and things have evened out to about 60-40, me still paying the majority. We are by no means well off, **together we make about 60k** but it is more than either of us have had in our entire lives. We're planning on travelling, buying a house, getting a really good savings built up cause we know how things with money can go sideways. 


His mom has been **unemployed by choice** (she decided she deserved a break, not a health issue or retirement) for about 5 months, and dipping into her 401k to stay afloat. She's at the point where she's old enough to use it without a penalty. She is idly looking for a new job, but her requirements are insane (must pay 20+ per hour, must be a 10 minute drive or less, must have flexible hours etc. no college or education) and I know she'll likely never go back to work. 


My husband and his mom used to share bills, and when everything was divided up they decided Husband would pay for their cell bill, and MIL would pay for car insurance. Not to go off on another tangent, but she ""forgot"" to mention that our car was no longer able to be under her insurance (this is a bunch of BS for several verified reasons and could have hurt us badly because we had no insurance for a month without her telling us, but what's done is done) and we need to get our own.  


I thought this would mean the end of the cell phone/insurance trade off. MIL of course wanted husband to keep paying her phone, and says we owe her an additional insurance payment because she paid through so many months. And now my husband is saying he wants to pay it for her as well.


I know if my family was in financial need, I'd absolutely want to help them out. But my parents are both still working because they know they can't afford to retire yet, and I feel it's a huge cop out to just decide you're done working if you but can't support yourself, but are physically/mentally able to hold a job. Even a part-time job at this point would benefit her, since she spends all her time at home. Plus, I would ABSOLUTELY talk to my husband before just deciding to give my family $100 per month.


As you can tell, I don't trust my mother in law and I am not a big fan of her from how she's treated my husband throughout his life. I DO understand that my husband can choose to have whatever relationship he wants with her, so I'm trying to focus on the things I CAN change. 


**At the heart of this, I'm upset that he just made a decision to pay for her monthly phone and internet without discussing with me. It's high speed, so it's about $100 per month not going into our savings/house/travel fund.** The larger picture, of course, is I think she's bad with money and shouldn't be given this freebie when we've worked so hard to get to where we are.


I'm trying so hard to think of something to tell him that doesn't involve my money/your money, because I want it to just be OUR money. What words can I say to him to convey that we need to make financial decisions together? Especially cause this isn't just a, ""I wanted to give my mom a gift."" This is a continual monthly cost with no end in sight. There was zero discussion if we're paying this until she gets a part-time job, or if we're paying this until she's 90. 


**TL;DR:** My husband told me rather than discussed with me that he wants to pay a monthly $100 bill for his mom, no end date in sight. Give me a script to convey how we need to make financial decisions together."
"I'm in a mixed culture marriage (Filipina/Korean) my (26f) husband (28m) of 2 years just issued me an ultimatum regarding me not ""respecting"" my MIL. Basically I do whatever she asks or he's divorcing me.


Both my husband and I come from Asian cultures and despite being highly Americanized and 3rd and 2nd generation respectively, both our families still retain a lot of culture such as language and lots of customs. We are the first mixed culture couple among either of our families.

I love my husband so much and I had heard all the rumors about Korean mother in laws but she was so sweet when we were dating I had no idea what we were in for. To keep track of this in my head I'll list out the things I'm having a hard time with:

1. She essentially lives with us 3 months out of the year when the weather is nice here which just sort of happened without me being consulted

2. She screams at me when I speak Tagalog on the phone to my parents and says she can't handle a ""savage"" language in her presence. She says I'm stupid because I haven't learned Korean yet.

3. Twice, I've been crazy busy at work and didn't have time to cook on my night so I stopped and got us all Chilis. She threw it all away and made dinner while speaking in Korean to my husband. I know enough Korean to know she was calling me lazy and stupid and a mistake. I went to Chilis because it's her favorite...

4. Out of the blue she's going on our trip to Florida with us. But we have to pay for her flight, room, food...everything. I booked the trip back in January but she wants me to change everything. Her reasons are so varied I'm positive it's just a power trip.

So the trip was my last straw I told my husband she can't come with us and the expectation is ridiculous. If she doesn't want to be alone in our house than we can fly her back to his sisters where she was staying before. He said he needed some time to think. I honestly thought he was thinking about how to tell her.

He just got back to me and he said basically that ""you either honor my mother and our cultural traditions or I'm divorcing you."" I was so stunned because this is the first time in all our years of dating and marriage he's ever considered leaving me. I'm pulled over to the side of the road in tears because I'm devastated. I love him so much but crushed he would side with his mom and her ""respect"" over my very simple requests of not taking her on vacation and not wanting to be treated like a second class citizen in my own home.

I honestly don't know what to do...so what should I do in this specific situation? I don't want to be a quitter and divorcee after two short years with a man I love but I feel like he's shown me some true colors here and I need to listen.

What should I do?

**tl;dr: my husband issues me an ultimatum that I either show his mother the respect she deserves or he's divorcing me. Respect to her means keeping quiet when she calls me stupid and savage and taking her on vacation with us. What do I do?**"
"My baby sister [2F] is either scared of me or hates me with all her guts and I [19F] don't understand how or why.


I have a large family, 8 younger siblings (and 1 older), all under the age of 17, so I'm familiar with little kids and babies. I'll just explain our history together and someone could maybe guess what's wrong.

My whole family was living in Africa for three years. In January 2016 my mother and I came back, my mom gave birth to her in the USA (where we're from and live now) and went back to the rest of our family while my older sis and I stayed back with my cousins. My sis took a gap quarter before starting college and went to our family June 2016 to November 2016. So during that time everyone in my family had the chance to develop a solid relationship with my baby sister. 

Everyone moves back end of 2016, but after everyone's been settled for 4 months my mom moves to Canada to deal with issues from my uncle passing away. She takes my little sister along with her. Before they left my baby sis didn't despise me holding her (she'd rather be held then crawl), but I was the absolute last person of the 12 person household she wanted to be held by. 

My siblings and I visited our mother probably 5 times over the course of  March 2017 - March 2018. Her reactions towards me get worse and worse. I'd come visit, she'd cry if I touched her, and I'd leave her hating me. 

Now they've been back for 2 months and it's gotten worse. She cries out for my mom or to anyone near her  if I try to talk to her sweetly and starts gripping whoever is near her, as if she needs to be protected by me. My dad picks her up and I kid you not she glares at me while sniffing. We're sitting down for dinner and she gets this disturbed look and starts crying if I look at her. My whole family finds it hilarious and laugh at my expense, but I do not.

My familiarity with little kids has taught me that they will learn to trust you as long as you're kind, playful, and consistent.  I feel like enough time has passed already. My cousin has been staying with us for a month and after two weeks she's now able to carry around my sister and play with her. I'm so disturbed and jealous. I don't want her to start kindergarten with me never holding or playing with her. 

She only comes near me if I have cookies. She'll be crying and if I mention cookies she'll say, ""Cookie..."" and hold my hand. And then runaway when she gets the cookie and starts glaring me again. Someone please tell me what couI have a large family, 8 younger siblings (and 1 older), all under the age of 17, so I'm familiar with little kids and babies. I'll just explain our history together and someone could maybe guess what's wrong, before I give her diabetes from so many chocolate chip cookies. 

**TL;DR: I've been with my sister for quite sometime and she's known me long enough, but she still reacts badly when I show her affection. Her reaction towards me is she finds me disturbing. She's open to my cousins and the neighbors she barely sees. I don't look like an ugly witch, believe me. I'm not sure what's going on.**

"My [47F] daughter [20F] treats her boyfriend [21M] really bad. Should I say or do something?


I'm asking for advice here because I don't want anyone I know or knows my daughter to know any of this. For the record, my husband died of cancer when Amy was 2 years old.

My daughter Amy has been dating her boyfriend Harry for about 9 months. I don't know the specifics about how they met, I think it was through mutual friends. As far as I know, this is Amy's first serious relationship.

Harry is the sweetest joung man I've ever met. I met him a few days before Halloween last year when he was helping Amy with some homework. He introduced himself and was really polite (and really nervous), and he just seemed really nice, made an effort to talk to me and all that. Amy told me he's an engineering student like herself, and really smart. He stayed for dinner and left after. I asked Amy if she liked him and she said they had been going out for two months or so.

I've been seeing Harry around the house since, and I really like him. He's smart and nice and I think he really cares for Amy. He's always helping her with homework, gives her small gifts, I've overheard some bits of conversation, and well, I can see the way he looks at her. I know that's not of my business and aside from asking a few questions and a talk here and there (safe sex, boundaries, all that), I didn't pry. I'm just happy that he treats my daughter with respect and love.

That said, I've noticed something in the last four months or so. Of course this is from an outside perspective and I'm missing a lot of details, but I think my daughter is treating Harry really bad, even abusing him. The first time I noticed something, they were watching a movie on the couch. I try to give them space so usually I go to the study or my bedroom, or go out. I was walking by the living room and I heard Harry asking Amy something and Amy said ""f*** off, you are so annoying"". I don't think the tone was that of banter. Since then, there have been more instances of this behaviour. Harry saying something and Amy telling him to f*** off or to shut up, calling him idiot, stupid, ugly, disgusting... I don't know how did this happen, Amy has NEVER shown any behaviour like this. She doesn't treat her friends like this.

I admit that since I started noticing this, I have eavesdropped a few conversations between them, and there's nothing Harry says to set Amy off, I've heard her calling him a f***ing loser just because Harry asked her to go out on a saturday.

Meanwhile, Harry keeps being sweet and nice to her, even more than when I first met him. I haven't even heard him cursing, much less insulting Amy (I would kick him out in a heartbeat), so either he's really good at hiding it, or he's not doing it at all.

I don't know if I should say something. On the one hand, Amy is my daughter and I feel like I should side with her and I don't know the whole story. On the other, as far as I know Harry has done nothing to diserve this kind of treatment and I sorry for him.

What should I do?

TLDR: Daughter's boyfriend is really nice to her and me, daughter treats him awful."
"A very millennial tale...My self-employed gf [33F] works insane hours in order to afford her lifestyle and mortgage and resents me [32M] for it.


We have been together for a little over a year and this has been an ongoing issue. One of the primary factors involved is the fact that she purchased a very expensive home just prior to us meeting. Let's be clear - it's a wonder she even got approved for a loan for a home this expensive. 

Anyway, I spend most nights at her house because she doesn't want to stay at my apartment - which is fine.

The mortgage on this massive purchase stresses her out tremendously and she takes on loads of extra contract work in order to cover the cost of the home as well as the cost of her lifestyle (nice clothes, nice furniture, nice things). There are entire three weeks spans where she will be working until midnight every single night, including weekends. For those of you letting your minds wander, she has a home office so she is *around*, she's just in her office with the door closed.

Before I continue, I should mention another major factor: we are both self-employed and, on average, she makes about 3x what I make.

Nonetheless, I have recently begun contributing some rent (= to about 1/4 of the mortgage) since I am there so often, but I've held onto my apartment lease as well since I too work from home and need the office space. So now I too am stretched a bit thin. Even so, she has said on a number of occasions that she doesn't feel like I am financially able to contribute enough and so she has to work herself into the ground. She clearly resents me for it.

I can understand her frustration of feeling like she is doing all of the work to pay for the house we both essentially live in. But I work hard as well. I make okay money, in my opinion, and am pretty ambitious in my career. And I had no say in the purchase of this home or the financial planning that went into the purchase of the home.

Is it fair for me to feel bummed that:
a. she is always working and has very little time for our relationship
b. she resents me for something I have very little control over and have very little say in

And conversely, is it fair for her to feel upset that:
a. I am not contributing enough or am reaping the benefits of things that I can't afford
b. Am unfairly getting on her case about overworking and not spending enough time with me
c. I resent her for being somewhat financially irresponsible

**TL;DR** My girlfriend makes a lot more money than me and still can barely afford her mortgage. She resents me for not being able to contribute more. I resent her for her resentment and the amount of hours she spends working. What should we do?

"My Grandfather [77M] touches me [20F] and says inappropriate things to me. I don’t know how to deal with this


To start off, this has been going on for around 10 years. He started to act inappropriate towards me when I hit puberty. I was young back then and I didn’t realise what was happening right away. Luckily things haven't escalated too far, but it still really bothers me. 

There was a time where I was stuck alone with him often because he insisted that he needed to teach his grandchildren how to drive. After one of his lessons he French kissed me. I didn’t know what to do or say as I was young. I haven’t driven or been alone with him ever since.   

I have told my parents about his behaviour, but they aren’t supportive. My father pretends that he doesn’t understand what I’m saying. My mother acknowledged her father’s behaviour, but she believes that I should be nice to him because he is my grandfather. 

When he visits, I am expected to greet him with a hug and a kiss on the lips. I really hate it and I wish I could get him to stop. He doesn't kiss my sister at all. He also continues to make inappropriate comments about me. “Oh, you such a beautiful girl. I want to take you with me to my home. You’re the most beautiful girl in this town. Have you lost/gained weight?” He also likes to comment on the size of my breasts. When I ignore his comments, he proceeds to yell my name very loudly until I look at him. How should I react when he does this? Before anyone asks, I do not wear revealing clothing.

Now, every time he visits I try to avoid him. My mother does not like this behaviour. There is always the lingering fear that he will come in the house to find me and I will be stuck with him alone. I feel ashamed for hiding away from my family when he is here. 

How do I deal with this? This has been haunting me for years. I really need some advice and thank you for taking the time to read this. 

TL;DR My grandfather touches me inappropriately and makes inappropriate comments about my appearance and body. I need some advice on how to deal with this. "
"My husband (26M) wants to borrow money from my (26F) parents (60s) to give to his parents (60s).


I will make this as to-the-point as possible. I’m on mobile so apologies for formatting/spelling/typos. 

My husband and his parents have an arrangement that he will pay them back for his college education. As of right now, he owes them around $30,000. 

My husband recently decided that he is tired of owing his parents money and that he would like to pay them back the rest of the money right now. Problem: we don’t have $30,000 to spare. We’re living entirely off of my salary right now because my husband is in grad school. We’re managing, but it’s not like we have a ton of money lying around. 

My husband wants to borrow money from my parents so that we can give it to his parents. According to his logic, my parents are wealthy so it’s not like this will really affect them. I am uncomfortable with this for many reasons. First of all, my parents aren’t a piggy bank that we can just take money from. Second, I don’t like the idea of borrowing money from my parents to give directly to his parents. Finally, my parents won’t actually make us pay back the money and my husband knows this. He insists that we will pay them back, but I know that it won’t happen. 

I have raised my concerns with my husband and his response is that I’m “not being logical.”  I think he’s acting entitled. 

Reddit, I don’t want to borrow money from my parents. Especially not for this. How do I talk to my husband about this in a productive way? Am I wrong?

TL;DR: My husband wants to pay off money he owes to his parents by borrowing money from my parents. "
"My (21f) close friend (18f) is dating a 38 year old man and I don't know how to warn her about it


My friend met this man through Tinder (my fault because I showed her the app) and got a few fun dates from it. She then matched with this 38 yealt old man (because she was joking around with the app) and he somehow got her interest. 

Now, my friend is known for being impulsive and doing stupid stuff just because she can. 

He's odd to say the least. They went on a first date and he was very particular about what she had to wear and how and what to eat. So much to the point that he bought her make up and clothes to change to and put on (and she obliged??) He also told her upfront he wanted her to be skinnier and at the end of the date he asked her to be his gf? She accepted (?)

They've been gf and bf for a week now and today I went with her to the mall because she wanted to buy lingerie for him (a very specific one too). And I suddenly got really concerned for her because she hasn't done anything but kissing before and she told me that he tried to finger her before and it hurted so bad she cried. 
I told her not to get alone with him again and she isn't listening.

And even though they are technically 2 concenting adults I just can't stop thinking this is wrong and she's just a kid?

I have talked to her with some friends but it doesn't seem to help the situation, what should I do?

TL;DR: the dude is creepy as hell and controlling. He makes me scared for her, she won't listen to me or any of her other friends advice. What should I do or say?"
"My boyfriend [42M] told me [41F] not to bake anything for an upcoming BBQ at his parents house because “I am not that great in the kitchen”


I’m relatively new to this family (we’ve been dating for about a year and he introduced me a few months ago). His parents personally invited me to a BBQ they will be having and I wanted to try some recipes I found on Pinterest. This is the first time I will be meeting some of his family from out of town. I want to make a pretty good impression. 

Now his parents have been great to me over the period I have known them. His family seems.... like a family? I feel like my family was, and is distant and I just love how close his family is to each other. They make me feel like one of them. 

I talked to one of his sisters and she told me her brother, my boyfriend mentioned that I like to try out recipes/make desserts etc. She encouraged me to prepare something if I wanted too. 

I of course, would love too. Now my boyfriend eats my cooking. I’m not the best, but I’ve been learning online and feel like I’ve made great strides. 

I mentioned this to him and said hey I’m going to make this and bring it to your parents house for the BBQ. He said and I quote “Yeah I’m not sure about that, I mean do you really think it will taste good?” I didn’t get what he meant... and then he proceeded to tell me that I should just leave it for everyone else and I don’t have to contribute, that I am a guest. 

Didn’t understand why he was saying what he was saying, I mean he was saying it in a joking way. He said look, you’re not that great at cooking, I don’t want you to feel bad if people don’t like what you made, please stay out of it. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I’ve let other people try my cooking/sweets and they have liked them. (People who would be honest if it didn’t taste good), and he eats what I make for him? His sisters are pretty good in the kitchen, and according to him I am not... so why should I bother? 

Not gonna lie, my feelings are hurt. I felt so excited and encouraged and I feel like he just crushed it.

TLDR: Boyfriends parents invited us over for a BBQ, I wanted to bring a homemade dessert and was encouraged by his sister. He doesn’t want me too and says I’m not good in the kitchen. He eats my cooking and now I just feel bad and discouraged."
"I [29F] am sadly ending my relationship with my [30M] boyfriend after several scary escalating physical altercations, need advice on how to end it. [LONG]


So I'll preface this by saying I am more on the extrovert side with higher needs for attention, affection and connection. SO is the polar opposite, extroverted with intense need for his own space, time and freedom. We both knew this very well as we've been friends for over 15 years and previously dated around 6 years ago. 

I have an 8 year old son and just started going back to college. When he moved back to our hometown I was hesitant to start a relationship because I have so much on my plate. I was sharing a rental with my mother at the time, and that was working out nicely. We shared the rent and expenses which was a huge financial relief for me, and very kind of her to give up her privacy to share a home with us to help me like that.

Several months ago we were talking about moving in together since he spent the majority of his time at my place anyway. I spoke to my mother about the situation and she did not want to stay in the big house we rent by herself, so she planned to move out when SO was ready to move in which we decided would be after his lease is up this September. Then suddenly in the middle of April he ""surprised"" me by asking his landlord to try to find someone to take over the lease asap so he could move in, since he was paying rent for an apartment he seldom ever went to. It was inconvenient timing but I told my mother and she was understanding and began looking for a place.

Shortly after his decision to speak to them, we got in a particularly ugly argument during which he broke and threw my ear buds at me and slammed my laptop closed on my hands. I do realize that's mild as violence goes but it was a red flag for me, and he spent a few days at his apartment before we met in a coffee shop to talk about things. I was very direct in my expectations, and that unless he was willing to speak to a counselor we couldn't continue the relationship. At this point I should add that our first run with a relationship 6 years ago ended over a similar mildly violent argument. He lost his shit while we were talking about I don't even remember what in the car, and began screaming with his face right in mine and poking me really hard in the chest (I know that sounds a little silly, but it was hard enough to hurt and he did it over and over while yelling at me.)

He agreed to pursue counseling and a psychiatrist and medication if necessary for his anger and control issues. However, he never followed through on that despite me reminding him. He felt that it was overkill for something that happened one time. Shortly after that argument, his landlord found someone and he had to be moved out TEN days later, smack dab in the middle of my finals week. We had already spoken about my need for his extra help and support during finals week, so it was really inconvenient timing. I managed to make it through finals week while helping him move (he didn't want to ask any of his friends for help, and aside from a large dresser and couch his brother helped with, he and I did all the moving and cleaning his old apartment.)

At this point he's been moved in about a month. My mother moved out just yesterday and last week is when things started escalating. We got into an argument starting over something very trivial over how he handled a situation with my son. I told him how I felt he was being a little unfair and he went off the deep end on me, he started yelling, cursing, calling me names, telling me I've done a terrible job raising my son, just losing it. So I excused myself from the room and calmly told him we should cool off and talk more about it later, that it's not ok to be screaming at me like that especially when my son is home. He yelled something along the lines of he's the MAN and I better not walk away from him, but i felt it was the wise idea to de escalate.

Apparently my walking away set him off even worse, and as I was in the kitchen getting dinner on the table he walked through on his way out the door, pulled the back of my hair and got right in my face screaming fuck you. My son happened to walk into the kitchen right as that was happening. Of course my primary focus was calming him down because he's never seen anyone do anything like that before, let alone to his mom. I explained to him that it was not ok, but that I'm ok and I'm not hurt etc. After I was sure he was calmed down and ok I went outside to address SO. He was apologetic and said he knew he crossed a line again. He again agreed to seek out professional help, and I gave him until this past Wednesday to do so because that was when my mom was signing her new lease. He again did not follow through with it.

He then proceeded to go out with his family and friends all week, go to the bar, pretty much do whatever he wanted while my son and I were still reeling from that kitchen event. I made my displeasure known and told him I'm going to need him to prioritize repairing the relationships with my son and I now, and put his friends and drinking on the back burner. He was upset by this, felt I was being unreasonable and demanding. He did literally nothing to even attempt to make up for what he did. When I mentioned that the other day he asked if I wanted him to buy me something. I said no, I need to feel like you actually give a shit about fixing things after you did that. He said he needed some time apart to feel better, so he was sorry he didn't give me the time I needed to be together to feel better. 

We agreed that this weekend and next week would be all us to make up for it. We had what I thought were some very healthy conversations about our respective needs, how I've been handling things when they don't go my way [I have been pretty pissy this last week over feeling that my son and I were neglected by his going out and prioritizing everyone over us] He DID actually find a counselor and look into his insurance, and said he would make the appointment next week. It seemed like things were looking up. 

My mom officially moved into her new place yesterday and invited my son for a sleepover so we had a date night to try to reconnect, something we seldom get to do and were long overdue for. I pitched the ideas of escape room, an art walk in a neighboring city, and several other non-alcohol related things because I figured that was the last thing we needed to add into the mix while we're in a fragile state. We went to the art walk and it ended up pouring so we dipped into a bar to escape the rain. He had 2 beers and I had 1 1/2 but he did have 3 glasses of whiskey before we left the house and some wine at a cigar lounge we stopped into.

While I snuck into the bathroom to tell my son goodnight on the phone, he got a call from a friend and as I was returning from the bathroom I overheard him making plans for him to come to our house and drink tomorrow (today.) I was very upset since this weekend and week were supposed to be focused on us. I told him I wanted to go home. He accused me of ruining our date night with my unreasonable need for 100% of him.

I went outside to clear my head and smoke a cigarette and he followed me, we started arguing and he went to flick his cigarette at my face but didn't actually do it. That was enough for me to walk away though, and I found another place to get away from the rain and went to order an uber to go home. He texted me telling me he'll just pick me up and we won't fight in the car which we didn't.

Once we got home we began arguing again, I told him my needs weren't being met and I felt he was putting himself and everyone else before my son and I. He argued that my needs are unreasonable and started with name calling again and broke up with me and said that I will never find anyone who wants to spend so much time with my son and I and be a family. I lost control and slapped him. He seemed almost smug when I did that, like he was happy that he got me to that point.

Disgusted with myself, I went downstairs to cool off and called my friend to vent. I have never done anything like that and I just felt sick. I went through the story, including what happened last week and how this past week has gone etc. He overheard the conversation and flipped out, screaming about me demonizing him and making him look like a bad guy and a psycho. Then he grabbed me and pinned me up against a wall squeezing my wrists really hard, screaming at me, hitting me against the wall and then slapped me. Then he took my phone and wouldn't give it back and was pushing me, trying not to let me out of the bedroom. I got away and ran downstairs, afraid of what else he might do. He chased me, screaming at me. I have no house phone so I ran to my neighbors' house and they took me in and called the police. After questioning both of us they asked if I wanted to press charges or file a PFA. I told them I just wanted him to leave, and they talked him into doing that.

He came over bright and early this morning to pick up clothes, and tried to talk to me as if this was something else we just have to ""work through"" he called me a sociopath when I told him I can't get past this, and it is indeed over. He's been texting me all day asking me to talk to him, saying that we can work this out, that we didn't even get started on getting help from a counselor etc and it's ridiculous for me to throw in the towel when ""help is just around the corner.""

I know I need to walk away, I will not put my son or myself in this type of situation. I just don't know how to handle talking to SO about it. It is a heartbreaking situation, and I am hurting incredibly over it. Sorry this was such a rant, and I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read it and offer advice.

"I think my [20F] best friend/room mate [19F] is using veganism as an excuse not to eat anything


So I've known ""Kate"" for about eight years, and this year we are sharing a flat together. Kate has always been obsessed with the idea that she is overweight, despite the figures actually indicating that she is underweight, even for her petite height (she's about 5ft). 

She's always had a very on/off, love/hate relationship with food and last month, she decided to become vegan because she loves animals. I'm vegetarian so I supported her decision, even though I'd personally find it very difficult to live on a strict vegan diet. 

Since she became vegan, she's barely eating anything and she looks so ill and exhausted. Every time I offer to make breakfast or bring her out for some lunch, she'll find a reason not to go. Is she using veganism as an excuse to just not eat? Because I want to say it to her, but I don't want to sound like I'm just hating on her ethical choices when I'm not! 

Tl;dr - I think my best friend is pretending she is vegan to hide the fact that she's not eating anything "
"[28M] My SO [28F] Stole $700 in cash from my sock drawer.


I need advice...

My SO stole a large amount of cash from my sock drawer, and used it to pay her mothers rent. Her relationship with her mother is strange and complicated. Basically, the mom was abusive to her during her formative years, and she now depends on the daughter to help her all the time. 

Her mom is a nasty person, with a bad temper and a worse work-ethic. She's mentally unstable and threatens to kill herself on a regular basis because ""no one cares about me"" and ""I'm an awful person"" wah wah wah. 

Anyways the mom lost her job after Christmas and has since given up looking for work. This leaves her 3-Bedroom townhouse with no one to pay the rent. Apparantly in March, the mother was begging SO for money so she wouldn't get evicted. Instead of saying ""I don't have the money,"" SO said she would see if plaqston would help. SO knew that i would never agree to give her cash, so she took it from where she knew i kept my rainy day cash. 

The mother was evicted anyways. It turns out that you need to pay rent every month, and after SO helped her, nothing happened, and she was kicked out in May, and has since ended up in a temporary living situation. 

Yesterday, i was looking for my cash and saw it was gone. I thought we were maybe robbed, but no. I called up SO and she broke down about how her mother needed help and had no one to turn to and didn't want her to commit suicide and felt so guilty for taking it and not telling me. 

For background, know that SO and i have had a great relationship. We never fight, we have great physical chemistry, we live together, we each have access to each others bank accounts. We have a solid trusting relationship. 

I don't know what to do. 700$ is a lot of money for us. I have student loans and have a car in disrepair. There are a million other things the money could have went to, but the big issue is Trust. How do I trust her any more? 

TLDR: SO stole money from my sock drawer and used it to help her abusive mother make rent

"My (20f) boyfriend (21m) is mad at my for masturbating


so this morning my bf (of 6 months) and I were having sex and I decided to pull out my vibrator which we’ve talked about using but never have before. I told him I got a new battery for it so its really strong and he asked when I last used it? I told him last week sometime and all of a sudden everything 180d. He got dressed and asked me to take him home, I asked him whats wrong and if he was being serious, he said yes and that he was upset but he didn’t want to talk about it.
 I drove him home and nothing was said the whole drive and then when we got to his apartment he said “well that was fun hanging out with you thanks”. I calmly told him that he asked me to bring him home so I did and he said “well I’m sorry I don’t like the idea that my girlfriend is master bating to other guys”. 
I asked him who told him that because it was completely out of no where and he said “you pretty much accidentally told me you do when you said you used your vibrator last week”. I stayed calm and told him I didn’t and I was just master-bating as a study break (lol).
    Anyway he says that he knows this is true because i didn’t tell him that i master-bated and I tell him everything, and he has a car he could have just come over. He stormed off after I tried to reassure him that this is not true and that it just never came up in conversation it was just an innocent vibrator sesh. So he texts me to not text him and I reply that ill leave him alone and to call me when he wants to talk more about it later. 
Later he sends me a long text saying a bunch of things about me lying about loving him and he said something pretty hurtful about a drunken mistake i made last summer that involves my ex (the story is much too long to tell).
So to that long message I replied that I love him and im here for him and that i would never be malicious towards him. 
He didn’t reply.
SO I work with him in an hour and I have no idea what to expect and I am super anxious I can’t eat. I know I did nothing wrong but I am just nervous as to what to do if he apologizes or if he doesn’t? I honestly kinda just needed to vent so ty if u read this and if u could give me some advice for what to do when I see him at work it would be much appreciated!

TLDR: my bf of 6 months thinks I master-bated to another guy because I didn’t tell him when I used my vibrator and I have work with him in an hour "
"My [31 M] Wife [31 F] told me she regrets marrying me a day after wedding.


I've been engaged for a year and a half, we finally got married last Sunday. A few days before the wedding, I tried to talk to her about how I felt she was being distant. I figured she was stressed about the upcoming wedding and wanted to ease any tension. I tried to tell her something like... ""Don't stress about making the wedding perfect, I love you very much, and just being able to share this day with you makes it perfect for me... let's have more sex"". It did not go as planned, I blew up in a heated argument, what I wanted to say ended up being ""I could not care less about the wedding"" and I know I hurt her feelings deeply. I apologized the next day and tried to clear the misunderstanding. I felt we were okay.

The day of the wedding comes, everything goes smoothly in my opinion until we get back to the hotel. Again, little to no intimacy. I asked her about it the next day, and she tells me that she regrets marrying me and only did it because of all the money we spent on it. That the fight we had a few days before left a very bad impression and she is unsure of everything.

She's remained distant, I took a week off from work after the wedding. She spent one day with her niece going for a walk. She spent memorial day weekend at her parents house. I try and talk to her about it, but I feel it's making things worse. I don't know what to do, it feels like my relationship fell apart overnight.

**TL;DR; : Felt my wife has been distant, tried to talk but made things worse. Now my wife regrets marrying me**.

"Father is asking me (23f) to buy gifts for his mistress


Story time: about 10 years ago, me and my older sister found out our father was cheating on my mom with a younger woman. It turns out this was not the first time. Finding all the evidence, we told my mom about it. Even though she was devastated, she decided to remain with him (she was worried about social status as well as us not getting money).

Fast forward to now. My sister no longer speaks with our parents and my father has continued to cheat on my mom. Literally my household has become a minefield of emotions. I am still in contact with my sister but my parents are resistant with that relationship. My father and mother no longer speak to each other to the point that it’s two strangers living in a house but still refuse to get a divorce. I’ve had to mediate between both parents since middle school to point where I am so desensitized to my fathers cheating that I just don’t give a shit. Along with this, my father continues to hold it over me that I ruined his marriage as well as his chance of a personal life.

A couple of days ago, my father asked me to buy a purse for one of his lady friends when I was on a shopping trip with my mom. I actually bought the purse thinking in some sense it would garner some affection for myself. I honestly felt so guilty that I had to return it since I had to lie to mom to actually get the purse. My dad now no longer is speaking with me and is calling me a coward for not buying the purse. It’s obvious my father is a toxic part of my life but some part of me wants to try help change him. Any advice please?

TL;DR: See title. Trying to figure out how to change him or get him some help"
"at first I was just annoyed with my [23m] girlfriends [20f] laugh. But now I find it unbearable. Is my only option to break up?


Been with my girlfriend for about 7 months. For the most part she's great but her laugh is something like out of a horror movie. It's one long noise that starts out like a growl then ends in a high pitched shriek. If she laughs in a restaurant people will stare. We went to a comedy club and a comedian actually stopped in the middle of his jokes and asked ""what is that?"" And made fun of her for a good five minutes.

As for me first few dates, I found it shocking and cute, then it was annoying and now I cringe so hard my face hurts when I hear it. I don't think she even has the possibility can change. Is my only option to break up with her?

"On my 6th date with this awesome guy [27M] and we saw his ex , what the hell happened


Red flags on the 6 th date. Okay so I’ve know this guy a couple of weeks I’m pretty sure he will ask me to be with him soon. Yesterday we went to a bar and everything was going fine until around being there twenty minutes in. 

About 10 pm this woman walks in with a guy and they walk past our table and the guy I’m seeing starts staring this lady down from the time she walked in until she sat down. So i shrugged it off and assumed maybe she caught his eye or something. But, every few minutes he would peep around my chair to look at this woman. So i asked him “do you know her or something ? You keep glancing at her really hard?” He said “well yeah that’s kind of my ex” and i said “how is she kind of your ex?” He said “well we weren’t exclusively dating but i broke up with her because i felt like our relationship was going nowhere” and i said “Ohokay” 


We ended up having a great time at the bar until it was time to go this is where the red flags come in. The guy I’m dating starts talking about his “kind of ex”. He says “i don’t know why she’s with that loser, she’s too good for him, i hope he’s treating her right, i hope she knows he only wants one thing” 

And i said “ why do you care?” And he said “i don’t i just don’t want her to be stupid “

So i shrugged it off we got up and left. While in the car he called this girl (kind of ex) i know it was her because he told me while in the car that he’s going to call her 

So he called her ,she answered and he started fussing at her , he said “i guess you got a new friend huh?, what happened to you texting me yesterday? , so i guess you only talk to me when you’re not going out with your new friend and don’t have nothing to do , I’m just convenient ? Idk if she was answering his questions or what and he said “well you’re lazy if you can’t text me back but go out and text someone else”



TL:DR; He hung up the phone and drove me home and hasn’t called texted me since the bar, I’m super lost what did i get myself into? What the hell happened a few days ago"
"I (25 F) was given a bombshell letter from my SO (27 M) that he told me to open on my plane leaving the country for 2.5 months.


Hi all, I’ve been seeing this guy for about 5 months who I met online. We really hit it off and have been dating happily - until now! 

He is from India and told me when we met he is studying in the US on a student visa getting a masters in IT while also working part time. He is an incredibly sweet guy and fun to be around, I’ve really enjoyed dating him. I thought we could have a serious future. 

I will be working abroad for 2.5 months over the summer and will not see him during this time, which he has known since we started seeing each other. He told me about a week or two before I left he was going to write me a letter that he wanted me to open and read on my airplane leaving the country. True to my word, I did not open the letter until I was on the plane. 

In the letter he told me he has been lying to me about school since we met, he works 5 days a week for cash under the table. He is not getting his masters. It wasn’t a total lie in that he did start an IT program when he first came to the US, but neither he nor his family could afford the tuition. He tried for scholarships and financial aid, but that did not pan out and he later did some sort of IT certificate program. So he does work in IT at some place (which I thought was part time but is actually full time). But I have no clue what his visa status is, and since he’s not in school I think he might be staying in the country illegally (but I’m no expert on how visas work). 

I really don’t know how to feel about this. On the one hand I feel awful that he has struggled so much to live in the US and that he has no support system to help him achieve his goals - I want to help him. But on the other hand I feel totally dismayed and upset that he would lie to me for so long. 

He seems genuinely remorseful about this and said he was so embarrassed. He wanted to tell me in person, but couldn’t bring himself to do it. I think it is a white lie from our first date that somehow snowballed out of control for him. 

I would really like to pursue this relationship further, but I feel very hurt and confused right now about this. What do I do, Reddit? 

TL;DR: My SO of 5 months told me in a letter as I was leaving the country for the summer that he’s been lying to me; he isn’t getting his masters like he has been saying since I met him.  "
"My new boyfriend [25/M] is getting a tattoo relating to his ex?


Okay, so I've known my boyfriend almost a year now and we've been close friends all that time. Then a couple of months ago he admitted he had feelings for me so we started seeing each other. We aren't even ""official"" yet but because we've been close for a while it feels like things are heading in a good direction and I'm pretty confident we both love each other every much.

He'd been talking about wanting to get a tattoo of a lynx (the animal) for a while and he showed me this design he liked which I really approved of. But earlier today I decided to look up his ex online. I'm not sure what prompted me to do this (general curiosity I suppose). After browsing through her Twitter and Instagram accounts I saw that she'd recently got a lynx tattoo as well, and judging by her history she's been obsessed with lynxes for years and I saw a post from last year where her boyfriend (now my boyfriend) got he loads of lynx related gifts. 

I know this is probably a silly thing to worry about, but I can't help but feel like my boyfriend wants to get a lynx tattoo as it connects him to her and that makes me feel like I'll always be second best. Like, I know he was very much in love with he but they broke up because she cheated on him. Since I've known him she's tried to contact him many times and once when I was sleeping in his bed, she was calling him all throughout the night (he didn't answer). So I guess I'm worried one day he'll cave and want her back. It's not like he's ever really mentioned his love for lynxes, apart from the tattoo. It seems like it was purely HER thing.

I don't know if I should talk to him about this as it might make me seem really creepy looking through his ex's old posts, especially since we've not been together long. But now every time he talks about getting the lynx tattoo I feel so anxious. What should I do?

TL;DR -- My boyfriend wants to get a lynx tattoo, but I've only just realised his ex was obsessed with lynxes. Do you think this is related to her? Does he still think of her as the love of his life?"
"I [21] am very uncomfortable with my mother [41] getting married for the sixth time to a guy she has known a month.


My mother recently went to the beach with my sister and met a guy there from Alaska with his grandkids. She ended up spending most of her time after my sister left in frustration (they've had a rough relationship for a while). The next month my mother flies to Alaska for a week, and missing my brief return from college before I had to go back for summer classes. While up there she got engaged and now this guy and his grand daughters are moving down to my mothers house in August. 


None of my family is for this and whenever I voice my concerns she just tells me she thinks he is really going to be good for her. My brother and I are also very suspcious of a guy who would propose to someone after a month and quickly move across the continent to live with them. I'm just not really sure what to do any more.


TL;DR:My mother met a guy on vacation and is now marrying him after a month as her sixth husband despite the objections of her family members. "
"Couple's Counselor Told Me I am ""Lacking as a Mother."" Would Appreciate Some Feedback.


My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately. It's pretty standard stuff, so we went to couple's counseling for the first time today, and while it was helpful for our relationship the counselor also lowkey berated me for being a bad mother.

We live in a small city in South Korea, so the only counselor available nearby was someone who specializes in children's language development and not couple counseling.

Her main issue was that my son is 22 months old and cannot yet speak in full sentences. He can understand pretty much everything we say in daily conversation, and can say about 40 English words such as mama, papa, car, bulldozer, cloud, sun, moon, yellow, red, blue etc. and also 10 Korean words.

When my husband mentioned this in passing, the counselor was visibly shocked and told me I really need to re\-evaluate my role as a mother because I am ""extremely lacking in effort."" \(She said this to me in Korean.\) She told me that my Korean was really bad for someone who has been living in Korea for the last 8 years, and as a mother of a Korean child raised in Korea, I need to be doing everything in my power to make sure I am fluent in Korean...otherwise my child will not be able to communicate with his friends. \(I don't think there were any racist or xenophobic intentions here.\)

I am Korean American, and I already worked really hard to improve my Korean. My Korean level is good enough that I can pass as a native Korean in terms of my accent, speaking, and writing ability...We had a 1.5 hour conversation with the counselor and there was literally only one word that I did not understand. I had never heard of the phrase 풋대접, and when I asked what this word meant is when the counselor went on her tangent about how I am a bad mother.

Also, I am currently still breastfeeding, which the counselor found appalling.

So I have three questions...

1. Is it really that bad that a 22 month old boy can't talk in sentences yet?
2. Am I a terrible mother for not being perfectly fluent in Korean? I am already ""fluent"" enough that whenever I mention I am not native Korean...people are shocked and say they couldn't tell.
3. Is it okay for me to keep breastfeeding until 24 months?

tldr: Am I a bad mother for not being fluent in the local language?"
"How do I [15 M] tell if my girlfriend [15 F] is ready for a kiss?


This is both mine and my girlfriend’s first relationship, and we have been dating for a little bit under a month now and things have been great. We are both very open with each other, telling each other our feelings and stuff like that. On the first date we held hands, and then it has moved on from there, with my arm around her shoulder and hugging and snuggling. 

I want to take it to the next step though and I’m not sure how to. I’ve tried to make eye contact with her to go in for a kiss, but she does not hold eye contact for very long. I think that it is because of nervousness and butterflies because she has told me that she gets butterflies around me. But not holding eye contact could also be a sign that she doesn’t want to kiss.

How do I tell if she wants to kiss or not?
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

**TL;DR** - Wondering how to tell if girlfriend is ready for a kiss."
"Me [19F] with my Mum [52F] and my older sister [21F] My older sister is no-contact with Mum. Mum has decided to confront sister herself (in a city a day's journey away) leaving me and younger siblings behind.


I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. The story is quite long, and there are a lot of details to it that make it very complicated, so please bear this in mind when you reply.

My older sister (who we'll call Charlie) is actually my half-sister. She has a different Dad but the same Mum as me. Her whole life she was raised as a full-sibling, as my Mum forbid Charlie's Dad, and by extension Charlie's half-siblings from contacting her except for 2 occasions. Instead Charlie had to live with Mum and my Father (not her bio one) who was emotionally and physically abusive. 

Recently (2yrs ago) my Father (Charlie's non-bio one) and my Mum got a divorce. It was found out that he was cheating on her with mentally impaired women from his medical practice, and it got on the news etc. We haven't seen him in 2 years. All of a sudden, after years of ignoring us complaining about his abuse, she hated him and he was the devil, bla bla bla. Basically we weren't allowed to hate him until he eventually hurt her as well. She drew the line at herself, not her kids. This is relevant because the divorce made her more erratic and unstable, and also is one of the reasons Charlie stopped contact.

Charlie also stopped contact because she only found out, on her 21st birthday, that Mum was actually the reason that her and her bio-Father had never had a relationship when she was younger. She took a while to process this information, she actually thought about it and decided to go no-contact. She told me this, but she didn't tell Mum. For Mum, the contact slowly petered out into nothing. Mum always complains to me and grills me about what's happening with Charlie, but I don't tell her because that's none of my business. 

Mum left a note on my birthday-card today reading ""Please, wherever you go- keep in contact with me."" This was obviously because she is angry and sad about Charlie not contacting her. She always makes passing comments about ""all her children hating her,"" and ""she isn't busy enough to not contact her mother"" but is especially hard on me about it because Charlie still contacts me sometimes.

Today it escalated a little bit when Mum told me that this Sunday she was leaving and flying/driving up to where Charlie lives to pay her a visit, leaving me with my two younger siblings. This is a day's journey. She is not even warning Charlie about it. I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want to get involved, but I think this is a bad idea. I think she should give Charlie some space, respect her boundaries and her no-contact decision. Mum will find it hard to accept because she is a proud, stubborn women and I'm wondering how this will impact her already turbulent mental health. 

This begs the question, should I warn Charlie about it, or talk to Mum about it, or stay out of it completely?

tldr; Mum is journeying up to where half-sister lives to confront her about no-contact decision. Half-sister made this decision due to some secrets that came out about her father just last year. Should I intervene and warn Charlie or not?

EDIT: I've let Charlie know via text that Mum may be coming up this Sunday. Hopefully she gets the text in time.

Thank you for replying everybody, I just want to clarify a few things. I am working on moving out. My Mum can be unstable, she was one of the mentally unstable women from my Dad's practice, that's how they met. And no, she isn't aware that there is a hard boundary in place (not that I know of) and I'm too scared to tell her because of her reaction. Shes not physically violent, she never has been, but she can be quite scary mentally sometimes."
"My (18F) boyfriend screamed at me for the first time today. Justified?


I'll keep this as short as possible and just tell you guys what happened. For background, we've been dating around 1.5 years.

Today was the first day of his internship, and he offered to pick me up from my internship \(30 mins for him one way\). I offered TWICE to meet him for dinner instead of making him drive, but he insisted on picking me up. He picks me up and I thank him for making the drive. We then spend 45 minutes taking headshot pictures for him since he wants a new Linkedin profile pic. We get in the car, he wants to have sex. I tell him no because he was a little rough over the weekend and my lady bits hurt. He gets huffy and asks for a blowjob instead. During the BJ, he repeatedly forced my head down when I tried to come up and I had to fight extremely hard to not throw up, especially when he came. Btw\- we have sex at least once a day.

After the BJ \(no thank you from him\), he asks if I want to go to an expensive restaurant. We just went shopping yesterday, so I told him not really since I don't want to spend more money. I also don't like sweets and he knows this, and the place was a dessert place. He then proceeds to get mad at me and harp on me about how he drives all this way, why can't I agree with his ideas etc etc. I apologize and say okay, let's go. He CONTINUES to rag at me about not being happy enough and ""why can't you be more excited?"" We get to the place, I pay for dinner \($40\) and when we get out he asks me to drive. I have my learner's permit and have only been driving for a week, so I tell him no, I don't feel comfortable. I told him TWICE but he straight up got out of the car and refused to drive ""you're driving. I'm tired."" So, despite being uncomfortable, I drove.

10 minutes in, I misjudged the timing of the stoplight \(still new to driving\) and cut it close with the yellow/red light. He FREAKS out and tells me if he gets fined, I'm paying for it and how his insurance is gonna go up \(his parents pay for insurance..\). He continues to criticize me, pretty meanly and loudly, for most of the drive. It was my first time on the highway and so I asked him to check for me before switching lanes \(I was nervous\) and he refused. ""You should fucking learn how to do this yourself."" I ended up missing the turn and the whole time I was extremely nervous and scared.

We turn into my neighborhood, and I try to apologize about the stoplight. I reminded him that I tried to refuse twice since I'm new to driving. I wasn't intentionally being careless, I just am not a good driver yet. I'm learning. I was trying to tell him that in the future I didn't want to drive until I'm good yet, but he misinterpreted and flipped out about me ""trying to blame it"" on him and SCREAMS at me to ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR."" I'm talking SCREAMED. I have never genuinely been scared of my boyfriend before but in that moment I was terrified. I should add on I have PTSD and am very sensitive to anger and loud voices. He has given me a panic attack twice \(he gave me one 2 days ago actually\) and he knows full well how badly I handle people raising their voices at me. He screamed at me so loudly that my neighbor who was walking his dog refused to let me go into my house myself and insisted on talking to my parents about ""I hope you know how this boy is treating your daughter.""

2 hours later and no apology. Nothing. I genuinely don't think he thinks he did anything wrong. He always complains about driving me, but when I tell him he doesn't have to, he insists on it then complains and holds it over my head the entire time we hang out.

So Reddit, how do I handle this situation? I am genuinely shocked that he could treat me like this and think it's okay. I'm just scared of breaking up because I had fault too \(not being careful with his car, not showing more gratitude when he drives a lot for me, etc\) but the fact that he hasn't apologized about screaming at me really makes me feel like shit. I know I'm wrong too, but damn. Somehow ""accept that you're both wrong"" doesn't make me feel better this time. I don't want to break up, but damn..

TLDR; My boyfriend made me drive even though I told him I didn't want to twice \(I have a learner's permit and have only been driving for a week\) and then yelled at me for making a mistake, and screamed at me to get out of his car."
"My boyfriend(26 M) asked for an open relationship while we were fighting. An old love interest of him has just come back into his life. I (26 F) said no, but I'm worried.


My boyfriend \(26 M\) asked for an open relationship while we were fighting. I \(26 F\) said no, he fought it for a while, and then he decided he wants to be with me and work it out. An old love interest of his has just come back into his life, and he admitted that that played a part in his decision to ask for an open relationship. He was the one who was insistent on a monogamous relationship with me when we started dating. This old love interest had cut him out of her life for years and just initiated contact, so the fact that his feelings were still strong enough to ask  for an open relationship is worrying to me. He keeps insisting it was just a bad suggestion, but now I feel like I would be anxious all the time about our relationship. I'd even feel worried about fighting with him, because I fear he'd just run off to her, or some other woman. Am I over reacting? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do?

 TL;DR: I said turned down my boyfriend's request to open the relationship, which he made while we were fighting. He wants to stay and work on things. But I fear he will resent me, and that I am going to feel very anxious all the time, moving forward. What would you do in this situation?"

So backstory, my husband and I started dating in 2010, and got married in 2014. We have had ups and downs like every couple, but I didn’t think it was anything major. I was happy, and thought he was the same. 

Well fast forward a few years, and I get pregnant - it was planned. Unfortunately, the first pregnancy didn’t work out, and I had a pretty tough time with it (both emotionally and physically). I get pregnant again last May and baby is healthy! I will be the first to admit, I wasn’t a happy pregnant lady. I hated my body, and after losing 60 lbs before our marriage seeing myself in this form really took a toll on me. 

Sooo, in December, we get into a fight and my husband drops a bombshell on me and tells me he is leaving me after the baby is born and that he has been unhappy for some time now. I am just giving a brief TLDR of this time period. Next day, he tells me we will talk about it later that night, and I thought he was just being dramatic due to the fight. He takes me to our favorite restaurant to talk about it, at the table we always sit at when we go (after eating!) and proceeds to tell me more about how he doesn’t want to be with me. He tells me he is going to stay in the basement and we will figure something out after the baby - I am 8 months pregnant at this time and completely devastated. I couldn’t eat, and when I did it would make me sick. I called into work, and my whole life was turned upside down. After a few days of him staying downstairs, I tell him I was going to a marriage counselor with or without him, and if he is just staying until the baby is born he can go ahead and leave. 

During this time, he is working mandatory 12 hour days at work, and he was working on the line with a girl around our age as well. She was okay looking, and I found out he had sent her FB messages about how she was the best thing about work etc etc. She is married as well, and I honestly don’t believe they ever did anything physically, but I do feel like he had a crush on her. We have talked through this, and he says they were just friends and that he realized he crossed a line. Maybe a month ago, he told her that they can’t talk as much at work and she even messaged me about it so theres’s that part added into the mix. 

Finally, we basically work things out and we are still together. 

Baby is 4 months old now, and he is back to normal and so is our marriage for the most part - he tells me things about how all he wants is for is to work out and be happy etc etc. Honestly, I want to be with him, but my heart was broken by how completely cruel he was to me. How can I get over this? Is there a way? Is our marriage doomed? I used to feel confident and loved and I just don’t anymore.

**TLDR** husband told me he didn’t was to be with me anymore, now has flip flopped and I am having trouble getting over it."
"One of our managers ruined a job interview for a candidate we really liked. How/should I try to rectify this situation?


Backstory: I [25F] was recently promoted and started interviewing candidates last week to fill my position. We need to get this new hire working by the third week of June, so I am feeling a little stressed. Out of 100+ applicants, we interviewed eight. Out of those eight there were three people we really really liked: Sarah, Emily, and Jackie. Sarah [late 20s F] is our unanimous favorite out of the three, and has the most work experience. She is the perfect fit for our office and I really enjoyed speaking with her. 

I conducted these interviews with my manager, John. Our office has four managers total: John, Rick, Bob, and Kevin. We are having the three candidates move forward for secondary interviews with Rick, Bob, and Kevin since they have not met them yet. I hope this isn’t too confusing. 

The issue: One of the other managers, Bob, scheduled his secondary interview with Sarah today at a brewery. I have no idea why he chose to hold it at a brewery or on Memorial Day. Sarah confirmed that this was what he wanted to do, and he said yes. I find this a little inappropriate but that’s another story. So today, Sarah shows up for the interview and waited for an hour but Bob never showed up. She called and emailed him but no answer. 

Sarah just emailed John and I letting us know that she had cancelled her plans with her retired military husband for this weekend in order to attend this interview today. She was rightfully upset and decided she no longer wants to apply to work for our company. 

John and I are completely mortified that this happened. I am so embarrassed that Bob would do this and make us look incompetent. We are also really upset because Sarah was our favorite candidate. John reached out to Sarah to send an apology email, and her let her know that he would find out what happened with Bob. The email was very professional and sympathetic. 

At 8 PM Bob sends an email to Sarah, CCing John and I, and is basically rambling an apology and saying that he left his phone in his car the night before (?) and completely forgot. I can’t tell if Bob is frantic or drunk, but the email contains many typos and is missing capitalizations, punctuation, etc. I think this made the situation even more embarrassing. 

Is there an appropriate way to reach out to Sarah and make the situation any better? I feel like an email from me might be more relatable, since we are both females around the same age and view each other as peers as opposed to someone in a position of power. On the other hand I really don’t want to bombard her and make us think we are all insane. I really wanted her for this job and I feel horrible that this has happened. 

**Edit: I just wanted to add this because it keeps getting brought up and is easier to add here: Bob will be meeting with John (our office HR) and our corporate HR to be reprimanded. No, he’s not going to be fired. He fucked up but he has always been a great manager– I truly have no idea what was going on with him to A) schedule an interview at a brewery with a female he’s never met B) completely forget it and C) send that rambly email. Obviously something is going on with him and HR is here for that. That being said, I am fucking pissed at Bob because I have spent so much time dedicated to this hiring process and then he goes and does this. But it doesn’t change that it already happened and now we have to move forward.**

**I just want to figure out if anything I can say to Sarah would be helpful. If this happened to you: what would make you reconsider this company/make the situation better? If anything. I just want some insight.**

TLDR; Manager no-showed to an interview today with our favorite job candidate. Candidate is a retired military wife and cancelled plans this weekend for the interview. Candidate withdrew application. Is there any way to fix this?"
"Me [32M] with my wife [28 F], she had an abortion while we were trying for a baby


I'll be quick, my wife and I have been trying to have a baby since 2016. We have heavily discussed this in the past and I thought we were on the same page about having two children. We have a nursery all set up, she tracks her period, eating healthier, reading parent books etc. 

Tonight we were discussing our ""trouble"" getting pregnant and I suggested we should see a doctor incase there were any complications and she got very on edge/defensive saying it was fine, there is nothing wrong and in time we will have a kid. I didn't understand this as seeing a doctor could give us some help and we didn't seem to have any luck. She got pretty angry ranting and raving about not needing a doctor, waste of money and time. The argument grew and she broke down crying and told me she was pregnant in the past but chose to abort. I felt like something inside me broke. I feel numb and empty. She said she didn't want to be pregnant or have a baby now. She said that since we were ""so far gone"" she couldn't bare to tell me she changed her mind. I was livid, I asked her why couldn't she just be honest with me when she changed her mind she knows how much I value honesty, we are married this is something you need to tell your partner. It wasn't just me that wanted a baby, she was out buying baby clothes, toys, making lists of baby names etc. 

I told her I need to be alone for a but and left. She has been blowing up my phone constantly but I haven't answered, all I see is rage and betrayal when I think of her. I cried more in the past 2 days then my entire life. I don't know where to go from here but I don't think I can continue with this marriage, she is not the person I thought she was. All she had to do was to be honest with me about her concerns, fears I can understand those but I can't understand going along with planning a family then aborting the baby. 

TL;DR: Wife and I tried for a baby, she got pregnant had an abortion and didn't tell me until 2 days ago. "
"My (22F) mum (55F) tells everyone about my autism and difficult childhood, despite an agreement to tell people only with my permission


When I was a kid, my mum wasn’t necessarily the best mum. She came from an abusive home, and had major anger issues. She would routinely scream at my dad, my sister, or me, for either minor mistakes, or because she was in a bad mood and we were in the way.

Additionally, I was experiencing physical/emotional bullying at school from my peers, my peer’s parents, and my teachers. My teachers would have meetings with my mum, where they’d tell her I was unintelligent, lazy, attention-seeking, a hypochondriac, and violent. My mum believed them, and this basically shaped how she viewed me growing up. She was really horrible to me, and would lecture me daily about how I wasn’t trying hard enough, and by “faking” an eating disorder/depression, I was ruining the family, and was competing with my very sick dad for attention. 

When I got toward the end of my teenaged years, my mum went to therapy, and stopped a lot of the screaming at the family. When I was 18, i attempted (and obviously failed) suicide. 

After that though, I reached out to an autism specialist and got diagnosed. My parents had to be there for the diagnosis, but in completing the screener, they realised that I had the disorder and had been wrong in their assumptions about me. My mum was *extremely* apologetic, and promised to accomodate my needs. 

Currently, my mum doesn’t scream at the family, and she doesn’t force me to do things I don’t want to do like she used to. We also had an agreement that she would only tell people about my diagnosis with my permission, and that only close friends and family would know, because I don’t like talking about my childhood, and people treat me very differently if they know I’m on the spectrum, particularly if they don’t know me.

Mum tells EVERYONE. Even our goddamned tenants know, her clients know, every fucking person imaginable and she never asked me once, or told me after she did it. She’ll bring people over for dinner, and then suddenly extremely personal details about what my teachers used to do to me come up. Mum always goes on about how horrified she was with what was happening at school, how she couldn’t do anything because I just never told her, etc. 

These stories make herself out to be such a struggling mum who just didn’t know, rather than someone who refused to listen, and who made it impossible for me to talk to her. Plus, after these stories, it’s not like she has to worry about prejudice towards her, because she doesn’t have fucking autism.

 I don’t know how to get her to stop. I’m honestly tempted to just say “yeah, my childhood was like that because you were a goddamned psychopath when I was young” and throw her under the bus the next time it happens, but then I’ll probably cry myself out the door just from talking about it. Currently I just look at her and say, “I’d rather not talk about it”, or say, “that wasn’t what happened, because you weren’t there”, but it keeps on happening.

Because of her telling everyone, I had an incident where my uncle tried to discipline the autism out of me, by abandoning me in the middle of nowhere for not doing enough eye contact, and reading on my phone instead of a book. I’ve also had a lot of people offer opinions on my diagnosis, like “it’s not autism, you’re just being attention seeking as you’ve always been”, or telling me that because I was vaccinated (I actually wasn’t - thanks mum!) I got autism. Or I just need to try their diet and it would cure my autism, or treat me like an imbecile. Etc etc, it sucks. 

Every time I ask her to stop, she just goes, “but so and so are close friends, they’ll understand you”. Every time she promises not to talk about it, but she still does, and I am so over it. Is there any way I can ask her to stop outing me and my childhood? I want to keep a relationship with my mum going, but this is driving me up the wall. 

TLDR: Mum was a little bit psycho growing up, and was a contributing factor to years of depression and undiagnosed autism. She now likes to use those years as conversation starters."
"He (40m) wants to wait to see if we (30f) are going to call off our engagement.


Background: We’ve been together 2.5 years and known each other around 6. Throughout our relationship, he’s always had trouble communicating his feelings. We lack emotional and sometimes physical intimacy. 

One of the things that drew me to him was that he was a successful business owner who was motivated, smart, and fun to be around. 

I’ve focused most my energy just being supportive of his business even if that meant going to work events and no longer having date nights, talking about his work in the evenings, and helping him make big decisions within that. All while my goals, work life, and aspirations for our relationship have taken a back seat. 

He describes me as making him better, but that feeling is not reciprocated. I feel I’m always in support of his situations, and emotionally and otherwise I’m off to the side. He admitted to his selfishness. 

When we got engaged, he had requested that I set up “meeting times” for wedding planning because he didn’t want to talk about it after work when he planned to relax. Weeks go by and  I eventually plan the entire wedding, with little to minimal effort on his part. 

We made all the appointments, I bought my dress. Then it just wasn’t feeling right.. 3 weeks after we said we would officially set the date... we didn’t. He didn’t. He messages me and tells me he’s cancelling the appointment with our photographer. 

Alas, he feels like emotionally he needs to see a therapist and schedules an appointment. He tells me he “might be a psychopath”, because he has no regard for others emotions and feels selfish and driven only for himself.  I tell him the wedding should just not take place and he should focus on getting some answers and feeling better mentally. 

He wants to wait to “see how things go” after this therapist appointment and I already want to tell our families it’s over. Do I wait? For once, selfishly, I would like to just leave. This could be coming from a place of hurt though because I feel like he’s ruined the process of being excited about marriage and tainted the entire experience. 

TLDR; future husband is emotionally distant, cancels vendor appointments, says he may be a psychopath and schedules an appointment to see therapist and wants me to wait to see if we’re officially calling off the wedding. "
"I [26F] found out last night about my husbands [26M] gambling addiction. Lost 200K+. Can we come back from this?


I [26F] found out last night my husband [26M] of 2 years lost over 200K+ gambling online in four months. 

He took out 70K in personal loans in his name and in my name without my knowledge (He used my social and signed for me for at a bank not in our home state, which is fraud and a federal crime, but more on that later....) His parents gifted us money (50K) for a down payment on a house and that’s gone. He switched our credit cards to only pay the minimum and racked up over 60K on multiple cards. As a last ditch effort to keep it all at bay he spent our entire checking account and savings account to try to cover it up, which obviously didn’t work out so great. 

I found out yesterday when my debit card got declined and I couldn’t pay for gas and lunch at work. He finally admitted the addiction to his parents last night. 

I’m in total shock, I’m numb, I feel stupid, I could throw up. How could I not see it? Why could I trust so blindly? Will I ever be able to trust him again? Has anyone come back from this? We are only 26. I vowed till death do us part but I don’t know if I can get past this. Need advice from someone who doesn’t have an opinion on my life right now...

TL;DR found out last night my husband is addicted to gambling and lost thousands. All our money is gone. Can we come back from this?"
