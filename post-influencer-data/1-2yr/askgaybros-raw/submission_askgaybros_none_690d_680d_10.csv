0,"Gonna take my boyfriend's virginity tonight. Tips? [[UPDATE! It happened]]


In case you missed my last post on Saturday, I asked for tips on taking my boyfriend's virginity. I received AWESOME advice and it helped us have an amazing night. So I owe you an update!

I prepared everything, sheets were clean, room tempretaure was ideal, I had extra clean sheets and towels and tissues, a ton of lube, condoms, candles, music, everything.

He came and we talked and fooled around a little until we both were in the mood. Then we did a ton of foreplay, undressed each other, lots of kissing and all of that, until I felt like it's time and asked if he's ready for me to focus on his ass. He said yes! But felt like I was gonna just enter him like that!

I told him to go on all fours and I gave him a good long rimming which he enjoyed a lot. I could tell from his moaning, then I whispered in his ears that I'm gonna start inserting fingers and he should tell me if he's in pain at any time. I lubbed him up and slowly inserted a finger, it went inside quite easily but he wasn't relaxed as he should have been, so I just calmed him down and helped him relax, and played in there with my finger for a good while, then with two, then three. I felt like he was ready. He was a little stressed, I reassured him that I'll never do anything that's painful and it's completely alright if we can't do it, as you guys had told me that it doesn't always work the first time.

He asked me ""are you really okay if I can't do it?"" And I was like ""duh, of course babe. It's either great for both of us or we're not doing anything. We'll have plenty of time to try again in the future so don't worry about me""

I laid down and had him sit on my cock but it never worked out. I wanted him to be in control of the process but it made things worse, as he wasn't relaxed and couldn't relax in that position. So back to him going on all fours, and a little me whispering in his ears to relax and there he was, quite relaxed. Key was touching his hips, ass and thighs to get him to relax. Played with his ass with my cock for a good while too. Going inside was difficult but I finally managed to get him to relax enough for me to get the tip inside, then got it out, added lube again, then back in and I was good to slowly go all the way in. After that, everything was pretty smooth. I promised to fuck his brains out and fucking his brains out I did!

I held out as long as I could, always slowed down and kissed him and played with him when I was near to give myself time to recover and started over, until he begged me to cum and I did, then finished him with a handjob.

Also, didn't allow him to go and clean up, instead use my towels and wet tissues to clean up with ass and cock and body and my body, and went in to cuddle him for a good 30 minutes. Then we went out to get dinner because we were hungry as fuck.

And oh yeah, when we returned he asked if he can sleep the night with me in my arms! We hadn't planned for it but could I have said no? Of course not. I made that babe mine and now I had to hold him all night, with pleasure.

The last thing he said while he was in my arms, before falling sleep: ""I couldn't have imagined a way to lose my virginity, or a better person to give it to""

I appreciate your help guys. I used your tips and a lot of other things that I read here on the sub to make this happen and make it special for him. Without your help, it would have been impossible for things to turn out as awesome as they did. So here's me showing my love and appreciation to all of you Bros!"
1,"Just got scolded for being gay


So my friends aunt who claims to be ‚Äúreligious‚Äù, yet smokes weed and cusses and had two kids out of wedlock pulled me aside and scolded me for being gay. She told me I was going to hell and said I was a fudge packer. I was like ‚Äú ummm. You know that he who is without sin should cast the first stone and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs you teen mom. Btw I‚Äôm pretty sure gluttony is a sin and I‚Äôm guessing your stomach didn‚Äôt get the memo. Maybe read the whole bible before you try to mask your homophobia with scripture that you‚Äôve probably never read in your life.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve never been so pissed. Man I hate hypocritical Christians. If God is real. They‚Äôre going to hell too. Good thing he‚Äôs not.

Also my friend said she‚Äôs entitled to her opinion and I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fair and my opinion is your aunt is a fat white trash bully who probably has never read the Bible and she needs to shut her obese mouth before she looks more ignorant than she already has.



Update: thanks for all the support in the comments it‚Äôs helped me realize my friend isn‚Äôt really my friend. I texted her and told her I think we need to stop hanging since she can‚Äôt even defend me to her family and I said her aunt is the reason so many gay youth kill themselves and she should be ashamed of herself. She hasn‚Äôt responded but she knows where I stand so I‚Äôm good with never speaking to her again."
2,"My Parents Threw Away All of My ""Faggy"" Clothes


I am a senior in highshool, and a day ago, I was casually hangjng out in my room when I heard my parents call for me to come into the family room. Naturally, I obliged and went in to the room. My dad looked pissed, while my mother had her bitch-face on. I asked them what was the matter, and they told me to show them my clothes. I had no idea why they asked this strange question, but me, being the little saint I am, went into my closet and brought out my outfits for the week (Too bad I couldn't do that with my sexuality üòâ ) They, also, for some reason, demanded that I brought out all the clothes in my closet
The outfits I had were perfectly fine. My father stood up, walked into the kitchen, and brought out a trash bag. I was completely bewildered as to what they were doing or going to do. 
My father started picking through them, looking like he was going through Hitler and Satan's love child's collection of child pornography. The first shirt was a FREAKING PLAIN PURPLE T SHIRT. He said he didnt raise a flaming fag and that I was going to start dressing ""like a man"". (Bitch. How does a fucking purple ass T shirt equate to me dressing like a woman?)
After thirty minutes and numerous lectures about how I look like a fag, he had basically thrown away my entire wardrobe. I only had three black t's and two pairs of jeans and shorts after this episode of my father's. He also ""grounded"" me indefinitely until I can stop acting like a fag, which I found utterly ridiculous, being that I am a legal adult and had done nothing wrong, whatsoever.

I think this is the straw that broke the camel's back. I have so much resentment towards my father, now more than ever. My mother is too afraid of my father to speak up for me and is only married to him for financial reasons. I am currently thinking about moving out, but, sadly, I have no where to go. This was just a long rant for me. Ugggggggghhhh."

4,"Do you censor yourself around straight men? (Bit of a ramble)


I mean... I like to joke around a little bit. I'm *very* comfortable with my same sex attractions. 

But inevitably there's always those straight guy acquaintances that get ""cool"" with me and everything's all fun and games until I make a joke about sucking down a hotdog and then it's, ""Yo man chill out with that."" And it's a big deal and they're so uncomfortable around me all of a sudden. I'm sorry did you forget I too am a sexual human being or...?

Chill out with... what? I made a joke. Y'all joke about fucking bitches and eating pussy but I can't joke about a **hot dog**? 

Okay. üòí

~~It's even worse when your female friend agrees with them and tells you to be more careful around straight dudes because they might not understand your humor. Like no bitch tell them to grow a pair or get out of my face~~."
5,"[UPDATE] The hunky guy who works at the coffee shop


original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/776p8w/the_hunky_guy_who_works_at_the_coffee_shop/

just wanna say thank you guys for the advise. love you all. we went on a date for lunch (because of his work schedule as he works evenings).

the date went beyond my expectation. i cant think of any dull moment. time passed so fast. we talked alot, ALOT!. the food was great. he was great. and turns out we had alot in common. and he was super sweet.

however, i have some concerns might need some advise on those as i am terrible at reading people and when it comes to dating. i havent done it well in the past. i dont want to screw things up as i felt great chemistry and connection to him.

my concers:
1) he's 6 years younger than me. im 35 he's 29.
2) he confessed that he likes me alot and that it all started with a crush. when he told me he said something like ""you dont know how charming you are to me"". he's very confident person with no bs type of guy. pretty straight forward. then i told him ""when i first saw you i said to myself, ah they finally hired a cute guy!""... he replied. ""you know what? when you first walked in i said to myself, finally a cute guy walked in!"".

otherwise i really really liked him alot. but dont you think its early to talk about liking someone on a first date.? hmmm i dont know... but i do like him too even tho i didnt say it the way he said it to me. and the date went almost perfect otherwise. and we did kiss by the end of the date. 

we have been texting each other ever since.

Sidenote: i had a boner the entire time i was with him :(

6,"Does it get better? It does (proof inside)


Look at my only other post on this account. If you don't wanna read all of that here's a tl;dr: It was posted almost 2 years ago when I was living in the Middle East and at one of the highest depression points of my life. 

The main reason I hated living there wasn't just homophobia, which is why I didn't mention homosexuality in that post (although homophobia is a big reason why I despised living in the Middle East). Anyway, now I live in western Europe, studying in a good university and have an amazing boyfriend.

Felt the need to post this because I see so much despair from many guys here and wanted to show that it's possible to become at least somewhat happy eventually."
7,"I Hate When People Equate Attractiveness With Being Valued


I‚Äôve seen so many people claim that if you‚Äôre not muscular, fit, or white then you don‚Äôt mean anything to the gay community. I hate this outlook because your worth shouldn‚Äôt be measured on how much someone else wants to have sex with you. You are an individual who are worthy of so many things in life. Stop bubbling yourselves into just the gay community make friends in other areas, go out to places that aren‚Äôt just gay bars, be interested in other social hobbies that aren‚Äôt just lgbt oriented. Just because you feel a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

I just felt like giving some advice because so many people don‚Äôt know it. "
8,"Nobody ever talks about the importance of laughter during sex.


My best sessions have been those with a lot of laughing, and to me that is very important to having a satisfying lay. Laughing and having fun is as important to me as the sexual pleasure and emotional intimacy, but nobody ever talks about it. 

When you make mistakes, joke or even catch yourself being a cheesy porn actor, all of that. "
9,"My blood test came back positive, my life is in ruins and I am falling apart


I have just arrived home after around 15 months travelling around Latin-America, and a week ago I decided to get tested, let's just say I went to a clinic in a Scandinavian country as I don't want to inform you about exactly which country since our countries are small and I do not want anyone finding out, I am in a extremely paranoid state of mind. 

I was back home after a long journey, organising my mind and my life. I was happy. I had seen so many amazing places, and met so many wonderful people, I could speak fluent Spanish I was ready to start conquering life. There was nothing that could stop me living the life I always wanted. Never had I felt such happiness or contentedness with myself or the people around my me. I was really truly happy for the first time since my father committed suicide a couple of years ago. But everything was about to change forever. 

As I entered the clinic I was very nervous, as I knew I've had been having sex at one occasion without any protection being used during a beach party in the south of Mexico. During the moment of passion I was out of my mind on both ecstacy and alcohol, which clouded my judgement. This was my first time having unprotected sex, and obviously my last. I am not sure if I ever will be able to have sex again, as in my mind it has changed to something ugly, dangerous, like an impure and dirty act. 

Nevertheless I was not prepared for the crushing message I was about to receive, I've had read about the low changes of contracting the virus, even when coming to gay sex, and I was quite sure in my mind that things like this simply doesn't happen to me, not to me, but to other people. I even asked him before we had sex if he had gotten himself tested or if he ""had anything"" and he replied that he just had gotten himself tested, he was clean. He was an Italian backpacker, and in my mind I couldn't even picture a beautiful, educated man like him having the virus.

A week after I had been to my doctor I received a text, as I haven't been able to answer the phone during work hours, I text simply told that I needed to come back to take a control of one of my tests. The following evening and day was one of the worst in my life, as I now thought it might have to do something with my HIV test. But I brushed it off in my mind, and thought the message was related to something else, as I had some others medical issues to resolve when I last talked to the doctor, or it could simply be one of the other treatable sicknesses that can come from unprotected sex, as I had checked for all of them. 

When I get called in to the doctor the following day, I just walked straight in and ask him straight up: Am I HIV positive? He simply replies yes, with sad and pitiful eyes. It was like I was falling into a bottomless pit and my heart was beating so hard I thought it would explode. I yelled ""NO, NO, NO"" cursing myself and my stupid idiotic actions, smashing my fists on the table screaming. I felt helpless. He tried to calm me down and said I could live a life as long as anyone else, and I just needed medication, If I am lucky as little as a pill a day. I didn't even listen, and I imagined myself dying alone, unloved and unwanted. I could see all my years going by with my sad self still alone. I was dirty and marked for life. Things had gotten very real. I had played Russian roulette and lost. I went from the doctors office straight back to work. I teach refugees from all of the world our language, and they are amazing and have been my only true support during these days. I haven't told anyone, nor family or friends. 

I still feel this way, suicidal and just wanting to end everything. I have my doctors appointment in two days in the hospital, and I am to ashamed to even go. I am thinking of buying a plane ticket, killing myself in an other country as I feel I deserve to die for what I have become. And then just become missing and eventually people will forget me. I don't know what to do and I am afraid of hurting myself. I need help or advice. How do I deal with this. "
10,"How do I have the ""you've fallen out of shape and I'm losing my physical attraction to you"" conversation with my SO?


We've been together for two years, and I'm very happy with pretty much all aspects of the relationship except for this. When I first met him he played volleyball and would come to the gym with me, and was in OK shape. He wasn't Channing Tatum or anything, but I thought he was really cute and I was very attracted to him. 

 Within about 6 months of us dating, he had pretty much stopped all physical activity (""I have no time!""). He also started eating more takeout and other garbage, and the weight started piling on. I lost a lot of weight (before I met him) and am pretty meticulous about staying in shape and eating healthy. I've tried the ""drop subtle hints"" approach of inviting him to the gym with me, and trying to encourage him to make healthier food choices, but they haven't worked. Over the past year he's put on about 30 lbs, which is really bad because he's 5'5 and has a really small frame. 

 Our sex life has steadily declined to the point of being pretty much non-existent. When we do fool around, I can't get hard and just want it to be over as fast as possible. Sex isn't a deal breaker for me, but I do think it should have its place in a functioning relationship. I'm scared to have this conversation with him and I'm not sure how to approach it. I'm (self-admittedly) awful at communication, and I tend to let problems like this fester instead of addressing them head-on. Any advice?"
