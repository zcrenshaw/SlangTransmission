0,"Today was a really fucking good day


I just wanted to share this with all of you. 

I told my brother I was gay today. I was extremely worried, but god damn do I have the best fucking brother. I cried like a god damn bitch because he was so awesome. He assured me that were brothers and none of this fucking matters. I still have a place at his future wedding and my plus one will be sitting right there with him at the table. 

He told his fiance and everything was fine. They apparently have gay friends that I had no idea existed. 

As a bonus, I fucking destroyed my workout in the gym today and ate like a monster afterwards. Plus, I kissed a guy for the first time yesterday so that's really cool.

1,"My coworker joked about me being gay and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.


Just wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I work in a restaurant and in the middle of dinner rush a bunch of servers were chowing down on some Chinese spare ribs that were made by the kitchen as a mistake. I walked past them and remarked that they were ‚Äúfucking carnivores‚Äù (in a joking way). One of them responded back in a similar joking manner: ‚Äúchaotic2h, you get more meat than the rest of us‚Äù which sent everyone in the kitchen laughing. 

I know it‚Äôs not a big deal but kinda made me happy that my sexuality isn‚Äôt some stupid thing people get weird about anymore. My last restaurant was homophobic af and the owner had fired multiple gay servers there before so coming here was definitely a nice change. "
2,"I had lunch at Applebee's with my family..only to realize our waiter sent me a dick pic on Grindr


After I picked up some books for the spring semester, my family took me out for lunch yesterday. We get directed to our table and the lady kindly tells us that our waiter will be over momentarily. The guy comes up, and lo and behold, I instantly recognize him. I, of course, didn't say anything- but to be honest, I was smiling like a dork. He sent me a dick pic to help with my art project in doing 1,000 dick drawings ([I've posted about this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7hedbg/as_requested_heres_my_tumblr_with_100_drawings_of/)) He's #234. Long story short, I get home, draw his dick instantly, and we start talking and exchange snaps. We've been sexting each other ever since and plan on meeting up during our spring break. We're going on a date too, lol.

I'm just curious- what have you guys done when you see a guy off of an app in a place that you wouldn't have expected them? Do you have any interesting stories? Was it ever awkward? I once went shopping with my Mom and an old guy I blocked happened to be there too. He kept watching me. It was weird. I'd love to hear your stories!

**EDIT: [Okay ya'll a guy on Grindr just messaged me saying he saw this post on Reddit. I feel so invaded idk](https://imgur.com/a/QAu6Y) lol Talk about coincidences?**"
3,"Finally came out to my parents


Hello, long time lurker here.
Throw away account because only my parents know, and all my friends know my other account and I would like to come out to them in person.

I'm about to turn 20 in a few weeks, and I finally managed to summon the courage to come out to my parents. I've known for many years that I'm Gay, but have been hindered from being true to myself from observations of my family. For years they've made homophobic comments left and right about LGBT people casually around the house and family events, which led me to being terrified of ever telling them about my orientation.

Tonight I told my mother after dinner while we were talking about my next semester, and the reaction was everything I could have hoped for. She laughed, and cried, saying she'd always had suspicion, and that she'll love me no matter who I am, or who I am with. She told me of dozens of other people in our family, most of whom I've never heard of who also happen to be gay. A while later my father came into the kitchen and hugged me, saying he'd heard everything, and that he too would love me unconditionally.

Today is one of the happiest days of my life and I just wanted to share it with other people who might understand. "
4,"Update: Outed myself and parents kicked me out.


About a year ago, I made a thread in which I described my outing to my family. 

Short backstory: I was 19 at that time, and I was living with my family. My parents are very religious and traditional, they are the kind of people who think being gay is disgusting and a mental illness. Because my mental health started getting worse I lost a lot of weight to the point where I was so skinny people asked me if I was ill, I decided to out me in front of my parents. My mother cried and my father told me, ""if you want to live this lifestyle, you have to move out"".

Fast forward a year, I dropped out of college, moved to a new town where I knew no one and I was ready to change myself and create my future. Getting out of depression wasn't as easy as I expected, but I kept working on myself and hit the gym regulary. I'm working a shitty job to pay my bills and to buy some food. The money that's left at the end of the month is being put into cryptocurrencies, since I'm hoping to earn some money for college (and because blockchain is the future).

What I want to say is, I was very down, mentally and physically and I had no perspective and joy in life. My life is still far from perfect, but it is also better then I would ever expected it to be. I'm working out and eating healthy, I'm teaching myself to code, I'm reading a lot and learn something new every day. It's ok to take your time and to find yourself. Only now I really realized that I'm the protagonist of my own story, so why not making it a good one?

What I want to say is, depression is not fun, but it's also not invincible. If there is someone dealing with rejection or is afraid of a coming out, I just want to let you know you are not alone, you're love and perfect as you are, and you can do this. Life can be so much better and it WILL be better, trust me. This world is full of life and color, just be yourself, work hard, and you will attract people with the same positive energy. 

I'm no native english speaker so please don't hate me too much"
5,"Gays of reddit, what's the biggest hint you missed from a guy?


Yoinked from r/AskReddit.

When I was 18 and still a bonafide twink, I met this really hot couple who randomly told me one day that they agreed my butt was cute. They hinted that they both played around with other guys. Then I ended up staying the night with one of them. There were drinks. There were cuddles. We FELL ASLEEP. I didn't even realize what could've happened until years later. Yeah. Ouch."
6,"What is a porn video you always come back to?


"
7,"If you don't have a face picture on your profile and they stop responding when you send one, they aren't ""collecting pics"". They just don't find you attractive.


I get so irritated seeing paranoid Grindr users who barely have a picture on their profile being so worried about pic collectors. Just because someone wants to see what should already be on your profile doesn't mean they want your picture in their Pok√©mon face pic bank or something. 

Maybe if they immediately ask for dick pics as the literal first messages. "
8,"Dear gaybros...


Year ago, when someone said ""LGBT community"", what I had in mind was bunch of annoying vegans&amp;feminists in overly colorful clothes, who always complain about something, desperately fight for attention and would be ready to kill someone who disagrees with them.

Well, r/askgaybros proved me wrong. I had an opportunity to read thousands of your stories -- both happy, romantic ones, but also these from scary and unwelcome places in the world, where being gay means having your life taken away, in metaphoric or actual way.

I found that you're not caricatural creatures -- and that's how some media and memes used to show you -- but just normal human beings who crave normal human things: love, friendship, passion, freedom, dicks...

And for that I wish to thank you. If I had any remains of doubts in my mind, concerning if homosexuality is morally acceptable or if it isn't some kind of mental illness, this year helped me to get rid of them.

I personally hate the giving wishes part because people tend to wish us what *they* want for us, not to support what we want for ourselves, so allow me to be *VERY* careful:

In the upcoming 2018 (and after that, lol), I wish all of you to find the source of strength to change whatever you wish to change and to sustain whatever you wish to sustain. I also wish you to stay healthy (not only in phyiscal way!), to keep the feeling of loneliness in check (in whatever ways it works for *you*), to never have to feel hopeless and powerless because it's basically the worst thing we can feel as human beings, and also a little bit (or even tons) of luck, because even if it's unreliable, sometimes it can really save your ass.

^(+ If someone hopes 2018 to be finally the one turning point of their lives and story... special shout-out to you! I hope it will be and that you will manage!)

Also, a word of reminder from my better half: if you're going to party in the upcoming hours/days, be sure to have fun with your brain switched to ""on"". If you're going to drive/play with fireworks DON'T DRINK. Always let someone know where are you going, always watch your drink and try to watch over others as well. If you'll notice something disturbing, never hesitate to contact emergency lines.

9,"Just had my first hookup - wow!


Finally worked up the courage to meet a guy off grindr (bit clich√© I know) and it was so liberating! I'm usually ultra shy and not very confident with my body (I'm very skinny) but somehow I managed to meet up with someone who literally looked like a Greek god üòÅ It was only oral but he was so sweet yet sexy and wants me to top him next time. Sorry to brag, just thought I'd share!"
10,"Hello bros, I am here to say that there is no shame in seeking therapy or counseling for issues you are dealing with.


I see so many posts here that show a lot of people struggling with issues they have been unable to solve on their own. Even some of the ""trolls"" here seem like they could use some love and support. Your mental health  is just as important as your physical health. Mental health professionals are there to listen to you and support you in a way that your family and friends cannot. It's not magic but it definitely helps a lot. I really wish I gave it a try when I was younger and in college. 


Please bros. If you can afford it or your insurance covers it, just try it. If you are in university, use its resources! It's an investment in your long term health and happiness. Even if you feel like something *can't* be solved, you might be pleasantly surprised. Sometimes our issues create a filter on the way we see the world. They create mental blind spots we are unaware of.


Cheers guys."
11,"What‚Äôs the best accidental nudity you‚Äôve seen? (Stolen from AskReddit)


Virtually all the stories on the AskReddit thread are about guys seeing naked women. Thought asking here could get some stories we would care about."
12,"Just got kicked out......


Have nothing except the clothes on my back and my phone until they shut it off. 


Update: just wanted to say thanks for all the support and advice. My parents apologized to me thirty minutes ago and said I can stay but I can‚Äôt be gay if I‚Äôm living with them so I said I would be asexual just to appease them. I‚Äôm gonna start college next year so hopefully that will help me towards getting financially independent. "
13,"Just wanted to share this amazing experience in 2017


Hey there gaybros! 

I just wanted to share this amazing experience in the last few hours of 2017 that I had with my (now) boyfriend.

So we've been hanging out together for some time now and we both knew that we were both gay because we're both in the pro-lgbt 'club' at our school. 

Last time we sat shoulder to shoulder and watched some gay short films on youtube but we were both too scared to say or do anything, not even to grab his hand.

Last night we did the same thing but with some low-quality films and our hands were next to eachother on the bed, I touched his and brought up the courage to take his hand in mine and then we confessed to eachother that we liked one another. And then we basically kissed (and more) and now, in the last few hours of 2017, I have gotten a boyfriend and we really like eachother.

I've read a lot of stuff on here and I consider this story to be some form of 'thank you' for all the amazing stories and experiences that are shared here. 

Throwawayaccount happy gay guy"
