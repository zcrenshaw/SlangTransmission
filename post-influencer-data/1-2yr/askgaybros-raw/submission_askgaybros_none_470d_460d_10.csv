0,"came out to my brother, went bettr than i though


so i came out to my brother today, he's the first to know. 

we were on our way to the movies, and stopped to get food. sitting in the car eating chipotle and he started asking me if I was seeing any of the girls in my year, a frequent question from him lol. when i said no then he started asking me if i have a type, blonde or brunette or redhead; did I like one more than the other. I wasn't planning on coming out today, was going to do in later in the summer, but I was just turned him and said 'guys, my type is guys'. 

He asked if I was joking, I said I wasn't. He told me to be serious, was I playing around, again I told him I wasn't. And then he was like interesting, I had no idea...

Then he told me guys wasn't a specific enough category, and asked blonde boys, brown hair, gingers so i told him I don't really care about hair color. then he asked about height, my height, shorter or taller. I told him I haven't really thought about and he was like 'so you're keeping your options open, smart guy'.  Took him 30seconds to move from his annoying questions about girls to his annoying questions about guys lol. 

He drove us to the movies, and when we got there he asked me how i was feeling because i was pretty quiet. I don't really know how I felt actually, this huge thing had happened and I wasn't really sure how to take it in. He offered to take us somewhere where we could talk, but I told him maybe after the movie. We got out the car he hugged me and told me in honour of my 'big day' he'd even get me a large popcorn lol, but then he got serious for a moment and was like ""i love you, and don't ever forget that, ok"". 

after the movie he elbowed me and goes ""so, you still gay?"", which actually made me laugh. so he's still the same him, which means a lot. he asked more serious questions on the way home, how long have you know/ who knows/how did i feel now/if there was anyway he could be more supportive...and then ended by asking which Avenger was my favourite, I said spiderman and he laughed and said so you do have a type. 


i don't know why im posting this here, probably because i don't really have anyone else to tell. i know i've only told one person, but it still feels like this huge weight off of me. knowing that my brother has my back, feels like no matter how anyone else takes it I'm gonna be alright because I he'll be there."
1,"STRAIGHT GUYS DO NOT WANT YOU


Old post still relevant 

I got downvoted in this sub for saying straight guys aren't obsessed with gay sex and the guy who said they are got a bunch of up votes...listen queens stop it. I use to be like that hopeful and wishful and clinging on to the ideology that ""no one is 100% straight"" like I hear a lot in this sub . It's just not true . Straight men sometimes might randomly talk about it but gay sex is not on there mind. Women are...getting pussy... Maybe even their girlfriends and marrying them and being with them. You are most of the time NOT on there minds . STOP wishful thinking . Wishful thinking is what got me humiliated a week before prom thinking a straight guy would go with me (check my previous posts) wishful thinking is what breaks so many gay men hearts when they believe in all this Kinsley scale sexuality spectrum bullshit . If you're hooking up with a ""straight guy"" on the dl he is not straight so don't even try using that as an excuse in the comments in fact you are so undesirable to them that gay men actually PAY STRAIGHT MEN TO BLOW THEM. Get use to the fact that you will end up with a gay man.. You are only desirable to a gay man. And you'll never be with a straight man ."
2,"..I did it


I came out. I'm black. I'm gay. I came OUT

Last night I couldnt take it anymore...FaceTime'd my only sister and told her I was gay. Her reaction was nothing more than perfect and what I expected. 

She first asked how long had I known and I just basically just spewed the past 25 years of my life on what I hid from her for the next 4 hours. What made it even better is she said she felt really bad that I felt like that was something I had to hide and keep bottled up for so long. 

Let me explain. I grew up playing sports all my life and thought I was going to take this secret to my GRAVE. I knew I could hide it and not have anyone question me but..something changed. I got a little older and realized I'm not prioritizing someone else's happiness over mine. 

I know most of you here can't understand but being black and gay is still a really big thing for us. The homophobia is real. Especially if you aren't a stereotypical gay dude that most straight people are exposed to. It's sad but that really played a huge role on keeping it hidden. 

My sister is really great yall. She was legit mad that I waited so long to tell her but understood why haha. What's crazy is that she said yesterday was the first day she actually questioned my sexuality....for me to come out to her then that same day was creepy as hell üòÇ. She straight up asked if I could finally be open to her about my love life and it felt great to tell her about my past relationship. 

I'm still in shock right now. I really outed myself to my fucking sister. 

No more hiding.........I can finally be open to at least one person (for now) I give a damn about. 

So fellas (especially you black men)..when the time is right...just do it. Dont sacrifice your happiness for someone else's.....it will literally eat you alive and you'll be mad at the world for no reason. "
3,"HAPPY PRIDE MONTH üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

4,"My husband hit me


Sorry, I just need somewhere to vent.


I have been married for the past 5 years with an unbelievable guy. He's smart, strong and so pretty. When he asked me out for the first time, I couldn't even believe it. I never thought a guy like him would look at a guy like me. Things progressed and we got a house, got married and are together since then.


Last night I went out with some guys from work. Just your typical happy hour. I asked him if we wanted to come, but he refused. I drank a bit, so I ditched my car and got a Uber home. I got there a bit tipsy, but I wasn't even totally drunk. For some reason he got so mad that I was out that a fight ensued. I wasn't in the mood to fight, so I just let him talk whatever he wanted. We don't fight a lot. I don't know what happened. When he realized I wasn't gonna fall into this nonsense fight, he came up to me and asked if I wasn't gonna reply or at least confirm that I'm 'a fucking slut' I just shook my shoulders. I thought he was gonna realize this was all nonsense because I'd never cheat on him. I'm not crazy to risk him nor will I ever find someone willing. But he punched me. I don't know how many times. I don't know if it was the drinking or th fact that I never learned how to fight, but I didn't had a reaction. I just let him. At some point I must've fallen because he kicked me a few times. Everything hurt when I got up. I didn't run or anything. I just said with that pathetic crying voice I never was able to get rid of that I thought it was best if I slept in another bedroom. 


I didn't sleep. I was just afraid, so I climbed out by the window and just walked. I thought about calling someone and ask if I could crash, but I realized no one would care or be interested or not be annoyed that I was calling in the middle of the night, so I just scrolled through my contacts. When did I loose all my friends? So I just walked until I found a McDonalds, where I have been buying things everytime a manager comes up. I thought about going to work, but everything still hurts, I'm sure I'm bruised and I can't show up with yesterday's suit and shirt. Basically, I'm stuck inside a McDonalds, without having somewhere to go. "
5,"Boyfriend and I got called Faggots for kissing him in his car


I saw the guy who did it and just kissed my boyfriend again. He made a disgusted face and I just laughed. 


I just don‚Äôt get how, in 2018, people don‚Äôt know how to mind their own business. What compels people to yell across the street at someone‚Äôs own car for something they don‚Äôt like? 


Be proud y‚Äôall. This is our month. :)"
6,"PSA: You don‚Äôt need a tragic backstory of low self worth to post that picture of you in your jockstrap


I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen guys post a super slutty picture of themselves somewhere with some long explanation of how it took them so long to love themselves and how hard they had to struggle to love their body how they should. 

If you want to post a picture of you in revealing clothes, just do it. The only person you‚Äôre making feel better is you. We won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any less slutty just because suddenly now you‚Äôre ‚Äúloving your body.‚Äù It‚Äôs still for attention and validation because I promise you if you didn‚Äôt receive a single ‚Äúlike‚Äù or comment on it you‚Äôd take that bitch down so quick and go back into self loathing. 

It‚Äôs ok to be a ho. It‚Äôs ok to dress revealing or even show off. But please stop trying to convince yourself that you‚Äôre not doing exactly that. "
7,"So I finally came out to my conservative, religious, homophobic parents


Just wanted to share in case anyone out there is struggling with this as much as I was until recently. I told my parents yesterday, after a day long anxiety attack, years of self hatred and denial, and even an aborted suicide attempt. And I have to say I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better outcome. To my surprise and disbelief they both were super supportive and said although they don‚Äôt understand this and are not prepared to deal with it, they love me no matter what and would always be there for me. I had all my belongings packed up in my car and was ready to drive away if things went south. I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôve only worked up the courage to tell them now. 

If you‚Äôre struggling with this there is hope out there and the people who love you may surprise! All the best gaybros "
8,"Anyone Else Hate When An Ass Is Called A Pussy?


I swear it really irks me when a guy refers to my ass as a pussy or ""bussy"" üòù (boy pussy if you don't know). Or if I'm gonna top and a guy says something like ""You wanna fuck my pussy?"" Like that's an instant ass turn off.

Like we aren't women. It's a small thing but also very annoying."
9,"Ok gays. Can we start expanding our gay zoocabulary by calling short muscular gays as pitbulls? Cuz just like pitbulls, theyre short muscular and seem to need a lpt of attention!


Im gonna propose this on our next Gay Agenda Meeting. I recall this comment from a post weeks ago. 

Its fuckin genius."
10,"I just kissed my boyfriend goodnight :)


We spent the day at the beach and playing video games, we made dinner and brownies. 

Just kissed him goodnight and now he‚Äôs sleeping like a puppy :)

Hope you bros have a good night too. "
11,"OMG So I just found the guy that used to bully me in high school for being feminine ON GRINDR!!!


Lool. This is fucking hilarious. 

This guy literally used to pick on me for no reason. I never understood why he picked on me so much, I even asked him why he hated me. And he would call me gay infront everyone and make fun of me how I was feminine.


Well...Fast forward 4 years, and I've just seen him on Grindr. Haha. Should I message him to surprise him? "
12,"Just came out


I just came out to my straight best friend and he was completely accepting and was upset that I thought he wouldn‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm so fucking happy and I know this post has probably been made a million times but I am so happy I could cry and just needed to share. That is all. Oh and also thank you to everyone on here for giving me the courage to finally do this. "
13,"Who else can't stop staring at a guys ass when hes in slacks/formal pants?


[Seeing guys like this makes me weak] (https://78.media.tumblr.com/d4ade3ad8bc522681400e6eea7117118/tumblr_p04vbtJsVn1tv6jbno1_500.jpg)"
14,"I came out to my mom... again


I first came out to my mom three years ago and when I told her she said things like ""Don't worry it's a phase"", ""You're gay so, do you wanna be a woman?"", ""You think you're gay because everybody is coming out of the closet nowadays"", since then she hasn't been supportive at all and we barely talk about the fact I'm gay. She didn't change the way she treats me, however she has shown no interest in getting to know me, what I do and how's my life. It's like what I said was a joke and that's why she didn't listen. She just doens't take me seriously. (Actually, it seems everything I say is a joke and she doens't give me credit for what I do, I'm not going to describe every situation because it would be a long post)

Yesterday, I decided to come out to her again. We never had a great dialogue but I thought if she asks about my life I would answer them and we may build a strong mother son relationship (as we kind of had before I came out the first time). One of the questions was ""Are you still gay?"". To be honest, I was hurt because that question proved she's paid no attention to me, even though we live together and talk every day. It's clear she doesn't want a gay son. 

After I explained to her that I am gay, intead of giving support or trying to understand what I went through. All she said was ""OK. I want you to think about all the experiences you had in your life, you need to find out what made you gay or influenced you to think you're not straight so, we can work on that experience and turn you straight again. I'll help you"". She's in denial.

I just wanted to feel accepted but I don't know if it is possible to change her mind. I need some advice on how I can talk to her about it because I'm not coming out again.  "
15,"Dumbest/Funniest thing people have asked you?


My 20 year old friend asks me what jerking off is, if it's men's period. Then after I've answered, she proceeds to ask why I need to masturbate while I'm gay. Apparently she thinks gay guys don't have sex at all.  The irony is that she lives with a gay couple.  

On another occasion she told me that the couple usually got into a fight, went into their room, got quiet for 10 \~ 15 minutes and came out happily.  She asked me what they did during that time. I was laughing so hard I had stomach cramp  üòÇüòÇ  

I guess sex\-ed is really important üòÇ"
16,"If you feel like pride parades don't really match you, I have a thought I'd like to put out there


So, whenever a discussion comes up about pride parades, there's usually a comment that goes something like ""I'm gay and I don't really feel like pride parades are for me either."" I think in a way that can be fair, and I think I once felt like this, but I really encourage guys to go and watch it from start to finish at least once. If you've done that, more power to you.

Here's why I think you should at least go and watch the whole thing before making a sweeping statement. News and a few pictures do a really bad job at capturing the whole thing. Publications usually pick the most visually exciting pictures and end up missing a whole lot that is far more mundane.

So, when I first went to San Francisco's Pride, I was expecting non-stop floats of go-go boys. However, there was this procession of marching bands, fire fighters, police officers, civic groups, public officials, churches, bikers, Elks-club-type-stuff, local businesses, school groups, and so on for almost four hours. It was surprising how so much of it was **kinda boring**, but not in a bad way. It was boring in that everyday life way, like finding out where your city gets water or how humdrum groups that maintain city life can be. It wasn't really until the end of the parade that there were maybe 5 or 6 floats with guys in speedos on them and even that number might be generous. There were some sex-positive things sprinkled in here and there, but it was such a sliver compared to how much of just everyday society was there showing support along with it.

Then, of course the pictures in the SF Chronicle are the fun ones with the shirtless guys and wild costumes, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it really under-represents a lot of what else is there. Even allies can do a bad job of summing up the whole and leave out segments of LGBT society who show up for the day.

Also, a quick point, if you grew up somewhere rural and only have footage from conservative groups to go on, it's important to know that a lot of YouTube videos and anti-gay videos will use footage from kink and bondage events and say they are from gay pride. If you're unfamiliar, events like Folsom are very much an 18+ sex celebration and kids aren't allowed in them. However, people will muddy the waters by using that footage to say that's what gay pride looks like.

Anyway, I really wish we could line up pictures of every pride parade float and put them in order on a single page so that people could get a feel for what it's really like. It's wonderful to see how much more of society is an ally than you realize and how much more of it is gay than you might realize. Experiencing it in person is a very different experience than what you get from a few photos."
