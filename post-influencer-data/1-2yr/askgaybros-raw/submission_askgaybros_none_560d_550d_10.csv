1,"DO NOT BAREBACK ON PrEP, EVER!


I caught a less common, but more invasive form of chlamydia (LGV) in the rectum and it's been the most horrendous experience of my life (I'd rather have a broken arm). 

It's non-stop discharge from the anus, so I have to sleep with tissue in my boxers. Serious inflammation in my sphincter, causing it to be ridiculously tight, making bowel movements torture (feels like having a baby that's covered in broken shards of glass that's been doused  in hot chilli sauce). There are red ulcers all around my anus. Sleep can be uncomfortable because symptoms cause serious sweating. You wake up and you're whole bed sheets, pillow and duvet are soaked. Even after a few days on antibiotics I can be woken up in the middle of the night by painful itching caused by the discharge. Honestly it's a fucking travesty down there. Sitting is always uncomfortable, but improves daily when taking antibiotics.

The treatment is 3 weeks of antibiotics rather than the usual 7 days.

This strain of chlamydia is most often seen in MSM and is generally diagnosed in the anus. 

I don't know how common it is in the USA, but in Europe, the U.K. especially it increasing.

Before I started on the antibiotics it was 2 days of tortuous itching and stabbing pain. I literally told myself if I didn't get antibiotics by the weekend I would kill myself. The itching drives you insane, literally!

And I'm suffering all this because I chose minutes of extra pleasure for potentially days to weeks of pain and discomfort. 

Don't bareback guys! Like ever!"

3,"Guy cried after we had sex.


I (20) recently hooked up with a guy my age, pretty handsome, completely my type physically . He came to my place, we talked, he said he was closeted, that he had never had sex with a man, that this was completely new to him. We started making out passionately, we blew each other for a bit. Now I'm not really the kind of person that likes it quick so I don't really mind how long it takes foreplay till we get down to business. We went his pace, turns out he really enjoyed making out, kissing, rubbing against each other and holding hands. He was far more into the physical affectionate closeness of sex rather than the act of sex itself. It's the first time a guy doesn't let me go down on him for too long, and actually prefers to have my mouth kissing him instead of sucking him. He went down on me and he was bad at it (as expected), but I noticed he was doing his best, I didn't mind so we continued kissing. When we got to anal, he was very clumsy, I tried some positions to make it easier for him and make him feel in control, but he got nervous he couldn't get in, I calmed him down and continued kissing him, but he couldn't get in, so I rode him. Now he was overwhelmed (I'm pretty good at riding) and he got close pretty fast, so we pulled off because he was pretty horny and I thought he wanted to finish somewhere else, he finished in my mouth and of course I swallowed for him. After that we kissed for a while and started cuddling. I noticed his eyes were watery, I thought I made something wrong, that I had hurt his cock or something, so I asked him and he started crying on my shoulder. He said that no one had ever made him feel like that, that it was the 1st time he felt he was loved by another man, that it all was too good, that he was never touched that way by anyone. I caressed his hair and we cuddled till we fell asleep, I noticed that affection was what he enjoyed most so I gave him plenty of that. 

His sweetness and innocence touched me so I woke up early in the morning to wake him up with a freshly baked pie and breakfast in bed. I was determined to make this guy's first time the best I could (unlike mine, which was shitty), he was very happy when I woke him up, we talked a bit. After that we cuddled and kissed watching some shitty movie on TV for an hour, then he said he had to leave soon. He asked if he could shower with me, so we did. After that he left and said bye with a warm kiss, he said he defenitely wanted to repeat it, we exchanged numbers. 

Now since then we have been talking a lot, he wants to date me, but I'm not sure if he really likes me or he's infatuated with the experience of his first time, I don't know if I'm infatuated myself (which, despite having slept around a lot, it's the 1st time I feel something for someone I hooked up with). Now also, I'm not the relationship type, I must admit (I've slept around a lot), but there's something about this guy that's making me doubt of myself, even though we barely know each other. I don't know if dating him and becoming his first boyfriend is the best thing for us both (though I must admit I fanstasize about it) and I also feel like I'm not worthy of his innocent feelings or if my sexual past is a dealbreaker for him. I don't know how it is like dating a closeted guy. What should I do? I don't want to crush this sweet man's heart but I don't want to lead him on either, when I'm not sure myself."
4,"I gave one of my straight friends a blowjob when i was drunk, he wants another one.


We were hanging out at my place and he was talking about how his girl doesn't blow him, i said that was a crime since i had seen him naked and offered to blow him. This all happened in like 6 seconds and i expected him to start screaming at me but he said okay and took his cock out. He didn't say a word during but he seemed to really enjoy it and afterwards he left almost immediately. The next day I was feeling super nervous about it but he texted me whether he could come over again tonight.

The way he was texting he clearly wants more and so do I but he is in a relationship, so I'd feel bad. Is it my responsability? I really wanna suck him again.."
5,"Just a small point regarding unprotected sex


I think PrEP is helping people defend against what we know regarding STDs. As many guys consider HIV to be the only serious sexually transmitted disease they are happy to have unprotected sex once they’re on PrEP and treat whatever else they get with antibiotics or antivirals.

As a physician I would just like to mention that this was the attitude in the 70s before HIV showed up, and then suddenly an entire generation of men died due to lack of treatment due to the ‘new kid on the block’. The point is we don’t know what is out there and what is mutating or forming on its journey to infect and harm humans. To each his own... do what makes you happy... i support PrEP to prevent HIV transmission, but be careful what you expose yourself to.

I’ll end with a quote from Demolition Man, a futuristic movie that touches on this point... ‘Rampant exchange of bodily fluids was a major cause of society's downfall. After AlDS, there was NRS, then there was UBT.’"
6,"Turns out my gaydar is just a massive Pleasebegaydar, but the dude was absolutely cool and he texted me this morning saying he had fun


This is a follow up to my last post about asking my crush to a party, well the party got cancelled, but I hanged out with this guy and his friend at my place, and it was just amazing, the jokes and the conversation were all on point. I have a new friend now, and I also need to purchase a new gaydar cause mine is broken."
7,"(UPDATE) Gave up looking for SO, rescuing a dog instead.

So I promised I would update everyone on how it would go with me rescuing Juliet from the shelter, and it all went through just fine! Everyone, meet [Juliet](https://imgur.com/a/huLi1)!

I want to encourage everyone to also link pics to pets, I’d love to see them!"
8,"Man, theres no greater relieving moment than when


The guy you've been crushing on, thats been giving mixed signs of potentially being interested back, turns out to be straight all along and you were completely unsure, yet spent a lot of time investing into some thought + daydreams of the two of you cuddling.

A huge moment of *phew* I can move on, because there absolutely zero chance if him having ever liked me back.

It feels nice to be ""free"" from the anxiety I guess is one way to put it."

10,"So some gaybros have problems with this subreddit


In a recent thread, what I saw was the most entitled display of... *gay whining*... if you will.

In summary, most of the comments didn't like people posting about : crushes, relationship problems, relationship achievements, life problems, coming out, happiness, sex, awareness, ""I love dick"", etc.

Now I know some things are redundant and some questions are out right stupid. But I personally try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.

It seems like many people (I'm in this too) have this mindset that *I've gone through this and now it's none of my business. Get over it*. Especially when it comes to topics like relationships and coming out.

Please can we not focus on bashing people for voicing their concerns and instead of helping them? Let's make this a more considerate platform.

Also, fuck that masc. vs fem. debate. You like masc more? Go for it. You like fem more? Go for it. But don't come for me because I like something different. That was the entire foundation of the gay movement. To show people we can like whoever we like and there's nothing you can do about it. "

12,"I literally don’t have any friends


Actually, this started back in September 2017. I deleted all my friends on social media. I say ‘friends’; I really mean ‘acquaintances that I’m forced to see on a regular basis’. I don’t see anyone in real life, except for my parents and my sister. That’s it. I don’t speak to anyone else. I’ve moved up and down the country my whole life, so I’m rootless. I don’t have lifelong friends since kindergarten that keep in touch with me, because my parents have always moved around (they hate staying in one place for too long). I don’t want to blame my parents, but moving schools so many times made me feel like the people I met were just going to disappear one day, so I stopped trying so hard. Just got on with assignments/revision and really enjoyed life at home anyway. I’ve never had a sleepover or done anything with a friend, like go out to eat somewhere. I’ve only ever eaten with my family. I’m very sheltered beyond belief, really.

A lot of the friends I had on Facebook never spoke to me in real life or we just added each other for the heck of it. I used to have feelings of jealousy seeing people going out to places I had never heard of unchaperoned and seeming to have a good time. The photos always look like they’re taken in 4K with powerful lighting and then I try to take a selfie and I look like I’m stuck in 2005 (RIP front facing iPhone camera...) I’m sadly forced to stay at home in the evenings and I can’t do anything alone, so long as I’m under my parents’ roof.

I felt upset a lot of the time, feeling like I was almost suffocated by these people. When I finally blocked everyone, I felt so relieved and had this peace.

Until today, actually. Today I really felt hammered by how lonely and quiet my life is.

Today, I woke up and I watched some random porn vid to jerk off. Before the guys did anything, I saw one guy being cuddled by the other guy sitting down on a sofa and I instantly paused and started to weep. I was shocked kind of how it hit me - the guy turned around and looked at the other guy and smiled. I always imagine myself as one of the characters in these videos, since it makes it way more exciting. When I imagined holding a guy and looking longingly into his eyes, I fell apart. I suppose I’ve suppressed a natural, human desire for intimacy and connection for half a year now and it had to come back at some point.

I’ve been lonely for a while and a lot of that motivation to be lonely has come from being hurt by others. I’ve definitely spiralled out of control to the point that I don’t even talk to my parents that much anymore, just hide in my room and read or watch Netflix and stuff. I’ve really enjoyed the peace and quiet that has come with being lonely, like if I want to laugh out loud, I can do that without getting weird looks or if I just want to dance spontaneously, I can do that too. I don’t get out much anymore, except to go shopping and get something to eat.

A large part of being lonely has been helpful in terms of feeling good about myself. For example, if I see myself in the mirror, I smile immediately and feel good about myself. Before, I would stand and nitpick things like my beard or play around with my hair or wonder if I had lint on my jacket or something. I definitely feel more comfortable as a human being. I also accepted the fact that I’m gay. I was trying to hide it and suppress that too, but I’m a lot more comfortable with the idea of being with a guy. It’s been a great chance to breathe and decompress, but I feel like it’s been long enough as a self-designed and randomly organised ‘rehab’ program.

But today, it just hit me. I was completely wiped out. I had breakfast, showered, changed into pyjamas and thought about it and soon passed out onto my bed. I was knocked out for like four hours.

I’m not sure what to do. I’ve enjoyed being alone so far, but I suddenly realise that it isn’t 100% fun as it initially seemed to be completely isolated.

Where do I meet nice people? What can I do to manage how lonely I feel? What can I do to help myself? Especially with overcoming social anxiety

Sorry if my post goes in circles a little. I wrote this in an info-dump way rather than a planned essay. Hope it all makes sense"

14,"My (ex) Boyfriend is in vacation


I don't know if this is an appropriate place to post but I'm pretty hurt right now. 

My boyfriend of one year just left to Australia for a couple weeks, with his friend.  Soon as he landed I found him (mock location) on grindr.

He said he didnt use grindr ever because he didn't like it , (we met on tinder) or any app after we started officially dating. He didn't even wait until he got to his hotel room. And used a pic of himself from a couple days ago. I messaged him to see what he was looking for (in hopes he was just looking to meet people) and he went to the straight to the point of meet up for fun. 

This has been my second relationship and my first one fell apart after my bf cheated on me in Spain and after 4 year break from dating I took a chance on this guy and just hurts to have the same thing happen to me.

I didn't confront him about it because I feel there is no point. I consider it over already and his two weeks over there will help me get over wanting to see him. I removed him from all my social media just now.

I am not looking for any advice or anything. Just wanted to let it out because I'm so ashamed to tell my family or friends"
