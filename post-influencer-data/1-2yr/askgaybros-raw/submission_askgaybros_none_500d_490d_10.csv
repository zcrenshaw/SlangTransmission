0,"I accidentally outed my son.


Throwaway, because I'm neurotic. 

After about a dozen panic attacks, I've finally calmed down enough to post this. 

So tonight I stopped over my parent's house as I normally do every Friday on my way home from work. It was the usual small talk with them, weekend plans, kids, etc. etc. Monday is my son's 18th birthday, they asked if I was doing anything special for him this weekend, I mindlessly said, that I was taking ""Him and Sean"" out for Sushi, and to see the new Avengers movie.  They questioned who Sean was, as they had never heard the name.  Again, I mindlessly, instantly replied ""oh, His boyfriend"", the second it came out of my mouth, I knew I had really, really, fucked up.  

My parent's are VERY old school, VERY conservative, and VERY Lutheran.  They immediately started in on me, about ""how could I allow this"" and telling me that I was a horrible parent, and what on earth would people say about me as a father for allowing my son to choose that ""disgusting and unchristian lifestyle"" and telling me that my wife was a horrible mother for being too overbearing and making him gay, and it's my fault because I allowed him to not play sports.  ""This would have never happened if you sent him to a Christian school""  {Yes, I am [serious] there are people who still think like this in the world}

It gets worse.  They told me that he wasn't welcome on Sunday (they were having a party for him). This is where I totally snapped.  I snapped so bad, I'm not sure about half of what I even said to my parent's.  I basically told them that they were horrible people, and horrible Christians (I think ALL religion is bullshit, but I threw this in there as a zing) and that they weren't going to tell me how to raise my children, and if this is how they were going to be, the next time I'd see them is when they were laying in a wood box, just to make sure.  (I took that too far, but all I saw was RED, YOU DO NOT FUCK WITH MY KIDS) 

Now I don't know what to do.  I've made such a mess.  I've been having a meltdown with my wife, what do I tell my son!?!  ""Sorry Josh, you're father is a piece of shit, and I just ruined our relationship with the family, because I wasn't paying attention.""  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS.  THIS IS 2018 FOR FUCK'S SAKE.  I feel awful, and I'm pissed off because I shouldn't have to feel awful, because shit like this shouldn't happen.  

I've known my son was gay since 2nd grade.  It never mattered.  The day he actually told us, he was so calm, I'll never forget it, we were all in the kitchen getting dinner ready for the grill, and he just looked at us, and said in the middle of conversation ""You know I'm gay, right""?  We stopped for a second, and I just said, ""yeah, we do, do you want corn or beans as a side""? He laughed, we all teared up a bit, we hugged him, then almost instantly we went back to talking about how bad we both wanted the 75th Anniversary edition Jeep.  

This is so fucked up.  HOW do I handle this!?! What do I say when we don't go over there on Sunday.  My kids (18 &amp; 16) are (thankfully) old enough to understand, but that's not the point.  I just feel like I failed as a parent on this one.  My wife and I more so, are both messes right now.  I don't want to hurt my son, but I feel like I have somehow betrayed him,  this wasn't for me to tell.

Help.  "
1,"How do I infect someone with the gay?


I've heard all over Fox News that I can turn my straight crush gay. But no matter how many times I brush against him, act flamboyant around him, or whisper Satanic messages in his ear, he keeps being straight. What am I doing wrong?"

3,"Straight guy here - worried my boyfriend could be gay - any advice?


I‚Äôm a straight guy, hope you bros don‚Äôt mind me asking for advice - long story short I‚Äôm starting to worry that my boyfriend may be gay.

My name‚Äôs Jon. Using my gay friends account to post this. I don‚Äôt have anything against gay guys. A lot are really hot. I just identify as straight, so does my boyfriend - who I‚Äôll call Sam. We‚Äôre both straight acting ( because we are straight). Also, we‚Äôre not gay.

I look like a young Bill Clinton and he looks like a young George W. Bush. I don‚Äôt know which one of us would run as Vice Prez if we decide to run. We‚Äôre not 100% that we‚Äôre gonna run anyway.

The problem is I‚Äôm starting to worry Sam could be gay. Last weekend we were in a coffee shop and something about the way he was drinking his flat white was just really gay. He was looking at a guy‚Äôs ass. Then he said ‚Äòthat guy‚Äôs hot‚Äô. And something about the way he said it just seemed really gay to me. I agreed that the guy was hot ( he was) but inside......inside I was worried.

I wondered if he could be...but we‚Äôve discussed this. We‚Äôre both straight and agreed to have a straight relationship.

Another time we were fucking, and when he was on top of me he just seemed really gay for some reason. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was hot, it was amazing like usual. But then afterwards we were all sweaty and feeling good and he said ‚Äúthat was so good‚Äù.

The way he used the word ‚Äòso‚Äô... that was ‚Äòso good‚Äô. Not just ‚Äògood‚Äô but ‚Äòso good‚Äô. I thought we were having straight sex. ‚ÄòSo good‚Äô. Do you think he could be gay? He‚Äôs always liked action movies and beer and lifting things, which I don‚Äôt think gay guys like. I thought I was dating a straight guy, just like me. ( I have nothing against gay or bi guys by the way).

But now I‚Äôm beginning to feel like our whole relationship is built on a bed of lies. Could it have become gay without me even realising it? Could he have become gay? Why do things have to change? Why did we both find Thor really hot in Avengers 3?

Then something happened the other day, we were having coffee. Both in a straight way.  It was a beautiful day. Then he turned to me and said, ‚Äúcall me crazy, but are you gay?‚Äù"
4,"Being gay is just so great


While you're listening to music, or lying awake at night, or looking out the window in a car or on the bus, do you just ever think about how *great* it is to be gay? 

I know that homophobia's a real thing, that a lot of people don't like gays, that there are infinite struggles involved, and that I'm still pretty scared to come out or tell anyone I'm gay. But it is just such a nice feeling. I just *love* being gay. I wouldn't have it any other way. I just wouldn't ever want to be straight. I love that I love other guys. I love being the way I am because that's how I am.

Can you guys relate?"

Thought I‚Äôd share this with y‚Äôall. Friday I graduated from this university and Saturday I publicly came out by posting this blog highlighting how horrible the school handles LGBTQ students.

7,"Funny conversation with my awkward boss


Started a new job a couple of weeks ago, few of us all started as new hires. It's a traditionally pale, male, stuffy workplace though diversity is getting much better. My boss doesn't actually manage me all that much, I just do my own thing. I go to him if I need help or comes to me if I mess something up. Had a sit down and a chat on day one to get to know each other, mentioned I had a boyfriend. He's cool with it, he's just a socially awkward person. He lives in fear of doing something wrong or being criticised. Yesterday he came into my office looking worried:

Boss:- Hi OP I'm a bit worried I've done something I shouldn't. Have you met Steve yet?

Me:- Yep.

Boss:- Well Steve's gay. And he said to me ""I hear we've got a couple of gay guys in the new intake"". And I said, ""oh yes, you mean OP"" And Steve said ""what OP's gay? I meant John, though oops I don't know yet if he's out at work"". So I'm worried I've accidentally outed you to Steve. Is it a problem?

Me:- What John's gay?

Boss:- Oh god I've done it again"
8,"Oops. Outed myself a little early at work


Let me start out by saying, I'm a-okay and everyone had a good laugh. 


I've been working at my job for just under a year and I really love my job and co-workers. They all have husbands and children and all those responsibilities I couldn't even imagine. I have been told I come across as straight and a lot of people I tell look at me as if I'm joking when I come out or most commonly ""You're gay?!?!"" . No one really asked me about my relationships and I didn't really bring anything up because in the last year I've only been in short-term relationships. 


I've worn a pride bracelet every year during Pride Month since I came out 3 years ago. So I thought why not, I was kinda getting fatigued by tip-toeing around. I work in a very conservative state in a very conservative area. Luckily I knew they had the only other LGBT employee working with them that I know of in my field (I work in healthcare and she moved away a year prior). 


I go to my boss first thing on the 1st and ask if it is okay with hospital dress code that I wear my pride bracelet during Pride Month. I just told it as it was, I have been wearing this bracelet since I came out. She said yes, absolutely it is okay and that she really appreciated that I asked. I was simply trying to say I wasn't making a political statement which it definitely could be viewed that way due to my location. 


I wear my bracelet for FIVE minutes and one of my co-workers across the room asked if I was wearing a rainbow bracelet and I said ""Yeah I'm just supporting it being Pride Month"". She yells ""You're gay?!?!"" right in front of literally everyone and I just smile back and nodded my head. She actually apologized later, but I told her told not to worry. 

 
""Isn't that in June?""


 Oops...


I've been thinking about this for the last couple months and as it turns out, I'm not only gay, I'm also an idiot. 



They start cracking up basically asking if I was really sure I was gay because I don't even know the most important month. I make a ""I've been told I was a quick shooter"" joke, we all laugh and everything feels normal again. 



With the exception that I feel a hell of a lot better. 



Happy early Pride!
Cheers bros :)

9,"Quit fetishizing straight men


So i received [this email ](https://imgur.com/a/ljguK4E) from Adam4Adam as an ad describing how to turn straight men gay. this absolutely outraged me because it enforces a false narrative that all gay men want to ‚Äúturn‚Äù straight men and it‚Äôs ridiculous in my opinion. This is the kind of shit that makes straight men think we‚Äôre perverts and makes them scared of us (and ignorance/homophobia ofc) Adam4Adam should be ashamed of themselves for even sending something like this out. You can‚Äôt ‚Äútrick‚Äù someone into being a certain sexuality and the gay community knows this all too well. Yes I get that you may prefer masculine men, I do as well but being masculine isn‚Äôt synonymous with being straight. There are masculine straight men, as well as masculine gay men. Just like there are more feminine straight men, as well as feminine gay men. I guess I just don‚Äôt understand this fetish for straight me 

EDIT: i got two words for everyone that‚Äôs upset at this: internalized homophobia;)"
10,"Fuck it, next week I‚Äôm going to give my number to a cashier


Yea I‚Äôm nervous as fuck, but I hope it works out.  Life‚Äôs too short, and if I don‚Äôt do anything, nothing will happen.  I‚Äôm not going to feel optimistic about this, but at least I‚Äôll try."
11,"Is I like your boots now a gay pickup line?


Was walking to my place and ran into a couple of Mormon boys on their 2 year mission.  I was polite and declined their bibles saying my denomination works just fine for me.  The one talking wouldn't surprise me if he is gay.  The last thing he said was ""I like your boots"" and my boots are worn and stained"
12,"Where the fuck are the majority of gay guys hiding?


Everything gay from clubs to bars seems to have been taken over by ""perfect gays"". You know who I'm talking about: beautiful/good-looking, social, and successful dreamboats. All power to them but where are the average guys? What are they doing? Don't they have social events?"
13,"If you're not very ""fem"", but want gay dudes to notice you....


Wear a god damn gay themed accessory. Doesn't have to be a shirt that makes you look like a cry for help. Something small that someone checking you out would notice. 

I have a custom rainbow bracelet that sais ""don't touch me, you'll catch the gay"" on me and since then have had a few random ass guys just walk up and talk to me and even ask me out!! Before it was never anything more than discreet eye-fucking that could've just been confused with something else. 

Do yoself a favor, wear something gay!"

15,"[UPDATE] My bf doesn‚Äôt believe in evolution


Original:
Okay so I talked to him and you can see what I texted him in the first post. So firstly, he apologized for being so stubborn and inconsiderate. And told me, like someone mentioned from the first post, that as a JW he was prevented from learning a lot about basic science things and is still trying hard to catch up. He thinks that by dating me, he can learn and become better. So on that note, he asked me to prepare a lesson or something so he can learn and to be prepared to ‚Äúanswer a shit ton of questions‚Äù. I appreciate all the help and insight you all gave me, it means a lot. "
