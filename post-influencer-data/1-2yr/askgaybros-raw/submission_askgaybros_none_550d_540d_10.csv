0,"15 year old r/askgaybros user commit suicide after coming out to his parents in Saudi Arabia.


I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm just sad for the kid. I commented and tried to help and just hoped he'd be okay but the world isn't as kind to gays everywhere. Please be safe and continue to fight homophobia wherever you see it.

[Here is the initial post he made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7qi10g/i_made_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life_by_coming/?st=JERT8D4P&amp;sh=497ba6d2)

[Here is the update from someone who was able to stay in contact with him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7qi10g/comment/dvo7s8h?st=JERTFTYV&amp;sh=d712df96)"
1,"I was too rough with my boyfriend, not knowing he was abused.


We been dating for about 4 months now. I'd say our sex life is pretty normal, but one thing I have noticed is before we would anything he'd almost always ask me to be slow and gentle-which I don't/didn't mind. He claimed it was because it felt special that way, so I never questioned it. 

One night we got really intimate (he initiated it) and we made out for a good 15 minutes. I carried him to bed, undressed him and started kissing him everywhere. I thought he was enjoying it since he was reciprocating. Suddenly, he told me to stop and he sounded really scared. When I asked him what was wrong, He told me to leave him alone. 

He asked me to leave the room so I did. One hour later, I went to check on him and he started acting like nothing happened. So we went to bed and I decided not to bring it up. Then, he started crying hysterically and told me he was abused by his ex and that when I was being rough, it made him feel helpless. And that he was afraid of me treating him like his ex did. I feel really bad."
2,"Love, Simon made me realize I've got mad internalized homophobia.


Today I went to see Love, Simon with a friend. It was actually an incredible film for many reasons. But it also made me realize that I cannot truly love another man until I acknowledge my internalized homophobia. For a while I've nodded to my homophobia, I've realized that it's a thing and that I am going to need to see it as real. But until I saw Love, Simon I didn't realize that I actually could not love until I truly understood why I hate myself.

I spend a lot of time and energy trying to be ""straight,"" or at least make myself believe that I am straight...but at the end of the day I am going to marry a man, I am going to fall in love with a man, and I am going to raise a family with a man. At the end of the day, I need to realize that the world doesn't hate me...I am the only one who hates me...

To ask a question: have you seen Love, Simon? How did it make you feel? Did you cry? What did you discover about yourself?"

4,"Uni housemate complaining about me bringing guys back - am I being inconsiderate?


I‚Äôm a first year at university and I got a place in mixed halls- so I‚Äôm sharing a corridor, kitchen, and lounge with about 10 other people. I have relatively infrequent hookups with other students (once every couple of weeks) and a fwb- but I usually go to his flat off campus because he has a double bed.

Another guy in my hall told me a couple of days ago he‚Äôs uncomfortable with the guys coming into my room. I‚Äôm gonna be honest I was a bit taken aback because I am *not* the only person doing it. There‚Äôs another guy who literally brings random girls back multiple times a week and a girl with a boyfriend in a nearby city who visits a lot too. I‚Äôve talked to them both and they say this guy hasn‚Äôt approached them.

I always tell guys not to be loud and as I say it‚Äôs pretty infrequent so I have a feeling the guy is just being passively homophobic. He‚Äôs a pretty devout Christian and while we get along fine our conversations are pretty limited because he‚Äôs made it pretty clear he doesn‚Äôt agree with my ‚Äòlifestyle choices‚Äô as he puts it.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind stopping if he‚Äôd *asked the straight people* but as it stands I don‚Äôt feel like I should. What would you do in this situation?"

6,"I CAME OUT TO MY BROTHER!


I finally came out to my brother guys!! His reaction was more than anything I could have wished for! 

I told him last night, after contemplating it the past few days. He told me that‚Äôs cool and he said a bunch of other things that made me tear up on the metro. 

Things like why I hadn‚Äôt told him sooner, and how long had I known and who else did. He seemed more upset I wasn‚Äôt going out with him and his friends to the straight bars in town. But he kept telling me to be safe etc have fun and to call him if anyone is giving me trouble. (He‚Äôs 24 but still acts as though I‚Äôm 15 XD ) but its nice knowing he‚Äôs supporting me and it feels like a huge relief off my shoulders, chest and can somewhat breathe for the first time. 

I read a lot of stories before coming out so I wanted to share mine and hope someone else can find the courage and strength like I did when deciding to come out.

And I'm slipping under."
8,"My wife is losing it


After yesterday I told my wife what we talked about with my son and she went totally crazy, she said she can't handle this, that it's sickening and unnatural and that it's my fault because I didn't teach our son ""man"" stuff. Today she started yelling at our son but I pulled her away and then comforted him. Thinks are getting really out of hand."
9,"Please look at this.... [NSFW]






I love you all and I hope that everyone has a great day. Life gets hard sometimes but each and every one of you are worth so much and you all bring something to the table. Thanks for making me laugh, think, and care a little more each day. You all are awesome! üíì"
10,"My boyfriend finally said 'I love you', I couldn't be happier!


I first said 'I love you' after 7 or 8 months. Now it's a couple of weeks short of a year, and he finally said it back!

He had said nice sweet things about how he feels about me (for example, in response to my 'I love you's). How I make him happier and he's glad to have me in his life, etc. But never the actual words 'I love you'. Until this weekend!

Needless to say, I'm happy beyond words! And now every time he says it, I feel like I'm... melting... Such a happy and warm feeling. &lt;3"
11,"[UPDATE] Wrongly assumed best friend was straight and now we‚Äôve fallen for one another‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs just one thing I don‚Äôt know how to deal with...


Here‚Äôs my original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/83bug6/wrongly_assumed_best_friend_was_straight_and_now
I didn‚Äôt expect I‚Äôd get that many bros telling me to just go for it. You guys made me feel less weird.

When Leo got here, soon as he got through the door he asked if 2 weeks was enough. And I was like what? ‚ÄúIs two weeks apart enough time spent pretending? Can we go back to being ourselves now?‚Äù is pretty much what he said. He looked hurt and I felt super bad. He came closer and we just held each other a while. Felt so good after all this time. He buried his face in my neck and I pressed my nose in his hair and I just stopped caring about anything else.

We agreed to give us a chance. We‚Äôll keep it for ourselves though, not ready to tell anyone right now. If it works out, we both feel it‚Äôll be easier to ‚Äúannounce‚Äù it to our friends and family after having already been a thing for a while. I‚Äôm a bit iffy about hiding a relationship. I understand why we have to right now but, like I said I‚Äôve never hidden that I was gay, I realized I was into guys when I was 12 and pretty much told my parents and Leo right away, so yeah, it‚Äôs not something I wanna keep hiding in the long run. But like someone commented, we‚Äôve always spent a lot of time together, so it won‚Äôt look odd for now. We‚Äôll just have to refrain from PDA. We‚Äôre in Canada, for those who wondered or assumed USA. First cousins marriage is legal here I think, but I really don‚Äôt wanna get married ever so, the legal aspect of it isn‚Äôt a concern to me.

We spent the rest of the evening cuddled in my bed, watched Jessica Jones and eventually fell asleep. He woke me in the wee hours of the morning with his hands and his mouth all over me and this time, pants did come off. We blew each other and while he was a bit clumsy at first, he got into it in the end and it was nice. The moans I got from him when I sucked him‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so turned on in my fucking life.

So now I‚Äôm writing this in bed with him next to me and he keeps smiling as he reads, and he pushes the laptop away every 30 seconds and keeps pestering to go get breakfast somewhere. I might update further along the line, I don‚Äôt know. "
12,"Yeah I don't normally bareback but I don't have a condom. *Gets condom 5 minutes later*


Has this actually worked on any of you? 

I've had this happen on a couple of hookups after I've reached their house. They want to have sex, I establish that I don't have intercourse raw, they say that they are the same way, but just so horny and don't have any condoms. I persist, and magically they remember they have some condoms.

How is random raw sex still so prevalentüò®?"
13,"What‚Äôs with all the creeps in this sub?


I‚Äôve been noticing that when posts done by 16 year olds and teen gays attracts a lot of sexual attention. For example, in one post a 16 yo that goes to boarding school did an ama and most of the questions were sexual. In another post a 16 yo was trying to get advice on his cousin who tried to kiss him. There was a comment saying to fuck him with a bunch of upvotes and encouraging incest. Is it just me or have you guys been noticing this happening somewhat frequently? I get that is in an unmoderated sub but still. (I‚Äôve looked through their post history and many of them are older than 30). The legal age in a lot of states and countries is around 16 but it‚Äôs still creepy as hell. Thoughts? "
