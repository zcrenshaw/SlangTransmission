0,"Guy I had a date with neglected to mention a pet pigeon???


Not much scope for discussion here but holy shit this is a story I need to tell. Went on a date last night, it had gone really well, we were both a little tipsy and he was hot. He asks if I want to come back to his place and winks.

We're at his place, dick in ass, and I shit you not, suddenly a fucking pigeon flies into the room. Like a big city pigeon. It lands on the headboard of his bed and starts cooing angrily and shaking its wings at me. 

I freak the fuck out and pull out, and he starts laughing and says he completely forgot to tell me he has a pet pigeon with free flight in his apartment and starts petting it. Who the fuck has a pet pigeon???? In retrospect it was pretty funny but honestly when the thing flew into the room I was so close to soiling his sheets."

It's a big turn on for me lol

3,"Best Week Ever: My professor made a joke about me on Grindr &amp; I came out to my family. My Mom is already laughing about the Applebee's waiter sending me dick pics :)


It's been a very emotional roller coaster the last couple of days. I can't be any happier and wanted to share this with everyone. 

I made it my New Years resolution to come out of the closet, and I could feel this anxiety gradually building up inside me. I'm currently taking an art history class called ""That's So Gay,"" at my university (focusing on Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, etc.). For once in my life I was being surrounded by positive role models that so happened to be gay. At college, everyone knows I'm gay- but at home? Not so much. That's So Gay is wonderful; some of us are writing research papers on how AIDS impacted art, or how art can be kinky, why some art is deemed as gay, etc. Well, when [Playboy published an article online about my dick art this week](http://www.playboy.com/articles/meet-the-illustrator-whos-turning-your-dick-pics-into-art), my professor loved it and had to share it with everyone.

Long story short, my professor had me explain how I drew the dick pics I get from Grindr to my classmates. Everyone looked at me bewildered when they found out I already have almost drawn 300 dicks. My professor especially enjoyed hearing about the part how I just saw penis #271 walk by me before class, how I saw penis #181 teaching his class, and how I just saw penis #10 while I was at work the night before. Well, long story short, he grins and asks me if I'm ""on Grindr purely for the art."" Not really suspecting him to ask me that, I slowly reply, ""......Yeah..""

 Everyone started to laugh. It was so weird..yet at the same time wonderful. It felt so right to be honest with everyone. Moments like these, in which I could finally be myself, all aided me in finally telling my Mom I was gay.

I had been planning to tell her for months. I told my older brother months ago, and he told me it would be best to tell her; she's the heart of my family. Finally, yesterday I had the chance. It was just us two in the living room watching TV. The Price is Right or something is on the TV and we're making jokes about people's costumes and everything. I could feel my heart race just at the thought of opening my mouth. I couldn't believe I was about to say anything. Then I grabbed the remote. I muted the TV. She looks at me, confused. I tell her I had something to say.

Immediately she looks at me, her heart breaking before my eyes. She asks me what's wrong; I can tell she's scared. I told her I was sorry, and then I finally told her I was gay. She instantly pulled me over and starts to give me the biggest hug of my life. We started to both cry into each others shoulders. I remember almost everything she said. I could tell she was so relieved. ""Oh honey, I was so scared something was wrong."" I kind of didn't expect her to say that. It's bringing tears to my eyes right now. ""What a heavy burden to carry."" She whispered to me. She asked me how long I had been holding it in for. I told her a long time. We both cried some more, and I will never forget what she said next:

**""I just don't want you to get hurt, man or woman. We all need love. Love is the only thing that matters in this world, and I love you.""**

At this point I was completely numb. I had been holding this in for so long. It didn't feel real. I didn't want to let go of her. She asked me so many questions so fast; I would have never guessed how open she wanted to be. She had been going through a lot of problems recently due to anxiety. She told me she felt bad that I held all of this in while I was helping her. Within five minutes of coming out to her she is asking me if I was still single. I told her I was. Without hesitating she had to remind me that the neighbor's son was gay too. I could not help but to laugh like crazy. God, I couldn't believe what was happening.

By that night everyone knew I was gay. As I got off work I checked my phone only to see this [text message from my little brother](https://imgur.com/a/oXeKO). My whole family knows... And they only want me safe and happy. I still can't believe this. I feel so light inside. I've been holding this in me for so long, I've been so used to pretending. It took awhile for it to finally hit me. At first I was just numb. But now? ..I'm so indescribably happy. Like.. I'll be okay no matter what. It's weird. 

My parents wanted me home over the weekend from college so we could spend some time together. We just got done eating breakfast that I made. We're all watching the Office and laughing. They all know I'm gay.. and nothing's changed. Yet it feels so different. It feels good. I can't believe I had been holding that in me for so long. By the time we all finish breakfast, it was just my Mom and I. I can tell she's curious about things, and now I can finally get some things off my chest. A couple of weeks ago [I posted about how I went out with my family at Applebee's only to realize that our waiter had sent me a dick pic the night before](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7ot3l7/i_had_lunch_at_applebees_with_my_familyonly_to/). I could see her eyes getting wider as I tell her. I tell her he wants to meet me over spring break and tie him up and let me have his way with him. She starts to laugh like crazy, and I can't believe this is my normal now. I can't believe I'm already telling her about all of this now. I'm so glad I don't have to pretend anymore. 

**Before this I was so scared about what they would think. There was always this chance they would react badly. But it's as if they don't really care that I'm gay- they care that I'm happy. I'm very blessed.. I know everyone's life is different, but I hope this story shows that the world isn't full of doom and gloom. I would have never thought it'd be like this. I've been so alone and scared for so long. When I was in middle/high school.. I felt like such a freak. Now I'm taking an art class about gay art, and my whole family knows I'm gay. And I was interviewed for Playboy?!?! I just hope your day is going good. I just wanted to share the good vibes.**

**Love you all.** 
 
*Thank you for the gold! I'm glad my story is being heard. I hope someone that needs to hear it is able to find this.* "
4,"I came out to my wife


After years upon years of hiding and repressing my sexuality I told my wife that I am a gay man.  This was not a total shock to her. We've talked about the subject many times before, however up until the now she will only say that I'm ""struggling with my sexuality"".  I finally told her that I was a gay man, that still loved her, just not in the complete way she deserved and wanted.

I have no idea what's next, probably talk to our girls, but for now we are just adjusting the situation.

I'm very excited and cautious at the same time. "
5,"Some good gay news from Russia (and it's rare enough to speak of it !)


I didn't see a topic about it, so I though that was worth the share...

Here is the all story : https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-russias-hilarious-homoerotic-satisfaction-became-a-nationwide-meme-of-solidarity

To sum up  : a group of Russian aviation students made a homoerotic clip on the song ""Satisfaction"", dancing half naked on the music, imitating a english video who did the same. Their video leaked, and soon, media and state reacted strongly (with this all ""gay propaganda"" blullshit, ""disgrace to the mother country"", etc.). So far, nothing new in Russia.

Then, a BIG reaction came from the net : a lot of people across Russia made the same video, on the same song, with the same homoerotic content,  to support the student, and published it on the net. From every part of Russia (i copy the list from the article) : trade schools, emergency services, jockeys, theatre troupe, nurses, members of the Russian women’s biathlon team, Ukrainian swim team, ""retired women of St. Petersburg filmed in the squalor of a communal apartment""...

Maybe it's more a ""fuck you"" to the state wanting to rule the private life of its people, more than a reaction to homophobia itselft. But it's still a surprise and a good news, and I wanted to share it !

6,"Russian Federation Accidentally Legalised Gay Marrige!


http://gmag.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/schwule-russen-heirat-daenemark-ring-600.jpg

Russia shocked all over the world and even itself by accepting a gay marriage accidentally!

Eugene Wojciechowski and Pavel Stotsko married in Copenhagen, Denmark at 4th of January with their matching bow ties. They weren't expecting the fact that their marriage will be recognised by their homeland,  Russia. When they went back to Moscow a government official sealed their passport in 5 minutes and that  means government accepted their marriage.

This news is even more shocking because according to a research 83% of the Russian people are against gays. 

According to Russian laws ANY marriage is accepted outside of the country except some facts which are mentioned in the Family Law the 14th. However same sex fact is not mentioned in that law.

8,"Feeling conflicted about my sexuality after getting really intimate with my best friend.


He's 16, I'm 15 and we both have girlfriends..

He came over to my house on a Tuesday night (school was cancelled for Wednesday because of the snow) so we could play video games together. While we were playing, he kept losing to me and this infuriated him. So he started yelling, threw the controller across the room and left the room.  After he came back, I kept making fun of him and then he got up, locked the bedroom door, and whispered in my ear that I was going to regret what I said. Then suddenly he grabbed me, pushed me against the wall, and started kissing me roughly while dry-humping me. It felt surprisingly good-even better than being intimate with my girlfriend. I reciprocated and it wasn't long until we got into my bed. We were both half naked and he was about to bang me missionary style, but I told him I didn't want it  and he immediately stopped. I actually did want to have sex with him, but I just felt really shocked by what we had already done..then he ended up staying the night and we cuddled. And it felt so right. When he was holding me I felt safe ad protected. 

I am confused because I never felt this way towards another boy before. He's the only guy I have felt attracted to. So maybe I am straight, but  he's just an exception? I dont know."
9,"He wrote about me on social media :)


I’ve been talking to this guy for a couple months now. I don’t “follow” his Instagram, but I check it from time to time (profile is public). 

We’ve only been on 4-5 dates now. But he posted a pic and captioned it about his amazing date last night. 

I felt this rush as soon as I read it, because he didn’t make that post for me. He made it for everyone, assuming I wouldn’t be aware of it. And I literally feel euphoric bc I’m starting to feel the same with him. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share this because it makes me happy. I just want to be in his arms again. "
10,"There is an out gay K-pop singer debuting!


Some people in this sub used to ask about out gay K-pop artists. And it always saddened me to say that there are none, and that coming-out would be a suicide move. But there is now an openly gay guy about to make his debut. So here you go, guys! His name is Holland and you can check him out on https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=2LP16R5IeJs. His debut song comes out on Jan. 22. That there is now an openly gay K-pop artist tells a lot about the changes in the industry and in a broader sense, Korean society. Change might be slow, but it's happening! So please do root for him. He looks gorgeous btw :))

+ I don't know how to add links to instagram but you can find him on instagram by typing holland vvv"
