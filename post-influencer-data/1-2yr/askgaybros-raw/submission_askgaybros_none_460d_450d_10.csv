1,"Dad definitely just caught me jerking it to gay porn


At 12:32 AM, while I, a typical 16 yr old, was peacefully jerking off, my door suddenly flies open and my Dad barges in. He sees what I'm doing and what I'm watching, stares for a solid 2-3 seconds, and just as quickly leaves. What he was doing in my room at 12:32 AM, I have no idea. Fuck. Embarrassed and outed all at once. And he has to drive me to cross country practice in the morning. Fuck. Wish me luck bros. I have an awkward af 24 hrs ahead."
2,"I came out to my parents, it went as expected


You guys helped me see what I already knew - that I had to come out. I am just back from my parents' home. We had a long, long talk but to sum it up: I told them I was gay, they said from this moment on they have only one son( my brother) and asked me to leave the house and never return and also delete there contacts because I am no longer welcome in their lifes. I told my boyfriend that I came out and he was very happy about it. I on the other hand feel awfully sad, been crying all the way home. Life sucks."
3,"I came out to my conservative trump supporting Christian parents....


I facetimed my mom and dad with and introduced my boyfriend and I came out...

They said that while my lifestyle conflicts with their view of the world, Iâ€™m still their son and they still love me unconditionally. They invited me and my boyfriend to their barbecue next weekend. 

My dad says my boyfriend seems  really nice. 


I am literally in tears right now, my boyfriend is consoling me with cuddling ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I thought it would end up badly. "

Stay-at-home housewife"

6,"Boyfriend is in the hospital


My boyfriend had been feeling off for a few months. He was tired and he had started to develop some bad back pain, he'd just brushed it off saying it was probably because he'd been working too long/hard. it had been getting worse and worse but he didn't want to see a doctor. then about a week ago he peed blood, a lot of blood. So he went to his general practitioner and I went with him, the doctor took one look at him and told him that he needs to see a urologist immediately.

So he was admitted and they ran some tests and we found out he had cancer. Really bad systemic kidney cancer. I spent the day with him, I held his hand, and I thought he was doing okay, he was joking and laughing. So when he asked me if I could go get some things from our apartment for him I didn't think anything of it. But when I came back to the hospital they wouldn't let me see him, I was confused so I told them who I was and that's when my heart sank. They told me that he specifically told them he didn't want to see me. I sat in the lobby trying to call him but he wouldn't pick up. I just can't help but think that it was something I said or I didn't help him enough. Or maybe he blames me."
7,"Homophobic sister and her deadbeat boyfriend want help...


So my sister has been a huge asshole, she always said mean things about gay people, AIDS and going to hell, you know the drill...

She is always never nice to me, not saying NEVER, but I'm saying that she never played a big part in my life in any way at all other than to be the antagonist.

Now she and her college dropout, drug dealing boyfriend need to borrow my car.

 It was my mom's car, but she GAVE it to me as soon as I got my driving license. No question about that whatsoever and I've also been using it since the start of this year at college. 

I said no to them borrowing the car and everyone in the family got mad at me, but I know that if I let them borrow, it means that I let homophobia win, it means that I'm a pushover, I'm a doormat. 

Am I in the wrong?

9,"Gays who can only have sex with men they love


I can't imagine hooking up with a man I barely know just based on physical attraction. I have to know the guy, there needs to be chemistry and love. Sex sans love is just off-putting in my eyes. It's an intimate act where you're at your most vulnerable. 

Have you ever struggled with these feelings? Have you ever gone on a first date with a guy who expected sex?"

11,"My friend asked me if Iâ€™m the male or the female during sex...heâ€™s description of the two positions was very, uhh, vivid.


I told him that no one in gay sex is the female...both are men.

He then proceeded to explain, that what he meant was...am I the person who is the hole or the person who clogs the hole with their Johnson

Iâ€™m a fucking mess dying of laughter. He means this in a funny way and itâ€™s our type of humorâ€”thereâ€™s no offense to be taken. 

clogs hole with their Johnson ... Iâ€™m still laughing 

any one experience naive friends in similar instances? 

Note: this question was not inappropriate in the context of our situation"
12,"Dudes with below average dicks


Don't let all the size queens getcha down. Most guys can definitely ""feel"" even when you stick a finger up their butt, so a even a smaller dick is more than workable for most guys bottoming. 

Bring on the penis!"
13,"How do you handle being ""gay-best-friended""?


This is a relatively recent phenomenon. I'm out in high school and have been for the past two years. It has been relatively smooth sailing for me with very little bullying. However, I'm noticing this odd way that my (straight, usually female) friends keep on behaving around me.

1. When I first came out to one of my friends, the first thing she asked me was: ""Do I look good in this outfit?"" It is to be noted that I never gave fashion advice before this event and was wearing a t\-shirt and paint\-stained shorts at the time.
2. A few months ago, one of the more popular girls at my school asked me to go shoe\-shopping with her and asked me if I could give her advice with her boyfriend. It is to be noted that I have never had a boyfriend and wear sneakers pretty much every day. She even changed her vocal tone around me as if she were at a bachelorette party. 
3. While most of this behaviour has been occasional and only from my more vapid friends, this one really kicked me. One of the mothers of one of my best friends reached out to me the other day through text and started speaking about her childhood best friend who was gay, Mario. She then told me she really liked me and that I was her daughter's Mario  I am sure this message was sent with only the best intentions. She was basically saying I was a very good friend, but all I could hear was ""I'm so glad my daughter found a gay best friend like I did"". 

So what do you think? Am I overreacting to find these small incidents irritating and that they perpetuate stereotypes? Have you ever experienced similar behaviour from your girl\-friends? Please share."
14,"Do you ever hesitate or have problems saying ""I'm gay""?


Those words in particular. I will be talking to friends and coworkers and say stuff like ""I was on a date last night and the guy seems really nice"" or ""We met at a gay bar"", but I can never bring myself to say ""I'm gay"". I was even dating a guy and introduced him to people as the guy I'm dating, but I have never been able to say those words. Anyone else?"
15,"Have you ever met a guy who was kind of an asshole but you fucked him anyway because he was hot?
