http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40589561

So the staunchly Catholic country, Malta which didn't even allow divorce up until six years ago, legalized gay marriage a couple of hours ago by a 66-1 vote."

Which is odd because every time he cums in me i tell him that i can't get pregnant but he keeps insisting on trying it again. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
3,"Question about talking about safe sex with my teenage son


Hi guys, I have a question, maybe two, and I'm hoping you can help me out.

My 14 year old son recently (within a few months) told me he is pansexual, which I have a feeling is a pit stop on the way to just being gay. He currently has a boyfriend, it's been a couple weeks since they started ""dating"" (quotes because there have been no actual dates, mostly snapchats and a few group hangouts at the lake, it's pretty innocent at this point).

We've had plenty of talks about safe sex over the years, but it was all very hetero based because, well, that's what I know and what I thought he'd need to know. It wasn't. So now I need to learn what else I need to go over with him and the right way to do it.

We have a pretty open dialog, I'm sure he has his secrets but for the most part he talks to me about everything, so it's not going to be an uncomfortable conversation, I'm just not sure what, exactly, needs to be covered. 

He claims he doesn't want to have sex until after high school, he's pretty square but I hold no illusions that he won't at the very least be experimenting over the next four years.

I've already planned on stashing some condoms in his bathroom with the promise I won't be counting or being weird about it. We've covered a lot of the emotional aspects of being in a relationship and how to be a good partner and how to expect your partner to treat you and all that. I don't really think I need to go over the ""how"" part of sex but I want him to always be safe and protected so what do I need to know, what do I need to tell him? 

Also, since I'm here, and this is kind of new, what advice do you have for me as I help him navigate all of this? As a mom, all I want is for him to be safe and happy and know that he's loved. 

Sorry this was so long, it's just who I am, lol.

Edit: Oh man, thank you guy so much, you are amazing! I never expected this much response. I appreciate it so much. I promise I'll respond to everyone!"
4,"I came out to my mom accidentally


I'm really lost on how I feel about what happened today.

Me and my mom spent the whole day arguing about a situation that involves me sharing a room with a girl. She kept saying it would be a distraction and that it's inappropriate and should not happen. She's very old fashioned and has a one sided way of thinking. We were going back and fourth and eventually got close to yelling and so I yelled at her that I'm not even into girls. 

She didn't believe me at first and thought I was just saying it and I had to explain and I broke down crying and I can't tell if she's taking it well or bad. She is obviously disappointed but also asking a bunch of (oddly personal) questions and I just really don't know what to do. I was worried that she would hate me and she said she would never but she also talks about gay people like gay people are super unnatural and I just wanted to vent all this out. Thank you for reading. Its been a really shitty day. 

Update: thank you guys for the overwhelming support and advice, it literally means the world right now. So far I don't know if my mom is taking things well or anything, but she's treating things like normal? She hasn't acknowledged it at all or anything and I'm really happy about that but scared due to how unpredictable my mom is. Thank you again guys :) "

7,"Warning: Drug-Resistant HIV is increasing


[Source](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=6742027)

[Source](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/hiv-drug-resistance/en/)

&gt;He believes that HIV resistance is due to the fact that more people receive remedies in the world and they do not have adequate follow-up treatment. ""It's partly due to good reasons, but a backside is that in some patients the virus is resistant to the commonly used emergency medication, and then medication does not work properly,"" says Jan Albert

&gt;HIV drug resistance develops when people do not adhere to a prescribed treatment plan, often because they do not have consistent access to quality HIV treatment and care. Individuals with HIV drug resistance will start to fail therapy and may also transmit drug-resistant viruses to others. 

Lesson: If you don't take care of yourself, how in the hell you gonna take care of somebody else? Can I get an amen? ðŸ’… ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ
