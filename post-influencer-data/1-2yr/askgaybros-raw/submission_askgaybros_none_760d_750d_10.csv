0,"Anyone else have a gay guy fetish?


I see that a lot of guys here are into straight guys, but I'm a gay man who is really attracted to men who are into other men. 

I'm not judging anyone else, but I personally get really excited and aroused by men who are openly into other men. I'm talking about guys who are sexually attracted to men, NOT women. 

I know it seems a little crazy, but my dick gets really hard when I see attractive men who are into other men. The kind of guys who don't have sex with women, but MEN. These are the guys I like.

I'm starting to feel alone in the gay community and want to know if anyone else is like me. "
1,"Shout out to the fem guys.


I meant to post this last night but I forgot. Anyway...

Lately on this sub I've noticed guys saying they're not out to certain people, or they didn't feel the need to tell people they were gay at all. I'm guessing because they showed no visible signs of being gay. 

From the time I was about 8 or 9 I was a fucking princess and the whole world knew it. I was getting called fairy, queen, faggot, pussy, bitch, you name it before I got to junior high school. 

After a certain point I had no choice but to come out because there was no hiding it. Believe me, I tried. There's *still* no hiding it. Random strangers automatically know I'm gay from the moment I start speaking and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. Not that I really want to at this point. 

So I just want to say hello to my fellow fems because I'm in a good mood today and I want to be nice. "
2,"Went to a Gay Bathhouse for the first time.


I went to a gay bathhouse over the weekend. 
I wanted to share this with you guys since I'm not entirely out IRL.
(Parents are hardcore conservative Christians, and I'm in the military)

I live in a pretty big city, and I wanted to try out a bathhouse because I was feeling pretty lonely.  It was in a horrible area of town and looked pretty sketchy especially at midnight. 

I sat in my car for about 40 min nervously sweating and thinking 
""I'm gonna get recognized, or someone will hurt me!""

Once I had enough, I sprinted to the door.  The door was solid metal and had bulletproof mirror windows all around it; I guess in case someone approached with a gun?
At the door, there was an employee; I told him it was my first time. 
He said "" You do KNOW what kind of place this is? Right?""
I told him yes and felt so ashamed. 

He buzzed me in.  

Once inside, the entry room was a locker room.  
I stripped down and locked my stuff away.  

It was strange; it was like a big maze with some reflective material. 
It was also badly lit, in fact, most of the light was coming from TV Monitors playing gay porn. 

The men there were very average looking. (FYI I don't consider myself good looking, so I felt like I fit in).
I would say it was about (50% guys in their 50's, 30% guys in their 30's and 40's, and 20% in their 20's). 

Surprisingly, I didn't feel any judgment and most guys were polite.   
One older guy did corner me in the maze and said: ""You're exactly my type and grabbed my waist.""  I told him ""thanks, but I'm not interested.""

he then left, it still felt kinda weird. 

One room, had two guys on a bed fucking and a lot of guys were just watching and jacking off to it. 

Some cute couple was making out in a pool
and there was a steam-room, sauna, and showers!
There were computers, where I'm guessing a bi guy was watching straight porn? 

Eventually, I saw a cute guy and followed him, but I was too slow, and some other guy grabbed and started fucking him. 

I was like ""Whoa, umm maybe this place is too much for me to handle.""

I left after an hour or so,  some guy did try and suck me off, but I wasn't feeling it.  The entire time I just felt so apathetic.  

Honestly, I felt even lonelier after the whole thing, but I'm glad I did it.
I have nothing against bathhouses and recommend trying one just for the experience or to learn something about yourself.   I saw men there really enjoying themselves (no pun intended), so definitely the experience varies person to person.

But, just don't indulge in something thinking it will fix a problem.  
I feel less internalized homophobia, and I feel less afraid of talking to other single gay men now! I'm just feeling better about myself!!! 

Don't be too hard on yourself!!!üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

TL:DR

Felt sad. Went to bathhouse. Felt worse. 
\Rant\
Feel better. Bathhouses aren't bad, and 
neither is being gay.

3,"Who are the best nsfw guys on Snapchat?


I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for any exhibitionist that post nsfw stuff on their Snapchat stories. I've seen lists of pornstars on snapchat, but am thinking of something more amateur. In lieu of that, any suggestions on hot guys to add?
Thanks gaybros!"
4,"Don't Equate Black Civil Rights with Gay Civil Rights


I was told this today by an aquaintance and, to tell you the truth, it really fucking hurts. 

The person who said this is a black woman I've known since grade school and she got angry with me that I would dare equate black civil rights with LGBT rights.  In her words: ""you can just not say anything about yourself and no one will know your gay but I can't hide the color of my skin and these people are coming for me.""  

I didn't even address her comment because she is the type that she is never wrong on these matters and that the only civil rights that matter are those for black people. 

ANyway.  I'm sorry for rambling.  This is just really weighing on my mind and heart today, I can't believe someone who hoists the liberal flag and proclaims their liberal opinions so loudly would essentially tell me to shut up and be quiet and I wouldn't have to worry about civil rights.    "
5,"Super turned on by tank tops


Does anyone else here get super turned on by looking at guys in tank tops, or even wearing them yourself?

If so, what's your favorite kind? Tight white ribbed ones? Athletic sports ones? Ones that show tons of skin on the sides?

To me it's just so freeing, open, relaxed, and sexy. The first time I wore one I had such a boner. And I love seeing guys' well defined arms if they got em, and perhaps some pecs peeking out through the low cut neck. "
6,"Straight guy falling for gay best friend


Over the past year or so I've been questioning my sexuality. I've been straight my whole life but felt like I was also attracted to certain men. Nearly 2 years ago my best friend of 5 years came out to me telling me he was gay. After a couple of months after coming out he got a boyfriend which he was in a relationship for about a year until breaking up a few months ago. During that time I started to feel jealous and wanted to spend more time with him myself. Now that he is single I can't help but feel like I'm falling for him. We both joke around about being with each other and have everyone questioning if we're in a relationship or not, even another good friend of ours asked us if we were. I can't 100% tell if he's into me or not but I really feel I am into him (we both have anxiety).

Should I tell him how I feel or should we just continue being friends? If so how should I go about doing it? Thanks in advanced for anyone who helps!"
7,"Young Aussie here suffering as the gay marriage public vote campaigning has started


Hi.. I'm a 15 year old boy from Australia. We are having a public vote on gay marriage, and as such, there is campaigning as each side tries to argue their case.

The no side of the campaign is driving me into depression. It is hurting me so much, I feel like I am trash that did something wrong.

I'm at school, the only out gay kid at my school. We live in a Conservative area but anyway. In just a week, I have had a book thrown at my head by an older student. I've had threats of violence. I've had notes slipped into my locker telling me I deserve to burn in hell, unnatural piece of shit, keep your gross agenda to yourself no one wants to ever see or hear it. And all of these cases have been dealt with by the head teacher but I still feel the stigma of being gay in a Conservative area.

And it doesn't even end there. The public vote is all over my news feed on Facebook, and somehow, the no campaign's hateful comments always, always make it to the top of the comments list. Thanks, Mark Zuckerberg. You say you support gay rights, well, you could do more to censor hate. I love going on my Facebook, reading news updates and then seeing people essentially say that theres something deeply, deeply wrong with me.

I don't want to be gay. I know people see me as abnormal... :( I feel so degraded and like I'm a sub human because I cannot even get married *unless* a majority of the rest of the country gives me their permission first..well, if I ever make it there.

And finally, I have anxiety. A lot of it, which is keeping me up late at night. Anxiety that what if this vote doesn't pass? I might just add its already rigged in the NO sides favour and on top of that, we need to wait two whole months for the result. Two whole months of anxiety.

Basically, I just hate life right now. I'm crying as I write this and need someone to talk to"
8,"What are my chances of dating? I have no penis.


Am 19 now. Was shot when I was 16 in the area and the whole thing is gone.

I‚Äôve dated three guys so far. Two walked away upon learning of it, one walked away after seeing the area. My self esteem is pretty much in the negative right now and in the past month I‚Äôve been thinking that I will need to come to reality that I‚Äôll be single for the rest of my life. I dealt with the depression post my incident by convincing myself that I can be a bottom and still have a healthy sex life and relationships but it doesn‚Äôt seem like it.

Am I hopeless?"
9,"I forgot how amazing dick was


So after 5+ years of not getting plowed from mourning my late husband, then going into an oral-only phase, then going into a sexless LDR, then a couple of grindr flakes, I finally ended that streak today.
Life went from [this](http://st.gde-fon.com/wallpapers_original/575305_pustosh_konets-sveta_art_gorod_bogdan_apokalipsis_2039x1293_www.Gde-Fon.com.jpg) to [this](http://kleineganz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/UtopiaCity5.jpg). The colors are brighter, the sun is warmer, and humanity suddenly doesn't suck so much. 

No question, just wanted to say dick is god's gift to us mortals."
10,"(NSFW) Is there something I can do about


precum? 

I'm very self-conscious about this, a bit of kissing or cuddling and i'm soaking wet down there, it's really embarrassing. "
