0,"UPDATE: Going on a date with a deaf guy


Original Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6pd4eh/im_going_on_a_date_with_a_deaf_guy_im_kinda/?st=j5lwjr7o&amp;sh=493ce5b7

So, I just got home from our date, and it went awesome, we met for sushi.  There was a little nervous icebreaking at first.  We did text a few things to each other throughout the night, he also carries a small notepad with him just incase.  He was pretty good at lip reading, and I was making a very conscious effort to talk slowly, as I have a bad habit of talking very fast.  

After dinner we went and sat at Starbucks where we were able to have very good conversation.  He had remarkably good pronunciation for someone who was deaf, although, I learned he hasn't been deaf his whole life, he's been deaf since about 10 years old, and he's considering having cochlear implants in the somewhat near future.  

I could tell every time I spoke too fast, or he missed something, because he would get this adorable smirk, almost like he was a little embarrassed he missed it.  He was SO cute, dark brown hair, hazel eyes, perfect teeth, scruffy, short-ish, just the perfect amount of muscle with a little bit on chunky side.  

During coffee he suggested a movie, which threw me, however, apparently they have closed captioning screens available at the theater, so we saw Valerian, which was good, during the movie he put his hand on my thigh, and I held his hand.  It was so sweet.  Another cute/funny thing, is when we agreed to meet at the theater, and were walking through the parking lot we realized, we drive the EXACT same car, color and all.  

We have another date set for Friday night, at my place :) "

3,"Update On Reconciling With My Father


About a year ago [I wrote a post on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/42zu3n/my_father_wants_to_maybe_reconcile_after_3_years/) regarding my father wanting to reconcile after 3 years of not speaking to each-other. I got a few messages asking for an update, so here it goes.

I decided to give it a go about a month after my original post. My mom wanted me to come over to the house, but I wasn’t comfortable with that (and figured it wouldn’t be the smartest idea, as some of you pointed out as well), so we met at a restaurant. I got there before them, and sat there with my insides clenched and super nervous. I don’t know why I was so nervous. And my heart jumped into my throat when my parents walked in. I honestly wanted to be a little cold and impersonal with him to start with, just to protect myself and my feelings. But I immediately teared up when I saw him, and he teared up as well (a rare sight) and then gave me a very long hug (which made my mom tear up, lol. All 3 of us were basically a mess.) He just kept repeating, “It’s so good to see you.” It was very sweet. 

Then we all sat down, and he did something I was not expecting at all, he apologized. I was floored, this is a stubborn as f*ck dude we are talking about. But he just said, “Look, I’m not gonna beat around the bush, I didn’t react how I should have when you told me about the gay thing. I was just shocked and kept thinking the worst. It would have helped if you didn’t just blurt it out at me out of nowhere (lol, he had to throw a dig at me) but regardless, I should have been more understanding. And the things I said, you know I didn’t mean. You’ll always be my son. Just, you know, take it easy with the gay stuff. Your mom tells me you are in a relationship, but I don’t think I’m ready to meet that person yet.” And I told him that was fine and that I didn’t expect him to meet the guy anytime soon, and that I was still the same person. 

Well, since then my partner and I broke up. And my dad has actually been joking about what guys I should date. We went to a basketball game a few weeks ago and he pointed to a guy and asked, “What about him?” I was confused, “What about him, dad?” “He seems like a nice guy, brought his mom to the game. No tattoos. Not checking his phone every 3 minutes. Good set of hair. Why aren’t you interested in a guy like that?” I died laughing. So, as you can see, he’s come a loooooong way. I am still in shock. "
4,"What the fuck is wrong with the gays who are trivializing HIV?


Yes - i have heard about the ""its 96 -99% chance safe to have sex with someone with hiv on treatment""

Yes - i use condoms

Yes - i know about prep, but im not taking prep

I have heard from some gay guys that they think people with hiv should not have to tell every person they hook up with that they are hiv-positive.

Everyone knows its a bigger risk to get hiv if you are gay, and especially because there are so many bisexual guys with girlfriends,  who cheats and secretly fucks other guys and are stupid enough to not use protection.

If you have HIV you have a responsibility to tell EVERY sexpartner, even random hookups that you have it. 
I would not have sex with an hiv-positive guy, and that is not mean, rude, discriminating or evil for me not wanting to. It is 4 % likely that you will get infected.

If a guy would infect me and he knew he's hiv-pos, i feel really sorry for what im gonna do to that guy, to say the least.

5,"PSA: It's OKAY to be masc and into masc guys only


Does anyone feel like this subreddit has a masc shaming problem? It feels like the sub is pro-fem when it should be pro-masc. If I posted ""I am a masc guy who likes fems guy"" there would be 100s of upvotes since every fem guy on here would upvote it. But if a masc guy posts ""I am a masc guy who likes masc guys"" it would be downvoted to hell and the OP would be criticized for preferring masc men like himself. Look we're not all queens here and some of us came here to be with other masc guys. So can we please stop criticizing masc guys for preferring the company of other masc guys."
6,"I'm salty af with this Sub... because


Rules are simple here , if you wanna get tons of upvotes and comments, you need to post something that's ULTRA relatable, shallow and/or overly ""cute and sexy"" like: 

*my perfect cardiologist boyfriend and I have been in a happy relationship for 15 years; he kisses me, he cuddles with me and fucks me every single day with his 12 inch dick and we have never been happier in our million dollar mansion in the most exclusive and least homophobic neighborhood in the world* 

These post get hundreds of comments while the young and inexperienced guys that actually need help and support don't even get an upvote... 

If most gay guys here are this stuck up, selfish, know it all and rude... then I don't even want to imagine how fucked up our community actually is in real life. 

*THIS IS NOT A SAFE SPACE* ... guess you got that right. I feel sorry for the poor youngsters that will come in search for help. They're doomed.

7,"Parents found out I'm gay and life is overwhelming right now


I'm going to explain everything as well as I can. For the record, I'm an immigrant who moved to Germany around 4 years ago at the age of 13. I'm 17 now. I live with my parents. My parents are huge homophobes who were born and raised in Eastern Europe for most of their lives.

The whole incident started a few days ago after my parents saw a message from my gay FWB after I had (stupidly) left my phone alone and unlocked. Apparently it was my dad who found the message, and he only meant to open the phone to check the time. We were on holiday in another country at this time so I was going to be stuck with them for another few days.

That day was pure hell. They were completely broken, crying about how I'm going to waste my life and how they cannot go on like this, how I've broken their dreams of having a family with grandkids and that I'm ""giving in to an illusion"". I was constantly told how this was a mistake, that I have one more chance to ""repair myself"" and that otherwise we would eventually split ways and they would die of stress and pain because of me. My friend was threatened with death, I was made to delete all my WhatsApp contacts and threatened with moving back to my old (also homophobic) home country. They claimed that they will always love me and that it's my choice to make, but it was obvious I was not given a choice.

The day after that I made an appointment with a therapist, who was very understanding and tried to explain to my parents how this is not something I can change and how they're further damaging me by trying to ""heal me"". My parents completely denied everything the therapist said, tried to find all sorts of other reasons I'm not gay, then proceeded to tell me how I can change if I really want to, indirectly threatening me if I cannot convince my dad within two weeks that I want to change (when asked how I was given no answer), indirectly threatening to kill my gay friend if I try to run away at 18 (not as threatening since they don't know him but made me lose a lot of trust) and even wanting to hire a prostitute to ""show me how good sex with a woman feels"". They were a mix between happy, angry and sad at all times. I was breaking down emotionally and just wanted to hide under a rock for the rest of my life.

My life right now consists of faking being straight until I'm an adult (in 6 months) and have enough resources to move out and break all but email contact to my parents. I feel horrible for doing this but I have no other option. I have contacts in several local LGBT organizations in my city so I'm also going to be counselled for options and support there. I feel somewhat depressed, very angry and rejected. My family kept telling me that they will never accept me being a homosexual and marrying a man, so they will completely lose me soon. Life is hard."

10,"I just got lead on, on Grindr, and now I'm out of pocket.


Hey bros. I'm feeling pretty shit here. But anyways.

So I live in Sydney, average 21 year old male, and boring Saturday for me and I'm feeling horny, I decide to look for sex on Grindr.

Then I found a really cute guy my age. We exchanged pics, and he said he could host. However, he lived in an area that had no public transport nor was really in walking distance so I decided to catch an Uber because I thought this would be a hookup worth it.

#So I spent a good chunk of my grandmas birthday money on that Uber ride, which was in total $37.

When I arrived, just as I'm walking towards his house according to the location he sent, i text saying I'm arriving. 

But then he said back.... ""Hahahahahha LOOOL as if"" and then *he blocked me*. Just like that. Made me come all the way out here, pay for an expensive taxi ride and just did that. I wonder if he even lived there.

It saddens me people are filled with so much hatred and malice to do such a thing. As for me....well, I'll walk home. Just in a bit of shock, really. :/ "
