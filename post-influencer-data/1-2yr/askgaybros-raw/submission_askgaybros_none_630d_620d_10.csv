0,"Update: My bf finally put his foot down with his religious mother. I cried


Happy holidays everyone,

Many of you have reached out wanting an update since I posted this earlier this month: https://redd.it/7fssuu

Christmas morning was very nice.  Because we don't have kids, we got to sleep in, had a leisurely breakfast, and then had a nice early afternoon nap.  

My BF knew I was nervous about meeting his mother for the first time - and with the added pressure of Christmas, needless to say, I spent the next few hours fretting about everything.  The drive to his parents' house felt like an eternity - and I got the expected speech.  ""Please no touching at my mother's house... give her time... don't be afraid to speak English if you can't think of what to say in French... etc.""

When we arrived at the house, he grabbed the bag of wrapped presents for his brother's kids, and we went in.  I put on my biggest smile, shook everyone's hand (kissed people on the cheeks), and then just took it all in.  

A French Canadian Christmas is much different than I am used to.  The food was fantastic, the music was loud, the kids were running everywhere, and I followed the conversation as best as I could.

One of their family traditions is that the boys have to wash the dishes because the ladies prepared all the food.  Without even thinking I popped up, rolled up my sleeves, and got to work.  My BF's father told me that I didn't have to, but I just smiled and started scrubbing the pots and pans.  

Of course, the BF was in the living room playing Pokemon with the kids and when his father came back with more dishes to wash he looked at me again and said (in French) that his son really should be helping as I was a guest.  I just smiled and said back (in French), ""when was the last time you ever saw him wash dishes?""

The entire family burst out laughing, and that was the tipping point. After that, there were hugs, gifts, games and story time with the kids (they thought my accent was HILARIOUS and kept bringing book after book).

It was indeed a lovely Christmas."
1,"Update: I pissed in my boyfriend's ass today.


As promised, here's an update to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7lwzdw/boyfriend_wants_to_try_something_im_kinda_weirded/)

So yesterday, my BF asked if I'd piss in his ass. He said it was a fetish of his and thought it'd feel good. I was a little weirded out so I gave a noncommittal answer. Asked you bros about it and you suggested first that I should ask my father (a conservative Christian) so that wasn't helpful, (though it was funny), but then a consensus was reached that it was fairly common and also safe. After independently confirming this I decided to give it a go. 


Anyway, I treated it as sort of a Christmas gift to him. He was super excited the entire morning, and I made sure he was VERY clean inside there. During foreplay he was diamond hard the whole time. After loosening him and fucking like normal for a bit, I tried to piss but it didn't work very well. Idk if it was my own slight discomfort, trying to piss while being kinda ""distracted"" (being buried balls deep in a tight ass can do that to a guy), or just general resistance but I only got a few squirts out. Eventually I pulled out and we decided to just go back to normal sex. He looked so disappointed though that I told him we'd try again in an hour. 

So this time I drank A LOT of water before trying it, to be sure it would work. I was desperate to pee this time when we started again. After re lubing him and such, I finally get in there and try to piss.  For a minute or two nothing happens, but then I start to go and it fucking starts pouring out of me, not so much as a jet but kinds just flowing. It was right against his ass so I could feel it. It was slightly disconcerting for me. It was so abnormally wet, and it was almost the same temperature, but not slick wet like lube, it was the kinda rougher, less oily wet of water. The main sensation I had was finally getting relief from an aching bladder, lol. That felt good. He moaned during it and said ""he could feel it hitting him inside, filling him up."" I imagine it was more intense for him as the bottom than for me. 

We (I) took some pics for him that I could share but they're very NSFW (and I'd have to ask him. Let me know if there's general interest.) Overall, maybe not my favorite thing to do in the bedroom, but he LOVED it so much that it was more than worth it to make him happy. Overall, I'd try it again.

**Update:** You guys have made this one of the top 50 most popular posts of all time on this sub. Good job everyone. And also there's a hiatus on the pics due to legality (or lack thereof.)"
2,"He said yes!


I popped the question while hiking on the coast of Lake Superior on Christmas Eve while we were up visiting his family!

https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7mdo6w/boyfriend_downloaded_grindr_im_confused/ - This is the previous thread I posted yesterday. 

Thank you to everyone who gave their input yesterday, it really helped me out. I spoke with him and was really surprised with how he reacted. He bounced around the subject, minimized what he did, tried to get me to pity him, denied everything I had to say, threatened me with breaking up and blamed me for being the problematic one in all this. Needless to say I ended it. My gut was telling me that something was fucked up and something was. There's no question his intentions were dishonest.

4,"I asked my Bf if he would like to move in with me.


And he said YES!!!!!!


Im soo happy, i have a house now and i always wanted him to live with me but my house was lacking stuff so i could not ask him sooner, originally i was going to ask him on christmas day but my family and his are going away for the holidays so i asked him him today.


He was happy and he told me that he always wanted us to live together, i feel so relieved because now we dont have to hide from his family and we can do what ever we want in our home.





Happy Holidays Everyone!!!!

7,"Merry Christmas Eve, bros. I love all of you.


The holidays are a tough time, for a lot of people. Whether you're spending it with family, friends, or just by yourself know that you are loved and appreciated. **If any of you guys are feeling lonely and want to chat, I'll be on tomorrow 12-5 PST to talk to you.** We can laugh, talk, ramble, rant, complain etc. I don't want *anyone* to feel lonely tomorrow. Happy holidays to everyone :-) 

edit: thank you to everyone for the kind comments! i hope everyone is having a fun, safe, and happy Christmas Day. I'll be starting to reply to messages from now until 5 :)

edit #2: it was so great talking to and getting to know all of you! i hope everyone had a great christmas :)"

Even though we argue on here a lot and have some negative moments at the end of the day, we’re all a part of the same community and we all should wish each other the best during the holidays."
11,"Do you ever wish there was more focus on love and romance over sex?


Sex is great, sex is amazing, however it sometimes feels as if it is the main emphasis and emotion, building a connection, getting to know the guy takes a backseat. Like do you ever wish a guy took you to dinner where you could share thoughts and ideas and not worry about sex?

12,"I DID IT ! I CAME OUT TO MY DAD! 1-0 TO ME BBY


So. Yesterday i posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7likkz/i_think_today_is_the_day_i_tell_my_parents_im_gay/

I was super nervous since i woke up today. My dad was in city with his gf i took a shower and ate a lot of sugar so i was sure i wouldn't faint.

Once they got home i went to my bed and told my dad to get into my room and close the door. He did. He sat in my chair and looked at me and said ''what is it?'' i said ''AHHHHHH this is so hard to say'' then i was just rolling around in my bed for like 3min and made weird sounds. (during this time my dad took his hands over his eyes and looked down. It felt like he was processing that this is it). I even asked him do u know what im about to say and he said no. (U think he lied?)

Then i stopped and said ''i like guys and not girls''
He: ''What?''
Me: ''I like guys and not girls''
He: Okey, i still love you''
1min after
He: ''Another question
Me: Yes?
He: Have u decided what cloths u wanna wear tomorrow on christmas eve''
Me: ????????????????????????

Also i said ur dad is really homophobic i think. He said that hes from 1900 or smth so he dont understand that. He like said it quitely that ''they will still love you'' and that make me a bit insecure.

Thank you guys a billion times over ! &lt;3 U really made this happen. luv you.

Tomorrow i gotta tell my mom doe still kinda nervous for that!

It feels so weird O.o i feel kinda vulnerable, it felt like i wasnt ready but i just did it.

EDIT: Thank you all ❤️, still really nervous about telling my mom tmrw

EDIT2: I  just Told my mom just like that. I feel so weird now ugh, she just said ""ok"" and i asked if she still love me and she said ""yes"" but I can see on her she thinks it weird. She said ""maybe cause it's much going on in ur head atm"". I feel so bad now, I think I made her sad 😭"
