1,"PSA: Groping guys in a Club IS sexual assault


After the recent article about Terry Crews being sexually assaulted, I debated posting here but didn't want to get on my high-horse. Seeing the current thread where everyone is whole-heartedly condemning this situation makes me think many here don't fully understand the breadth of sexual assault.

Several times in the past I have commented on here about being hard-core groped in clubs only to be told that it was my fault for going to a club. The downvote/upvote ratio indicated to me that many people agreed with that sentiment. I am posting in hopes I can open a few minds.

Groping someone at a Hollywood party and groping someone at a gay club are the same. They are both sexual assault. They are both not okay. They both make the perpetrator a shitty human being.

I am not talking about brushing up against someone or dancing in a pile of people, I am talking about the hands that come out of nowhere to grab pieces of your body. Lots of you do it, many of you have expressed that this is just ""part of being gay and being at clubs.""

It's not. It's sexual assault. You are no different than the guys in the media right now. And to hopefully make you feel worse, you do not know the person's story that you are groping. You don't know if they were repeatedly molested as a kid and your seemingly ""drunk and funny"" actions are giving another person flashbacks to when they had no control of their body. 

It's not harmless. It doesn't matter how hot and in shape the guy is. His body is not for you and it is not for you to touch. 

After a pretty horrendous experience in SF several years ago, I try to avoid gay clubs and overly packed bars. So this isn't for me, but I'm hoping it prevents some other innocent guys from having to feel like shit when they're having a great night out."
2,"My mom said to aunt that my husband is ""the woman"" in our marriage. I corrected her immediately. Now she's mad.


I need to blow off some steam as I'm so angry at my mom right now. She was talking to my aunt at their place and I was there too to help her with some things, and my aunt asked me some questions about gay relationships and marriage and things like that, totally normal stuff. Then my mom comes and says that I'm the man and my husband is the woman in the marriage. Exact words were like ""his husband, he's the woman... sort of the wife in the marriage"".

I immediately corrected her, told my aunt that in gay marriages there's two men, two husbands. Nobody is the wife or the husband. She nodded and then an hour later after she left my mom was upset that I firmly corrected her. I had asked her twice before not to do this as my husband doesn't like it when someone misgenders him. He was bullied a lot for being gay in school and being misgendered is a central part of that. It's shitty when my family does the same thing.

I had a fight with my mom and left. I haven't told what happened to my husband yet.

How should I deal with these situations? I don't know. Maybe getting angry is not the solution but I can't just take it and pretend it doesn't happen. Any advice is appreciated. "
3,"Why do some gay men continue to travel to Dubai?


I don't get it. I argued with a friend of mine who spent a week there with his boyfriend and I was like, ""are you insane?"". Just because Dubai looks like your average cosmopolitan city, does not mean it is safe to be a gay man there. Not long ago a man was jailed for touching another man's hip. That's how bad that country is. The UAE still criminalizes homosexuality. Don't be fooled by the shiny cover. "
4,"I'm a female sex worker and I think one of my clients might be gay and being forced to use me for ""conversion therapy""..


I posted in a few other subs and someone recommended I post here.. Here is the x-post:

""Basically I'm a sex worker living and working on the West Coast. I'm very comfortable with my job and I always discontinue seeing any clients that make me uncomfortable, feel threatened, etc. About three weeks ago I got an e-mail from someone wanting to meet up, we arranged a coffee date, I went and met him. Really handsome guy, east asian (like myself), but seemed kind of shy and ucomfortable - ok, thats normal considering what youre hiring me for, probably need some help in that department.

Alright, we just part ways and he doesnt propsoition me that day. Skip to three days later and he text me on the number I gave him. We arrange to meet up at a hotel, I host. Heres where shit gets weird. The first time we met at the hotel he said it had to be at 3 in the morning. Alright, whatever. So im there and he shows up, but with a black eye. An abrasion on his face, suddenly wearing full long sleeves and a turtle neck.
I ask who punched him jokingly and it makes him uncomfortable. He doesnt initial sex, he just sits on the bed and asks me questions aobut my life. Did you grow up with pets? Do you speak your mother tongue? Are you from the area? 

Basically we talk until 7am, fall asleep, he wakes up around noon, leaves money and leaves. No text. Texts me the following day to meet up again. Now alot of people use escorts and sex workers as companions, they love to talk and exchange with a pretty girl, i'm okay with that. Thats not whats weird. The next time he shows up hes even more timid and even more fucked up looking. He has a busted lip. He initiates sex with me but its seems like pulling teeth; after sitting in silence for 5 minutes he asks ""can we do this"" and then yeah.

He can't get it up. He turned the lights off so I have no diea whats going on down there, I just know that he laid ontop of me, awkwardly kissed me on the neck, I grabbed his dick and its as limp as a sea urchin and it seemed to make him uncomfortable. I ask if hes okay, he grunts at me. We stop any sexul stuff. I just let him lay ontop of me and hug me and we fall asleep. He wakes up in a few hours, leaves money, disappears.
Now skip to 2 days ago and he asks to meet up again. I arrange to host at a separate hotel. He seems super sketchy, calls me on one number to ask where to meet up, another number to ask for directions because he got lost because his ""weird phone has no GPS"". ?? Alright.

He looks slightly better physically but still awkward. Avoids eye contact. Sits on the bed, I ask if he's okay genrally, he shrugs. We sit there. I get him a drink. We sit there. I rub his back, he cries some, he apologizes a ton, we sit there, he eventually tries to climb ontop of me and act as if hes trying to initiate sex. No go. He's soft apparently, never takes his pants off, we spoon. I don't fall asleep but instead just sit there in silence for hours. I ask him again if he's okay, he says he's okay, I ask why he looks like shit, he says he always looks like shit. I say you know what I mean. 

He doesn't respond. Eventually he falls asleep I assume because after a few hours, he gets up, leaves money, disappears.
Now i've spoken to a few of my girlfriends about this and their explaination is that he's into some kinky shit. Likes to be beat up at home then come and sleep with an escort?? I don't know in what universe thats someones kink but stranger things have happened, sure, I just don't think thats it. He recoils like a beaten dog, he seems super timid, wont make eye contact, what the fuck?

My question is: What is the possibiliy hes being forced to come and try to have sex with me? What if hes being abused or sex trafficked? What would anyone get out of making some guy hve sex with an escort???? IF and IF he is in trouble, who do I contact? With what information? Who will believe me?

I am expecting to hear from him some time soon and lately I hve this feeling in my gut like something is really wrong and I Cant put my finger on it. I cant do the logical thing and just keep my distance when enpowerment and consent is part of why im in this field and its possible someone is being exploited and im somehow participating in it.""


I'm strongly considering the possibility that this is a gay man being forced by family or someone or something else to use escorts to ""straightify' himself or whatever you wnat to call it. If I am able to confirm this is there a gay rights organization I can reach out to that might be able to remove him from his abusive situation?

Any other advice?

Thanks.."
5,"Big Mouth


Not really a question, just figured I'd share. There's a new cartoon on Netflix (rated TV-MA, so it's raunchy humor) called Big Mouth. It's about a bunch of middle schoolers going through puberty, dating, figuring themselves out, etc. Anyway, there's an episode where one of the characters thinks he might be gay because he got a random boner for The Rock. At one point when it's being discussed, other characters make it very clear that being gay is okay. 

Another point that stuck out is when he goes up to the token stereotypical gay character and asks for advice. He says ""you're the only gay person I know"", which seems accurate. But the writers made it a point for the gay kid to respond with ""I'm the only gay kid that *you know* you know"". I just think that was pretty great. A lot of gay guys in their teens feel alienated because they don't align with the visible (feminine, flamboyant) gay guys at their school. So a line like that is just a simple reminder that there are plenty of other guys like them, they're just hiding in the closet. In years to come, they'll be coming out too.

It's nice that these are the messages new shows are promoting."
6,"Had fun for the first time in a decade!


I'm 46, the last time I got laid I was 36. Had a long relationship that ended 10 years ago and I didn't feel like having to start over dating again so I just retired from having a sex life. Getting flabby around the middle and that's okay. I've been enjoying middle age. I work the overnight shift at Walmart. There's this hot guy that works 2nd shift. He's older than me, 52. Kinda flabby around the middle, too, but he's just sexy! For a long time he was dating another coworker who's still there but they broke up a few months ago. Anyhow, he's always looking at me, kinda hungry-like, but never made a move.

Last Wednesday I went to the baler to throw out some cardboard and he was back there. It was almost 1 am, that's when his shift ends. He was in a playful mood I guess and as I was throwing out my cardboard he picks up this sponge thing called a Scrub Daddy and says, ""Scrub me Daddy!""

For the life of me I don't know why I said it but it came out of my mouth before I could stop it--I blurted out, ""Choke me Daddy!""

He got the most amused look on his face. I could feel my face burning so I know I was beet red. I just finished throwing out my cardboard and left. He went down the hallway to the breakroom.

The next night I was stocking the canned aisle and I saw him walk by just before one. Several minutes later here he comes down my aisle. I was still embarrassed about the previous night. Sure enough he comes up to me, smiling. I thought he was just going to make a scrub daddy comment but instead he asked me if I wanted to go out and have a drink sometime! I accepted and we exchanged numbers and he is off work Friday and Saturday and I'm off Saturday and Sunday. He said we could go out Saturday night if that was okay. I agreed.

We went to a local burger place/bar. Had some burgers and fires and drinks. Went back to his place where he proceeded to fuck me with a dick as thick as a beercan! It was maybe 5 inches long but thick as a can! I swear I've never felt so much pleasure in my life. Came like never before. And he kept fucking even though I was sore but I didn't want him to stop. I came a second time mostly dry, but damn I was in heaven. He finally came and we spent a good while kissing and cuddling and talking. My body was humming. Really a nice night. I stayed the night. Made plans to get together this coming Saturday again.

Monday night at work he came down my aisle just after I got there and we talked and had fun. We've talked each night this week, texted, and we're generally having a good time.

It's nice to be with someone again.

*Sorry there's no question. Just wanted to share/brag a little."
7,"PSA: Delete all the gay apps off your phone and give yourself a break once in a while.


Your mental health is important. In a sea of fuckboys, ghosting, and mean gays; it gets so easy to hurt your self esteem. Give yourself a break and come back later...or don't come back at all, your choice.

Point is, prioritize making yourself better first."

9,"President Trump: Mike Pence ""Wants to Hang"" all Gay People


https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59e4afd5e4b04d1d518320d9/amp

This is a weird one. Apparently, a source from the White House said the President makes jokes about Pence's dangerous, anti-LGBT+, socially conservative beliefs. While this can be viewed as Trump feeling superior to Pence on social issues, it can also be seen as the President of the United States not taking equal rights seriously, but instead as a joke. What do you guys think?"
10,"I'm a female sex worker and I think one of my clients might be gay and being forced to use me for ""conversion therapy"".. [UPDATE]


Hey, I am crossposting my update here, which has revealed really nothing relevant to you guys or to his identity and whether or not he's gay, but some of you guys helped me out alot with insight and asked for updates so I just thought i'd put it here too. Heres my original post: ( https://redd.it/76ng1l )


I’ve received a lot of really honest advice and more importantly i’ve received some ear worms that had me thinking about things that never even crossed my mind beforehand. After thinking about it that night, I decided I wasnt going to engage this specific client again and instead just tell him when he contacted me next, that if he needs help I am willing to figure out where he can go to and who he can talk to, but i’m not going to meet him in private anymore. I really intended to do this over the phone and leave it at that but it really didn’t pan out like that and its really my own fault because I didnt take other peoples advice nor my own advice.

This all went down on the 16th and the following morning of the 17th so p much after I posted before.

He text me while I was leaving class, asking when or where to meet up. I had to text back “Who is this” because yep, another new number.

Basically my reply to him was this:
“Hey, listen, I need to talk to you. I understand it’s not my place to encroach and I have no idea whats going on, but I got the feeling that you might be needing someone to talk to that might be able to help you more than I can. This doesnt mean anything is wrong with you. I am worried about you and I get the feeling that whatevers going on is out of your control. If you need advice on who to go to to get help with your situation, ive done some research, I just need you to let me know whats going on. Because if you dont tell me, I don’t know!”

I paraphrased that a little bit but that was reply to him. I didn’t want to blatantly put in my text, “hey if you’re gay and being abused you can go here here or here!” or insinuate anything else that may or may not be blatantly wrong and make the situation worse. I just thought to tread lightly and then yeah. Again as of right now I have no idea if him being forced into some kind of gay conversation therapy is the root of the issue or even part of it at all :( 

I didn’t hear from him for hours after that. By the time I got home I figured I had probably spooked him and driven him off and I honestly felt terrible but eventually he did reply, some 6 hours later, and he asked if I would quote “meet up with him one more time”. He didnt directly respond to anything I said in my text earlier that day? I replied, did you get my text? Let me know what you think of it first, thanks. He replied, I got it but can we meet up one more time?
I replied is there something going on I need to know about? He replied with a flat no then also wrote can we do it tonight or tomorrow. I said I want to talk about whats going on first. He said can we talk in person.

 Pretty much against my better judgment I asked what time that night, it was again like 2 in the morning, I rented a place and went to meet up with him. I dont know my thought process at this point so dont ask. Guilt, pity, I dont know. I only started panicking thinking maybe im a fucking idiot when I was already at the hotel and waiting and texting my bestie telling her where I was, what I was doing, and she was replying that she wanted the address to come get me “right now”.
Basically im there 30 mins early and 2 comes and goes, he finally shows up there at a quarter to 3, disshoveled and with wet hair ?? (no it wasnt raining so idk). 

Again looking straight busted up. Lip swollen, looking kind of dirty (although admittedly he is still a handsome dude despite the fact that he looks like he came out on the losing end of a hurricane). He doesnt say anything, comes in, I get him a drink, he sits in the random sidetable every hotel room has and I ask whats going on, hes quiet. Okay. Im like trying to seem nonchalant. I try to stay near my bookbag I take with me to meet clients because I do have pepperspray and a taser in it fortunately (hvent had to use to date, knock on wood)

He sits hunched over and starts crying. I stood next to him and just kind of awkwardly petted his hair but got uncomfortable that it was wet for some reason so I pet his back. At this point i realize half of his left eyebrow is suddenly shaved off???? Or maybe burnt off i dont even know. I say to tell me whats wrong, you can tell me anything and I promise I wont judge you, he sort of recoils from me after a minute so I go and sit at the end of the bed again.

At some point he starts smoking (in a non smoking room) and doesnt stop when I tell him its nonsmoking. I also notice that hes real fidgetting and bounces his leg as he sits there (like tapping foot type thing idk how else to describe that sorry), I ask him why he looks like hes in a fight and if anyone is hurting him and he starts going off on what I can only describe as a word salad but literally the longest sentence he has made since we started seeing eachother. In a nutshell “there’s only four steps I saw, come here”, “the least of shocking in most I have seen, I dont know what I have done with that”, something to the effect of “theres fourteen points and sixty two inbetween them”. All sentences to that effect, just gumbled. Yeppers.

When I text him earlier that day there wasnt any unusual speech patterns so at this point im panicking and wondering how quickly I can launch myself out of the hotel window and to the safety of the concrete below if something goes wrong. He literally doesnt engage me and just sits there and stares at the floor and talks as he smokes and I dont reply or do anyting but sit there and stare. This went on for 15 mins. My phone goes off whe my best friend text me, he stops talking, I get touchy and grab my bookbag and get up and say hey, im going to give you some space, lets meet another time and I go to the door (i realize now that was too quick and impulsive and I moved too fast). He got up and hugs me from the side, i’m spooked but hug him back with one arm and a one of those “awkward pats” type of hugs. He grabbed me by my ribcage (as in puts his hands beneath my breasts and squeezes my ribcage) and squeezes it, I basically just go uh what’s going on and pull away, he kind of tries to grab my bookbag (its slung over my shoulder) and i say kind of like “hey ok youre good let me have it ok??” iin as calm of a voice as I can as I pull my bag back. I tell him again that lets meet another time and I leave. I dont check out, I just leave.

Mind you again this was the morning of the 17th. Skip to yesterday, the 18th, I get a text from him around 10am (wayyy earlier than I usually hear from him. Or later depending on how you look at it), asking to meet up. At first coherent speech. I say, im sorry but what happened made me really unomfortable, i understand theres a lot going on with you right now and again if you need suggestions on a mental health facility or somewhere you can goto get help, i’ve researched some so please let me know.

We started texting back and forth at that point and are still texting now. Hes sometimes lucid but sometimes isnt? He does sidetrack into coherent speech even in text, go quiet for hours at a time, come back and go onto a totally different sidetracked topic.
Sooo this isnt exactly an update but my update is: I still have no fucking idea whats going on. My hypothesis is that he’s mentally unhinged and living with a Father that beats him.

Or

Hes self harming. Alot. I dont know how to self harm enough to bust a lip and get a black eye but I know its possible?
?? but I may be WAY off i dont know. What symptoms is this? Schizophrenia? Something onset by drugs becuz of how quickly he lost it? Something else? I dot know i dont know i dont know. I’m not going to see him again. I am going to continue texting him (I use a “stage name” for my work and a burner phone and email so thats not chance of him stalking me), to see what and if anything I can do, but outside of that i’m pretty much lost. This is the first time hes exhibited any kind of incoherency as before he was just noncommunicative. I dont know what happened between then and now but im.. Yeah.

Tl;dr: I still have no clue but I got spooked so i’m keeping my distance and not trying to save a life, at least not in person.
Ive learned a lot from this and alot about myself, such as the fact that i’m an idiot who second guesses my gut instinct. I am going to lay low until he seems lucid like before so I can recommend to him to a clinic to go to or can suggest to call 211 like someone here suggested to me, to suggest to him. Hes not communicating well enough to tell me why hes been hurt, what kind of mental conditions hes facing if he even knows, so I dont know what else to do?? I know ive made super reckless decisions while wrapped up in concern, i know things couldve gone really bad for me but I still feel a lot of pity and worry for the dude and I acknowledge that sustaining contact isnt ideal but I dont know. I know even now its going beyond the realms of a client relatinship and only im responsible for that and what it leads up to and im being reckless. He is 100% not trying to engage sex at this time too. But again I just… idk.
Thanks again everyone for your support and responses.."
