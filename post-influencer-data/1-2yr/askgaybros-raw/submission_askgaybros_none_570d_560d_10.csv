0,"My boss made me cry.


I'm a fairly recent college grad, and this is my first ""real"" corporate-America job, I've bee there about 7 months, and my boss is pretty much the epitome of the middle-aged conservative corporate executive.  People in the office seem to like him though, I've yet to hear anything bad about him, He's just very ""dry"", I give him weekly progress updates on my tasks, and in general, as long as I'm getting things done, he pretty much leaves me alone.  

Well, Thursday I was talking with one of the girls from our Graphics dept, and I was really excited about the fact that I was having an extra special ""date night"" with my boyfriend because it was our 1 year anniversary, we were going to Fogo de Chao (pretty nice Brazilian steak-house) and then going to a movie.  

Well, when I turned around to walk back to my desk, my boss was right there looking for me to give me some paperwork, I was a little stunned, mainly because he kind of surprised me, but he handed my some files, and I went back to my desk.  I was a little nervous just because he seems pretty conservative, and I didn't know if he would have issue with me being gay.  

Towards the end of the day I was walking by his office and he yelled for me to come in and sit down.  

Boss: ""Going out tonight, eh?"" 

Me: ***:starts to panic:*** ""y, ye, yes""

Boss: ""Cool, Fogo is one of my favorite restaurants"" ""I just wanted to say, you're doing a good job around here, and a lot of people are very happy with you""  He reaches for his wallet sitting next to his keyboard, ""Here, let the company pay for you and your man to go out tonight, nice dinner, have a few drinks, see a good movie""  He hands me his corporate Amex.  ""And congrats on your anniversary"" ""Now get out of here ... and oh, if you happen to be late tomorrow, I didn't see a thing"" 

I was so speechless, I'm shocked I managed to get out a ""Thank you"" 

I walked out of the office with this HUGE ass smile, as I thought about what happened, I started to cry a little, I was so happy, It was nice to be complimented on my work, it was even nicer to know I'm 100% accepted at my job.  "
1,"Hi, Im gay


After 6 years, I finally came out... To myself. No, its not just a phase. No, you dont stop watching gay porn. No, seeing straight porn once a month doesnt count. No, Im not bissexual. No, Im not only sexually atracted to men and romanticaly to women. 

Im 19 and I love men.

2,"After a long string of disappointing first dates, I finally went on one that was perfect and he just texted me and told me he felt the same way, and wants to go out again next weekend.


I'm literally sitting here smiling like an idiot.

After months of flipping through the same old people on the apps, this new guy popped out of nowhere. I went on the date managing my expectations not expecting much, but it couldn't have gone any better if it was scripted. It's like he's a robot programmed to my exact specifications lol. I'm officially letting myself get excited about this now."

4,"I think I‚Äôm in love again.


I met him on Scruff at the beginning of the year and we‚Äôll call him (Joe). I was getting off from work from a 18hr night shift and I was so tired I was about to fall asleep in my car in a really dangerous area. I most likely would‚Äôve gotten robbed. We‚Äôve been chatting for a while before this day had happened. When I told him I was going to sleep in my car he threatened to punch me in the face if I don‚Äôt sleep on his couch. I was hesitant to go over to a strangers place, and he was hesitant about me being a burglar lol. 

He sends me his address and I assure him I‚Äôm not joking about how tired I am. As soon as he opens the door I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. He was so beautiful. I‚Äôm sure everyone tells him this, but that moment to me felt like an eternity. He gives me a hug to crack my back and pours me water. We talk for 30 minutes before I ended up falling sleeping on the couch.

Since that day we‚Äôve been hanging out every weekend for the past 2 months. I know he says he just wanted to be friends, but when he invited me to meet his family. They all told me different stories of how he can‚Äôt stop talking about me. 

At the end of the night he gave me a kiss that sent me through every universe."
5,"Confession: I send taps to profiles that say 'no taps'


Sue me. "
6,"Mom found out I'm gay... ""I'll always love you, but Jehovah God will always come first."" ""I don't want you to hope we'll support you if you choose this life style.""


I was surprised by how numb I felt. I actually cried because I wasn't having any intense feelings about what she said. I went to the gym to clear my head. Still feeling nothing. I should probably start looking for a roommate soon.

Edit:

Just wanted to let you all know I‚Äôm okay. At least I‚Äôm okay as I can be. I have the support of all my coworkers and a new friend. I very much appreciate all the supportive replies and messages you are sending. I‚Äôm currently working, trying to just keep to a schedule. 

My mom wants me to not make any ‚Äúrash‚Äù decisions in hopes that I‚Äôll just continue living without acting on my desires. 

My friend helped keep me positive my talking about this guy I‚Äôm into so that was fun. "
7,"Why on earth do yall whine about how empty hook ups are but continue to do them?


Hook up or don't hook up. You can do what you want, but for the life of me I don't understand why so many of you on here are so damn masochistic and hook up knowing you're going to apparently feel hollow inside afterwards(which is melodramatic in and of itself). 

You realize if enough of you refused to hook up because you felt it was hollow and not what  you wanted, you could cause a culture shift? But it'll never happen because a lot of you act like you have no agency of yourself and are just FORCED by the Gay Illuminati to go into random guys houses to suck their dick. And this isn't slut shaming, I get my fair share of dick but the loathing I see a lot of you express on here is ridiculous."
8,"Brother caught me riding dildo


So my brother just walked in my room as I was playing with my dildo. I quickly hid it under the quilt. Don‚Äôt know if he really saw it or if I hid it fast enough, but my face turned so red so he must‚Äôve understood that I was doing something inappropriate. 
Do you have any similar experiences with family members catching you in the middle of the act? How do you get over things like this? I‚Äôm too embarrassed to function normally so now I could really use some support 
Edit: Also, I was wearing a glove to prevent lube from getting all over my hands. The glove makes it look even weirder, doesn‚Äôt it? "
9,"Asking for some prayers from the gay community!


Hi all! This has nothing to do with being gay (although I am gay) necessarily but I was diagnosed with stage IV cancer today. I think the gay community has shown on this forum how supportive they can be with one another and offer great advice to those in need. I felt this to be the appropriate place to share my burden. I‚Äôm in a good positive state of mind, eating very healthy with focus on antioxidants, exercising, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a few prayers as well. 

Thanks. You all are the best!

10,"""Queer Eye"" on Netflix


So I decided today would be a lazy type of Sunday, and put on ""Queer Eye"" as a way of kicking back. 

Honestly, the show absolutely floored me. I somewhat expected outdated stereotypes about gay men and how they tend to have better instincts towards fashion and style. This show proved that a group of guys can positively reach out to others and help them get in touch with some of the issues in their lives.

I think this is the type of show that doesn't just unite gay men, but all men. I really like how they touch on issues like the way gay men express their masculinity, and having a conversation with a participant regarding excessive police force and murder of black people. I like how honest the show is, and that's a very fun and laid back show at the same time. 

Has anyone seen this? What do you all think? Has anyone else had the time to watch it?"
11,"I‚Äôm finally past the phase of my life where I have unrequited crushes on straight guys!


On the down side, I now have an unrequited crush on a gay guy :("

14,"I came back from the hospital with bad new. Feeling empty and hopeless right now...


I (21M) was tested HIV positive.

They've assigned me to a counsellor and all, trying to work through the next steps supposedly. I've told my immediate partner and former partners about it and I've been given mixed to really frightening results. Its still best they know and get tested themselves but I feel like a giant piece of shit. My parents are going to be absolutely livid when they come back from vacation. Its worse that they're overly-religious people who firmly believe sex before marriage is a terrible sin. Worse also that I'm also bi and they haven't known that yet.

I feel so shallow right now. Empty. Is this going to change my life? How will it affect my job prospects? What about spouses or partners? What about kids? What about the possibility of other diseases? I'm just so lost right now and I have no one else to talk to about it. And I have no one else to blame for it.

Anyone wanna chime in and say something? This has been a terrible morning to start the day/week.

UPDATE: Thank you guys for the kind words. I've been in bed depressed since the diagnosis but I think I'm a bit better now. I'll see to it I get this all sorted out.

UPDATE #2: To the guy who PM'd me ""die aids faggot"" and wishing us gays with HIV to be wiped out. I'm sorry I made you feel that way. I hope you have a good day."
