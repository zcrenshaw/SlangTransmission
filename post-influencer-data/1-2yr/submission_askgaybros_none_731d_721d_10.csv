"Take a second to remember that Edith Windsor died today.


She was the plaintiff in the case of US v Windsor, which resulted in the overturning of section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. Windsor was a landmark case, decided on the same day as Hollingsworth V Perry, which led to the Obergefell case.

She was also a long time activist for LGBT causes and deserves to have her life celebrated. "

"Gay dad here, found son with his boyfriend [Update]


Before I mention how things are going here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6zl0i7/gay_dad_here_found_son_cuddled_up_with_a_friend/?st=J7HMD2IV&amp;sh=ab29df89)

So I asked them casually at breakfast and my son's boyfriend said that they were in fact dating, and that my son was cold last night and he felt bad. 

As many of you already implied, I was being a piece of shit. I'll continue to support them in this relationship no matter how long it lasts. My husband and I experimented in our freshman year, and heavily as a juniors, and I'm honestly glad that laying on each other was the least they did. I shouldn't be this afraid of my kid growing up. 

Thank you for the advice. Much appreciated~"

"Would you ever have a dick sucking contest with a chick? I just agreed to one


I matched with this hot guy on tinder. Long story short, our conversation quickly became sexual. Turned out he was bisexual, and wanted to know if I was okay with that. Of course I was, and I even joked about how I thought it'd be an interesting experience to suck the same dick with a chick. Within a heartbeat he wrote back, mentioning he had a girl he was FWBs with and would ask her if she'd be down. I have no sexual desire with women, I only see them as friends, but even still I agreed. Sounded hot to help him with a fantasy of his, plus I get to suck a dick and make a friend along the way 😂

I'm joking with him that it's going to be a dick sucking contest. He doesn't seem to have an issue with that at all. I warned him all of my attention will be on him, so it won't be an exact threesome, but I did say if he thought it'd be hot, I would help pleasure her tho. I'd be as hard as rope doing it 💀

Would you agree to this? Would you ever suck a dick with someone else? Have you before, and what was it like? I'm curious to hear!"
"How do I make my boyfriend comfortable enough to go number 2 at my apartment?


I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years now and he still will not shit at my place. Sometimes he even leaves during the night to go home to do his business.

I asked him about it and all he ever says is he is just not comfortable.
I know this question seems ridiculous, but I really don't know what to do to get him to get over his shitting anxieties. "
"Straight friend accused me of rape. Help


So,  just as the title said, my best friend (let's call him Mike) for years just accused me of spiking his drink and raping him in his own home.  

Let's give you all a little back story, I've been friends with Mike since about 4th grade (I'm 27 now) and with his girlfriend since kinder. They are two of my most trusted friends, they are like a another sibling in my family. A little while back Mike has started abusing marijuana, and in my suspicions and rumors from another friend maybe a some heavier drugs, till his girlfriend dumbed him. He stopped and a few months later and they got together. Recently he has been in a lot of stress with work, in debt and his relationship is not so stable anymore. We used to hang out a lot, playing video games and what not and several times in the past I've slept with him in his bed. 

One day ago he said he wanted to vent and met me at my house. Mike started talking about how he once (long long time ago) showed me a post here in reddit  (which I vaguely remember) about someone stating the shittiest or worst thing they've ever done. That post stated that this person roofied a drink and raped his friend. Mike continued with saying that when he mentioned that to me a million years ago that post disappeared, which he found weird. After that he mentioned that he has been having weird ""dreams"" and/or memories of me... For which I stopped him and asked him if he actually was accusing me that that post was me. To my surprised he said yes.  He thinks I raped him one day in his house when apparently I offered him a drink once. I quickly denied it of course. He later said he was just making sure, but stating that he has been in negligence for a long time. I promised him that I never done anything and would never, heck i don't even know where to find a roofie or anything similar.   

I've always respected him and I'm not sure what to do now... I'm in shock that this came out of nowhere.   

What would you guys suggest or do? Has it ever happened to you were a straight friend accused you of rape?
