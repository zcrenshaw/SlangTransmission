"UPDATE: ""26 hours in NYC"" itinerary vs actual trip. Hoping this will help someone in the future!


I [previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/8qkomq/looking_for_feedback_on_26_hour_nyc_plan_and/) asking for feedback on my 26 hours in NYC itinerary and this sub was so helpful. I also browsed a BUNCH of old posts to get suggestions and ideas, and also looked stuff up on Serious Eats / Yelp / Tripadvisor / etc. Overall I had an amazing day and wanted to share what I did.

**General Things:**

* As suggested, I plugged everything into Google Maps and included travel time (rounded up to the next half hour mark) in my plan. I made a 'time sheet' of half hour increments that I checked in with as the day went on.  

* *Planning*: I cut way down on the number of things I was trying to do (thanks, guys!) I marked ""essentials"" on my itinerary in case I ran into issues with timing and needed to cut some things out. I was glad I cut out the extra bars I wanted to hit up; there wasn't enough time.  

* *Clothing*: I wore the most comfortable shoes I had, with added arch support inserts (flat feet) that I broke in a few days before. I also took a cross body bag that I could hold in front of me, and I brought an SPF-protective cardigan that could double as sun and cold protection. For the plane, I packed a backpack so I didn't have to worry about rolling bags around the subway.  

* *Lessons Learned*: I wish I had brought along more cash and small bills. I also wish I'd had more downtime to do less touristy-things or maybe a walking or bike tour, but obviously I had a jam-packed day and there's always next time. :)

**FRIDAY MORNING (\~6AM - 1PM)**

* Took subway from JFK to hostel in Queens / Long Island City. I stayed at The Local NYC and it seemed super was cool! Movies playing, an in-house bar and coffee bar, theme night events, etc. I wish I'd been able to hang out there more. I was about a 5-10 minute walk from most subway stations. The hostel holds your bags for free until you can check in, and you can rent locks for the lockers for free, too. The place also had a rooftop patio that I didn't know about until the last day, but check out this view: [https://imgur.com/s6UkWor](https://imgur.com/s6UkWor)  

* We were sleepy and hungry, and traffic wasn't too bad yet, so we took Lyft Pool to Dumbo after checking in (much cheaper than standard Lyft).   

* Snapped an obligatory picture of the bridge through the buildings at Front St &amp; Washington St: [https://imgur.com/MXRtCT9](https://imgur.com/MXRtCT9)  

* Grabbed a hand-rolled bagel at La Bagel Delight (cheap &amp; delicious -- the line moves fast!)  

* Walked to the benches outside Cecconi's/West Elm (between the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge, close to Jane's Carousel) to sit and enjoy coffee and the amazing free view: [https://imgur.com/53X2BMh](https://imgur.com/53X2BMh)  

* Crossed the Brooklyn Bridge on foot and just took in the views and hilarious ""no locks"" signs. I heard crossing during the daytime into Manhattan was a must do and I'm glad I included it.  

* Took a cheap Uber/Lyft Pool to the Staten Island Ferry. Best free thing we did the whole trip. So cool and relaxing! We were on the wrong side of the boat for the Statue of Liberty but by the time we realized it, there were hoards of tourists crowding the rail, so we waited till the trip back to stake out a spot on the correct side.   

* Traveled to Chinatown (can't remember if we walked or took the subway, sorry!) to walk around up Mott St. Grabbed a salted egg yolk and BBQ pork bun from Golden Steamer on the recommendation of Serious Eats (THESE WERE SO GOOD. My favorite food I ate the entire trip, seriously wish I could've taken these home. Bring cash.) Grabbed some egg custard tarts from Tai Pan bakery, also yummy and cheap. We only spent like an hour in Chinatown, a lot less than I anticipated.

**FRIDAY AFTERNOON (\~1PM - 5PM):**

* Hit up Joe's Pizza on Carmine St. Got a fresh mozz and regular cheese slice. It was definitely NY pizza but it wasn't honestly my favorite. Probably my fault for eating it after those amazing steam buns haha. The line moved super fast, even though it was out the door. We were lucky enough to snag seats at the window.  

* Walked the High Line which I loved! Such a cool mix of beautiful greenery with the buildings in the background. They have delicious popsicles (that we were too full to eat) if you want something sweet during the walk. We sat on this awesome patch of grass about halfway through the walk and rested/people-watched: [https://imgur.com/FOGuWCx](https://imgur.com/FOGuWCx)  

* Walked to Grand Central Terminal to look around the beautiful building interior. Was careful not to get in the way of commuters.  

* Walked to 30 Rockefeller Plaza and just walked around the plaza (I'm a huge 30 Rock nerd, so I loved this).

**FRIDAY EVENING (\~5PM - 10PM):**

* I made an appointment online earlier in the week to see Top of the Rock at 5:45pm. Best idea ever. I walked right in and was at the top within 20 minutes of arriving. I briefly looked at each deck but really enjoyed the very top deck. You are allowed to stay as long as you want, so I would recommend coming about 1-1.5 hours before sunset and watching the sunset. You'll get to see both day and night view, plus the sunset up there was *beautiful*. I had a show to catch at 8pm, so I only caught a glimpse of the sunset and took this crappy picture from a lower deck ([https://imgur.com/IAp8oJL](https://imgur.com/IAp8oJL)), but I stood and looked at the Empire State Building for 45 minutes, it was so gorgeous.  

* Walked to the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater to see Come From Away. BEST musical I have ever seen, hands down my current favorite. I literally laughed and cried and jumped to my feet with the rest of the theater for a standing ovation at the end. It was heartwarming and touching and the cast is so, so talented. I'm already planning to see it again when it starts touring on the West coast. The theater is small, so I got mezz seats which were awesome and cheaper (row C). Here's the view from my seat: [https://imgur.com/PT0YTYD](https://imgur.com/PT0YTYD)  

* Walked to Times Square to see it at night. I only stayed about 5-10 minutes, it was crazy, but I'm glad I at least saw it and took a picture there.  

* Found the original Halal Guys food cart and had an amazing falafel sandwich. (Get extra white sauce!! And also, the red sauce is spicier than it looks.)

**FRIDAY LATE NIGHT (\~10PM - 2AM):**

* Walked to Supernova at the Novotel hotel. I heavily researched rooftop bars to try and find something reasonably priced (for NYC), not too crowded, and where we could show up in our casual clothes (since we weren't going back to the hostel). Supernova was PERFECT. No line, no cover, $15 cocktails, plenty of seats overlooking Times Square, and casual clothing was okay (I called ahead to check). Take the elevator up the hotel to the bar and just walk straight outside. This picture doesn't do the view justice, but here's an idea: [https://imgur.com/42cfFDz](https://imgur.com/42cfFDz)  

* Took the subway to the Brooklyn Bridge Park to see the nighttime skyline. This is where everything went wrong. I did not understand how to do subway lines weekend vs weekday vs late night schedules. We got lost and ended up wasting a bunch of time traveling. I will definitely prepare more for the subway next time I go.  

* Chilled at the park looking at the skyline. I was going to hit up Fornino which has a squat rooftop around there, but they close at midnight and we were there around 1-2am.  

* We were exhausted, so we Uber Pool-ed back to the hostel. Also a mistake -- picked up 3 drunk couples on the way home and it was a long ride.   

* Late night checked-in (made sure to let the hostel know earlier that day that we'd be back late, so we weren't marked as a no-show) and passed out in bed.

**SATURDAY MORNING (\~7AM - 10AM):**

* Rode the subway to Central Park and just walked around. Wish I had more time to do this, definitely going back next time. So beautiful! I wanted to get Wafels &amp; Dinges but both carts had incorrect hours listed online and weren't open until 10AM.   

* Walked to Port Authority to catch our bus to the next city and slept hard on the bus haha.

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

I had an absolute blast. I was definitely ready to rest and my joints barely worked the next day, but I would go back in a heartbeat. I believe all cities have personalities and I just loved the vibe of NYC. So different from LA or DC or other big cities. I actually felt really safe in Manhattan, even late into the night, as long as I was staying conscious of my surroundings. 

I almost didn't go at all because I only had around a day to make it happen, but I'm really glad I did it. I had a fantastic time. Thank you to everyone who helped on my post and others' old posts. I couldn't have done it without this sub!"
"What apps do you use specifically for NYC living?


I use citizen, notify NYC and park whizz. Just wondering if there are any interesting apps out there. I had a happy hour one but a bartender I know said the info was very out of date."
"how are Hasidic Jews not dying in this weather?


going through Flushing and everyone is dressed in long sleeves / pants / skirts and stockings. Most of the men are wearing long coats! Seems uncomfortable. Can any Hasids of reddit enlighten?"
"Anyone else started to order takeout less frequently?


I feel like a couple of years ago I was ordering it constantly, now it almost feels like everything has either gotten too pricey or isn't worth the amount of time it takes for the order to arrive due to lateness.

I'm definitely in the minority as I know people on this sub live on Seamless, but I was just curious if anyone else has noticed themselves ordering takeout less."
