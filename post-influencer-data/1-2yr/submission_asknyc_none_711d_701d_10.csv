"Montana tourist checking in: Finally visited your amazing city. You are an impressive bunch of people.


Only had a few days, was here on a work trip. Didn't get to explore too much outside of Midtown/Chelsea, but man... what a place. Also, I get why you all hate Times Square - fuck that noise, lol. Anyhow, just wanted to shout out some thanks into the oblivion. Encountered lots of friendly people, ate the shit out of your pizza/hot dogs/halal, walked my ass off, and definitely will fondly remember this experience for many, many years. 

You guys are a scrappy bunch! I'm not sure I could hack it here myself, actually. But I sure enjoyed the visit, and I hope to see you good people again soon. Stay awesome!"
"What was your top “I wish I’d known before” NYC moment?

"Girlfriend dumped me right before our trip to NYC. What are good places to go alone?


The title sums it up. What are cool, hip, and not especially tourist-y places to chill and read alone during the day and where can I go at night to drink away my sorrows?  I'm already taking the Roosevelt Island Tram, stopping at Dylan's Candy Bar in Manhattan, and going to Cookie Do.  I also want to spend time in Wiliiamsburg but I don't know where."
