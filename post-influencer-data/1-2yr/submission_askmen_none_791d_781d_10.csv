"Net Neutrality Bullshit and Why It Matters


Sup shitlords,

So you may have noticed that the admins are spouting off about this “net neutrality” stuff and they even have this fun popup that makes everything slower in an attempt to prove why net neutrality is so good and why we need it.  So let me assume that none of you know what the internet is and how it works and explain why net neutrality is important in the derogatory fashion you have all come to expect from this sub.

Imagine that the internet is your mother.  You and your shutin siblings have split up your parents basement and have your own corner of the room.  Now your mother is a kind mother, and caters to you all equally.  Whenever you ask for something, she gives you as much time as she has and does everything as quickly as possible because for some reason, she loves your greasy ass.  This is the internet as it should be: everybody makes requests and gets as much time (bandwidth) as they need and everything is done as fast as possible (latency).  Even if your sister is a needy bitch and always asks for stuff, as long as you make your requests, they will be processed in the order they are received.  That way, nobody is more important than anyone else.

Now imagine that your needy bitch of a sister is a daddy’s girl, and your dad wants your mom to do more stuff for your sister than she does for you.  Your dad thinks that her problems are more important than yours and therefore deserve priority.  Your dad keeps going on about how you’re lazy, you can’t get a job, and you don’t have a girlfriend because you’re a weeb piece of shit who lives in your parent’s basement.  Therefore, in his mind, her requests should come first.  Even if you ask your mom for something before she does, your sister and your dad think that her request should take priority for your mom because she’s the baby of the family and asks for more stuff.  Not only that, your dad thinks that if you want more stuff from your mom, then you should do chores to get it.  That’s not fair to you, right?  You use your mom just like everybody else in your neighborhood: everybody should have equal access to her (like they already don’t).  Your requests should mean just as much as your sister’s, regardless of who she is.  Because that’s the beauty of the your mom: in her eyes, you’re all her disgusting little spawn.  

In this case, the ISPs are your dad.  Since they get more attention (and money) from bigger, needier companies (your sister), it’s in their best interest to give better service to them because it will net them more money (or more attention because your dad is weird like that).  Which makes sense, but it shouldn’t affect how you browse the internet.  Because if you could clone your mom (aka provide more resources for consumption), then this wouldn’t be a big deal.  But ISPs are cheap, dirty little bastards, and they don’t want to provide us more resources, they want to redistribute the resources they already have and give more of them to the bigger companies.  Not only that, they want to charge you more for using the current service you have because they’re going to downgrade you.  ISPs are against net neutrality because they say it allows them to “innovate”, but really it just allows them to fuck over laymen like you and me to create more pay-for-basic-service options that will hurt our wallets, because at their core, they recognize the same thing we do: that the internet is a utility and everyone needs it.

So how can you stop your dad from denying you of your delicious tendies?  Easy, do the same thing you do in the real world: complain to the government.  Go **[here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)** and send a letter to the FCC (it’s super easy, I did it myself) and you can even call if they don’t answer in a couple hours (those roastie government stooges how dare they ignore my messages ree and such).  This is super important.  These companies have blocked services they don’t like in the past and they’ll do it again.  All you losers who make tons of alt accounts to get around bans can surely make a couple of alt emails to use on battleforthenet.  Put your shitposting and trolling skills to work and save the internet!

Have a nice day,

"How do I make my boyfriend more aware of his surroundings?


I'm 5'3"" and he's 6'3"". He's not very aware of his surroundings. He hits me with his elbow, steps on my feet, accidentally hits me etc multiple times a day. At first it was funny but now it's incredibly fucking annoying. 



He feels genuinely sorry about all this but I can't help but get angry. After getting elbowed in the face for the 3rd time today it's driving me mad. It really fucking hurts, sometimes it leaves a bruise. 



When I do snap at him to be more careful he gets kind of sad and he always says ""you know I'm not doing it on purpose right?"" In a really sad way and it makes me feel bad for snapping at him. When I mean snap, I tell ""OW WHAT THEFUCK"". I'm not sure if that's snapping but I don't like yelling so I feel like I'm being mean. 



He's just always quite clumsy, accidentally bumping into stuff in general, cutting himself while opening packages etc. 



But I seriously can't handle this anymore. I'm tired of bruises and just being accidentally hurt all the time. It really sucks! Any help?


Edit/update: I sat down and talked to him about it again and brought up some concerns. He said that he's not used to having girlfriends close to him. He's very not physically affectionate and it changed with me. So he likes having me even closer but he's not used to it. So he forgets that he has me close by. 


For the people assuming that I'm glued to him constantly, what the actual fuck? What a moronic assumption. You really think I would stand right next to him, glued to his ass if I was being bonked over the head constantly? Geez have a little sympathy and don't assume people are stupid. 

 it's to a point where he elbows me while we are in bed trying to sleep. I literally cannot do anything about it. It's not my fault I get squished and then kicked while I'm sleeping. It also does not help that he's usually never around people that are around my height. All his friends, coworkers and exes are 5'8"" and over. Mostly 6' and up actually. So he said it's very strange to be around someone so ""little"" on a regular basis. 


We both concluded that I am to bite him arm and lick his face if he elbows me because those things scare him. 



And for those who had he health concerns, thank you for that. Appreciate it! He's just a spaced out guy. I ask him what are you thinking when you accidentally bonk me over the head, he said ""I'm just happy to be with the girl I love"" and has this dumb goofy grin. We are long distance so we don't get to be with each other much, hence him being spaced out and in lala land all the time. 



And the final thing that came up: he's never lived in a ""normal"" sized house before. Everyone in his family is quite tall so their house is just made for tall people. It's very roomy, big bedrooms with calkings, adjusted door frames, showers and all that. He finds it hard to navigate a smaller space on a daily basis since he is not used to it. "
"my girlfriend is always on her phone, but when she's out with her friends she doesn't reply to my texts.


My GF and I have been together for ~6 years, about half of that long distance. We live together in a major metro in the US.

I haven't been terribly successful with building a friend group here, meanwhile she has made a bunch of lady friends through work. They're all single, she's the only taken one in the group. They occasionally go out for ""girls nights"" together, of which I'm obviously rarely invited to.


My girlfriend is the kind of girl who very frequently checks her phone. When I'm with her she's pretty much glued to the thing and very responsive to anyone who messages her.

But when she goes out with her friends, I pretty much don't hear a peep from her for 2,3,4+ hours. 



I won't lie, it makes me feel really insecure / paranoid that maybe she's meeting up with a guy or something. I know it's illogical because we've been together for so long but I KNOW her and I KNOW she wouldn't go that long without checking her phone.


because of this I usually end up texting her a couple times, and she usually only ends up responding when she's on her way home. 



I feel like im being insecure, since I trust her, but part of me just is paranoid that she's not texting me because there is some funny business. What are signs to look for of this being the case? I'm not really close with any of her friends so it's not like I could text one of them or something. I don't know. I want to give her space but I also feel ignored and it sucks? "

"My parents dropped the bomb yesterday.. they're separating. Men of AskMen who have been in this situation, how have you coped and helped you family cope?


Just some background of myself: 20M, College junior starting this fall majoring in CS

Yesterday I came home from being at my girlfriends house all weekend and work. My younger brother had said to me that my mom needed to say something to me. He said he can't tell me too much because he doesn't know what they will and won't tell me. The only thing he said was that my mom was moving back to the previous state we lived in last and taking him with her and I am staying in my current state with my dad. I immediately knew what was going on (I just never expected it). I went downstairs after putting some stuff away and getting cleaned up and my parents sat down and said to me that they're taking a break. They don't know for how long. It turns out that this is what my mom wants, but not my dad. He is distraught that my mom wants to do this and he had actually been fearing for some time that she would leave him, though he never gave full reason as to why (which I believe he only confided to me about). So now my parents are putting the house up for sale and I need to look for a new apartment with my dad. For the most part I am holding up, but it's my dad I am mainly worried about. What have you guys done to help yourself cope and your family get through this? I want to be as helpful to my dad as I can without shirking my duties at work, school, my gf, and friends. I appreciate all those who comment here. And thank you in advance."

"Men who willingly date high maintenance women, can you explain what is appealing about them?


We'll define high maintenance as - needing to be full made up/done up to go out anywhere, only brand name, on trend clothes, gets a attitude when things aren't her way, only wants ""the perfect guy"", princess-y. 

I'm most curious about guys who seem to date this kind of women repeatedly. Why? Do you intentionally seek them out or does it just happen like that? Do you equate it with femininity?  "
"What are men like when they fall in love?


I felt a connection with a man recently and can't stop thinking about him, listen to saccharine music constantly and spend hours daydreaming. Do guys do this too? It makes me wonder if me get as single minded and obsessed as women are. "
