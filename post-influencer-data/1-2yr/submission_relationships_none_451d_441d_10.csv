"[UPDATE] My [23F] coworker [early 30’s M] is making me uncomfortable but I’m not sure if it’s a big deal?


[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ma3rj/my_23f_coworker_early_30s_m_is_making_me/)

So my first post really didn’t get much attention but after posting here and talking to my family and 2 trusted coworkers (Supervisor and Male Coworker) I decided to report the Creepy Coworker to HR. 

I started by emailing my Supervisor since she’d pulled me aside that one time to assure me that I can talk to her if something was bothering me. I outlined everything I’d said in my last post (the soup incident and the skinny dipping incident were emphasized) and basically ended it by saying “I just want this documented in case the new (female) interns are also uncomfortable this summer while I’m gone”. She called me when she read the email since she was out in the field and wanted to make sure I was okay and wanted to pursue this. 

She forwarded that email to the on-site HR lady and Creepy Coworker’s manager. I sent that email on a Friday and on Tuesday, CC’s (male) manager pulled me aside to apologize for CC’s behavior and to say that I shouldn’t have to deal with something like that in the workplace, which I really appreciated. 

HR lady called me into her office on Wednesday, to file an official report. She Skyped with the HR lady at our headquarters since on-site HR lady has only been with the company for a month so I knew it was important if she was getting HQ staff involved. Supervisor and Male Coworker also shared their 2 cents with HR lady about Creepy Coworker’s behavior with me since an investigation officially opened up after my report. I also heard through the grapevine that it had made its way up the totem pole to the new CEO, who was not happy with Creepy Coworker at all. 

Male Coworker called me last week to say Creepy Coworker ended up getting fired last Monday and while me reporting him was the final nail in the coffin, he’d had scuffles with other coworkers in the past and the only person protecting him had been the old CEO who just stepped down this year. 

Apparently Creepy Coworker had tried to spin his own version of events as to why HR was investigating him. He told a few people that he’d offered to take all the interns out for lunch and I’d declined (referencing the lunch incident back in September when I was the only intern working there...) and that I’d blown it out of proportion. The people he told talked to Male Coworker and said that didn’t make much sense and didn’t sound like me. After he was fired, the CEO made everyone take a sexual harassment class that we were apparently lacking, so that’s pretty cool too. 

I’m honestly grateful that I got to keep my job, my reputation wasn’t ruined at work since it pretty much stayed within the top level execs, and how quickly and seriously it was taken when I wasn’t even sure if it was a reportable offense. 

**tldr**; Creepy Coworker got fired, woo!"
"[UPDATE] My (20f) friend (21f) is going to great lengths to ‘prove’ that my boyfriend (24m) is cheating even though I know he isn’t


Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q10gs/my_20f_friend_21f_is_going_to_great_lengths_to/

So I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life’s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me.

After posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over.

… Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily’s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a ‘home wrecker’. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I’d been cheating on Sam and how I’d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he’d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend’s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn’t in the flat… I was celebrating Sam’s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven’t had any other messages from him since.

Emily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can’t say I saw anything, but I also can’t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I’ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be ‘free’ from our partners but she knew I wouldn’t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own ‘abusive’ relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off.

I didn’t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we’re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I’m breaking my lease, and I’m going to spend the night in a friend’s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I’ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision.

Also a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn’t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to ‘I know he’s not cheated on me with Emily’, but I do know he didn’t. He never contacted Emily privately, and was really only friendly to her because she was my housemate. Sam was just as unlikely to cheat with Emily as I was with any of his friends, family or housemates. I know some of you may still think that he could still have cheated/cheat in the future and I can’t definitively say he didn’t/won’t, but I’m not going to ruin my relationship with ‘what if’ style thoughts.

TL;DR - Housemate who was trying to prove to me that my boyfriend was cheating was actually cheating on her boyfriend and wanted me to ‘join in’ by convincing me to dump my boyfriend. Found out from her boyfriend, who had been told that I was the one telling her to cheat on him (I wasn’t). I’m moving out as quickly as my legs will let me."
"My [28M] wife [24F] pushed for us to move from a low CoL area to a high CoL area, and is being childish about the adjustments necessary to succeed here. It's impacting how I view her.


 \*\*tl;dr My wife and I moved from a low CoL area to a very high CoL area. She was the one who pushed me to move, and now she's imploding and crying to go back. I'm losing my patience with her.\*\*

My wife and I previously had a comfortable life in a rural state. My income afforded us home ownership, two cars, allowed her to stay at home instead of working retail jobs\*, and sent us on two nice vacations per year and many fun weekend getaways. (\*I have encouraged her to go to school, but her parents demeaned her intelligence growing up, and now she refuses because she feels incapable.)

Despite our comfort, the intensity of her desire to leave exploded. We had many tearful discussions where she begged me to look for jobs in certain expensive regions that she's always wanted to live. I broke down the financials and showed her exactly what we'd be giving up. She swore up and down that it would be worth it, she was happy to work retail again and rent a crappy place, because the city would be her home and the apartment was just a place to sleep.  After a year of chipping away at me, I gave in. I felt like it was give in or divorce her, because she just would not drop it.

After 6 months of searching I landed a good job (""good"" enough to afford 2/3s of a gonzo rent), and we moved. It meant my wife has to work a retail job again or we literally cannot afford our bills (before you ask, we live in the most affordable area that's within a 1 hour train ride of my job, and if we move any further away, the rent only goes down nominally and my commute becomes a lot more painful). The sale of our house basically broke even, so we got a small buffer to help us move, but not enough for another down payment (and housing is in the low millions here, so lol @ saving for another down payment anytime soon). I sold my truck and kept my commute vehicle for her to get to her job(s).

Even with all this, I found I love it here. Intellectually, professionally and socially, this place matches me much better than my home state. I even apologized to my wife for resisting her attempts to move, and thanked her for pushing me out of my comfort zone.  I know our lives are humble now, but the enrichment I feel more than offsets it. I would love to spend many more years here. It's a special place, and I get why so many pay so much to be here.

It appears to have had the exact opposite effect on my wife. Some of her common complaints: people are cold and there's no sense of community, people are rude, our apartment is claustrophobically small, there's a lot to do but we can't afford most of it, everyone in our social circle and their partner is an educated professional who looks down on her (no one has made untoward comments around me, and I've never observed the judgment that she perceives). 

She has left 4 jobs in the past 10 months, and we've had to float with emergency savings every time she rage quits with no back up plan. Some of her complaints are legitimate (she worked in a bar and said she was getting sexually harassed by customers and managers), but some sounded childish (she found the rush of customers too stressful, she was overwhelmed by the mountains of clothes to collect, the women she worked with were mean to her). Mostly, she cries about how demeaning and horrible retail jobs are. I feel for her, I really do, but she won't learn a trade or get educated, won't get therapy for her anxiety about pursuing further education, and these types of jobs are the only thing she is qualified to do. And she NEEDS to work now. I can't save her from that unless we go back to a poor area.

Now the begging and pleading to move home has started up again. I don't have any patience for it this time. It was fucking huge for me to uproot and come here - I did it FOR HER. Now that I've finally found my footing and am starting to get ahead socially and professionally, she wants to pull the rug out and go back home. Except this time we have nothing to show for ourselves, and will be starting out in the hole.

What can I do for her at this point? I feel like this time around I am going to leave her if she keeps pushing to move, but I feel heartbroken at that prospect."
"(Update) a small piece of advice may have saved me from messing up a potential relationship between me (26m) and a girl (28f) Im crushing on hard. A serious, serious thank you and update.


Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8scu84/i_26m_was_just_on_a_lunch_date_with_a_girl_28f/


So the gist of the original is that I asked a girl who I've been friendly/flirty with to lunch on Tuesday. We had a great time but she left with an older guy she said was a friend and paid for lunch.

That was the crux of my question and buried somewhere deep in all the comments was essentially ""don't ask her anything about that guy when you talk to her again, at this point it's none of your business...assume she's being honest that he's just a friend."" (I'm sorry I can't find the exact comment but whoever wrote it, thank you so much). Despite my curiosity about what went on and who he was, I didn't ask her when she stopped by office later in the day and asked me if I would like to come over to her apartment and watch Anthony Bourdain on Netflix that evening. I went over and we had amazing time and talked for 3 hours about our lives, where we've traveled, where we hoped to go in the future. It was very flirty and she held my hand, gave me playful ""smacks"" on the arm and felt my leg muscles to determine in her ""professuonal opinion"" as a physical therapist that I wasn't lying about being a good surfer. It was an amazing night. I left at 9:30 or so since we both had to work.

I saw her the next day in the office and towards the end of the day she stopped in and said ""id love to try your Tom Kha...want to come over and make it for me?"" I said I'd love to but didn't out of work until like 7 so I got there and she was exhausted from work. I made us dinner and afterwards we sat on her couch with me sitting down and her laying down with her legs over my lap. I was in the middle of talking when she popped up and kissed me on the cheek then on the mouth and it was amazing...best kiss I've ever had. We kissed for what could have been forever...eventually she laid back down and held my hands to her stomach and fell asleep. With The motion of her breathing and her looking like an absolute angel and so peaceful while asleep...it was almost like meditation. I haven't been that stress free and peaceful in my life. Before I knew it it was midnight and I had to get up at 4:30 to be at work at 5:30 and spend the day in the field in 105 temps. I woke her up and she kissed me again on my way out. I didn't sleep a wink last night I was so excited.

I had an exhausting day at our field site and maybe 3 she texted me ""you're probably sick of me but I had such a great time last night, I'd love to return the favor and make you dinner...your house? If you're too tired I understand."" I texted back ""no way I'd love to see you!"" 

So I was done at 4, got home at 5...took a small nap and she showed up at 6 after her last patient. She had stopped by old navy and a sports gear  store and bought us matching flannel pajama pants and matching Padres t-shirts since we are both originally from the San Diego area and huge Padres fans. It was the sweetest and cutest thing a girl has ever done for me. We made dinner together in our matching outfits and she was so fun with playful banter about my house needed a woman's touch and my mismatched flatware and plastic cups and my cats who never come inside because even they don't like my decorationing skills. Eventually we settled in and watched the Padres get beat and she fell asleep in my lap again. It was magical. I don't have any other way to describe it. 

She's going to spend the night but isn't comfortable sleeping in the same bed with me (yet-she said) so I'm letting her sleep in my bedroom and I'm staying in my guest room. We kissed again before she went to bed and I tucked her in.

I'm in my guest bed trying to sleep but again too amped up because between you, me and the walls...I'm madly in love with this girl. My only other relationship was my miserable high school ""romance"" that lasted for 9 years. I always told myself that when it happened again, it would be easy from the start...I'm not ready to call wedding planners for Shelby because at my heart I'm a rational, empirical type guy who moves very slow...but it's off to a great start.  


If this does work out like I hope...I literally owe it to this sub because my instinct to ask her who that guy was would have been dead wrong and would have probably turned her off. I still don't know who he is and like I learned from posters here, it doesn't matter. I do know that she's single since she's similar in that she's really only had long term relationships that struggled way past their prime and she hasn't really dated since she moved here to work at her current PT clinic.

I'm on cloud 9...certainly there's way more I need learn about her and while we've known each other for a few weeks, the last 3 days have been intense and a whirlwind of positivity, surely there's more to learn about her.

A deep and sincere thank you to this sub and it's great advice, yiu d made me happier than I have been in a very, very long time.

For those that get it...chippy kay yay Futhamuckas!

**tl;dr: update from a post I made on Tuesday about a girl who left lunch with another guy. I got some great advice on how to react (which was basically: don't) which I followed and have since spent three amazing nights with her. I'm on cloud 9 and I want to thank everyone for the great advice.**

"I (19M) took leave to visit my girlfriend (18f) because she begged me to see her graduation. Then she broke up with me.


I'm in the military and have been dating my (I guess ex) for a year. My brother can't take leave as on a whim as I can so I was originally going home at the same time as him, also when all our friends would be home.



My girlfriend begged me to come to see her graduate, and have sex with her when I was back.  We were home for 3 days and she was the happiest in the world.


Now sex for me has always been delicate. She's the second girl I've ever slept with, and first in about 6 years. It was a big step for me emotionally.



The Friday before her graduation, she was really distant. That day she asked me to meet her at a beach, and I did. She was again super distant, and she started crying and said she couldn't handle a relationship now that she was moving to college.




Typically I bounce back fast from relationships, but:


1.) no one is home for the next week. I took this time for her, and all my friends are out at college. Every empty day is reminding 



2.) the sex. I feel used in a way. She begs me for sex, gets what she wants then leaves me. 





And of course I still love her. This is the first time a breakup has hit me like this, what should I do? So far I haven't told her any of this, I was mature and told her that I wanted her to be happy.




TL;DR girlfriend told me to take leave to see her, she broke up with me on 3rd day, I don't know what to do."
"I (25f) am infertile. Needing advice on how to politely deflect hurtful comments from my boyfriend’s (27m) extended family regarding “giving them a baby”


If there is a better place for me to post this I would be welcome to the suggestion!

I am a 25 year old divorced mother of two young girls. Their biological father turned into a flake after the divorce and is an “every-other-weekend” father *at best*. 

After the birth of my youngest daughter there were complications and I had to have an emergency complete hysterectomy (I have no ovaries, so no eggs). I came to terms with this and it doesn’t sadden me nearly as much as it used to. I have two kids and am happy with that. My ex husband was a piece of work that endeavored to make me feel like less of a woman because of it, so it’s still a bit of a sore spot but it doesn’t pain me regularly. 

I feel like I hit the jackpot with my boyfriend (27m) of the past two years. He loves my daughters like they are his own and is very supportive and respectful of them. I was worried about feeling like damaged goods when I began dating again because I know a young mother of two without the ability to have any kids is a lot to accept.

We live a 4 hour plane ride from my boyfriend’s large, extended family. 
He was the first born child in his generation and was a bit of a “golden child” so his family is very, very attached to him. Every visit we make (around 3x a year) is like the prodigal son returning — they arrange barbecues and pool parties for him and even more distant family members visit from out of state just to see him. 
They are a bit louder and more gregarious than what I am used to (my mom is a coroner and my dad is an engineer — we shake hands) but overall are very kind, welcoming people who love my children and seem to like me.

After we had been together for around a year, the expected “so when are we going to be getting a new baby!” questions began to start. 
I started with “that just isn’t in the cards for us” but when pressed further ended up telling a few of his family members that I had had a hysterectomy. This was met with polite “oh that’s too bad” comments which was expected. 

The trouble is that, since then, they have gotten more comfortable with me and are pushing the issue further. Everyone in his family now knows I’m infertile (gossip travels).

They have my boyfriend’s childhood on a pedestal and will not drop the idea of a little clone of him roaming around. 

A few examples.

* Drunkenly begging me to “let them” use a surrogate so that they can have a “real” grandchild/cousin/nephew/whatever. When boyfriend speaks up saying that isn’t what he wants they turn to me and continue asking, like it’s a choice between me and the extended family. 

* Asking invasive, deeply personal questions about the medical circumstance of my infertility and how I feel about it.

* Boyfriend’s dad half-jokingly said “oh.... are you sure she’s the one then?” to my boyfriend (right in front of me) when he found out I wouldn’t be bearing “real” grandchildren. Boyfriend laughed it off but Dad kept staring, waiting for an answer. 

* His mom says wistfully says things like “Your kids are wonderful... but it’s just not the same...” 

My family is generally pretty sterile and drama-free so I am not used to this level of family entanglement.

Does anyone have any good one-liners, or things I can say to kill these conversations as they start? 
I’m desperately trying to be polite but am having trouble toeing the line between being amicable and feeling disrespected.

I feel like anyone (women in particular) should understand that this would be a tender subject, so I am struggling to handle these “casual” cookout conversations that sometimes leave me fighting tears.

**tl:dr** I have two young daughters but cannot have anymore (no uterus/eggs). Boyfriend accepts my kids as his own and is happy not having any more. He is the golden child of his large extended family and they keep making hurtful comments about my kids not being enough for them, and acting like I’m holding him back from “giving them” a baby. Any advice on what to say? 
I feel this is incredibly rude but don’t know if I’m being too sensitive. "
"[UPDATE] I (30F) promised my dying friend that I would regularly visit her disabled son (50sM). Now my husband (30M) wants to move across the country but I feel too guilty


[previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gabkv/i_30f_promised_my_dying_friend_that_i_would_visit/?st=JITEGU58&amp;sh=487fbc28)

Last time I posted, I was overcome with guilt about the prospect of leaving my disabled friend to move across the country. I honestly couldn't tell you the amount of hours I cried over the situation. It opened up so many cans of worms. Before this, I was living on autopilot. Coming to terms with the situation made me realize that I'm still grieving my parents. I still feel guilty about not putting in ""enough"" work taking care my disabled siblings (therefore putting the burden my parents). I feel guilty about not visiting my siblings more. I miss Jan and Jerry terribly. I miss when I was younger and everything seemed so much easier. I didn't want to leave my home of 30 years, but I knew I had to. I was so scared of letting my husband down... I just had so many emotions tangled up in my promise to Jan, my commitment to John, and the prospect of moving thousands of miles away.

I received so much great advice on my post. I know I didn't reply to most of the commenters (asides from a few special PMs), but I really can't put into words how much all the support meant to me. It really helped me when I was in a low place. 

So, here goes with the update. My husband and I bit the bullet and made the big move this February. Before I left, I bought John a tablet and we practiced video calling 3 or 4 times. Honestly, it didn't work very well. He didn't seem to connect with me as well through skype. He was distracted, irritable.. he didn't seem to recognize it was ME inside that tiny computer! The last time I visited him, I was heartbroken. I gave him a huge hug and a kiss. He's not normally super into physical contact like that, but he took it really well. I gave him a care package of some of his favorite candies and treats, and he was really happy. It was so bittersweet. I can't say I ever really felt confident in choice.

We continued with video calls biweekly until about 2 months ago when I received a call from his treatment facility that John passed away after choking on a plastic game piece. I'm still utterly devastated. He was one of the most special people I've ever known and it's hard to accept the reality of him really being gone. It's still a shock to me just typing this out.

I know Jan and Jerry believed in heaven, so I like to think they are all all together, happy and at peace now. I miss all three of them very much. 

I can't thank this sub (and my professional, licensed therapist lol) for the support. I know this is a really depressing update, but I've wanted to thank all of the commenters on my original post for awhile, and it seemed fitting to make a final post. 

**TLDR John passed away**

"My (36F) husband (36M) caught lying about seeing another girl; do I end this before he does?


My husband moved here from London to marry me last February. Honestly, it was a weird transition going from long distance to suddenly living together and married, but I figured that was something we’d navigate together.


The last few months, I noticed  a change in his Whatsapp activity- constantly online, last seen time stamps at really early hours in the morning...combined with zero sex, zero touching, barely any talking,I tortured myself over what could be going on.

Long story short: I confronted him about it, even used the name of the girl he was talking to (my friend was holding my husband’s phone when a message from her showed up) and he denied denied denied.

Tonight, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I decided to scroll through Venmo feed. Seriously I was just vegging out and scrolling.
Saw my husband’s name, and transfer to the girl’s name with the title “Damsel in Distress.” 
 
Confronted him. Then he told me he’s having doubts about this, about us. I do understand how difficult it has been to move from London to a suburb, but my empathy stops there. The lies continued.

Tells me he booked a trip to Denver last Thursday to see “a mate”. I look up the girl on Facebook, what do you know, she lives in Denver. He then admits he was going to see her while he was there. The ease with which he lies is unnerving...

So here I am. He wants to work things out. I don’t.I don’t trust he won’t come back from Denver in July and tell me it’s over, and here I was, waiting for him and twiddling my thumbs. He’s controlling the situation, and my trust in him is gone. I want to tell him to either leave now, or plan to relocate to Denver bc he clearly has intentions.

How do I approach this? His “I want to try to fix this” rings hollow and leaves me open to be stomped on at his will.

TL;DR: Husband has been talking to another girl, lied about it, cites difficulty adjusting here, has flights booked to go and see her, and only told me because I pushed.

"[UPDATE] My [24F] mum [54F] has not seen my dad [52M] since their messy divorce, nor met the OW/his new wife [42F] [...] they are all attending my graduation where they will also meet my bf's [23M] parents for the first time. (!!!)


Title editorialized because it was so long to begin with. [Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/) It didn't get a lot of traction but I was asked for an update, so here it is. I write nothing but novellas.

I know a lot of people wanted me to call out my dad or uninvite him entirely, or basically somehow see him get what he ""deserves"". Fair enough. I felt the same way for most of my life. But I can tell you from experience that taking the scorched earth route comes with a whole lot of negatives for me and my family, including my mom. Since my mom's family is basically also my dad's family, trust me, it's so much nicer for all of us when we just don't rock that boat. And frankly, their marriage and their parenting relationship is really not my business and definitely not my responsibility.

The advice I appreciated the most and ultimately ended up following was from u/punfull who said something along the lines of: [You are a bubble floating through the breeze. You are completely unaware of any undertones or subtext or sarcasm or snottiness. You are not available for venting. You are not the mediator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/dzfpv18/)

It was such great advice that I told it to my mom, and advised that we all follow it. While punfull recommended that me and my boyfriend be the inner bubble, it ended up actually being me and my mom.

Nothing went exactly to plan, of course. For one, it turned out that my graduation tickets were indeed assigned seating, so my mom, dad and boyfriend were indeed forced to sit right next to each other, right in the front so I could watch it happen from the stage. My boyfriend's dad was unexpectedly very sick and had to cancel on dinner, so we ended up having to schedule an additional event with less friends and even more mom-dad face time. At first my parents asked which one of them should be there, and I said to both of them, ""You are both invited, and I would love it if you both could come. I trust that you guys will be able to figure it out."" My dad strongly hinted that he might not want to come to dinner after all. I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble.

As expected, my Dad and his wife were somewhat obnoxious. They rented an insanely expensive car, he talked a lot about how successful they are and how much money they make/spend, he wore an expensive patterned suit when I told him to dress casually, they drank a fair bit, he paid for everything even when my mom offered just to make a point of it, and he generally tried to steal the show when possible. They got me a really gaudy graduation present that was very expensive but not really in my taste. He made a bunch of off-colour comments, etc.

However, that said, everyone did show up to everything, and nothing terrible happened. Everyone followed their directions to distract my dad and support my mom. My boyfriend's parents spent all of their time engaging my mom, despite my dad's best efforts to pull them away. As expected, my boyfriend's dad spent basically the entire time telling sob stories, but my family dutifully smiled and nodded and only minorly made fun of him. Bf's dad was busy having fun putting two and two together insofar as where my personality comes from (i.e., I am Nana 2.0). My Nana kept repeating to everyone that we were 100% Team Mom. My friends kept everyone occupied so I could relax.

My mom handled everything like a champ. Eventually she even walked right up to Heather super confidently and introduced herself saying, ""Hello, it's so awkward to finally meet you."" Heather practically had word vomit after that which was pretty satisfying to watch lol. My mom acted and felt very comfortable. She took pictures with me and my dad and operated the camera when it was my dad and Heather. She said she honestly felt fine. She found my dad annoying AF but she always has. I was really proud of her anyways, and I told her so.

Interestingly, it was my dad that was clearly uncomfortable. He always talked louder when she came close so that she would hear him self-aggrandizing. Several times I caught him staring at her from across the table/room. Sometimes he would say something and me and my mom would laugh and roll our eyes at each other. My dad tried to make some sort of sexist joke to my boyfriend about the nursing class and he pretended not to understand. He seemed to slowly absorb that he was not the star of the show and to his credit, he never made a scene about it.

And as for me, as soon as the first meeting was out of the way and nothing terrible had happened, I immediately felt more relaxed. Stuff went wrong but I literally kept saying to myself, ""I am in a bubble, I am in a bubble,"" and it would pass. I almost fell down the stairs in my long gown and high heels while walking towards the stage, and I definitely accidentally flashed the entire audience with photo evidence. But I was pretty much riding the high and it didn't seem to matter. So yeah it went well, good times all around, the last of my family just left yesterday afternoon and I am having a good time in the bathtub, enjoying sweet silence, and being officially graduated! Thanks everyone :)

**TL;DR:** It happened. I followed u/punfull's advice of pretending I am in a bubble, unawares of the drama around me. My mom also followed this advice and we ignored everything that wasn't good and enjoyed everything that was. When not encouraged with attention, my dad was nothing worse than annoying. Everyone can now be considered on polite and speaking terms and nothing terrible happened except for accidentally showing the convocation audience my vagina :)"
"My friend (21F) is incredibly mad at me for using gas money she gave me (25F) to buy ice cream.


I think this is a seriously stupid problem, but maybe you guys can tell me if I'm being insensitive.

I give my buddy Bella rides around pretty often. She doesn't have a car and I work via appointment, so I have huge blocks of time free, so I don't mind. She gives me five or ten bucks depending on where she needs to go.

Now, I have a gas rewards credit card that I use religiously to fill up. When I first started to use it a while ago, Bella made a few faces about me not using her cash anymore, but I told her I'd use it later, and I thought that was that. I stopped filling up after picking her up and started to go to the gas station right before I picked her up.

Last week, I picked up Bella and another friend for errands, and they decided that they wanted to get ice cream, which is fine, but the ice cream stand only took cash. I don't really use cash, I have a gas card and a travel rewards card, so I use them as often as I can over cash cause who doesn't love free airline miles?

So I whip out the tenner that Bella had given me and bought an ice cream cone, and Bella lost her damn mind. She started to whisper-lecture me that she just **knew** I had been misappropriating funds all along (???) and how she couldn't  believe that she couldn't trust me to use *her* money for the right things. She eventually said that I needed to bring her home because after was questioning our friendship.

To be clear, I have *never* denied anyone a ride on the basis that I don't have cash or gas. I don't think that spending cash that my friends give me on food or drinks so I don't have to go find an ATM is a bad thing.

I'm just at a loss. Should I have been using her cash exclusively to put gas in my car?

Now she's going seeing telling people that I'm untrustworthy. I'm pretty upset over the entire thing, but I'm wondering if I should just grovel.

TL;DR: my friend is really upset that I used her gas money to buy ice cream even though I had a full tank.

"Husband (33 m) and I (27f) gave birth to s still-born, and now our marriage is falling apart.


Sorry for format.
Long story, that I will try my best to summarize. 

 My husband and I tried for almost 3 years to get pregnant. If finally happened, and it was a boy. Which was amazing. I have a daughter from a previous marriage. This would be our only child together, &amp; we both wanted a boy.

 We went to our normal 28 week check up. The Dr. Informed us  there was no heartbeat. We were crushed. I was far enough along that I had to give birth to him. He was born sleeping in April.

We got the results of his autopsy. They informed us it was not a genetic disorder. Just a fluke incident ""that just happened"".

We decided to try again as soon as possible. Knowing that we actually CAN get pregnant, &amp; and women are more fertile for 6 months after delivery. 

Well my period is almost a week late. However, all pregnancy tests say negative. He was really excited at the beginning of the week. After the 1st one was negative, he appeared upset. He stopped talking all day. Then the next day, he woke me up and asked me to take another test. Negative. He acted mad ALL day. We have been fighting A LOT lately, and I feel like we are falling apart. Before we lost our son, we were always happy. Hardly ever had a fight, and were able to talk things out.

I really don't want to lose my husband over something that was not our fault. He seems distant, and unhappy now. He makes comments that Owen (our son) looked just like him &amp; I could never understand his side, because I have a child. (He IS her ""daddy"" but not her father.)

He has never admitted it, but I feel like part of him blames me. I was in a lot of pain the last 2 weeks before we found out, and a part of me knew something wasn't right. I didn't go to the hospital though. He works long hours, and I know he needs his rest. With that, our son had been gone for 3 weeks. I obviously did not know. He was perfect at our previous appointment. No one knows why it happened.

I feel like he is slowly pulling away from me. We never talk anymore, and when he is home he just hides in our room. He has days he appears to be happy, but not many. I love this man. More than I have ever loved anyone before. I am terrified if we keep getting a negative test, he will eventually leave. What we have been through was no easy task, but we promised each other it wouldn't destroy our marriage. It appears to be doing just that. Any ideas on how to help us make it through this? I don't think my marriage will last another 3 years waiting to have a baby. I do NOT want to lose my husband too.

TD;LR. Husband and I gave birth to our son at 28 weeks. He had no heartbeat. We tried to get pregnant for almost 3 years. We are trying again, but I feel like my husband is emotionally removing himself from our marriage.  I think he has some resentment that I have a daughter from a previous marriage, and he has no living children of his own. I don't know what to do, or how to keep him from leaving. I do NOT want to lose my husband. Neither of us did anything wrong. It was no ones fault, but I feel like he blames me, on some level. Marriage advice would be helpful. "
"My [26M] wife [28F] of 2 years' friends don't want me in the house when they sleep over...what?


As the title says, my [26M] wife [28F] of 2 years' friends, for some reason, cannot sleep over with me in the house. Normally I don't mind if I get major advance notice, but I've talked to my wife to see if she could convince them to at least be aware of the fact that they're the guests in the house, not me, and it's basically boiled down to them being unable to even live with the fact that I'll be in a room somewhere in the house.

Right now I've been swinging by my parent's house when they do come by but that's a huge drag on my physical fortitude given it's a good half hour away from our current house and it increases my travel time to work by a good half hour to an hour (poor public transit line around that area). I don't really want to stop her from having her friends over just because they are extremely close, but now we're at a loss of how to actually approach her friends: they've said they won't be able to come over if I'm there since ""they'd be uncomfortable if I'm there"" (wat). On top of that, my wife has been really pushing against bringing it up with them for fear of stressing them out and putting them off of coming over (wouldn't want them to get tired now would we?).

In a sense I get it, our place being fairly small (one room, living room + kitchen combined, washroom), but I don't understand the issue of having an extra bed in the living room for them and me just staying in the room the whole time if it's a weekend or something. Though, my wife has also mentioned them being extremely anxious and introverted, to the point where they're only friends with each other + their SOs, though I'm also as sectioned off as they are and wouldn't want to even get near them while they're over.

Aside from getting a house so large I can literally be in it without anyone knowing where I am without tracking me via GPS, how do we even approach the subject with her friends? How can I convince my wife that she needs to put a foot down and work on a compromise with them? What's the legality of splitting rent with them 7-10 days a month (only slightly kidding)?

TL;DR: I'm getting kicked out of my own house since my wife's friends can't handle me being on the same concrete foundation as them. How do we get them to actually be human beings in a world of human beings and socially ignore me and let me be able to sleep in my own bed instead of having to swing by my parent's place or a friends or whoever's while they sleep over?"
"Mine (31F) and my husband (33M)'s houseguest (33M) talks incessantly and is driving me insane


My husband Will has a friend named Gary who arrived on Sunday night from SC to stay with us for the week.  He's Will's buddy from college and they haven't seen each other in years but used to be close.  This is the first time I've met Gary.  Three days into his visit and I'm struggling, guys.  Gary talks almost non-stop!

He literally talked (mostly about himself) throughout the entire dinner we had last night.  He kept talking after dinner.  He kept talking until we went to bed.  He has an opinion about EVERYTHING.  Will and I barely got any words in or got talked over.  My husband could tell I was about to lose my cool by the time I excused myself for bed.  

Will apologized when he came to bed and says he remembered that Gary talked a lot but did not know he was going to do it incessantly and rudely.  We decided we would put more effort into speaking up/interjecting.

Tonight, the three of us went out to try a new restaurant and it didn't go well.  Gary kept trying to monopolize the conversation and would talk over me.  I said, ""EXCUSE ME, please allow me to finish,""  and he laughed and apologized because he, ""knows he talks to much,"" and then KEPT TALKING.  My husband then interjected and said, ""Gary, I would like to hear what Bri has to say.""  So Gary apologized again and let me talk.  When I finished, he nodded and then started continuing with whatever he was saying without acknowledging my point.

I was done being polite at this point.  I was mad and highly irritated.  I had already had a couple drinks and thought, ""fuck.  This.  Noise.""

Our food arrives.  Gary just sits there in front of his plate talking and talking.  So I pushed my salad aside and grabbed his plate of untouched steak.  And I started eating it.  He stopped talking, looked stunned, and said, ""Bri, what are you doing?""  I ignored him and kept eating his steak.  He looks kind of pissed and says, ""please stop eating my steak!""  I ignored him and ignored Will's death stare and kept eating Gary's steak.  I ate the whole thing.  They watched me and Gary didn't speak a word the whole time and I got to eat in glorious silence.  Then I apologized to Gary and said some shit about how I know I eat too much and should have let him finish his steak.  Gary tried to like...laugh it off?  He didn't talk on the ride home....

So...yeah.  My husband is beyond pissed at me and has asked me to apologize to Gary.  I've agreed to apologize because what I did was NOT the right way to handle the situation.  My question is...how do I handle this for the remainder of the week?  Should I just stay away from him?  Or is that being more rude on top of my super rudeness?


TL;DR My husband's college friend is staying with us for a week and he talks incessantly and I have reacted poorly and  insanely.  What do I do for the remaining week?"
"My [41M] family [71F, 42F, 40F] are trying to shame me into giving them money, after years of alienation


Thanks up front Reddit users for reading my long-winded background.

  
  I've always been kind of the goat with my family, and by that I don't mean ""greatest of all time."" I mean my family always kind of looked down on me and held me to unreasonable expectations. I think it's because other than my dad, I was the only male in the house. I didn't get any special consideration for being the youngest (not that I'd want any), and anyway that was rendered irrelevant once my youngest sister was born. She was sort of the golden child throughout our childhoods, but my oldest sister also had special pride of place for being the oldest kid. I was the middle kid and even though I'm male I got hand-me-downs from my sister as long as the clothes weren't too effemimate. As an adult I can see how that's practical and moneysaving, but as a child it was embarrassing and also hurtful to see your sisters constantly get new clothes and new bikes, while I had to wear girls' clothes and ride hand-me-down girl bikes. Interestingly my younger sister never had to wear hand-me-downs from my older sister.   

  
  My mom and sisters pretty much had an easy life while my dad was alive because they just rode him all day long and henpecked him until he died fifteen years ago from a heart attack. He was only 58. Growing up sometimes my dad tried to do special guy things with me but my mom shamed him into stopping it. 

  
  I just don't get it, why my mom was always so cynical and negative toward me. My hair was always too long or ugly, I was too skinny, then when I started working out in high school suddenly I was too muscular, then I was too tanned, then too pale, my grades weren't good enough, then once I got into a good school for college, it wasn't ""that good."" When I earned my degree in business, I was a ""wannabe businessman fast food employee,"" when I got into graduate school for an MBA, it was a ""stupid idea,"" (not like I asked anyone to help me pay for it), etc. Why do you dress like that? You look dumb. Why don't you own a house? Your car is old. No one will respect you.

You know how that goes.

  
  I worked and earned my own pocket money starting at age fifteen with a job at a fast food restaurant, so that's why they all picked on me for working fast food. Eventually I became assistant manager of the restaurant at age twenty one, when I was almost done with college.   
  

My sisters would often mock me for working in fast food, and my mom would too. It wasn't gentle ribbing or teasing, in a loving way. No. It was spiteful insults, trying to hurt my feelings and make me feel small. Speaking of feel small, I'm really tall (6'5"") and they also made fun of me for never trying out or being good at basketball or caring about any other sports.

   
  When my dad died he left everything to my mom, which is to be expected, including the house. He left me and each of my siblings ten thousand dollars just as some extra money, on the assumption that my mom would leave the kids everything equally upon her own death many years later. I already knew back then that my mom wouldn't leave me much, if anything, compared to my sisters. My sisters continued to live at home, but once I graduated college I moved across town to my own apartment. They weren't sad to see me go. I've been living on my own ever since. It's been going on almost twenty years now.

   
  I grew up in a rather large house (this was Kansas, where it was possible for a normal dude like my father to own a big home), so when my sisters got married, their husbands moved in, too. Their husbands are both college educated guys but I could tell they enjoyed the idea of not having to pay for their own house or any rent. My dad had built a small guest house behind the home which he always told me would be mine when I grew up, but after he died I could tell my mom had the place earmarked for her daughter and future son in law. My older sister and husband stayed in my former room in the big house.   


  Well, whatever, right. I had my own thing going. These days I'm regional manager of a mid-sized restaurant chain (not fast food, but close haha) and although I'm not rich, I live quite comfortably. I could afford to put a downpayment on a house but I like the easy freedom of having an apartment. At thirty, I married my long-time girlfriend, who my mother and sisters always hated because she was Jewish and also eight years older than me. ""Your girlfriend is too old! She will never have a baby!"" 

  
  Well, none of them came to my wedding even though they were invited. We actually conceived a baby but my wife miscarried. My mom and sisters found out about it and rather than express any condolences at a woman who just lost a child, my mom and sisters treated me to unsolicted ""I told you so"" and didn't send my wide so much as a card.

   
  I love my wife, and since we don't have kids, we have French bulldogs. We live in a big bungalow apartment with a yard for them, so whatever. My family mocks me for that, too. Like I'm not a man, because I don't have kids.   
  

It's not like I accuse my sisters' husbands of not being men because they live in their mother in law's house. Everyone does their own thing.   
 

My wife's family is somewhat successful in the furniture business and they're a lot nicer to me than my own family. My mother and father in law offered to buy me a new car (I drive a 2000 Honda Accord which is still in mint shape) just this year but I said no thanks, and they seemed to be impressed that I didn't accept gifts.   
 

 Well, after all that background, finally my point.   


  It seems my sisters and their husbands have had all sorts of business schemes and tried to open their own yoga studio, because I guess my sisters are into that stuff. Sort of the whole ""Gee, I like coming to yoga class, so naturally I understand business economics and should open my own yoga studio!""  
 

 Personally I thought that the kind of boutique, expensive yoga studio they had in mind was more of a Manhattan or Beverly Hills thing and not a small town thing, but whatever it was none of my business, they never asked my advice, so I never said anything. Plus my sisters' husbands both fancied themselves business savvy (one of them sells insurance, the other works as a new accounts person at a bank) so it's not like my counsel was ever needed.  

  
  Of course they failed, and spectacularly so, and my mom foolishly put her house up as collatoral for the business. I'll admit that in a petty way I felt a bit of schadenfreude but overall I was upset especially because both of my sisters have small children (there are nine people living in my old house now).  
  

Now the bank is threatening to take over their house if they don't come up with a certain sum of money.   
  

It's a lot of money, but money that I happen to have, and they know it. 

  
  They all approached me with appeals (by phone message and TEXT--they've always known where I live but have NEVER once come to visit me) to how I should be a good brother and son and how ""this is what my father would have wanted"" and all that. Neither of my sisters' husbands have said a word to me about it and I doubt I'll see one penny of my money back if I ""loaned"" it to them.

My mom especially has been laying it on thick about how she's an old woman and will be cast out of her ""familial home"" and all that.

  
  I haven't yet returned any of their calls or texts yet.   
 

 I'm still thinking about how they all always have a big Christmas party every year and never invite me or my wife, partly because they don't like me, and partly because they don't like the ""Jew."" I know that if I confronted them about it they'd say ""you're family, you don't need to be invited, just show up,"" but I know DAMN WELL they don't want me there.  
  

My wife says it's up to me whether I want to help or not, but she also says that there is power in mercy.   
  

I don't know, though. I think she's bigger than me in that way.  
  

I'm looking for some outside perspectives on what to do here. 

  
  Thanks for any advice, Reddit!!!

"My [26M] adoptive mom [55] and sisters [30F, 34F] think that I tricked my deceased father [50M] into leaving me his money


Hi Reddit I don't really know how to deal with this current situation with my family.

First a little background. Sorry in advance for the wordiness.

My biological dad was killed in a car accident when I was still a baby, and my mom gave me up for adoption soon after. I have no relationship with her and have no idea where she is, nor do I care to look for her. I learned these things from my adoptive parents when I was eight years old.

Anyway, I got adopted by a nice family as a baby and my life has generally been pretty comfortable. My father died late in 2017 after a couple of years suffering from lung cancer. He was quite young to die at only fifty and doctors said it was because of heavy smoking and stress (he was a finance executive). He made a great salary and was able to support my mom and two sisters.

Well fast forward a few years and both my sisters went to good colleges and got married. My dad paid for all of their college expenses and for their weddings and also for their home downpayments.

I'm almost five years younger than the younger of my older sisters, and by the time it was my turn to go to school, my dad took me aside and told me he didn't have enough money to ""full ride"" me like my sisters. I said that was okay and I just worked at Target as a sales associate for a few years. I went to school for engineering and got my degree in that. By my third year I was earning really good grades (I didn't earn very good grades in high school though) and got a scholarship to pay for the rest of my degree. My father was building up his finances again and offered to pay for my schooling, but I was already used to paying for it myself so I told him it was okay. And anyway I got into a program that paid for my graduate degree as well and recently got that.

Sorry about the long buildup, but when my dad passed away, he left me close to sixty thousand dollars, which is a little to some people, and a lot to others. For me, it's like my whole year's salary at my new job, so it's an amazing windfall.

But here's the thing. My dad didn't leave my mom anything, because according to his lawyer he reasoned the house and everything in it and both their cars and their motor home were theres, plus all the ""loose"" money in the bank, and it comes to a hell of a lot more than sixty thousand dollars.

Also, he left each of my sisters thirty thousand dollars, which is half of what he gave me.

My sisters accused me of fooling my cancer-ridden father somehow, and my mom didn't dissuade their opinion on this. I tried to explain the whole ""I never told dad what to do with his money"" thing but they just wouldn't hear it. They actually tried to go to my dad's lawyer and have my dad's will reversed somehow.

My dad's lawyer told them that according to my father, he (dad) felt that my sisters already got a lot of money from him in that he paid for their full four years of college and also for their house downpayments, which for each of them TRIPLED anything my dad left for me. But my sisters still won't hear of it.

I'm really disappointed with them because up until now I thought we were all quite close as a family.

My mom hasn't really been wanting to talk to me, and I think my eldest sister's husband has them all convinced that I somehow ""elder abused"" my dad by ""abandoning him"" during his illness, whereas they all stayed hear him, and that I turned him against them all somehow. I don't see how the hell I could have done that while I was busting my hump in grad school.

I mean I'm sad and sorry I wasn't able to hang out with him as much as them, but my scholarship for grad school was out of state and I couldn't just pop in every day like they could.

I hear through the grapevine that my older brother in law actually wants to sue me for my share of the money.

As far as I'm concerned, I haven't even seen a dime of it so far and I'm earning my own money and in a strict technical sense I don't really need it. But I'm also angry and hurt and I feel like I could actually use the money in the future, too. I basically have zero money saved right now other than the little bit my new job puts away by default for retirement. Sixty grand would be nice to have in the bank. Also I live in a studio and I don't have a huge mansion like my mom or sisters, so WTF.

And I really in danger of losing my inheritance here?

Thanks in advance.

"Husband (34M) confessed he sometimes wonders if our child (6mo) is his. Married two years


He says he knows it’s an irrational fear. But the child looks more like me, and we’d both assumed husband’s dominant genes would show more.

The child is absolutely his. I’ve never cheated. And husband knows this deep down, but he says he has this irrational fear.

It really bothers me and now I can’t enjoy it when someone points out a trait in our child that is like me. I can’t be happy my child looks like me. Even when I point out where I see my husband he says, “yeah, I guess he looks like me a little. For a change.”

It’s really bothering me. I’ve even suggested a paternity test, but it hurts. When I push it, my husband asks why I’m so defensive and says that’s fishy. Then claims he’s joking. So I can’t bring up how much it bothers me without it looking like I’m trying to defend myself.

I just don’t know how to handle this. I’ve never cheated. I know for a fact the child is his but I find myself desperately hoping they look more like their dad as they get older so he can know.

And he also mentions an article he read about his fathers tend to love children more if they look like them.

I know he loves our child. But this is really nagging at me.

Tl;dr: husband mentioned he sometimes wonders if our child is his. I’m hurt and can’t bring it up."
"How do I [25M] tell my friend [26M] that his ""friendships"" with teenage girls is wildly inappropriate?


Hi reddit, this is a pretty sensitive topic and I didn't really know where else to ask this. I've known this guy K for a couple years now and consider him a good friend, currently I share an apartment with him and work in the same area. 

I've noticed from early on that he tends to date very young looking women, but I didn't really ask questions about his love life so I assumed they were just very petite girls around his age. Now a while ago (maybe 3~4 months ago) there was an incident where K was out and I was at the apartment alone and this girl showed up looking for him, saying they had plans to hang out and smoke weed or something. She looked really, really young, like I assumed she couldn't be any older than 15, and she said she was 17 which kinda freaked me out majorly and I told her K wasn't here and she should leave. K later on also freaked out and said he had no idea she was under 20 since they had only talked on facebook and she had her age listed as way older.

This left a really bad taste in my mouth, because no matter how much K denied knowing this girl's age something just didn't sit right. Combined with the fact that I've literally never seen him with a girl who looked close to his age, this was just kinda really disturbing so I did some digging (I'm not proud of trying to interfere in someone else's life but it just felt like something I should do). I found the 17 year old girl on his facebook friends list really easily and there was nothing on her profile where anyone could have assumed she was over 20, she was talking about prom and general high school stuff all over her timeline. I super casually asked him how he could have thought this girl was over 20 and he immediately got defensive and said he was only trying to ""mentor"" her since she wanted to go to the college he graduated from. Like I get it, high school seniors talking to college alumni is perfectly understandable, but why tell this girl he was gonna give her weed and meet in person at night, and why lie to me in the first place saying he had no idea how old she was?

I wasn't sure how to approach this or put in words how fucking inappropriate everything sounded to me, and during the next month or so K generally kinda avoided me and started making plans to move out. Yesterday night I came home kinda late (around 4AM) to find him talking to someone on (I'm guessing) skype, it was definitely a female voice and they were talking about high school finals/college applications and stuff. When K noticed I was home he immediately plugged in his earphones and told me he was talking to a work friend. At this point I just had this inexplicable sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and I went to my room, but I could hear everything he was saying to this most likely high school student, which was his usual routine of trying to impress women with how well traveled/worldly he was and all his accomplishments etc that I swear he used almost verbatim to a girl he dated briefly a while ago. I also very distinctly heard him say something like ""if I was in high school I'd definitely ask you out,"" which again just sounds so fucking wrong.

Earlier today I brought it up again, maybe hoping to myself there was a big misunderstanding and somehow I had misheard everything. I only got to ""so is your friend still in high school?"" before K completely blew up and started lecturing me about how I should mind my own business. I just told him it was kinda weird that he would stay up until like 4AM chatting with a high school kid, and again he claimed that he was a ""mentor"" and a ""best friend"" to this girl, along with a couple jabs at how I'm kind of a loner and thus I wouldn't understand his ""friendships"" anyways. He stormed off and hasn't come home, which at this point I'm perfectly fine with.

I just have this really sickening gut feeling. Nothing about the conversations K is having with these obviously underage girls sits right with me, it all seems so fucking inappropriate and predatory. Giving tips on how to get into colleges, maybe, but staying up until 4 talking about your love life and what your ""type"" is with a high school student does not sound like something a 26 year old man should do. He just seemed so casual about it all, like it was no big deal, that I can't help but wonder how many ""friendships"" like this he has, or if any of the girls he dated were even around his age (I swear none of them looked like they were even anywhere near 20). What do I even fucking do? Obviously confronting him head on just makes him pissed off, and I don't know if I even want to talk to him if my assumptions are correct and he's actually preying on underage girls. Is there anything I could have misunderstood about the situation and I'm the one being overly sensitive? What can I even do?

tl;dr my ""friend"" talks to obviously underage girls about what I think are completely inappropriate things, and develops generally inappropriate ""mentorships"" with them. really grossed out, need some advice."
"My [M 30] siblings [2 F's 25/26] are trying to connect, they were my abusers during my childhood.


Long time lurker in this sub, finally have something to share! I created a new account with this, want to keep my personal life out of my fun account. 

It might sound strange, but my entire childhood was very rough because both of my younger siblings were some of the worst people I have ever met in my life. The level of hate I saw out of them I have not ever seen matched in my own life. One strong example from childhood would be that one year for Christmas my parents got me an Ipod nano (you remember the old ones with no screen or anything, but still great at the time!) and got my siblings other items that they asked for. On paper, everyone got what the asked ""santa"" for but the problem was the Ipod turned out to be a very popular item. In the coming weeks I was pulled into my high schools (I was a senior in high school at the time and my siblings were just coming in as 1st years) counseling services and asked how my home life was. I have always had a rough time at home, but nothing major had happened recently and I got by just hiding in my room so I told the counselor that all was well and that I felt fine! The visits I had to make increased, and I could not find out why. I asked my mother about it and she said she didn't know about anything, she never talked to anyone over there. 

Now before we go further, I want to make things clear about me. I have always been a super recluse. I was lucky enough to have my own space growing up and never talked to anyone/had only friends who I spent time with online or far from my house. I never wanted to bring people to my house, and time spent with friends was always away. I love and trust both my parents, but my sisters both behaved so insane that I spent 100&amp;#37; of my time avoiding it. I wanted to be as small as I could. Both of them spent a lot of time trying to sort of draw me out but setting ""traps"" or creating a shitty situation and somehow getting me to be involved in it. 

Back to the story, I got called into the counseling services place again and met with someone new. At this point I was starting to get really nervous because I didn't know what was going on. I started the meeting by asking why I was here and if I had to stay. The person let me know that they had been getting some disturbing news about me that they had to investigate. He wouldn't say what, but I continued with the meeting if only to prove I didn't do anything. Later that day when I got home my parents ignored me and wouldn't talk to me. I was super fed up with all this mystery so I just went into my room and stayed away. I played a lot of online games and such to pass the time. This went on for months. It had become the norm that no one at home would talk to me, and folks at my school were keeping an eye on me. After a great while I finally caught on to what happened. My sisters both came home talking about the new Ipod's they got from my parents. Some newer model had come out or something and they both got one. I overheard one of them in the hallway talking about how much better it was than mine and how they could stop now. Using that new information I confronted the counselors at my school and asked them if this had anything to do with my sisters. They refused to tell me but I knew. I followed up with my father at home, everyone else had left so it was just him and I. He said that my sisters had gone to the school counselors and told them that they were going to kill themselves because their big brother got an Ipod and their parents refused to buy them one. (we were by no means rich, but to my parents they were able to get everyone what they wanted but didn't know the Ipod would be such a big deal.) The school contacted my parents to talk to them about it and after a while it resulted in them getting their new Ipods. (we had bread for dinner a few times because of it) The counselors continued to meet with me during the rest of final year at school but I stopped talking to them while I was there. I couldn't believe that they wanted an Ipod so badly that they went to their school counselors and told them that. The school thought I was an abusive person, and they had told my parents that. For a while everyone thought I was this terrible person. 

Not once did anyone ask me. I was crushed like this repeatedly during my growing up, this was one of the worst. As soon as my high school year was done, I left for college and rarely go back. I sometimes visit my parents though, they are still good to me.  Both of them had sat down with me and said they were sorry for how they acted. They both knew it was nothing I did and that they didn't know how to handle everything that was happening. My sisters had no repercussions and everyone just let the situation sit, including myself. I just wanted to be left alone. That was all a while ago now. 

Now as I hit 30, I live in a really nice neighborhood and have an amazing job. I have a loving girlfriend of 5 years now and everything is going really well. Recently one of my sisters has been trying to buddy up and keep telling my mom that they have changed and that they want to get to know their brother etc. I don't buy a damn word of it. My mom called me saying that she is a completely different person and that we should have a cook out and such. Every instinct of mine is saying this is some kind of trap. I have so many other stories like the one before, they all start harmless and evolve into shit. My worst fear is either of my sisters finding out where I live, or where I work, or really anything about me they could use to do anything with. I am sure that they could find out all of this on their own, but hey that is just me being paranoid. However, I have to think of my parents side. I know they love all their kids, and my mother seems to be trying to guilt me in by saying that it breaks her heart that we don't get along. I can't tell if she is in on this or if she is being real. I have to consider that she is being real and that I don't want to let her down. 

The big question is, how on earth do I handle this? Should I trust at all that someone like that has changed? It is only one of them, throughout my life they were always both involved in the shit going on. 

TL;DR: Abusive siblings from my childhood want to reconnect and get to know each other. Life is great now, don't want to risk any of it. 

Also side note: I did not realize this was going to turn into such a large wall of text. Thank you to anyone who managed to get through it all. I hope my story I included here provides some decent insight into how mixed up things were. "
"My wife [26F] is trying to take over the garage that was supposed to be mine [28M]. It’s causing some fights and I’m getting pretty annoyed about it.


Alright, I’m trying not to be petty about this, but I’m getting pretty annoyed and would really like some resolution on it. 

Wife and I got together six years ago and have been married for four.

We spent most of that time jumping around the country, as I was in the military back then. My grandparents happened to own a small plot of land with a small cottage on it not far from the city I grew up in, and my wife and I have gotten to spend time there for vacation a few times. She really, really liked that cabin and was very vocal about it.

When it was time for me to get out of the military, we started looking for somewhere to live near where I grew up, as my wife had zero interest in moving back to where she is from. 

My grandpa knew I was looking for a place and contacted me. He basically told me that he and my grandma are too old to do much with the cottage anyway, and he knows how much my wife loves the place, and he offered to sell me the land and cottage for literally next to nothing.

While that is a super-awesome deal, I was a little hesitant at first, just because I really didn’t want to live out in the countryside. My wife on the otherhand was overjoyed with the offer and practically begged to move there. We talked it out and eventually found a compromise. I told her I’d make living in the country work for me, and she could do whatever she wanted with the cottage itsself, but I wanted the little standalone shed/garage for myself.

She, very happily, agreed to that. And when I say I was taking the garage for myself, I didnt mean that I was banning her from it or anything. I like working on cars, I want to try getting into restoring old cars, so I wanted it for my personal space to take old cars apart and keep my tools in and whatnot.

We moved in six months ago. I’m not crazy about my hour-long commute to work, but I got my garage so I didn’t complain. I think I worked pretty hard on making it a nice spot to hang out, too. I’ve got a halfway disassembled vehicle in it right now, plus my tools and work area, space to park my motorcycle, and there’s a little carpeted area towards the back where I threw in a couch and a couple old recliners and a tv and a bar. So, y’know, I think I worked pretty hard on making it nice for myself.

My wife winds up hanging out in that space quite a bit to chat and watch me work and I was really happy with the arrangement. It seemed like she was too.

But three weeks ago I got her a new car, because her old one was getting unsafe for that long commute into work. And she loves her new car. To the point that she told me the other day she would really like to be able to park it in the garage. I kinda gave her a look when she said she wants to start parking it in the garage, and she told me she just doesn’t like leaving a new car outside where it is in the rain or sun or hail or whatever. I kinda get that, but........that garage is supposed to be *mine*. So I offered to get her a car-cover and maybe put together a car port. She didn’t seem satisfied and countered that maybe I could move my car-work to some rented space in town.

I’m sorry, but there is no chance of that happening. I told her I’m not trying to be unreasonable with her, but my condition for getting her this place (Granted it was ludicrously cheap, but I *did* pay for it all with my own paycheck) was that I get to have the garage. The whole reason I wanted it was so I wouldn’t have to drive into town, and I’d have a place to do my hobby that I could just walk right outside to, plus have a drink or something (because frankly, scotch tastes best when drank over a V-8 engine block) since I wouldn’t have to drive home. Moving it to in town negates all reasons I had for this garage.

And now we are having an argument over it. She is continuously complaining about parking her car outside, I am continuously offering her a car cover and to put together that car port. She says she wants her new car somewhere inside.

Am I being the asshole by telling her “no”? She *does* have a nice new car and I understand wanting to protect it, but we had an agreement that I can do what I want with that garage, and she pretty much gets to decorate the whole rest of our property however she wants with no complaint from me. Help?

**TL;DR** I got my wife a cottage that she really wanted on the condition that I get to have to garage to myself. Now she wants the garage for her new car and she gets upset when I tell her “no”. Help?"
"My [25F] boyfriend [28M, 3 years] has been banned from being the best man at his friend’s wedding by his ex [28F] from 12 years ago.


I just want to start by saying that my boyfriend is the most calm and sweet natured man on the planet. Nothing really seems to upset him so it’s breaking my heart to watch him come home and stare into space until it’s time for bed because this whole situation has really hurt him. 

So, my boyfriend dated this girl (let’s call her Alice) 12 years ago for 3 months. There was no big fight or drama when they broke up, it was just one of those things. But through Alice, my boyfriend met Dave who is Alice’s sister’s boyfriend. Hope that’s not too confusing! Since they met, BF and Dave have been inseparable. They’ve both been through some tough times together and they are genuinely like brothers. 

Alice hates my boyfriend. Completely hates him and by default she dislikes me too. The first time I met her she said the only reason my BF is with me is because he likes “slutty girls”. And that was the kindest thing she said to me that night. The second time we met was just as awful but I always take the higher ground and just pretend that I think she’s joking and laugh awkwardly. 

Throughout the years, my BF has been disinvited to every single one of Dave’s birthday parties because Alice has expressed that she was uncomfortable (despite being married with a son, and another on the way) but we never thought she would go this far. When Dave mentioned to her that BF would be the best man she said she wouldn’t allow that. What’s hurting my boyfriend the most is that Dave just seemed to accept it. 

My heart is so broken for him. He expressed to me that he doesn’t know why she hates him this much but he just wants Dave to be happy so he doesn’t want to cause a fuss by telling him he’s hurt. But I’m getting sick and tired of this grown woman dictating over Dave and my BFs friendship. 

Another thing I’m worried about is her once again not being to help herself from making mean comments at the wedding and it upsetting me. The wedding will be 2 weeks after she’s given birth by C-section and the first time she will be drinking in a long time. 

Does anyone have any advice as to what the best way to proceed is? 

TL;DR My boyfriend’s best friend has said he isn’t allowed to be best man anymore because his future SIL (and BFs ex) has banned it. "
"My girlfriend finally revealed why I [31M] wasn't allowed at her place...


We have been together for 3 years and a half, and became sexually active 2/3 months into our relationship. She's a few years older than me, divorced. Instead this is my first relationship ever, and I'm way less experienced.

We meet about 2/3 times every week and just in the last year we travelled abroad 4 times. I love her and try to be kind/please her often. She also cares for me and treats me with small gifts. Besides a couple of weird things, I'm happy to realize that we seem to manage our differences and haven't had any problems undermining our relationship compared with other relationships without passion or in which the pair always nags/criticizes each other. Obviously things aren't always 100% happy, but we always made amends quite quickly.

A few months ago she finally met my family (I haven't met hers yet: they're more than 6000km away and there's no direct flight). Though we aren't living together yet, she has multiple times asked if we'll get married once we'll have been living together for long enough.

The main weird thing was how I've never been able to visit her place (we always meet outside or at my place), and I was not even allowed to know her home address (until yesterday). She made some excuses about extremely strict landlord rules (due to her taking care for the place and paying a fraction of market price) and needing her own space, as well as being afraid of some stalking exes. Knowing about it was just something that got pushed in the future again and again.

Pushing her on it was just souring things and not accomplishing much. But recently I caught her out lying about a recent trip, and I set an ultimatum: no more hiding anything anymore, otherwise she'd return my flat's keys.

So, it turns out that she's still married with whom she previously referred to as her ex-boyfriend. They live in separate rooms and haven't had sex in 5 years. They're married since almost 8 years.

This was a bit shocking, but it explains all the weird things: why I couldn't visit, why she hesitated to move over to me, why she couldn't spend with me several days in a row (except the holidays).

She's apparently quite stuck in a loveless relationship: besides the lack of sex, she's not allowed to have friends over, she cannot use/drive the car that they have (she's learning for a driving license just now), she received some harsh words when she paid for a coffee from their joint account, they never cook for each other (they just cook for one and eat outside often), etc.etc. While she confessed this she was crying, and I was also brought to tears a bit.

That said, I don't like the idea of having another person's wife cheat on him with me and neither I want myself to be the cause for another relationship to be over.

But I'm not keen either on walking away, she recommitted her love to me and I would be hurting her a lot. We're invested in this relationship and, besides this hurdle, everything looks like it would work out. On the other hand, if I had to make the same decision 3.5 years ago, when I just met her, I wouldn't have pursued a relationship and this is hypocritical of me, given that even if I was not aware until now, the situation was exactly the same. The only difference is that we're now invested in this relationship.

It seems that he mentioned to her that they could divorce 4 years ago. Less than 1 year ago he also proposed her to meet his parents (that hasn't happened yet, they live in yet another place 7000+km away) but she declined since she's been thinking of leaving him recently. She hasn't done it yet for 2 main reasons:

1 - She was not 100% sure that our relationship would work out (we've done some small mistakes in the past, those things that I previously mentioned we have amended), and moving from a stable situation to an uncertain one is understandably difficult.
2 - She would be in substantial financial difficulty: she currently sends almost 1/4th of her net salary to her parents back home and currently doesn't have to pay rent (which would be more than half her net salary for a 1-bedroom). Point 1 compounds this second point: if I can help her out in case she might lose her job, it would be much better than having to handle everything on her own.


I recognize that hiding things for so long is quite bad, but the aversion of loss that caused her not to leave him/confess earlier is actually very similar to the reason for my mistake: not pushing her to clarify and force her to show me her place, due to fear of losing her. So I've instead been overly patient and accomodating.

Anyhow, I explicitly told her that I don't want to be the reason for her breakup with him, but given that she's been thinking of leaving him already, she said that she'll probably do it in July/August. She also said that now she came to terms with the fact that she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life with him, and she's thus going to leave him, even if we wouldn't continue our relationship.

Obviously, if she won't leave him by the date that she's committing to, I would find the situation unsustainable, and it would be much better for me to walk away rather than sticking around and be an unwanted third wheel. But assuming she'll go along with what she said, this whole situation might get resolved soon, and I'll just need to help her in the transition (I don't expect a divorce to ever be an easy thing). It'll just be unpleasant to think about for a couple of months, as well as being unfair on the other guy (which I've never met).

What do you think?

Do you have experience in similar situations in which you've been in the same place as me?

How would you handle this?

**TL;DR;** : After 3+ years in a stable, monogamous relationship, I discovered that my girlfriend is married with another guy (which she's going to divorce soon)."
"[UPDATE] My [24F] collegues [28F] husband [28M) is texting me, I've taken the right course of action but I am worried, what do I do?


Hello Guys, 
I posted a few days ago but I did not get a lot of attention, however, here's the original post anyway, https://redd.it/8qt1sn

So after that I got another message from Ted the husband from a different account i.e. a fake account, I still did not reply but knew it was him because of the content and the profile picture (Which was a meme he sent me). 
At this point I just sort of decided I need to tell Kara the wife. I spoke to her yesterday and well, she seemed to think it was not that bad, then proceeded to tell me he did this with other girl before they got married, then said she checked his facebook and he has deleted all the messages, then said they have had fight about him deleting messages, and then said he is silly and jokey like that. 

In all honesty, my opinion is that he was out of line, for the rest of us who aren't his wife and haven't got used to his antics, I think it was clear what he was doing. Anyway, I might bump into him at work if he comes and I am okay with the confrontation if it needs to happen cause I dont doubt he was out of line, he may have his wife fooled but not me.

TL;DR: Ted messaged from fake account I told the wife. "
"Me (36F) with my husband (40M) of 3 years. Found out an old friend of his is actually a woman he was the other man of off and on for over 15 years. He may have fathered her younger 2 kids. Where do I go from here?


Forgive me if I ramble but this is all really fresh. Please ask questions if you need to. 

We'll call my husband Jim and the woman Amy. Some details changed.

Jim has a *lot* of very long term friendships with both men and women. Some as far back as grade school. He's a very loyal person who values the relationships he has and that's one thing I've always loved about him. If he cares about you, you know it and ge always make an effort to work out any problems before walking away. Not that he has never ended a friendship but it wasn't for lack of trying to fix it first. 

Amy is an old co-worker of his who lives about 8 hrs away from us. She has some family near us who she visits once or twice a year so I've met her a handful of times as well as her husband Brad and their 3 kids. We've all done dinner together and they even stayed with us once when their hotel screwed up their reservations. I was never particularly close with them, they're much more Jim's friends, but I did like them well enough. 

Jim told me (in confidence of course) that Amy and Brad's marriage has always been up and down. Brad is ex military and has PTSD which makes things difficult for them and they actually almost have divorced several times. There's a big gap between their oldest child and their younger two. 

Now on to what happened. 

Jim and I don't snoop on each other's devices but we're pretty lax about them. Our phones have PIN locks but it's more for if they get lost or stolen than to keep each other out. We both leave our computer screens up around the house a lot of the time. Up til last night there was no distrust so it was just an organic thing because neither of us havld anything to hide. 

Jim had left his FB up and I was sitting at the coffee table watching TV when a message from Amy popped up that said ""Happy Father's Day!!!! 😉"" 

.......we don't have kids. I was married once before and Jim was in an 11 year relationship but never married and he doesn't have any kids. 

We don't even have pets to call fur kids. I'm deathly allergic to most animals. 

So I called him in from the kitchen and calmly said ""Honey..... why is Amy wishing you a happy father's day?"" He got nervous and stammered out ""Oh it's an old inside joke""

Something about it just hit me WRONG. 

""What kind of joke?"" 

""It's a really long story. I'll tell you tomorrow, It's been a long day.""

*He is never like this*

If anything he loves to tell old stories and relive the memory. Sometimes a little too much but that's who he is. Really sentimental. 

""No, tell me now""

""I'm really tired and getting a headache. It's nothing, I promise.""

""Jim I swear to god if you don't tell me what's going on right now I am grabbing this laptop and messaging Amy back and SHE can tell me.""

Well. TURNS OUT that every time Amy and Brad had a rough patch? Her and Jim would end up in bed. On and off for *a period of 15 years*. Her younger 2 kids may be his. He said he ""fell on the sword and broke it off with her because it was easier for one person to lose than for 5 people to lose"".

He possibly let another man *raise kids that aren't his* and this has been going on SINCE THEIR 20s!!!!

Reddit. Who am I married to? This woman has stayed in our home. I've befriended her. Jim swears up and down that they're 100% done and just friends and I have no reason to believe he's cheated, if anything it's just logistically impossible, but he's basically had a whole life with this woman and potentially a FAMILY and I NEVER KNEW. 

He said their relationship was just an ""escape"" and ""was what it was"" and he was never ""waiting around for her"" nor was she waiting around for him.

HE MAY HAVE CHILDREN WITH HER!!!!

I went on her FB and guys? It's seriously debateable. The boy is almost definitely Brad's. Has his nose and his bone structure and his eyes. The girl doesn't look like Amy or Brad.

Not to mention this is NASTY. Jim thought he was so SPESHUL but cheaters cheat. It's what they do. This awful immoral selfish creature was probably sleeping with any number of other guys who all thought THEY were special too and while I truly do believe as much as I can that they're over..... what if they're not? If their relationship potentially produced 2 kids obviously no protection was used and what diseases is she spreading to me and Brad? 

Even if what Jim says is true and they are and have been truly over there they both are, parading their spouses around their ex affair partners. 

My mind is reeling, Reddit. I don't know where to turn or what my next move should be. I can't get my thoughts straight.

tl;dr Found out husband's married ""old work friend"" of 15 years is actually someone he slept with off and on the entire time and her younger 2 kids maybe his. I don't know what direction to go in. Help me make a plan."
"I [34m] inadvertently hurt my girlfriend of 7 years [33f] feelings by trying to compliment her breasts


TLDR: Tried to compliment my girlfriend's body but inadvertently ended up hurting her feelings by failing to understand the context of what she said.

Last night my girlfriend worked late so I got us a bottle of wine, and when we she got off we sat out in the hot tub and enjoyed a romantic soak in our birthday suits.

My girlfriend is one of those people who hit the gene pool lottery. Without serious exercise (other than Yoga a few times a week) or strict diet, she maintains a body that any swimsuit model would covet. And she's beautiful to boot, inside and out. She's a head turner and I lucked out big time.

So after our soak we were getting dressed and she pulled on a little crop top t-shirt without a bra. She looked so stinking cute, the kind of cute that hurts. I half jokingly said ""you can wear that out in public with me anytime!"" The joke being that she is incredibly modest and we both know she never would, but I was just trying to be fun and feeling a little frisky. She laughed and kinda cupped her boobs and jiggled them through her shirt and said ""I don't think so, these girls aren't quite what they used to be!!"" 

This is where I screwed up. In retrospect, I realize this was a version of ""does this dress make me look fat."" She didn't want me to address WHAT she said, she was probably feeling some insecurity and wanted a little affirmation, or maybe wasn't looking for any kind of comment from me. But I'd had a couple glasses of wine and wasn't super sharp and that totally flew past me. I replied, ""are you kidding me? I love the way your body is changing, I think it's super sexy! I wouldn't change it for a minute! saggy boobs and all"" The saggy boobs part was DEFINITELY a joke, because even if they've changed over the years, they sure as shit aren't saggy.  But, not the right time nor subject for a joke.

Her face kinda dropped and she was pretty quiet the rest of the night. I tried to bring it up, but she just asked that we drop it. She's seemed a little down today and despite my best efforts at apologizing, I think I stung her worse than I'd realized.

The thing is, I meant what I said. I would never come out straight and say it, but I can see the way her body has changed over 7 years. Maybe her boobs aren't quite as perky as they used to be, but still defy gravity in ways that boobs her size rarely do. But I HONESTLY do think the changes are sexy. Why? I dunno. 20  year old me would have laughed at that thought. But after being in a relationship with someone for 7 years and planning on spending your life with them, somehow in some weird way things that you never thought would be sexy, kinda become sexy. It's like the little bit of change in her body I can notice, reminds me of the time we have together, what we've been through, all that sentimental crap.

But for her it's different. And she's entitled to her own feelings. She's always struggled with body issues, probably has some slight body dysmorphia. And she struggles with insecurity too. Also, I just think society puts a lot of pressure on women to be beautiful to some silly standard. I never really understood the weight of that pressure until recently when I read an awesome book called ""Come as You Are"" by Emily Nagoski. It's a pretty enlightening book on female sexuality. Highly recommend to both women and men.

Anyway. I kinda just don't know what to do. I've explained myself, and she gets where I'm coming from. I've been going through my own ""mid 30s seeing/feeling my body change"" crisis. But I think it's different for men. Our culture treats aging men and women differently. While I feel older, and gain weight faster, and have to work harder to stay fit, I don't think I feel the same societal pressures as a woman. So it seems like a combination of factors playing in to this. 

Any suggestions on how to move forward?

"My BF (28M) received a call saying that I (29M) have been cheating on him which is absolutely isn't true. It has damaged our relationship significantly, and I feel powerless. Would really appreciate any advice.


My life has been turned upside down this week and I don't know where to turn. I am in a lot of pain and would really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. 


&amp;nbsp;

Been dating this guy for 4 months and it's been nothing short of incredible. I was the happiest I can ever remember myself being. It's the longest and most serious relationship for both of us. Then about a week ago he started getting calls every day from a number with a local area code. He didn't answer until the 4th day when he received this series of texts:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Anon: Is this **(*my bf's name*)** ?

&gt; Anon: you know **(*my name*)** ?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; BF's response: Who is this?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; it's *my ex's name*

&gt; your seeing *my name* ? [sic]

&gt; need to talk to u

&gt; I need 2 min. In your best interest. answer

&amp;nbsp;


Then he answers the call, and the guy on the phone tells him that he and I have been dating for a long time, and also that I sleep around with other guys on my work trips out of town. (Kinda contradictory claims, no?)

&amp;nbsp;


Totally blindsided by this. I have never cheated and I never would, I am crazy about this guy. It's super fucked up because I haven't had any bad break ups or evil ex's. I have been good to the people in my life. There's no motive.

&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, he confronts me about it, says it's too crazy to not have any basis in reality, and that it's too early in this relationship for this kinda drama. He said he has feelings for me and doesn't want to get hurt in the long run, gives me my key and I leave. All totally reasonable, I mean, I don't blame him. 

&amp;nbsp;


So I'm left to piece together what just happened. The number was spoofed and is just a voice mail box when I call it. Probably a VoIP service. I first call my ""ex"" who lives across the country. (I moved away about a year ago) He was never my bf, we were close friends for a few years, and we messed around a bit early on, but near the end he said he had feelings for me, and I didn't feel the same way, and that was that. We hadn't talked in months, he isn't on any of my social media, it just doesn't make any sense. He is pretty hurt by the accusation, says he wants nothing to do with me, and we left things healthy between us, he would want me to be happy. The next day I called him again with my bf in the car to have him hear it first hand, and my bf said it's not the same voice as was on the phone. 

&amp;nbsp;

I really just can't think of anyone in my past who would want to hurt me like this. I haven't been able to sleep properly or eat in days, and I've been struggling to do my job. I feel like this is totally out of my control. I'm hurt that my bf doesn't believe me, but he says he's willing to work with me as a friend until I figure this out. I'm worried that the damage is done and that I won't ever find out who did this. 

&amp;nbsp;


So, I have a few theories, but nothing that checks all the boxes. 

Is it maybe a close friend of an ex that wants to pay for breaking their friend's heart? Perhaps they got an exaggerated story of how things went down. It's feels like overreaching though. I sound like a paranoid schizophrenic making claims like that.

Is it someone from one bad tinder date a year ago who I blocked?

There are a couple main issues here: 

&amp;nbsp;


**Knowledge of our relationship:**

Not a lot of people know about our relationship. I don't post couple pics on social media because I'm not out to all of my family and want to avoid the questions. He's been in a few instagram story posts, but not explicitly tagged. He has posted several pics of us together though, but his fb and instagram have always been on private. Someone would have to be paying extremely close attention to figure this out. Also to add to the unlikeliness, I'm not even very good looking. This is what makes me think it might be someone he knows.

&amp;nbsp;


**His phone number:**

It's not on any of his social media. Even to figure out his name from my instagram stories would take some effort. Then they would need to pay one of those online records places maybe to find it. I couldn't get his number with a google search. Again this leads me to think it has to be someone he knows.

&amp;nbsp;

**Motive:**

So it's made to look like someone is getting revenge on me (but for what?!?) for something horrible I must have done to them. Alternatively, I wonder if someone on his side doesn't like me, and wants to protect him from me. Perhaps they think I'm a bad influence, or perhaps they want him for themselves. Maybe I am getting in the way of his relationship with his best friend who I don't know so well. They talk on the phone for hours every week. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Timing:**

This is the biggest thing for me. Why now? Nothing has happened in my life recently to trigger this. He hasn't been in a insta story post in weeks. The only thing that's happened recently is that I met his best friend for the first time a little over a week ago. He lives a few hours drive away, they used to be roommates, and he is straight. He was very nice to me, had lots of questions about my life and my job. (might explain how the caller knew about my work trips, which btw are never to the same place twice) We hung out on a Friday and a Saturday, and the calls to my bf started on the Sunday. 


&amp;nbsp;

So this explains almost everything, and is honestly a bit of a weight off my shoulders. I can't rationalize how he would know the name of my ex from where I used to live though. I don't think I had ever even talked about him much to my bf. It's a fairly common guy's name, but it's too close to home to be a coincidence. I talked to my bf about this possibility (delicately), and he said he will keep an open mind, but can't get over the name part. It seems so unlikely. The guy has always been supportive of us, and said he was impressed by me after we met.

I have found several services online where you can pay someone 5 dollars to make any phone call you want and say anything, and make it look like it would come from any number, which could explain the voice. 


&amp;nbsp;

Then I take a step back and think I sound like a crazy person, and I'm accusing his friend of something which obviously appears to be skeletons in my closet. I just can't see it though. I'm pretty introverted, don't have a huge group of friends in my life, and I'm very conscious of the way I treat people and how they might feel. I feel like I'm driving myself crazy here because I'm so obsessed with this. I want to stop giving it control over me and get over it, but things won't be the same between us until I solve this. I want to say to him that if he doesn't trust me then I'm walking away, but I really really like this guy and want to fight as much as I can. He is giving this thing power when it is powerless, but I can't tell him what to believe.

This has really been psychologically devastating for me and I'm probably going to need counseling after this. Any advice would be amazing. You are already amazing for reading this far.

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: A phone call was made to my bf from a fake number saying that I'm a cheater and a liar. It's extremely strange and I have no idea what direction it's even coming from. If I was him I would also be shaken, but I feel like I don't have the means to repair this. I haven't done anything to make someone want to hurt me. It has taken over my life and I haven't been able to sleep, eat, or do my job properly in the last 4 days. I need an outsider's perspective. Thank you for reading.

"My (26F) boyfriend (27M) and I went on a road trip. About 5 hours into the drive (using my car), he told me he didn’t have any money to pay for the trip. He doesn’t see why that situation broke any trust I had with him about money.


Basically what I said in the title. Before the trip, we agreed he’d pay for the gas and I’d pay for the tolls. I guess I also assumed we’d go out to dinner or buy some snacks once in a while. He doesn’t understand why I don’t trust him with money anymore. A day into the trip, he received a small paycheque. I was happy because he finally had money. We went to walk around and went to some stores. I watched him buy a bunch of stuff. On the drive back from the trip, he told me he didn’t have that much left to pay for gas. I realized he had spent his entire paycheque on crap and didn’t think to save anything for the way home. 


How do I help him see that his behaviour hurts me? What can I say to him to wake him up?


tldr; My boyfriend isn’t responsible with money. He hates when I bring up budgeting because he feels I’m attacking him. I don’t trust him because of his past actions. How do I fix this?

"Girl [27f] just told me [30m] that she was madly in love with me after three dates. The trouble is, I'm madly in love with her as well. It's very out of character for me, but should I just go with it?


I'm probably among the most rational people on the planet so I feel like my head is spinning as I've never been in a situation like this before. 

Last Wednesday I was introduced to this girl Anna via mutual friends. We hit it off immediately and she asked me out for Friday. It was a whirlwind date that was fun and crazy and ended up with us driving up the mountains to watch the sun rise then sleeping at her house until the afternoon where we went out for dinner. It was probably the most fun I've ever had with another human. 

I went home late Saturday and we hung out again Sunday night. I had to go out of town on Monday so we hung out again last night and I spent the night at her place. This morning when I woke up she said that she missed me on the night I was gone and that she was falling madly in love with me. I gave her a lame ass non-commital response that I could tell hurt her feelings. I'm now sitting in my car in the parking lot of her condo thinking that I should just go knock on her door and tell her despite how crazy it is, that I'm falling in love with her as well. 

I know this sounds crazy but I've never had this much fun and felt as natural with another human being as I do with her. 


Should I go back and tell her that I love her as well? 


**tl;dr: A girl I've been on three dates with just told me she was falling in love with me. I feel the same way. Should I tell her I feel the same way despite it only being our third date?**"
"My (26/F) boyfriend (26/M) of five years is on a trip with with his guy friends and called me early this morning to say that he almost cheated on me last night.


First, we’ve known each other since the eighth grade. But we only started dating after uni. He’s not only my boyfriend, he’s also my best friend.

At first I remember I was hesitant to start dating him. I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. But there’s really no guy I’ve met who makes the feel the way he does. No one I trust as much and no one who has taken the time to really understand me. Suffice to say I changed my mind and decided to go for it. For years we haven’t had any massive arguments, just little disagreements here and there. Like who should wash the dishes and what movie we should watch on Netflix. No problems that you can’t fix. 

For that reason I’m really surprised by what he said to me this morning. He called me an hour ago, from the house where he’s staying on a guys trip. His brother is getting married, so they planned a hiking and fishing trip with the guys up in the interior of BC. We’re from Vancouver. It’s not that far from here. I answered the call half asleep, expecting him to tell me how the trip was going so far, what they were doing, etc. 

Instead he told me that they went out to a pub nearby for some drinks and that he’d met someone. A girl. He said she worked there and that she was really friendly and talkative, gave them suggestions as to what they could do while they were in town, etc. Still I suspected nothing. I just listened and nodded, said how nice she was for helping them and how you hardly find people like that in the city these days. 

Somewhere along the line he said she asked whether they were “doing anything later” and they said no. She then invited them to some sort of lakeside party. They went and had a good time meeting everyone. He saw her at the party, they got to talking again, just the two of them, and she asked if he has “anyone at home”. As in an SO of some sort. 

At this point it started to sink in. 

He asked me if I wanted to listen to the rest. I told him yes, surprised there was more to it. One thing that he knows about me is that I always want to know the full story. Don’t give me the short version. Especially if I’m involved somehow. 

Basically he said that he has a girlfriend, to which this girl expressed disappointment. She asked why he was talking to her if he has a girlfriend and he said “talking is okay”. The girl then asked, “What else is okay?” He said he blanked for a few seconds, piecing together in his head exactly what she was referring to. After a few moments he asked, “What are you getting at?” just to make sure. She then leaned in for a kiss and he didn’t immediately back away. 

He said their lips didn’t touch. But he did freeze for a second there. Not long after he left her there and told one of the guys what happened. They left. He was told by them to sleep on it before he talks to me. Nothing actually happened. He backed away before they had actually kissed. But he still made a series of decisions that night that he knew he shouldn’t have. 

He said that he’d have called me right away had it not been the middle of the night. To be fair he did text me last night asking if I was awake. I wasn’t. So he waited until morning. 

After apologizing repeatedly, he asked me how I felt. I told him that I didn’t know how I should feel yet. I still don’t. On the one hand he backed off before any true cheating had occurred, but then on the other hand he knew exactly what he was doing. I appreciate that he backed off in the last second but honestly it shouldn’t have even reached the point where he had to back off. 

I got off the phone with him, told him to stay there for the rest of the trip. He initially wanted to come home. I guess because he’d nearly made the worst decision of our relationship, and wanted to see me to know we would be okay. But I don’t really know whether that’s the case quite yet. 

Maybe I’m just being dramatic. I don’t know. I’d never put myself in a position where I’m talking to a random guy all night, leading him on, etc. I believe every word of what he said. I don’t think he actually cheated and I know the friend he told, would never cover for anyone either way. I’ve known this friend just as long. 

Anyway, that’s what happened. 

I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do or how to go about handling this. He said he loves me and that what happened has nothing to do with a lack of love or feeling as though something in our relationship is missing. I want to believe that, but there *must* be some subconscious reason as to why he let it get that far. You don’t just do shit like that out of nowhere. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but this is truly the last thing I expected from him. 

Where do we go from here? What does this mean? 

**tl;dr** He met some random girl at a pub, talked to her all night, and then nearly kissed her after already telling her that he has a girlfriend at home. Once it all clicked, he realized what he was doing and removed himself from the situation. I’m in shock. I know that he didn’t actually cheat in terms of touch, but he did make a series of decisions that he knew he shouldn’t have made. I’m glad he told me what happened. I just don’t know what to do now.

"I (32M) have a weird relationship with my wife (36F) and it is killing me


Here comes a wall of text:

My wife had wanted to open up our relationship so she could experiment with her feelings toward women. I was okay with this as long as she was not looking to end her love with me, which she was not. (Mind you she did cheat on me two year ago with a woman I found out later about). This time she was upfront about it.

So September of last year she started this relationship with another woman who she knew felt the same. They are now in love, I slowly became ignored and as of the end of January I told her I wanted to get a divorce as it is clear she no longer cares for me, which she agreed and believes she is a lesbian. We have two kids. 

At first I was fine with her being gone most nights, as she had a significant other, and I did not. We both work 40 hours a week, but over the last 5 months, it has turned into me taking the kids to everything they have going on, cooking every dinner, the sole cleaner of the house and of all affairs (bill paying, family things etc.) She has had since January and has not moved out yet. She is gone almost every night and I get 1, maybe 2 nights out a week if she hasn't already planned something.  If I bring up her moving out, she loses it and starts crying. I am mentally and physically exhausted and at my wits end. I don't want the kids to see me being hard on their mother, my parent's divorce was messy and awful and led to a falling out with my father.  

I dont have enough money for a therapist for myself, after making sure my kids get the help they need for sorting out their feelings on the divorce. Everyone seems happy, my kids are getting used to the idea, my wife is happier then she has ever been with her new love, and I am so miserable, I dont want to leave the house, and my wife cannot afford it on her own, but I know if I leave that it might make it harder for me to get it during the divorce (which we agreed to just have a mediator). 

TL;DR: Wife has a happy life with her girlfriend while I remain her financeer, butler, maid, child care, etc."
"Should I (18F) ask my best and only friend (18M) if I can give him oral sex


I’ll try to make this not too long. So I just graduated HS as did my best friend well call him Jake. We’ve been best friends since we were in first grade when my family moved next door to his, where we both still live. We hang out pretty much every day and we’re pretty much each other’s only real friend. We’re both kind of shy and socially awkward. Neither of us have ever done anything sexually together or with others. We talk about sex, like about what we’d like to do, famous people we have crushes on, it’s kind of like girl talk and guy talk together I guess? 

But I’m 18 now and never even kissed a boy and you know I want to start doing stuff. I thought about tinder but I’m afraid of like ending up chopped up in some guys basement. But also, I think it would be perfect if Jake would like to do stuff with me. He’s attractive but until a few days ago I never thought of him that way really, maybe a couple times. 

I’ve thought about what if he wants to have a relationship like romantically and I’m ok with that but I’m also ok with just having fun too. Like I picture us being friends forever, so why not lovers too? 

But then part of me thinks it’s a bad idea. But I’m just so interested in just even giving a blowjob that I was thinking maybe I could ask him if I could do that and see where it goes? Like right now I can’t see a downside but when I’m not thinking about sex it seems like it could go wrong. He’s coming over tonight to watch wrestling which is our usual Monday night activity and I’ve got such an urge to do it. 

**tldr should I ask my best and only friend if I can give him a blowjob instead of going on tinder or should leave him be as a friend and find someone else?**"
"Found out my (27M) wife (26F) hid a large amount of money because she didn’t want to share it with me. Should I say something?


Throwaway. 

I have been with my wife for 5 years, married for 2. She comes from a well-off family while I grew up in somewhere middle class. We didn’t have any differences or arguments over finances, lifestyle or anything related to our backgrounds. Recently, I found out from a very reliable source that my wife, who was back then my fiancee, told her parents to not put the $1.5 mil she was supposed to get in her name because she didn’t want to enter the marriage with the money, knowing it would technically become “ours”. I don’t know what she ultimately did with the money. This source also told me that wife never takes her earnings from the business into her name for the same reason. Apparently she somehow puts the money into her parents accounts so in case of a divorce or whatever, she can say there’s nothing to her name to share. Wife currently works for her parents’ businesses and wr share life expenses 50/50 but don’t have joint finances. 

I haven’t talked to her about this and I don’t know if I should. It is technically her choice and she has all the rights to protect her money. But I cannot stop feeling hurt. I feel like my wife sees me as a gold digger going after her money. Just to be clear, I did nothing to even hint at such thing. How should I tackle this? 

TL;DR: wife fears I might run away with her money"
"My [15 F] mom [37 F] is mad because I burned my journal and paintings after I caught her snooping.


My mom always snooped in my stuff, reading notes my friends wrote me in school if I brought them home and stuff like that. And she looks through my trash for drawings and paintings I make but don't like enough to keep, because she wants them. She also looks in my art portfolio all the time even though I tell her that's private. Recently I thought my mom might be reading my journal. So to check, I tied a long hair around it and saw that the next week the hair was broken.

I was really mad, and I didn't want my mom treating everything I write and draw like her business anymore. So I took all my journals and my art portfolio to the fire pit outside and burned them. I was upset that I wouldn't have some of the memories I'd made written down anymore, but I thought it was worth it for my privacy. And a lot of my drawings were old and I can do better now.

My mom asked me a few days later where all my art and journals went, and I said ""Why were you looking for them, I told you they are private."" She just assumed I hid them or something.

Yesterday, she saw some of the metal rhinestones from my journal, and the metal clasp from my art portfolio in the firepit ashes, and realized that I'd burned everything. She blew up at me, saying I'd regret throwing away those memories, childhood memories are precious. And she was even madder about my art portfolio because I was going to use it to submit pieces to competitions and also apply for a summer program. And maybe even use it for college.

I just kept asking her why it was any of her business, and asking her if she'd read my journal. She wouldn't answer me.

She just keeps getting mad about it, like when she was reminded of the art program i won't get into in the fall, or for no reason at all.

I told her I don't care about the art program as much as i care about having privacy to express myself. 

I don't know what to do now. I don't think she'll leave this be.

TLDR - My mom is furious with me for burning my journals and art because she snoops in it all the time and read my journal"
"I'm [29f] worried that my boyfriend [28/m] may be turning in to a jerk.


My boyfriend has a STEM job that for the most part he is very happy with. Through his job he travels frequently and is able to afford nice things such as a couple of sports cars.


When I first met my boyfriend he was a great friend. Polite, humble, maybe even a bit shy. I've noticed over the past several months that he has been saying things that indicate he may be losing touch with his humility.


A few examples of this behavior include:


- eating dinner at a Taco Bell one evening we saw a sign that said ""start you're career at Taco Bell today"" and he started talking about how pathetic that was.

- I used a silly word (can't remember what it was) and said I thought it was funny and I wanted to use the word more frequently. He rolled his eyes and told me he couldn't use that word at his job because he works with mature adults.

- one day out of the blue he started talking about how he was considered a professional in his job but that the world does not view people like me as a professional

- he frequently talks very badly about people who live in the suburbs, and stay at home SUV driving soccer mom types


When he says these sorts of things it makes me feel like he is arrogant and also makes me feel bad about myself. I have talked to him about this a few times and his response is always just ""I won't think I'm better than anyone else. Just different"".


How much of this is my own insecurity? Am I over reacting?


I'm not sure if this is relevant but I manage a large resort, earn about 65k a year, and evenly split the cost of everything we do (rent, dates, etc). He grew up ""middle of nowhere"" poor and I grew up ""suburban"" poor

**TL;DR: boyfriend keeps making comments about other's lifestyle and his status/ occupation that make me feel bad about myself and make him sound like a jerk**"
"3 healthy boys, and my wife is obsessed with trying for the girl... I don't know what to do


We have 3 healthy boys, ages 5, 6, and 8. We are both early 30's in age. I am a medical resident. My wife is obsessed with having a girl and wants to do IVF gender selection to get one, and promises she will never be happy without having a girl. To her it's not if, but when. She absolutely has to have one. She has promised that nothing can fill the void in her life except a baby girl. I have 3 siblings who all have at least a boy and a girl, and she is insanely jealous. My sister had a daughter yesterday and my wife sobbed the whole way home from the hospital and all night long. She can't be happy for them. While I can understand a longing to have a girl, as I have also wanted a girl, I can't understand the mentality that we must have one. I can't understand why she can't be happy with what we have. While there is potential that having another baby would be a disaster a number of reasons, I can also see how it might add joy to our family. But it needs to ADD joy, not be the source of joy. We need to find the joy now. It's offensive that my boys and I aren't enough for her. It's insane to me that we would have another child out of jealousy. I'm also extremely hesitant to have a child because now we finally have our life back. Medical school with 3 children was insane. Life is getting better now and I don't want to start over. But again, if we can find the joy now, I can maybe see adding to it.

She has depression and anger management issues. Kids in medical school wasn't easy, but things were rough even before we had kids. Ever since she started taking prozac 3 years ago, things have been a bit better in that regard, but not perfect. She wanted to stop taking prozac 5 months ago and stopped on her own accord, and things were terrible with her depression and anger. She threatened divorce and I called her on it, agreeing we should separte unless she both restarted her meds and we went to couples therapy. She agreed, and is back on the meds. We went to 6 sessions. I tried discussing the above with her solo and at counseling, it never goes well. The last couple of sessions ended poorly because the therapist agreed in some form with my opinion that jealousy isn't a valid reason to have a child, which made her feel ganged up on, attacked, and she refuses to go back.

We are in the process of freezing embryos. I have told her I am willing to harvest eggs and freeze embryos so that she can stop worrying about her biologic clock, but this does not mean I am agreeing to having another baby. I have told her it's a stopgap measure so she doesn't go insane, and in the next several years if things don't markedly improved with our family life and her mental health, there is no chance I will ever agree to having the additional child.

For context, here is something she texted me when she was angry about me trying to discuss her jealousy with her.

"" If you don't want me to have a baby. Let's get a divorce. End of discussion. I am not letting you decide for me. I am fine raising her by myself if need to. If you refuse to give me your sperm, i will find a doner. I love you but you are not going to stop me this time. I am sick of your trying to talk me out. Everything else is fine. But I know what I want and I am not stopping until I get it. Whatever takes.""

She apologized for those remarks and said she didn't mean it. She said that kind of language will never happen again. I am doubtful though.

Am I wrong to say that we must find happiness now and that she must balance her mental health before we consider having another baby? What am I not seeing? I am thinking of giving her an ultimatum that she must engage in many months of individual psychotherapy before I can even consider having another child. She has always refused personal mental health therapy. I don't want that to come across as a sort of threat or blackmail though. But I do think it needs to happen. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think she will ever be willing to try couples therapy again.

 \---  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Is it unreasonable for me to both want my wife to be happy now with our family of 3 boys and to resolve her mental health issues before we consider IVF gender selection and have another daughter? If so, what to I do?"
"I [26m] was just on a lunch date with a girl [28f] that works in my building. She left with another guy. What in the hell just happened? Do I even bother trying to find out?


Background: I work in an engineering firm that has a small office in a large office building. Two doors down from us is a physical therapy office. Although I'm an engineer, I kind of work at the ""front"" desk of this office and I can see into the hallway through the glass door. Every day like clockwork a very attractive girl about my age walks past my door at least 4 times a day. We had gotten into this pattern where we would just give a friendly wave and smile. This lasted for two months or. 

Out of the blue last week I got a call at my desk saying ""hi, I hope you don't think I'm psycho but I'm the girl you've been waving at for the past few months. I googled your firms name and I'm so glad you answered because I left my building keys inside which are attached to my car keys and since it's after hours I can't get in. Would you let me in?"" (of course that's not it exactly but you get the idea). I did and then her office was locked so she had to wait for her supervisor to come down and unlock her office so I let her wait next to my desk and we actually had a very nice conversation. 

It turns out we have a lot in common, we are both from Southern California, we both went to schools in our new state, we have similar hobbies (surfing being the big one) and we both are huge fans of the comedian Jim Norton and Chip Chipperson. Oh and we're both big fans of sushi. 

So instead of just waving for the last two weeks, she would pop open my door and do a ""Chip"" joke (to most people these aren't funny, I admit but if you're a Chip Chipperson fan, it's like the ultimate inside joke) and she was cracking me up every day. I really began to look forward to seeing her. 

Yesterday, when she popped her head in I said ""we should go get some raw fish or sumpthin'"" (again, a Chip joke that most people won't or even shouldn't get) and she said yes.

So today we went to lunch at this really awesome, hole in wall Sushi place and I thought we were having an awesome time. We had some serious laughs and talked some more. Towards the end of lunch she noticed a guy that she knew sitting at the bar, who honestly appeared to be in his early 50s. She got up and talked with him and came back and all she said was ""this is so crazy, I haven't seen my friend over there in a few years. Do you mind if he gives me a ride back?"" I said no I didn't mind at all (I really did mind, maybe that's petty). She reached over to give me a hug which made it all the more confusing because that was our first physical contact ever. Then to make it even more confusing, apparently she paid for everything, including the tip on her way out. I ended up sitting there for an extra 20 minutes waiting for the bill to come over not realizing that she had already paid. 

What in the hell just happened? Did I get ditched for a much older guy? Was she just being super rude? Should I have asserted myself and said that I actually mind a lot that she left.  Did she really just see an old friend? What do I make of her paying for the meal?

Should I even bother to find out what went wrong? Or should I just say our playful banter through my glass door is as far as a relationship as we will ever have?


As you can probably assume, I don't have a lot of experience dating different girls. I had the same girlfriend from 10th grade until grad school and haven't been with anyone since so I really appreciate any help. 

thank you. 

**tl;dr: girl I was on a lunch date with left with another guy. What just happened to me? Should I follow up with her and figure out just happened or should I just let it go?**

"I [37F] went no contact with my brother[35M] 3 years ago. My family thinks I'm unreasonable to insist on maintaining it. Am I?


My brother and I do not get along. He holds grudges from childhood he won't explain and generally treats me with contempt. He routinely tries to negatively impact my life, by spreading rumors to our family and has even contacted my friends and dates in attempts to ruin the relationships. 

I cut him out of my life as completely as I could. We don't stay in touch, he lives on the other side of the country, theres no family relationship there at all. If we run into each other at a family event I am polite and civil and so is he.

He got married a few years ago to a lovely woman. If she weren't my brothers wife I like to think we'd be friends. But since she did marry him I haven't pursued a relationship with her at all. No matter how nice she is, she's still married to a man who does his best to negatively impact my life. By extension, I've also avoided becoming anything but casual acquaintances with her family. And thats where my family is starting to give me a hard time.

They don't understand the levels of anxiety my brother can spark in me. He thinks I'm the favorite or the golden child and that angers him. The man went so far as to contact my therapist at one point to accuse me of faking mental illness. He tried to convince my husband I'd cheated on him a week before my wedding, apparently in response to my refusal to invite him. I had to hire security to keep him away from the celebration.

I do not want this man in my life. I don't want relationships with the people who are close to him because he manages to cause enough drama with what he hears from his own family. I don't want a friendship with a member of his wifes family to give him more ammunition. Is that unreasonable? Or am I letting my family put too much pressure on me to smile and suck it up some more?

tl;dr Family is pressuring me to become closer to my estranged brothers wifes family. Am I being too stubborn about it?"
"Update! A guy [24M] I'm [25F] seeing stood me up today.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ro0cp/a_guy_24m_im_24f_seeing_stood_me_up_today_and_i

I said I'd update if I ever heard from him again, and I did! Even though my first post didn't get a ton of comments, I like posting here to get things off my chest and hear different opinions, which is what I was doing last time. 

Well I heard from him, and he basically said he was sorry and had a really bad day and was really stressed and he stopped replying to everyone so he could get things done. 

He doesn't really seem sorry. It doesn't that that long to send a text saying something came up, I can't make it, I'll explain later, I'm sorry. And I would have been understanding if that were the case. Instead, he just blew me off because he was having a bad day, which in turn, caused me to have some bad days too. 

On top of it all, he decided to finally text me back today ON MY BIRTHDAY which I told him about not that long ago. He probably didn't remember because he probably doesn't give a shit but I called him out on that too. 

So happy birthday to me I guess... I don't see this going anywhere if he can't communicate something that simple and if he thinks it's okay to treat me like that. And if it was something bigger than just a bad day, he's not telling me so I can only work with what he gave me. I would probably understand more if there was some big emotional event. It sucks because I thought we really clicked. But hey, I'm used to this shit so whatever. 

Tl;dr: he stood me up because he had a bad day. I'm over it if he can't communicate better than that."
"UPDATE: My (31M) friend (25F) is suddenly flirting with me and showing interest in me, but I think it’s only because she was rejected by someone else


Original Post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ifnp0/my\_31m\_friend\_25f\_is\_suddenly\_flirting\_with\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ifnp0/my_31m_friend_25f_is_suddenly_flirting_with_me/)

So after taking into consideration the comments from the original post, I initially decided to not pursue anything with Nicole.  As I had stated, she had suddenly become flirtatious with me and started inviting me to places alone immediately after the guy she was interested in got a girlfriend.  I was concerned about a rebound situation (and that wasn’t the only factor involved).  I decided I would lay low and not encourage her (for lack of a better word).  What’s funny though is that after I turned down her invitation to a baseball game, she had stopped that behavior and our interactions had become normal again.

I went to an amusement park last weekend with some of the same friends, and Nicole was there.  At one point we had all ridden a roller coaster.  I wanted to immediately ride again, and Nicole was the only one who joined me.  When the 2nd ride ended, the others had kind of disappeared and were doing their own thing (I don’t know for sure, but I can’t help but think this wasn’t a coincidence).  Nicole and I spent the next two hours going on rides, grabbing a bite to eat, talking about life a little bit ... and something just clicked.  

I had suggested we get on the ferris wheel before meeting back up with the others … You can probably guess where this is heading.  I know I was reluctant about doing anything with Nicole for several reasons, but at that moment it was like “fuck it”.  When we reached the top of the ferris wheel, we kissed.

We had all left soon after; we both played it cool as if nothing happened.  I texted her the next day about meeting up for dinner, which was last night. At one point the conversation steered toward Kyle.  She admitted she was interested in him, but it became clear to her that despite our friends trying to set them up, he was into this other girl.  She said more than anything she was down on herself because she’s only ever had one serious boyfriend, and Kyle was in essence another rejection because he never made any moves or asked her out.  She revealed that she always “liked” me, but that the timing was never right and after a while it seemed like we were “friendzoned”.  I failed to mention in the original post that when I met Nicole two years ago, I had a girlfriend, and that relationship lasted another 7-8 months.  Nicole had dated others during the last year, whereas I had mostly taken a break and focused on other things.  Hence the “timing” issue.  

I don’t know where this will end up.  We had a fun day at the park and dinner last night was great.  I was concerned I was the ""backup option"" and who knows, maybe I am, but I've decided it's worth a longer look.  I do think she is beautiful and quirky and somewhat awkward, but in an endearing way (she reminds me of Holly Flax from The Office).  You only live once, right?  

tl:dr Friend who was into another guy suddenly shows interest in me after a rejection from someone else.  Initially decided to not pursue it.  Met up with her last weekend and had a great time, have begun dating."
"I overheard my mom talking with my step dad and she said I was a mistake/she never wanted to have me. She told him how I ruined her life and youth. I’m having a hard time trusting her and interacting with her


I [16M] am having a hard time talking let alone look my mom [37F] in the eyes. I don’t live with my dad, he is in prison and we live with my stepdad [38M] and my half sister [14F]. When we lived with my dad I was going through hell with family problems with abuse and stuff like that. I feel like the only person that actually cared about me was my grandma, I was her favorite grandson and she treated me like a child. A thig to know is my stepdad really hates me, my father also left me for dead and said he didn’t love me. Through all this I started being depressed and my mom took me to the doctors and they took a test on me and it turns out I have am severely clinically depressed.

My mom and stepdad were arguing about something in the middle of the night, I went to go use the bathroom and they were talking really loud, I heard my mom bring up when I was born, she told my step dad I ruined her youth and that she tried to get an abortion or something and it didn’t work. She also told him she didn’t love me and I wasn’t a good enough kid and that she was tired of having to be a mother for me. She also told my step dad that I was “baggage” which she wish she didn’t have and that she regreted having me with my father. I probably shouldn’t have heard that. I snuck back to my room and I had a really difficult time falling asleep or doing anything. Lately I have been distant with my mom, I can’t really eat or sleep and I can’t get my mind off of what I heard. I am basically ruining our relationship. Any advice on what I should do?

TL:DR: my mom said she doesn’t love me and that I ruined her life and I constantky think about it"
"My [36f] wife wants me [37m] to move past [35m] brotgervin law making inappropriate pass at her, and I'm not sure I can.


A few months ago my brother in law made a pass at my wife, told her he wanted to kiss her.  From what I gather he was grooming her, lots of stories but about how poorly he was being treated at home, how his wife didn't get him.  He was the one initiating contact as my wife showed me the texts and explained she was just listening and being a friend.  Call logs also backed up that he was the one calling.  He also made multiple efforts to meet up alone with the kids, which my wife declined.  

 My wife was floored and came home and immediately told me.  My BIL texted her to just forget about it and to not tell anyone.  Next time I saw him I told him I knew(didn't gice any details though)and didn't appreciate him trying to break up my family, I said nothing else...hevsaid nothing, walked away and I haven't spoken to him since.  Well, right after he called my wife crying claiming I was going to tell his wife and that it would destroy them.  My wife told me not to say anything to my sister in law so I didn't.  I cannot stand the sight of him knowing he was willing to destroy my kids lives, I have zero respect for him and have no desire to ever speak to him again.  My wife claims that my actions are noticeable and that her family will think something is wrong and that I should break the ice and forgive him.  

She keeps commenting that I can't act like this forever and that my actions are going to run her relationship with her sister.  I explained that my actions are not the issue but rather our brother in law's inappropriate actions.  I further explained that he had so little respect for my kids and I that he was willing to break up my family, he is pure scum.  Wife gets upset and keeps asking I start talking to him and go on like everything is ok.  I don't think I can do this, what should I do.

TLDR: brother in law told my wife he wanted to kiss her, I stopped talking to him and wife wants me to forgive him and start talking. I'm not ready and don't view it as an innocent mistake but an attack on my family. Not sure how to handle."
"My (24F) sister (28F) is dating a convicted murderer


Using a throw away account because I don't want my sister to find this.

To preface, my sister is a 28 year old extremely successful women. She is a nurse practioner, works at one of the top hospitals in my state and brings in roughy 140k per year. 

About six years ago, my mother reconnected with some old high school friends on facebook. One of these friends has a son, who has been in jail since he was 19 for second degree murder and was sentence to 20 years to life. My mother mentioned this to both my sister and I. My mom said it would be nice to write him a letter to let him know that people were praying for his well being. I declined, however my sister did begin writing to him (we will call him B). My sister wrote B about five-ish times per year, nothing serious. During this six year period my sister dated a ton of guys. She is one of those girls that gets really obsessive and possessive and she really turned a lot of guys off. For about a year, until June of 2016, she was dating this real asshat that she claimed to be madly in love with (as she did with every single guy she dated). She actually broke things off with him, which shocked and delighted me. My sister told me she was taking a break from men because she really hadn't been ""single"" since she was 17, which made me very happy.

In October 2016, I went to my sister's house because she wanted to talk to me about something very important. During this visit, my sister explained to me that she had begun dating B. I was baffled. I freaked out, I was confused and upset. I told her this wasn't a good idea. My sister insisted that she loved him and has been in love with him since she was 23 years old. I was not in anyway supportive and I told her she needed to talk to a therapist because this made no rational sense. We didn't really talk until Chirstmas of that year.

Almost two years later, she is still dating B. Keep in mind, this is not a ""Making a Murderer"" situation. B is in prison for what he did. He helped a friend lure another man into the friend's garage, while the friend stabbed him 16 times. B than helped decapitate the man while he was still alive and proceeded to burn his body. They dropped the dead body in an undeleveloped local subdivision and threw the head in a body of water at a nearby park. This sickens me. It makes me want to vomit. My sister said he's changed, that he feels guilty for what he did. I can't get passed it.

Not only does my sister say that B is the love her life (which she has said about the past 4 men she's dated) but that he is the most intelligent person she knows. This is complete crap. All B does is read books and spews out what he reads and claims the ideas as his own thoughts. My sister said he is writing a book about his life and she thinks he will be famous one day.

B is not even elgible for parole for 10 more years. That means my sister will be 38 years old when he gets out and she doesn't care. She even recently bought a house and is painting it in his favorite colors so it can be ready for him when he gets out. She has even mentioned marrying him in jail if it will help his chance for parole.

I am at a complete loss. I have been silently dealing with this for the past two years. I have not told my friends because I'm too ashamed. The only people that know are my parents and brother...we all feel the same.

Does anyone have any advice? I love my sister so much and I want a relationship with her but I don't know how much more I can hear about him before I explode.

TL;DR my sister is dating a convicted murderer. "
"I (31f) am starting to resent my SO (30m) for something he has no control over.


We have been together since we were 19. We now have two children, who are 9 and 7. I carry most of the weight in the relationship. I have the better job, I do most of the up keep with the kids and house, I manage the finances.. even after asking him to contribute more of his attention to them. It is what it is at this point, and I have accepted this.

Here is what is causing us grief. About 5 years ago, he was addicted to Percocet. It was destroying us. He did finally seek help in the form of Suboxone. Flash forward to now, he is still taking Suboxone. I don't ever to claim to understand what it is like to have an addiction problem, so it is on him to work through this at his own pace. But I won't lie, I've asked before if he should still be on them. He has been on them longer than he was the Percocet.

Basically 6 months ago his insurance decided to not pay for them anymore. He submitted an appeal through them. They rejected it. Then he was told to reappeal it, which supposedly he has. He says there has been all these issues with the reappeal, like missing paperwork, sending it to the wrong department, and so on. This has left us paying out the bum for his Suboxone. 

I have been working over to help cover the cost while he has done little. He still spends money like nothing is straining us. This ignorance comes from him not being involved in our finances. I tell him precisely how much money we have and where it is going, but he either ""forgets"" or just sees the number in the bank and assumes we are good.. idk. 

Well a week ago, he finally talked to his doctor about other medications he could try. There is one, and it only costs $10 a month. Doctor prescribes for this month. He takes it for a day and says it doesn't work. He calls the doctor; the doctor can't prescribe him Suboxone due to already having a month prescription of Subutex. 

He flips out. Acts just like he did all those years ago. Worrying about withdrawing. He even threatened to relapse. He then proceeds to go buy some Suboxone, for twice the amount of money we were paying for them, without talking to me first. Then tells me it is what he had to do.

At this point, I see no end in sight. I am exhausted from it all, physically from working over and mentally from dealing with everything. I don't know what to do. I am no longer happy. Our relationship is failing because of something that he had little control over.

TL;DR; : Paying too much for medication due to insurance not covering it, and it is ruining our relationship."
"Me [24F] with my sisters [28F] husband [27 M] of eight years; he announced my pregnancy, excludes my family from events, but insists on visiting my child. Sister won't do anything about it, should I confront him about his behavior?


 My (24F) older sister's (28F) husband (27m) announced my pregnancy two years ago, after he was explicitly asked to say nothing. He's never apologised, which is unsurprising as he's never liked me and has often shown it. We now have very little to do with each other, and I like it that way.

The problem is my sister now asks if she and her husband can visit us to see my child, despite knowing that her husband dislikes me. He seems to think he's done nothing wrong and is entitled to visit; visits where he awkwardly ignores my partner and I and tries to play with our child. We don't allow him to see us often.

My Sister thinks this is normal behavior and doesn't call him out on anything. Sister believes we are also not allowed to call him out, and must pretend we enjoy the visits and play nice. We do this to keep her happy, as she has led us to believe he will take it out on her if we speak up (not physically, he likes to ignore her when he's upset).

A while ago, her husband threw himself a huge party which he invited my whole family to, except for my partner and I. Some months later he asked to visit us again, without mentioning the party and acting as though he's done nothing wrong.

Now, I don't care about the lack of invite, we wouldn't have gone anyway. I care about the fact that my sister lets her husband treat us this way and then urges us to say nothing. Why would a grown man need his feelings protected?

I've had enough of playing nice with this man. Should I go against my sisters wishes and ask her husband why he still wants to visit us when he obviously has some kind of problem with me, or should I start holding my sister accountable for her husbands actions?

**TL;DR Should I ask my sisters husband why he feels the need to visit us when he obviously doesn't like me?**"
"My [35m] wife [33] has been in contact with her high school ex on Facebook. Likely will cheat. How do I save my marriage.


So to get straight to it, I accessed her account and actually read a few messages between the two of them. This has happened over the course of a few weeks. She has admitted to talking to him on Facebook to me before but also said they were done talking. 

About two weeks ago, she admitted that while I was away for the night she got drunk and lonely and actually called him on the phone. She told me they only talked for 25 minutes but this wasn’t true because we had a massive phone bill and it turns out she talked to him for an hour. She down played the content of the conversation but also felt terrible for the situation. 

Last night I was away again, and I knew that she was drinking and alone. I actually signed in to her Facebook and read a conversation where she was asking him to fly out to visit later this summer. Told him to keep it quiet. Then they each admitted that they had never stopped loving each other. I feel like a piece of shit because I totally violated her trust and right to privacy for reading these messages. However, what the fuck??

We’ve been married for 10 years and have two kids together. Her ex was talking about how it’s important that she takes the kids when she leaves me. 

There are so many other little details and my mind is spinning. I don’t know what to do. What to admit to. How to deal with this. I just got home tonight and we didn’t have much time to talk. She didn’t admit to anything. 

On one hand I feel like she was drunk and lonely so I get that she wasn’t acting with a level head. And those messages were not for me to read. On the other hand I don’t want my marriage, family, and life destroyed and I am really hurt. I don’t believe her when she tells me she loves me anymore. 

Where do I even start?? To top it off I’m gone tomorrow for another 24 hours for work and he’s suggested they talk again. I think she’ll do it. 

Help! 

**tl;dr I broke my wife’s trust and snooped her messages, turns out my gut was right and she’s talking to her ex about their love for each other. We’ve got kids. I’m destroyed.**"
"My [22 M] girlfriend [23 F] of over a year has made a habit of locking her keys in her car and I'm not sure if it's accidental


So, as the title states my girlfriend has made a habit of locking her keys in her car. What makes me say it's a habit, you may ask? Well this has happened 5 times in the past month. A few of those times, in my mind, have been at very suspicious times so I'll go ahead and run them down:

&gt;The first time was after she finished working her delivery job and left her keys in her car after coming up to the apartment.

&gt;The second time happened much the same as the first.

&gt;The third time happened while she was working the delivery job. I had told her since I got off work when she started that I was going to hang out with my roommate and smoke while we watched a movie (she claims that I never told her this, but I specifically remember telling her what I was going to do and when). She called me in a panic that she had locked her keys in her car in some persons driveway that she had just delivered to and was calling to get me to pick her up until someone could unlock her car. I told her that I wasn't able to because my roommate and I had just smoked and I got in contact with her friend to try and help her. This really pissed her off because she claimed I never told her and told me I shouldn't be doing those things while she's working because she may need me. When she said that it made me think that maybe this whole locking-her-keys-in-her-car thing may not be accidental after all, but I never pressured her or ask her about it.

&gt;The fourth time it was my roommate and I, her friend and her hanging out at my apartment drinking and playing video games for the evening/night. Again, she was working her delivery job and came to the apartment as soon as she finished. There was a charging cable that I needed from her car so after everyone was done drinking for the night I asked for her keys to go get it, but surprise, her keys were left in the ignition in front of my apartment building which isn't the nicest of neighborhoods. I stayed up most of the night with her waiting for someone to come and unlock the car.

&gt;The fifth and final time (as of this posting) was right before we were going to the airport to go visit my grandmother for her 80th birthday. I got a call from her saying, ""Guess what I did again?"" and after I got mad and hung up, she started texting me making sure I knew she didn't keep doing this on purpose, but now I'm not so sure. She eventually got her car unlocked and came back and we made it to the airport with 20 minutes to spare, but all of this just doesn't sit right with me. 

The last three times specifically, something in the back of my brain has said that her locking her keys in her car may not be an accident. It's such an odd behavior to have, and I can come up with some reasons to why it keeps happening -mainly that it is always during or after her delivery job, but the way she has either talked about the incidents or apologized for them makes me feel like she may be doing this on purpose. Or at least the last few times have been on purpose.

This isn't normal behavior right? And even if it is, what should I be doing about it?

tldr; My gf has locked her keys in her car 5 times now and her actions and choice of words makes me feel like it might be on purpose."
"[UPDATE] My (20F) Creepy Uncle (50sM) made advances at me, now he's coming to visit and I don't know how to handle the situation


Previous Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8r1t5l/my\_20f\_creepy\_uncle\_50sm\_made\_advances\_at\_me\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8r1t5l/my_20f_creepy_uncle_50sm_made_advances_at_me_now/)

A few people replied to my original post but I could really do with your advice again.

So when I posted originally I had no intention whatsoever of telling my Mum, I just wanted advice on how to enforce my boundaries in a way that won't rock the boat. But every single reply pointed out why I should be telling my Mum and I kinda started to agree after keeping it to myself for so long. I don't really wanna be bearing this burden anymore.

I took the weekend to think about it and prepare myself and on Monday, I told my Dad  (parents are divorced) basically for support and to hopefully make more sense of it as he knows my uncle well. I told him start to finish including his intrusive messages etc.

Boyyyyy I did not expect what he said. He said that I need to think of the bigger picture and not just myself. If I tell my Mum she won't be able to forgive my uncle and it will lead to fall outs with their other siblings, my uncles marriage will break down, the upcoming trip will be cancelled, the family has been through a lot already.

I did say (which you guys convinced me is true now) that none of that is my fault, he should have thought of all of that but he didn't so why should I be holding it together for him, lying to my Mum etc. I said yeah I can make excuses for his trip but that means 5 days of lying and alienating myself from my Mum while he gets to carry on without any impact or consequences. I don't see why I should have to lie and cover and carry the weight of this entire fucking thing for the rest of my life.

My Dad's view is, ""unfortunately there is men like that (so that makes it ok lol). they don't care as long as they can have sex. He's not a pedophile, you're an adult now and sometimes the right thing to do is the one that's right for the most people"" I understand he's not a pedophile and yes I am an adult but it's still inappropriate and wrong, especially seeing as he has watched me grow since I WAS a child.

I got upset discussing it so I left, and he rang me again to talk about it and I said tbh I wish I hadn't told you because I thought you'd have my back and have my best interests at heart. His reply was if you did tell your Mum, she will say that she'd rather have known, however it's HIS opinion that I shouldn't tell her due to the fallout although he would support me if I did want to. He said I need to ""weigh it up"".

I feel like he's given me a massive influence with a very strong opinion but then said ""but it's your choice"" meaning you can make that decision if you want to but it's the wrong one.

I honestly just feel so disappointed in him and now I just feel so fucking trapped in this situation. It just doesn't feel fair and now I don't know what to do even more :(

**TLDR: Asked my Dad for support in telling my Mum about Creepy Uncle, Dad said (in a nutshell) put up and shut up**"
"My [M22] friend [M22] walked in on my GF [F21] in the shower. He says it was an accident but I’m having trouble believing him and it’s stressing me out.


Title says a lot of it but there’s obviously more to it. Sorry if this is long. I’m just confused.

Basically, my friends, gf, and I all on break for school so we head up to my family’s beach house for the weekend for drinks and hanging out. There were 8 of us total and my gf of 3.5 years was a bit of an outsider since everyone else had known each other since middle school but she has met everyone a few other times so nothing was awkward and everyone got along.

The friend in question (let’s call him J) I have also known for many years. 

Well, we all spend the day drinking beers but at an incredibly reasonable pace with barbecuing and swimming all leading to natural breaks in drinking. No one is drunk and half the people I’d say were basically sober. Throughout the day my gf and J talk quite a bit and I was happy to see it since my gf can be closed off in social situations. I wasn’t surprised they got along since they both have similar senses of humor and are in similar fields of research which is hard to come by in people. I also didn’t feel jealous because I trusted J and because my gf gets really uncomfortable when people hit on her or generally give her flirty vibes so she shuts that down really quick. Also I should say my girlfriend is very attractive; obviously I’m biased but many people have told me they think she’s very beautiful. 

Anyways. The night is winding down, J continues to chat up my gf and even sets up a chair for her (between me and him) when we sit around a fire. It was weird but still within a reasonable realm of things to do, especially since I was busy building the fire. He keeps laughing a lot at her jokes and generally seeming charmed by her which was fine because she is funny and can be very charismatic. 

The problem comes along when my gf decides it’s time to shower. Her announcement of her leaving prompted everyone to head inside and start cleaning up/making their sleeping areas. You can very obviously hear the shower running from the other side of the door and besides, once again, my gf essentially announced she was going to shower to call dibs first. I go into the back room to change and clean when I hear my gf shriek. I come out of the room and go into the bathroom and ask her what’s wrong. She turns off the shower and seems very uncomfortable and awkward but eventually tells me that J walked in on her showering. She said she didn’t freak out at first because she thought it was me but freaked out when she realized it was J.

The shower has a huge glass door so while there is steam blocking some of the view, you can clearly see at least the outline of someone’s body while in it. She said J was embarrassed when she shrieked and quickly left.

When I went to the living room J came up to me and started apologizing a bunch saying he was “sooo drunk” and he totally forgot she was in there but he didn’t have more than 6 drinks throughout the entire 10 hours we were hanging out (plus 2 meals) and certainly was not acting drunk earlier that night and I’ve known him for a while so I know him drunk. At the time I just said “it’s fine” and went to bed. My gf also didn’t want to make a big deal out of it because she was embarrassed and assumed it was a genuine mistake.

But the weird “drunk” claim got me thinking. I wasn’t initially angry and also thought it was an accident but now I’m not so sure. He knew she was in there, you can hear the shower running, and I was in the back room with the door shut when he did it. It’s weird when coupled with his overly friendly behavior that night. Also, the fact that it took her shrieking when she realized it wasn’t me after a couple of seconds of him being in the bathroom is really setting off red flags to me. Why wouldn’t you shut the door and leave right away after hearing shower noises?

Basically I just don’t know what to do. It’s been a few days and we’re all hanging out again next weekend but my gf admits to feeling kind of weird around him now and I feel the same. He’s been my friend for so long but this situation is making me  question things. 

Am I overreacting? Does this seem like a genuine mistake? If it doesn’t, how do I talk to him about this if I even need to do that at all? I’m not the jealous type at all but this whole thing is so damn weird. Really just trying to get other perspectives or advice on this.

Tl;dr: friend of many years walked in on my gf showering after being very friendly with her throughout the day. He claims it was an accident and he was drunk but he was definitely not drunk. How do I handle this situation and am I reading too much into this?"
"[19F] Home from uni for the summer to work. My mom [57F] keeps giving out to me if my nipples are visible in public


When I began university, I stopped wearing bras. I realised that nobody cares about seeing my nipples through my shirt, that it was more comfortable and that I didn't need them anyway (B cup). There was no issue, I wasn't treated any differently which you would expect. 

Now I'm home for the summer, to work and hang out with my friends and parents. 

My mom keeps sending me links to bra shops online, and telling me to zip up my hoodie if we're in public and you can tell I'm not wearing a bra, because they aren't perfectly round-shaped breasts. 

Literally nobody cares about what I do with my tits, and it's embarrassing in public to be nearly 20 years old and have your mom complaining that people can see your bee stings, and how it's inappropriate. 

I feel awkward getting mad at my mom for something like this, especially if she turns out to be in the right, but am I crazy for thinking it's not a big deal?? It's not even a *deal*, period. 

Tl;dr - my mom keeps pointing out that it's inappropriate to not wear a bra in public, but I don't see the issue. "
"my (22f) boyfriend (23m) said that I told him I like to be degraded


tldr: my boyfriend said that I told him I like being degraded despite me telling him I don’t and has started to do so 

Last night while at a party my boyfriend of 4 months out of nowhere brought up the subject of me and how I like to “be degraded.” 

Right away I asked him why he was saying this and he said that I told him that at the beginning of our relationship. I quickly shot him down and said that I wouldn’t say that especially because I’ve been in really abusive relationships where I was constantly verbally degraded. 

I have been asking him over and over why all of a sudden this is a thing and he refuses to answer. He says this is a pointless argument and so he won’t answer me. 

This morning we were laying on the couch and then out of nowhere he was like, “kiss me bitch” which I kind of laughed at and was like whatever but then he was like “kiss me slut” I asked what he called me and he just repeated “slut.” 

I feel hurt, degraded, embarrassed and dumb. What should I do? "
"I’m [30 F] starting to think my fiancé [37 M] prefers me to be sad and broken.


(We’ve been together 4 years and are getting married in October.)

The past few months I’ve been very productive. I’ve been losing weight through healthy eating and exercise. I’ve met several personal goals and have been feeling really good and happy and strong and positive.

During this time, my fiancé has become really distant. He hasn’t encouraged me or acknowledged my progress. We haven’t had sex in over a month. I’ve tried, but he’s never receptive. He always has to be the one to initiate it. 

He quit being affectionate with me altogether. I kept giving him back massages and playing with his hair like he likes but he basically stopped giving me everything except for a quick, routine peck on the lips when he leaves for work. 

Since the beginning of our relationship I put on 20lbs while he consistently stayed lean and muscular. He’s very physically fit and active and is still in better shape than I am, even with all of my progress. Which is why it surprises me that he hasn’t been supportive. I’m not leaving him behind but am actually joining him, although I’ve been feeling like I’ve been doing it all alone this whole time. 

This past weekend he began taking everything I said personally. For example, I noticed the outside of our house was looking pretty drabby. I enthusiastically said I wanted to clean it. He responded that I was making him feel like a failure. I tried telling him he isn’t a failure and the responsibility lies with both of us to keep our home looking nice because we deserve it. It was like talking to a brick wall... he’s barely spoken to me these past few days. 

Last night he was being very rude to me regarding everything, like me asking him how his day was or what he wants for dinner. Finally I just started crying and he just sat and looked at me, emotionless. I told him I miss him and felt like he has been so far away. He used to be very sweet and loving and affectionate with me. 

We began arguing until eventually I was just a bawling and broken puddle of a human. Then he starts being nice to me again immediately. Like a switch was flipped. He wanted to hold me and make it all better. I fell asleep crying and with him tickling my back like he always used to. “Just let me love you,” he kept saying.

Except I was letting him love me. For months it’s all I’ve wanted. I wanted him to love me by encouraging me and telling me he’s proud of me, by being my biggest cheerleader like I’ve always been his. I wanted him to love my strength, my perseverance, my determination, my confidence. I wanted him to love the fact that I actually started to love myself. 

Looking back over our relationship, I’m starting to see a pattern. He seems to love me best, or at least he shows me that, when I’m weak and entirely dependent upon him. Any time I am making positive changes in my life for myself he seems to pull away from me and becomes very distant. It hurts. 

Today I woke up with my eyes so swollen from crying that I can barely see to type this. I feel unmotivated and have already missed my morning yoga practice. I’m exhausted and I just want to lay in bed all day. He keeps telling me he is going to fix it and make it better. “Just let me love you,” he keeps saying. 

I don’t know what that means anymore.

Could this be all in my head or do my instincts seem accurate? I’m feeling very confused right now. Some outside input would be much appreciated. Thank you. 

Tldr- My fiancé doesn’t support me when I make positive changes in my life, it’s been a pattern I’ve noticed over the past couple of years. He pulls away from me and seems to prefer me when I’m weak and need him to be strong for me. "
"My boyfriend (27M) shaved his head and beard and I’m (24M) no longer attracted to him


I’ve been dating a really nice guy for about a year. He treats me very well, and this is the first healthy relationship I’ve ever had. I’ve only had abusive partners before this.

Side note - I’m incredibly attracted to facial hair. To the degree that there are maybe one or two clean shaven guys I’ve really ever felt attracted to (don’t know why). My partner initially had a beard when I met him, and a short haircut.

Physically, I didn’t find him to be super attractive, but I thought he was cute. I was more taken with the way he treated me than his appearance - it was definitely (positively) overwhelming to realize what a healthy relationship with a supportive and caring partner could feel like. I felt like I was physically attracted enough that it wasn’t an issue for me. I loved his beard/scruff and thought he had a really cute face.

A few days ago, he shaved it all off. His beard is gone, and he buzzed his hair (shorter than a quarter inch everywhere). It completely changed the shape of his face. I know I’m still adjusting, but I feel absolutely awful because I realized I don’t find him attractive at all anymore. He loves the haircut, and as of now it sounds like it might be his new normal.

I feel like an absolute asshole. I don’t want to be a partner that controls the other’s haircut, that feels shitty and abusive. So far I’ve told him that I like it, and tried to act normal, but it feels like I’m lying to him. I just don’t know what to do, and I’m panicking about what to do if I realize through this that I don’t find him attractive anymore :( any advice or thoughts are all welcome

\**Tl;dr; my boyfriend shaved his head and beard, I’ve found myself feeling absolutely zero physical attraction, and I don’t know what to do."
"Gf (21F) of 3.5 months got into fight at her sisters (28F) wedding and she's embarrassed, how do I (24M) make her feel better?


I'm on mobile, so sorry for typos


Long story short, my girlfriends Sister Tanya had her wedding this weekend. Tanya's fiancé/husband had a really crazy ex girlfriend. Like she's harassed them since they started dating three years ago, driving to their house at night, calling his phone from random numbers after bung blocked, all that classic crazy shit. So ex gf wasn't invited to the wedding, they even hired the fiances uncle as a security guard to watch out for her.


So the wedding goes fine, we're at the reception, and who walks in? Crazy ex gf. Wearing a *wedding dress*. One of the simple ones you'd get from like h&amp;m, but still noticeably a wedding dress. So security is nowhere to be found, bride is low key freaking out, and my girlfriend Lisa took the reigns, walked up to their, and splashed her chest with fruit punch. Of course a fight broke out. Not a major one, cause Lisa kicked her ass really quickly, and it was over in like three minutes.  Crazy gf called her mom and left. After twenty minutes of damage control everyone settled down and the wedding proceeded normally, and everyone laughed about it.


So it's been two days. If anything, I found the whole thing hilarious. But it's really been messing with my gf. She's mortified by it, can't stop talking about it and how she's ashamed, and how I probably think she's horrible. I don't at all. If anything, I think it's bad ass that she would stick up for her sister. Idk how I can get her to understand that.


**tldr: Girlfriend got in a fight, thinks I hate her, I think it's nbd. "
"Me [32f] encountered a very creepy “birthday clown” (late 30sM) at friends (33f) kid’s (9m) bday party. He made me a balloon penis and said “there’s more where that came from.” Do I need to tell his wife (30sF) even though I don’t know her and suspect she won’t believe me?


Hopefully with better title within the rules...

So yesterday evening I attended a child’s birthday pool party without my husband since he had to work. I was running extremely late and didn’t have a swim suit so I ran into Target, figured if I got a two piece I wouldn’t have to worry as much about the sizing. I picked one out, held it up to myself quickly and figured it would work. I paid and bolted to the party. I had zero idea that target sold “sexy” swimsuits and after I got dressed I realized that I’d made a terrible mistake and I looked like a 32 year old trying to be a 19 year old insta-model. I was able to borrow a sarong type cover up but even then either my boobs or my butt was exposed. I put on one of my friends t-shirt and that was ok but the kids all wanted me to swim so I spent the evening way more exposed than I hoped.
My friends all thought it was hilarious and I was very lucky that I was around people I’m close too because even with half my butt hanging out, I felt like I was in a “safe” place.

And then the “clown” showed up and he was a creep from the start. He is married to my best friends sister, and I don’t really know either of them. On multiple occasions I caught him staring at me as I would either be putting the shirt on or off or wrapping the sarong around my waist. He made me very, very uncomfortable. Then he led a game where if he called out a certain color the kids wearing that color would have to jump in the pool. I was the only adult he asked to be in the game. The kids really wanted me to play put I decided that because of his creep stare I would just wear the T-shirt and sarong, even in the water. The bikini was turquoise and he kept calling out turquoise and the finally said “I know SOMEONE is hiding turquoise around here, let’s see it!” The kids obviously didn’t get what he was saying and I don’t think the adults were paying enough attention to notice.

When it came to ballon animal time he made all the traditional ones but again I was the only adult he made one for, he called it a “sword” but it was clearly a penis with testicles even with a “tip”. When he handed it to me he said something like “there’s plenty more where that came from.” I was disgusted but frozen, I wish I had a witty comeback or popped the balloon but I said nothing.

I told my friend that her BIL was really creeping me out and she said he’s just like that and he probably didn’t mean anything bad. I tried to tell her about the staring and she sort of accused me asking for the attention by wearing such a ridiculous bikini to a kids party. I said she knew what happened, as I told her about being late and target and all that. She said something like “I’ve known you for too long to believe that.” And she walked away from me. Again, not being super witty...I didn’t have a comeback.

Do I need to find this guys wife and tell her what happened? Is this one of those “not my monkeys, not my circus” situations and since I will just leave if I ever see this guy again, my part is done? I know that that if my husband was up to such crap I would want to know for so many reasons, including potential legal trouble. With my friends reaction (again his SIL) I’m worried that he’s bamboozled the entire family and telling his wife will have no effect.
What should I do here?

Tl;dr: birthday party clown was incredibly creepy towards me last night. His ultimate creepiness came when he made me a balloon penis and told me “there’s more where that came from.” Do I find and tell his wife?"
"My [33f] friend [28f] earns an income from Airbnb while staying at my place for free.


Hi all,

I need some advice on how to be assertive with my friend by telling her I don’t want her staying at my place anymore.

My friend has her apartment listed on Airbnb and stays at my apartment whenever she has a guest. Sometimes 3 nights, sometimes a week, sometimes more. This has been going on for nearly 6 months now and I can’t do it anymore. 
In the beginning I agreed because she said she was really strapped for cash, but now I feel like she’s taking advantage of me. 

She’s currently staying at my place for 5 nights and will earn 400 euros which is more than my rent per week. She was just bragging to me that she bought 200 euros worth of clothing with all this extra cash she is earning... this has really pissed me off because she said she didn’t have any money.  I am basically financing her wardrobe at this point. I have a very small one bedroom apartment (30sqm), and I work from home so it’s very disruptive for me having another person living in my work environment. She has not once offered to give me a share of what she earns, she eats my food, doesn’t buy any groceries or does any cooking, goes through my wardrobe and wears my clothes, and I feel like she’s taking advantage of me at this point. 

I never hear from her when she isn’t staying at my place. I see her going out with our mutual friends on social media and I’m never invited. I’m at the end of my rope, and I don’t know how to have this conversation without her ending up in tears.

I’m not well off by any means, I work hard to pay for my own rent, and I really miss my own space and having my apartment to myself. She has her own key so she comes and goes as she pleases.

How can I go about this without ruining the friendship? Should I send her a text when she leaves or say it in person? 

**TL;DR** : My friend earns an income from Airbnb by staying at my place for free and I feel like I’m being used."
"I (30F) am the main breadwinner in my marriage with Josh (29M). He wants to do lots of expensive things this summer that are just for him. Am I being taken advantage of?


This is sort of a half r/personalfinance and half r/relationships kind of question. 

TL;DR: my husband isn't pulling in much money (odd freelance gigs, side hustles like Lyft), but really wants to do a lot of things this summer that are just for him. Where do I draw the line? 

My husband Josh recently graduated from a PhD program, where he had a decent stipend (for a doctoral program). I work full-time and make pretty good money, supporting him during his doctoral program. Josh decided during school that he wanted to take an unorthodox career path with the knowledge he gained during his program. instead of doing academia or private sector work, he was going to forge his own path in the freelance world. We sat down and discussed how long we could afford to have him do this before he has to give up and get a private sector job. This is his dream and although I'm not convinced he'll make a TON of money from it, I do think it is worth trying for and if he's successful, could be a good ""second"" income for us. We decided that we'd give him a year and if he is making X amount of money, we'll consider it a success; if he isn't, he needs to find something else to do. I do not want to be in a situation where I'm supporting both of us by myself. 

A few weeks ago, he lets me know he and a few of his buddies have planned a short road trip. It's something they usually do every year and isn't a huge deal, so OK. He also wants to go to this really expensive conference in a very expensive city. Since he's no longer affiliated with any university or company, the entire travel and registration is coming out of our pocket (though we're looking into options for writing this off with our taxes, since he's self-employed). Oh, and he forgot to tell me that a college friend is getting married later this year in a remote area that requires expensive travel accommodations. Oh, and we have two other weddings we're attending this year, both of which involve modest travel. And he needed to pay off the remainder of his student loans, since the no-interest period ended when he graduated (this one, I do not begrudge). And we also had a vacation just the two of us a couple months ago. 

Although I am welcome to attend some of these things (such as the friend wedding in a remote area), but i have limited time off that I don't want to use it to go to some guy I've never met's wedding in the middle of nowhere. Other info: we have a mortgage and really want to start having kids, but might need a little help in the fertility department, which is not cheap. 

We sat down and talked about this last week. I said that I felt like he was getting to do a lot of fun, optional things using the money that we need to use for our family. Adding insult to injury, I don't really get to do very many of these things (or trips of my own) because I'm working and have limited time off. I said I felt like everything was rotating around him right now, when we need to focus on paying off our mortgage and building our family. He agrees that these things are top priorities, but he still ""really wants to do"" all of the events I listed above. Some of these things were not optional - he has to go to this conference if his freelancing thing is ever going to work, he has to pay off his loans, etc., so paying for none of it isn't an option.

He freaked out a little and has started to take up a bunch of side hustles/gig economy stuff (e.g., Lyft driving, dog walking). If you've ever done that stuff, you know it pays like crap. It's pocket change at best. But, between the few freelance gigs he has in his field and this gig economy stuff, he is working hard and pulling in a little more money, which is nice. I appreciate that he's working hard and that he does seem a little stressed about the money, because given all his requests, I was worried he was thinking about me like I'm a money tree or something.

Here's where my question is. He's doing all this gig economy stuff to help offset the cost of his fun trips. I do think he'll be able to make enough this summer to offset those costs, but I'm still feeling frustrated that extra money is going to his trips and fun, extra stuff and not our mortgage/family costs. Am I being unreasonable? 

Am I being taken advantage of? One of the occasional disagreements Josh and I have is about budgeting. I am from a lower middle class family that heavily emphasized saving and only spending money if you know you REALLY want something. I meticulously monitor my finances. He comes from a poor family that views money as a transigent thing: ""oh, we have money today - we better spend it because it might not be here tomorrow!"" He recognizes it isn't a healthy attitude and occasionally makes  a small effort to try to budget, but he usually gives up after a day or so (""I don't like to feel deprived.""). 

I recognize as the main breadwinner that I occasionally need to pay for things that only benefit him. The same would be true if the tables were turned. However, I feel like his fear of being deprived has resulted in me actually being deprived of fun things and the financial security I've worked hard for -- like, his fun takes precedence over my fun. 

Does this situation sound like a normal problem for a breadwinner? Or does it sound like Josh is taking advantage of me?"
"My (32M) wife’s (32F) obsession with money is tiresome and it’s affecting our marriage


I don’t have anyone else to talk to since my wife is crazy about privacy. I can’t share this with friends or family, so I’m turning to internet strangers. 

We have been married for 8 years and, overall, our relationship is wonderful. We have an amazing life, no children, live in a beautiful home, travel the world, you name it. We both work in the same field but not together. 

On to the issue. My wife is, by all accounts, addicted to her work. From the day I met her, I realized that this woman is the most ambitious and fierce person I’ve ever known, which was and still is a good thing. She went ti school, got into a very high paying career but it is never enough. She is always after the money. If she can’t make money doing something, that thing is not worth her time. Some examples: her sister needed help with a problem which would require a professional like my wife. Obviously, SIL asked for wife’s help, wife accepted and quoted SIL a pretty high price for the task. SIL tried to bring it down a bit but wife said something like “without $$ amount, it’s not worth my time”. Another example is that she works at all hours, all time zones, even when on vacation. She takes phone calls, conferences, consultations, and says “what, you want me to pass up that $5000?”. Moreover, she once admitted to me that she doesn’t particularly enjoy her work. In her exact words, “I couldn’t care less for being a [het profession]. I would do whatever it takes for good money”. To her merit, she is fantastic at her job, which allows her to overcharge her clients enormously. 

I mean, I love my life and I never want for anything but at what price? I feel like at one point I will wake up and feel lonely. We don’t have friends, we only have people we have to network with because they bring clients. We don’t visit family because we can’t afford wasting time. Am I right to complain about this? Should I havr a serious conversation with my wife? I don’t want to make it sound like I ask her to drop her work. 

TL;DR: my wife is addicted to her work and the money "
"My [25 M] mom [48 F] tried to put a curse on me to destroy my relationship with my GF [24 F] of 1.5 years.


Hi all,


I've posted on here before regarding my mom and her attempts to sabotage my relationship with my GF because she is not Russian-Jewish. My mom has tried to sabotage my relationship for a year, has said nasty things about my GF, has done everything in her power to turn my family against her and me. I went very low contact and my mom acted somewhat normal in these recent times, she wouldn't bring up GF, wouldn't say anything negative, and if she did I would hang up. To be fair though, she hasn't had much of a chance. We talked about one/twice a month compared to one a week in my last post, and if she did say something negative I would hang up on her.


Recently I had my birthday, it was a milestone birthday, and I couldn't think of a better person to spend it with than my lovely GF. My family clearly wanted to see me on my bday as well, however I made it abundantly clear to them that I will not see them on my birthday without her. This led to guilt trips/flying monkeys being sent by my mom about not visiting them. In addition, even when she said happy birthday to me, she had to chime in with a line referring to I hope you and your gf end this next year of her life. I was quite angered, and didn't speak to my mom.


Now here comes the real kicker. My sister, god bless her, who lives with my parents discovered secretly that my parents visit a psychic. She found an audio recording on my moms phone that was 50 minutes long of my moms most recent visit to her psychic. The psychic tells details of my life, what age I will die, how I will die... but the thing that really angered me is this psychic talking about my GF. Basically she made her out to be the devil, an evil being with a black heart, even going as far as to say we will soon have a kid, she will leave me after the kid, I won't pay child support, and end up in jail. It's extremely messed up because my GF is one of the nicest and best people I know. Clearly my mom ate it up, and the psychic offered her to do some black magic/cast a spell on our relationship to break us up for a nominal fee of $1000. I have no idea if they went along with it or not, but my mom seemed very interested. This seems like fiction and I really wish it was but its the reality I'm dealing with. I'm not a believer in psychics/black magic, however I do believe in karma/negative energies and I can't believe my mom would try to send anything negative my way, or pay to break me and my GF up just because she doesn't like her not being Jewish.


My mom had no idea that I knew about this recording. She sent me a message yesterday asking me if I can come home to help them move furniture for a house renovation they are planning, and at that point I unloaded. I told her many things, mainly saying who do you think you are to try to poison my relationship with black magic and then want me to go home and help you? She left me a voicemail crying and saying ""she would never wish bad on me or try to curse/black magic me""... to which I added on to the text with the audio portion of the black magic bit.

She never responded to my texts, I received calls from my grandparents shortly after, probably to try to guilt me for being so harsh to my mom, but I didn't pick up. My dad also sent me two texts. One was saying that ""you better call your mom right now and apologize"" - apologize for what? Being angry that she tried to poison my relationship with black magic? I didn't respond to his message, and he followed up with a threat saying ""You will pay for your mothers tears, I promise you that"". That message was my final straw, I blocked both of their numbers.


My GF knows the whole story, she was extremely upset and disturbed by it, and honestly she's a little afraid. But I have a problem, a big problem, I really wish to have my parents in my life, but I want them to be normal people. This whole saga has been going on for almost two years, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Is there any hope to ever have a normal relationship with them in the future, what do I do?


**TLDR**

Mom hates GF, has said many horrible things about her because she's not Jewish been trying to sabotage relationship for over a year and turned whole family against me. Mom went to a psychic recently who spoke of GF as if shes the devil. Psychic offered to do black magic to break us up, mom was interested. I blew up at my mom after finding out, went NC..any hope for normal relationship with parents in future?"
"I (20M) think my parents (50M &amp; 48F) lied to me about me having HSV2


I come from a very socially conservative Indian family, where even the thought of me dating or having sex was out of the question. But in high school, like many Indian kids in my position, I wanted to date this girl, Stacey (16F at the time), in my grade so we snuck around etc. Though she was white, her parents were also very conservative and didn't like the idea of her with me, though I was never quite sure if it was because I was not white or because they didn't want her dating, period. Anyways about a year and a half into our relationship, her parents found out about us and had found out that we had sex for the first time around that time, at the end of our junior year of high school. Her parents ended up calling my parents and I was in big trouble, lots of yelling, even though they knew that I was being safe, using condoms etc. A few months later a weird rash appeared on my neck, and my genital area was a little irritated, so they ended up taking me to a local urgentCare center. They administered an STD panel and the doctor said that I had tested positive for HSV2. Again, more yelling, asking whether I was still seeing Stacey, which to be fair I kind of was because I really did love her at the time, implying and insisting in many ways and words that I was damaged goods and that this was ""God's way of punishing me for my unchaste behavior"". I was skeptical of this result for a few reasons at the time. The doctor/nurse practitioner who assessed and diagnosed me didn't even know that the appropriate treatment for HSV2 is oral or topical antivirals such as valacyclovir, which is something I found from nothing more than a cursory google search and was confirmed by my primary physician. They also called me in a second time because the needed more blood for some reason that I don't remember, even though they already had taken 4 vials. But I trusted them, because they were my doctors and I was only 17. When I got diagnosed, I got really depressed and its something that's stuck with for a long time, and has affected my mental health and relationships since then. Recently I've reconnected with a friend from high school while home for the summer, and I guess we've sort of become friends with benefits? Anyway we hadn't done anything that according to my doctor would risk transmission, before I told her about my alleged condition, and she was one of the most accepting people about it. I told that I got tested a while ago and she urged me to get tested again for my own knowledge and for her safety before we do anything, so I booked an appointment with a lab near me. I was anxiously waiting for results, and to my surprise, everything came back negative, including IgG tests for HSV1 &amp; 2. The index vales for both tests were both so low that it didn't make sense. This morning, I finally had time go to that original urgent care place and request my testing records. The original test also came back negative with a stated index value of &lt;.90, but they also printed out the record with the doctor's handwriting, and she circled the index value, below which CLEARLY stated that an index value &lt;.90 indicates a negative result, but she circled positive. The only thing that I can think of was that the doctor was also Indian, and a conservative seeming Christian one at the that, who shamed me for having premarital sex, so this obvious mistake was ideologically motivated, perhaps even by suggestion from my mom. After I looked at the tests, I tried googling the doctor/nurse practitioner, to hear what exactly happened from her point of view, but all I got was a personal phone number. When I tried calling, she picked up and didn't even let me explain my predicament before hanging and now will not pick up the phone at all. What should I do?

**TL:DR I think my parents lied to me about me having HSV2 to shame me for having premarital sex**"
"My (17f) father(63m) is not letting me go to my mothers(50f) birthday dinner, but is letting my older brother(23m) go


So, my mother’s 50th birthday is today and I assumed that we were all going out to eat for her birthday. I asked my older brother if he knew what we’re the plans because, at the time my mother and I were on a two week long trip with our extended family.

He told me that my dad only told him to show up at a place and that’s it. I of course assumed I would be going. 

I also had another close family friend tell me that they were showing up for a party for my mother. 

Well queue to today and I ask my dad what the plans are for my moms birthday and he tells me that he’s taking my mother out and I ask him if I’m going and he says no. I’m really confused at this point and I ask him about what my brother said to him and he stared at me for a second and got really upset and asked why my brother would tell me that and to not tell my mother anything. 

So apparently there’s no party going on and I’m not even invited to my own mothers birthday dinner. 

I’m really hurt and confused and I don’t know how to confront my dad about all this. Any suggestions?

TL;DR -  my father is not letting me attend my mothers birthday dinner but is letting my older brother surprise her"

We were and off for the first few years, as we were still so young at the time, still in school, etc. But now we’re solid. We’re talking about marriage. The plan is to get married within the next couple of years, get traveling out of the way and then start a family. 

Anyway that’s not important. 

Her best friend, who was in a really shitty relationship for too long, recently split up with her boyfriend and needed a place to stay. She has no family here, so we decided to take her in until she finds a job and a good therapist that she connects with. 

My girlfriend thinks of her like a sister. There’s no way we could ever turn her away. She’s like family. 

They basically grew up together. 

Obviously we’ve been taking it slow with her. She and I didn’t interact all that much at the start, but when my girlfriend went away on a work trip for a weekend, we were kind of forced to talk and interact. 

I made her breakfast. I usually always make breakfast at our apartment, but I guess she assumed it was my girlfriend before. Anyway, she was surprised, asked if she should make breakfast the next day. I told her not to worry about it. She did it anyway. Later that day, I was in the living room watching Netflix. She sat down with me, asked what I was watching, etc. Honestly she was talking a lot, so I just switched the show off and engaged in conversation, figuring she wanted to talk and had nothing else to do. 

Because she’s my girlfriend’s best friend, I asked her what she thought of the necklace that I was going to get my girlfriend for her birthday. She said it was nice, asked how my girlfriend and I had met. Apparently my girlfriend had never really gone to deep into the details. I told her about our first date, the white dress my girlfriend wore and the way she had her hair down, etc. 

After that she told me how good of a boyfriend I am. I jokingly said I’m actually a dumbass most of the time, and that my girlfriend is the one who’s good. Better than good. She’s as close to perfect as anyone can get. 

I could tell her friend felt a little bad after I’d said that. Maybe her ex had never said anything like that about her before. I don’t know. She just stopped talking, fell into thought, etc. I changed the subject, asked her if she wanted to continue watching the show. She said okay. We sat there for about two hours before it was time to sleep. 

I talked to my girlfriend before bed, told her what we talked about (apart from the necklace) and she said that it was really nice of me to spend time with her friend. She was worried that it was going to be really awkward with her there. 

We got off the phone. I went to sleep. About an hour later, I got a knock on my door. I opened it to find her friend. She was in tears and she said she called her ex. To my knowledge he’d never touched her, but he did have a hold on her emotionally, and he was really manipulative, so I understood why she was so upset. But I didn’t know what to do. 

Apparently she called her ex and he was trying to talk her into coming back. Going by the fact that she was dressed to go out, it nearly worked. 

I offered to call my girlfriend for her, so they could talk it out. She said she didn’t want to bother her. At this point I wasn’t sure how to handle the situation. When I was younger, my Mum used to make me tea and sit with me at the table when I had a bad day at school or a bad dream of some sort, so that’s what came to mind. 

I made her tea, sat with her at the table and snuck a quick text to my girlfriend to let her know what was going on. Keep her informed. She said that I did the right thing. 

Her friend eventually relaxed, thanked me for sitting with her, and apologized for waking me up in the middle of the night. I said it was okay and went back to bed. 

This happened this past weekend. My girlfriend is back now. Everything seems to be okay. But I noticed today that her friend kept looking at me, smiling at me, walking by my home office for no reason, etc. She was also wearing a white dress today and had her hair down, very similar to how described to my girlfriend before. What she looked like on our first date. 

Now maybe I’m just overthinking it. In fact I hope I am. The last thing I want is to make things worse for everyone. But I’m worried that my kindness this past weekend, has been taken the wrong way. And maybe her friend is shifting her attention to me, even subconsciously. 

She hasn’t said or done anything massively wrong. But that’s just the feeling I’m getting from her. And I don’t want to wait until it gets worse. But I also don’t want to overthink and create drama over nothing. Do I tell my girlfriend or do I wait it out? 

I don’t want to stress my girlfriend out anymore than what she already feels right now. She’s really worried about her friend. 

**tl;dr** The signs are small but they’re there. I don’t want to create drama, or stress my girlfriend out, but I also don’t want to keep anything, even the slightest suspicions, from her. She’s really worried about her friend. But I have a feeling her friend has shifted her focus onto me because I was nice to her, and maybe she’s not used to that form a guy. How do I go about this in a way that’s good for everyone?

"Me [26F] with my first boyfriend [25M], 4 months together. He finds it boring when we make out ""too often""


Hi, 

So I'll try to keep this short. I'm in a relationship with S for four months now, we're long distance, and see each other once or twice a month max, usually for a couple of days or a whole week. He's my first boyfriend, and I never even dated before him.  

I have a lot of self esteem issues, and trust issues as well, and have been in therapy because of it. Before I had met him, I was doing quite well and actually gained some confidence which allowed me to try and go for this relationship. I do like him a lot and felt like I could really trust this guy, and that he's truly into me. 

Now, last weekend he came to visit me in my city. He's always been a social media guy and i don't mind if he checks it every now and then, but last weekend he was on his phone all the damn time. I had already mentioned to him once that it bothers me a bit when I'm traveling five hours to see him and he spends his evening on his phone, to which he replied that he just needs a break sometimes, so I let it go. 

Anyway, I felt like last time it got really out of hand. And we haven't seen each other for a whole month! I felt like i had to fight for his attention with his phone. But what really crushed me was the one time, when we were having sex ( we don't have full on sex because of his religious reasons, so he usually uses his fingers on me), he kept watching football on the laptop that was running in the background! He kept looking to screen a couple of times, and I was SO hurt by that. I didn't communicate though because I didn't want to risk a fight when we already see each other so rarely... 

A couple of hours later we started talking about related things, though, and he said that he finds it boring when we make out so often. That he wants to do things together instead of making out all the time. And I get that! But it still really hurt and upset me. I do have a higher libido than him, but I still don't understand how he can find it boring when we only see each other once a moth? Often I don't even want to take it further, I just want to kiss him and feel close to him... 

So, the thing is, we talked about this twice now, I told him it had hurt me, and he apologized. So it should be fine now, right? But I still can't get over it. I feel like I'm not good enough for him, and I can't believe him anymore, his words feel empty to me. He keeps reassuring me that he finds me amazing, but I still feel like shit. I do want to get over it and move on, I just don't know how. What can I do? 

*tl;dr:* Long distance boyfriend of four months crushed me by saying that he finds making out with me boring, and I feel like I have to share his attention with his phone and social media. We talked about it and I wanna forgive him and move on, but I don't seem to be able to. What do I do? "
"I [18 M] want to get rid of my crush on my best friend [18 F] who has been my best friend for years


Me [18 M] and my best friend [F 18] have been best friends for years, we are always there for eachother and are willing to talk about anything with eachother, from hookups to dating advice.

Shes an amazing friend who has been with me through some tough shit, and I've been there for her.

I value a friendship with her and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

The issue is that over time I've started to devlop a crush on her, and a part of me wants to see us become more than just friends.

But I know that won't happen due to me not being her type, and her generaqlly not seeing me in that way.

I respect that 100% and am happy just being her friend.

The issue is that my feelings for her are still there and are startign to cloud my judgement.

For example I'm starting to make jealous decisons on guys she wants to date, and its starting to affect my mood. It hurts when I see others ask her out because a certain part of myself wants that.

I want to remain friends with her, shes my anchor, but in order for me to be fully happy I need to get rid of my crush on her.

How would I go about doing that?

**TL;DR** I have a crush on my bestfriend, I want to get rid of my crush so we can remain best friends"
"Getting married VERY soon, but after 8 years I'm no longer ""in love"" and dreading the mushiness of a wedding.


Throwaway. I'm getting married VERY soon (like in a week). Fiance (M/35) and I (F/35) have been together for nearly 8 years off and on. We aren't really all that romantic or mushy all that often. That's not to say never, but have not really publicly like that in a long time. We are years passed the point where we are ""crazy"" about each other in that way. He's excited about the upcoming wedding whereas I'm more ""meh"" at this point. For reference, wedding will have about 170 people. 

You know how weddings are though .. You have to spend the entire day acting like a lovesick puppy or you just don't live up to the hype. I know this is a weird problem to have, but I'm really dreading the wedding. We have been together so long that I don't even know why we're bothering to get married at this point. The wedding planning has been super stressful; it's an out of state wedding where I have had almost no help to plan, other than my father. He tries to help, but he knows nothing about weddings or etiquette or how things are done, plus he can't use technology to save his life, so trying to plan a wedding with him has been super stressful (my mom works FT and is very busy). My fiance also works FT running his own business. I don't know if my feelings of ambivalence are because I'm so sick to death of wedding planning, or if it's also that I don't want to act all mushy in front of everyone, or both. I also will admit to having mixed feelings about marriage in general, as in I used to really want to get married and now I don't know if I want to be tied together forever to him or anyone. 

I hate admitting that, but there you have it. I know it sounds like I don't love my fiance. I do love him, he's my best friend, but those ""in love"" butterflies are gone and the reality of being tied to someone forever is making me depressed. Meanwhile, everyone keeps asking me if I'm excited, and I can't even muster enough energy to bullshit and act like I'm crazy happy, like everyone else seems to be right before they marry. I let people know I'm excited, but really sick of wedding stuff and ready to get it over with. To make things worse, I lost my job (mass layoff) at the end of February after 10 years with my company, and because I had to go back and forth to my home state for wedding planning, decided to hold off on getting another job until after the nuptials. I have been out of work and while some people may enjoy it, I'm not really enjoying it that much. Unemployment requires me to complete some job applications every week, but the whole process is soul suckingly depressing. This may also be contributing to some depression. 

I don't know what I'm looking for - advice? reassurance? - Did anyone else feel this way prior to marriage?? I feel so lost right now. 

tl;dr: Getting married in a week, feel ambivalent about wedding and marriage after 8 years of living together, and I hate that I feel this way right before my wedding day. "
"My girlfriend (f26) is mad at me (m27) for messing up her ""friendship"" with her married boss (m37) and for interfering with her work


My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now. We met in college and were friends for years before we started dating. Until recently, I would've said I knew her well and better than anyone. She is a kind, giving person. Extroverted and positive. Happy and loving. Reliable and smart. Beautiful. My best friend. 

6 months ago, my girlfriend got a new job. She was miserable at her last one and I had a connection at a company she always wanted to work at. I helped her get looked at, but she's talented enough and has the personality to get the job herself. I point this out mainly because my connection to the company has a lot to do with this. Her boss is my sister's best friend's husband. I know him well. I know his wife well. My sister and I are close. I have friends who work at this company, too.

I've been feeling something is off and wrong with my girlfriend's relationship with her boss for a few months now. She talks about him constantly. She texts him all the time. Other small things that add up. My friend also works with them and tells me that they are really flirty in the office and he favors her to the point where everyone thinks they have a thing. I have asked her about it, she always brushes it off and says she admires him as her boss.

I know this was bad, but I did read some of their texts and they were  flirty. I do not think they have done anything sexual.

As I said, this guy is my sister's best friend's husband and I wound up telling my sister about this and we both told her friend. Her friend also was feeling suspicious and upset, but recently had a baby and thought she was making it up. I had a long talk with my girlfriend after this and she was angry at me for talking to his wife, said I had no business doing that and that they weren't doing anything wrong. She called me insecure and jealous. It was ugly, but we made it through.

Long story short, my girlfriend is complaining because her boss treats her badly now. Her version of ""bad"" is that she's not getting the good assignments, he is not lenient on her, he won't text her anymore, and he's cold to her. My friend at her work says they are no longer flirting. She seems like she is in a bad mood now. She says it is interfering with her work and blames me for it. She also misses her friend.

I love my girlfriend. I have never seen her like this. I want to get back to what we were or at least to a better place than we are now. It is impossible as we are at an impasse. 

My questions are, did I cross the line? Should I feel bad about this? How can I fix this with my girlfriend? Should I even try?

---
**tl;dr:** My girlfriend's relationship with her boss was inappropriate. I talked to his wife and my girlfriend got angry. She's upset since now he doesn't want to be her friend or favor her. We are at an impasse. Was I wrong? Is this savable? Should I bother?"
"Apparently, I'm [25F] an evil witch because of the way I'm raising my daughter [8F]. It's putting a strain on a lot of relationships and I could use some help.


Well, this could get long, I don't know.

I had Sara young. I always said I'd never have children, I'm pro-choice and I was always careful because I knew if I got pregnant, I'd have an abortion. Turns out, the minute I found out I was pregnant, I went all 'Oh, I want this.' Then when she was born, it was all 'Yup, I made her and she's mine, back off'.

But even then my choices already got me judged. My mom had me via a c-section, and she always told me how she bounced back quickly after surgery. When I was pregnant, I read everything on labor and I was just terrified about the natural birth thing and the tearing and the bleeding for weeks and so I chose to have a c-section. Sara's father and my family all supported me, his family and some of my friends were all 'you're a freaking monster'. 

I bounced back quickly, as well and aside from the sleepless nights and usual things, things were fine. We got a place of our own and all that.

Now, see, I'm a gamer. This might seem silly, but I was raised as one. I'd stay up all night playing horror games with my dad and sometimes my mom would join us and I just really freaking love games. I also write for a living. Have a books a few poems published. My stories are mostly horror, which is another thing I love. Horror movies, books, games and all that.


I never forced any of my interests on my girl. But I'd play games with her, or I'd watch her father play while I was breastfeeding or she was asleep in my arms. When she got a little older, she'd always stay right next to me and watch me play. The first horror game she watched me play, she got scared, but her father and I managed to make her laugh while making fun of the monsters in the game, and she wasn't scared anymore. Soon, she was into horror as well. 
I mean, we watched the E3 conference together. I had her in my arms and when the remake of RE2 came up, we both squealed. That was the first horror game I showed her because it was my favorite one and she has the biggest crush on Leon, so it the coolest thing because I had the same reaction back in 1998 as a kid playing it with my dad for the first time.

She's a very independent little girl. She likes her own stuff, she's very selective, loves her friends, loves reading, watching/playing games, does well in school, gets in trouble occasionaly for normal kid things. She's very cool and I'm proud of her and I love her very much. 

Her father and I separated when she was 4, but we remained friends. I didn't want a romantic relationship with him anymore and I didn't want to set him back on finding someone. We work better as friends who have a kid together. I'm very introverted and I never really wanted a relationship with anyone to begin with. I do have dates here and there, but I never let it get past hooking up or the fwb scenario and I never, ever, introduce any of these dates to my kid. She usually stays with her dad when I'm out or with my parents.

Anyway.

Apparently, some friends of mine, including Sara's father's sister, think I'm a horrible mom. 

They invited me out for some drinks last week and I thought, ok, sounds fun. They all ganged up on me. In their words, my kid is going to suffer in her teen years because she doesn't like the things girls are supposed to like. She's going to be 'different', and I'm to blame because I exposed her to so many weird things. I'm a monster because who in the world lets their kid watch horror movies with ghosts and blood or play video games full of gore and zombies? 

When I said I was going to leave, they got angry and said I've always been selfish and irresponsible, both for having a kid so young and then for having a c-section.

I asked where this was coming from and they said they're just worried.

I left. Haven't spoken to them and have no intention to. But this took me off guard. I have absolutely no idea why they decided to do this, and I don't know how to deal with it. I'm sad, of course, and angry and just...I feel blindsided. Sara's father said he had no idea his sister thought that way about me, and I believe him. He was angry and had a fight with her because of what she said to me. I appreciated it a lot, but it still doesn't change the fact that this was out of the blue. I mean, what the hell?


I guess I'm here to ask if this is really that much of a problem and, I mean, what should I do? My kid is fine, she's awesome, she's kind, she's loyal to her friends--she protected her friend from this other girl who was bullying them, she respects me and her father and her grandparents, she doesn't have any problems with behavior. I mean, she's a kid, she does kid stuff sometimes that defy logic like the one time she scribbled on the walls because, in her words, 'they're like paper but huge'. 

So, how should I handle this?

**tl;dr:**  My 'friends' ganged up on me and questioned me about the way I'm raising my daughter. I don't know how to handle the situation since it was so out of the blue for me. "
"Boyfriend (28m) just left me (25f) high and dry at HIS dads Father’s Day celebration to go to a spontaneous street party downtown since Mexico won the World Cup of soccer. I’m so upset, awkward and hurt.


So to get this out of the way my boyfriend is not from Mexico nor is his family. He just loves soccer and when Mexico won the World Cup he litteraly grabbed his keys said he “had to go” and his Instagram shows him downtown with all his friends looking like they are at a cinco de mayo parade with sombreros and Mexican flags everywhere.

I’m still at his dads party and it’s so awkward since we don’t know each other. I want to get an uber but my credit card was hacked and I can’t pay for it. He won’t text me back about when he’s coming home or what to expect. His sister offered to give me a ride since she’s going to the valley anyways but that won’t be for another hour or so. 

So what do I do? What do I do right now to make myself comfortable in thier house and how do I deal with this with him when I see him?

"My (23M) wife (23F) spent all last night alone with a guy she and I met the day prior, and I'm unsure how I should handle it.


My wife and I met a single guy named Dave on Thursday while I was competing in a school-related activity. She spent the whole time talking one-on-one with this man for about three hours, which didn't bother me too much as her and I are real solid. I did, however, find it a little off-putting when he kept exclaiming how much she looked like Padme from Star Wars and showed the photo to everyone for comparison. It sounded like something I would do if I were flirting! This is relevant for later in the story.

Fast forward to last night, where I'm in a chess tournament. I told her I would be home most likely late, as I wanted to take some lessons from my mentor thereafter. She asks me at around 9 o'clock if she could meet with Dave. I told her ""sure:)"" as I thought it would be nice for her to have something to do on a Friday night, and who the hell am I to tell her no? I assumed they were going to a club or something with friends, and focused on the rest of my night.

I come home around 2:30 am to find she's still not home, so I sent her a text saying I was a little worried, and to please send me a text so I knew she was okay. I saw the message was sent and received (on whatsapp), but I didn't want to call, as I didn't want to be controlling or insecure. This has never happened before. She usually tuckers out around 1 am, so I fully expected her to be in bed by then.

Immediately my mind thinks the worst. What if something bad happened to her? What if David is some psychopath and hurt her? I didn't know anybody who knew him, and my wife didn't tell me where they were going or what they were doing (I know, my fault for not asking, but I was trying to show her that I trust her) so I was very upset for her not updating me on her uncharacteristically late-night outing, and mildly worried about Dave and her being together so late (I recognized this as jealousy).

She got back to me about 3:30 am saying she was alright, and apologized for making me worry. I was immensely relieved and went to bed. She got home around 4 am and said sorry again and I told her I'm just glad she's safe and we will talk tomorrow (so today).

She told me that she met Dave, alone, around 10 pm and they cooked Mexican food together and talked the whole time until she left his place. The morning after, she woke up before I did, and made us breakfast in bed, and did some cleaning to make it up to me. I trust fully that she didn't do this from guilt, so no, I don't believe they slept together or did anything physical. She also told me there was no physical contact, and I believe her.

The time spent with Dave sounds very strange to me. They just met the day before, he's single and seems REALLY interested in everything she says, he outwardly compares her to a beautiful celebrity (in my mind, this is flirtation), and to me, their time together sounds like a really great date! It sounds like something I would've done if I really liked a girl, and I feel massively uncomfortable with someone spending this type of quality time with my SO. With the research I've done into spouses with close, opposite-sex friends, I've found it's rather common for people to develop rapid bonds with these kinds of experiences, and this relationship between her and Dave could potentially harm our marriage if certain boundaries aren't set, but what are the correct boundaries? Should I even set boundaries? Or should I tell my wife I don't want them to see each other anymore? He's a great listener and she really enjoys talking to him. It would hurt me to say I don't want it to continue.

Deep inside, I believe that things moved way to fast and suddenly between them for my comfort, and I don't want them seeing each other anymore, period. The story would be much different if Dave were a good friend that predated me... But this guy is too new, and I think both of them have crossed a line. I believe my wife would agree if I asked her to stop seeing/talking to him, but should I? I value my relationship very much, and would do anything to protect it, but wouldn't asking her to stop seeing this friend say that I don't trust her? I feel it could permanently damage the nature of our relationship. It's not that I don't think she will make a mistake, but to quote an article I read, I don't want to let the mistake happen to her. It's human nature to develop bonds with people you spend quality time with, and also human nature to develop those bonds into something sexual at some point.

Another option is to say I don't want her to be with him that late, or under ""alone"" circumstances, but I feel the damage has already been done. I do not feel comfortable with them together in any situation now as I am strongly suspicious of Dave.

I am quite torn. On one hand, I want to support her and all of her decisions, including who she has as friends, but on the other hand, I cannot shake this feeling that something bad will come of this if I allow it to continue. I have not yet talked with my wife about it further, as I wish to get all my thoughts in order before doing so.

I am upset that she spent this intimate night with a man she and I just met, and I am scared of what will happen next. I'm at a loss on how to resolve this situation without being an ass :( What should I do?

**\*\*TL;DR; : My wife spent all night from 10pm-4am alone with a man she and I met just a day ago, and I am uncomfortable with the idea of them continuing their relationship. I worry that if I request that she no longer see's or talks to David, that will reflect badly on me in her eyes, and disappoint her as I know she likes to talk with him. How should I handle this situation? If I had non-consequential power, I'd like to cut them off, is that an overreaction? Will asking her to stop seeing him permanently scar our relationship?  \*\*.** "
"I(31f) don't respect my husband (32m) anymore and it's effecting our marriage.


We dated for 5 years, and have been married for 3. We also have a 2 year old son. Dating everything was great, and marriage was good at first. It was when we had our son that things changed. We decided I would quit my job and be a stay at home mom. There were many reasons we wanted this, but it was something we both agreed on. 


Very quickly everything became my responsibility in the home. Ranging from getting up every two hours for our son for the first year of his life, to picking up trash from my husband and putting it in the trash can. If it occured within our home, it was all my responsibility. I really struggled at first healing from giving birth, cleaning the entire house, and taking care of a newborn. When I asked for help, he responded with ""I don't know how to help you."" He claimed there wasn't enough time in the day to help me clean, even though he spent every night in front of the TV. 


He also started lying to get out of things. He would say ""yes"" to any request I had of him, regardless of any intent to actually complete it. I could never be sure whether he was going to do something or not, so I couldn't leave anything of importance up to him. Every doctors appointments, insurance, or other important things that required phone calls or paper work were left to me. 


Also, our fights became difficult. He is very prone to feeling blamed, so often most of our arguing involves me reassuring him that he's not to blame. I don't know how to explain it, but I walk away from a lot of our arguments wondering if I'm being abusive, but I am positive I'm not (I grew up in an abusive home and I know what it looks like). I think it's because I will say something like ""I need you to do X, it hasn't been done in awhile"" and he will get really upset and say I was calling him lazy. When I try to explain that I wasn't trying to call him lazy, he will say I need to say things better, and he only got so defensive because of the way I said it. I can't think of a single way to say that statement any better, and when I ask him how he would want me to say it he says idk.


On top of all this, my mother in law got  very overbearing when we had our son. She is very opinionated and while visiting would push her opinions on us. I don't mean like she wouldn't shut up about her opinions (which is also true, but I don't mind that as much), I mean she would rearrange our furniture/personal items to the way she thought they should be and would do things to/with our son that I specifically told her she couldn't do. My husband didn't want to face his controlling mother, and didn't want me to either (I have a much more forward nature and it was difficult for me to bite the bullet on this). This caused me to build a lot of resentment, I would frequently complain to my husband and request him to either say something or to let me, and he kept saying it was ""easier"" this way.    



Eventually things started to get better. It started with my mother in law, while she was visiting all my resentment finally built up and I exploded on her. My husband realized that this was not a healthy situation. He had a talk with her about respecting our boundaries and she has been better ever since, however my mother in law and brother in law don't like me now. It's evident, but there is nothing I can do now. 


Then we started to see a marriage counselor (mainly, honestly, because I was talking about leaving). We began working on me trusting him (meaning no lying, this is working better), and ""problem solving"" (our fights, like different language and stuff. This is still a work in progress.). I also returned back to work and with the guidance of our counselor we made a chore chart (this isn't working as well. He doesn't do most of his chores. Maybe one a week).     




I still don't respect him though. I think his lying to me and avoiding his problems with his mom is cowardly. I still feel as though I can't trust him to complete simple tasks (like his chores). When he complains he CAN'T complete them because there isn't enough time in the day, I feel angry because it was expected of me even though I was drowning. He knew I was miserable and incapable of everything put on my plate. When it was my problem I just had to figure it out, but now with less than half of the entire workload it's impossible and I need to help him figure out how to do it.  He says I never notice all things he does right, but it makes me angry that I would have to reward him for completing one thing on his ten thing list, especially compared to my twenty thing list.



These feelings are effecting my wanting to be around him. I don't feel loved by him. They also make me no longer physically attracted to him. When I look at him I don't see the man I fell in love with. I have never expressed these feelings of anger or resentment to him, or our counselor because I don't want to hurt him. I'm afraid to say them out loud, he has enough self esteem issues on his own, neither a less if he knew I actually do think he is lazy, ECT.    




Just to be clear he does have positives. If I mention wanting to pursue a hobby or a dream, he encourages me like no tomorrow. He is willing to put in time and effort for me to pursue it (this is key. He will put aside time to watch our son, manage his work schedule, whatever to help me). He is fantastic with managing our finances, and does it basically on his own. We only are able to live how we live because of his well paying career and his money managing. He does like to do sweet gestures, but mainly forgets that sort of thing exists sometimes. I think some of our problems come from his mother's controlling nature (he is used to everything being managed for him) and his ADHD (he has trouble focusing and keeping track of things). 


How can I resolve my resentment without causing more problems? Do you think the more we work with the counselor it will just go away on its own?    



TL;DR Husband left all responsibilities (other than earning money) to me along with allowing his mother to do whatever she wanted. We are seeing a counselor, and fixing it, but I still resent him for our past. How do I fix this without hurting his feelings?"
"Husband (30M) is FURIOUS about me (29F) wanting to try drinking


Hey everyone, I could really use some advice...my stomach is in a serious mess of knots right now. So here’s the backstory:
I grew up in a religion that strongly encouraged to abstain from alcohol completely. I agreed with it and never had any huge desire to drink. I have 2 friends the same way but we have all talked about how for our birthday this year (we have birthdays around the same time) we want to have a drinking party just to try it once in our lifetime. I told my husband about it and he FLIPPED. He grew up in the same religion and has never drank either. He feels very strongly about it because he’s had a couple of family members who were alcoholics and it led to their deaths. He’s now been yelling, cussing, saying he wants a divorce and that he’s lost all respect for me. I keep telling him that I will only do it the one time and never again. I just want to try it once and don’t have any desire to drink again after that. And I want to be able to do that with my friends. My husband doesn’t believe me and continues to say that if I do it he will divorce me. I’m crushed because this was something I was actually looking forward to doing with my friends...I know it’s really childish but I just want to experience it once! My husband is very judgmental of people who drink and he’s been calling my friend’s names because she’s the one who came up with the idea. He said he never wants to see her again. He said he will absolutely divorce me if I go to the birthday party and drink. This honestly makes me angry because I feel like it’s my personal choice and I’ll just resent him for it because he’s forcing me to choose between our marriage and just having one time fun thing with my friends. 
I would just love to have other people’s perspectives on this? How do I go forward with this marriage and not resent my husband for essentialky taking a personal choice away from me by saying it’s either going to be that or divorce? 
Thanks! 
TL;DR
Husband is saying he wants a  divorce if I decide to try drinking one time.

"Husband [31/m] and I [26/f] adopted a cat [4/m] a month ago. The shelter owner is constantly asking to visit the cat in our home


Okay, so my husband and I formalized a cat adoption over a month ago. 



The shelter doesn't have a physical location but the owner uses her business -she owns a pet food store- as the physical address. People who have animals they want to get rid of will contact her and she places the animal profile on pet finder. When were were on petfinder, we thought it was an actual shelter but it was no problem.



We adopted the cat just a few days later and the owner, I'll call her Amy from now on, had us sign the usual paperwork. We thought that would be it but Amy called us a day later and she said that she had extra premium raw cat food, almost 100 pounds worth, she would be willing to give us. She said she was in our area if we wanted to meet. We thanked her and said she could stop by.



After we loaded everything, she asked if she could see Max the Cat. When I brought him out, he ran away from her because he's a shy cat. She laughed about how he's still shy and went to get him from the guest room he ran into. He dodged her and ran into the main bedroom.  


She followed him into the bathroom in our room and I was a little upset because I consider our room a private area and she didn't even ask if she could enter. She saw my [positive] pregnancy test near the sink and decided that she should talk about it and ask a million questions as she destroyed our bathroom trying to reach Max.


After a few minutes, she decided to leave. We thanked her again for the amazing food(Max loves it!) and thought it would be the last time we see her. 

Now she's constantly emailing, texting, and calling about Max and asking when she could see him again. Now, we've never adopted before Max but we have fostered and this doesn't seem to be normal to us. She gets slightly upset if I tell her that we're too busy now and maybe another day will work.

I feel so bad for not wanting to keep in contact with this woman because she brought Max really great food when she didn't have to. However, I really don't want to keep talking to her. Any suggestions for how to end this politely would be very appreciated.

**Tl;dr:** Adopted cat and now shelter owner keeps trying to see him in our home. When we make excuses for why she can't see him, she gets upset.

"Teammates [25-30] left my [25] name out of the credits for an award nominated project... publications have gone out already and it’s too late too do anything. Should I bring it up?


Long story short, a project of our (team of 4) was nominated for an internationally-known award. We (the team, plus non-team coworkers from the office) all went to the awards gala and had a good time. We didn’t end up winning. 

The award is run by a magazine, and at the end of the gala night, the awards edition of the magazine was given to each of the gala attenders. Each nominated project has a blurb in the issue. When I opened to the page with our project, my heart sank when I saw that our office director and the other 3 members were credited, but I was not. 

Two of the team members have media/promo related roles in the offices, while the third is a very close friend to one of them. I suspect the three of them may have submitted the blurb together and forgotten about me. Best case scenario. In the office we are all on very good terms, but while the three of them spend time together outside of work, I usually do not as I live further. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. This is definitely building resentment. I will only be at this office for a few more months (due to other unrelated factors, I like this office) so I am not sure if bringing it up is a good idea, especially since I don’t see any possible solution to the problem (lack of published credit), and I don’t know if bringing it up will create worthless drama. I don’t think I care for an apology. It’s just a shitty situation and I feel super shitty. What can I do? 

tldr - Was the only one not credited for my contributions to an award nominated project in a high profile magazine. Too late to do anything to rectify. Not sure how to cope with bitter feelings and whether I should bring it up with teammates. "
"I [20s/M] hate it when my mother [50s/F] touches me, she thinks it's cute and harmless, even when I tell her it's harassment.


I know this sounds weird, but my mother just loves to poke, prod, hug me all the time. She slaps me on the backside, pats me on the belly, goes through my hair for grey hairs, grabs my feet when I walk up the stairs, and I absolutely loathe being touched, especially like this. In addition to all this, she insists on kisses on the cheek and back massages often. I get angry, plead with her to stop, or shout at her; she just laughs it off saying I'm just a dumb baby, sometimes accompanied with mocking baby talk nonsense.

The few times I did manage to get her to stop this, she reverts back to it within days. She claims to forget ever promising (I do believe this), and that I'll always be her big baby. She says this is harmless, and just showing affection. Her family and culture (Indonesian) brought up in is very touchyfeely admittedly, but she goes to extremes.

In public too she acts an little like this; just last year taking a bus back home from shopping, I was sat next to her and opposite a few girls. She kept going on about how one of them was so beautiful and ""upper class"" looking, and why I don't ask her out. She did so loudly, some of the passengers were mocking and laughing, she didn't seem to realize it was directed at us. I cried when I got home, and told her why, she genuinely thought she was doing me a favor as I had no girlfriend, and was confused as to why I was upset. I honestly think she lives in her own world, she really does believe all this. If nothing else, my mother is no liar.  

I have an older sister, and mother does not dare even hug her without clear permission. She is frightened of her because she can be brutal, and even violent towards her. I dislike my sister's cruelty, but it actually works, but I would never  physically hurt my own mother.

If it makes it any difference, I am on the autistic spectrum, and I have difficulty coping with certain day-to-day things. My father passed away over a decade ago, he was nothing but pure love and kindness.

tl;dr: mother keeps treats me, her 20 something son as a baby, despite repeatedly being told why I hated it."
"My [19F] Mother [45F] keeps letting my autistic brother [9M] ride his bike around the neighborhood with nothing but a diaper on with our dog.


Background Info: I live with just my Mom, Grandma, and Brother. My mom has always been lazy, making my grandmother still do her laundry and clean her room even to this day, but it has gotten to a point that she barely watches my brother who has severe autism and lets him practically run wild outside with our dog loose in the streets.

We've already had several visits by the police over the years because of our neighbors calling the police over this but Mom will still sit on the couch and would rather stare at her phone even when he has obviously left the house (Sometimes fully naked!) with our dog (Who was been known to run in the middle of the street, nearly get hit by cars all the time, and has been brought home by many people inducing bus/taxi drivers.)

Once it gets through to her head that ""hey, maybe I shouldn't have the cops called on me again for not watching my kid"" she'll just stand at the front door and just scream at the top of her lungs for him and the dog to come back home, which can go on for several minutes before she eventually goes outside and looks for them or get grandma to do it.

I have given up trying to get him inside my self because he has gotten so violent with me from her finding it funny when he hit me when he was little and yelling at me when I punished him myself and would always say ""Sissy, stop yelling at my boy!"" and then let him keep hitting me. On the off chance that I do try to get him inside myself Mom still yells at me for ""over reacting"".

Another that bothers me though is she sometimes tells people that grandma always beats him with belts and rods as a joke (which she only did once and that was because he was biting and attacking her when mom or me wasn't home) and laughs about it despite it obviously making people extremely uncomfortable. I honestly can not see how she thinks this is okay.

Honestly i'm not gonna be surprised if CPS comes over one day. We've had several visits every couple years or so already for different reasons.

TL;DR: Mom is letting brother with severe autism ride his bike with our dog loose around the neighborhood almost naked, got cops called on several times and still refuses to change."
"I think my BF (M25) filmed us... need advice :(


please help,

I think my BF (m25) filmed us (F20) having sex. We have been together for almost a year. The other day he picked up his phone during sex and I could feel his hand behind me. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was checking the time and quickly hid his phone. After sex, I asked if i could set an alarm on his phone for work but he hesitated and he ran off to the bathroom with his phone. I know that he has done this before with past partners and has videos of his exes on his laptop. He has also been trying to convince me to cam on Chaturbate with him as he finds it erotic but I do not feel comfortable with that type of thing. I feel like sex doesn't mean anything to him and he is slightly/porn sex obsessed. What should i do?

Tl;dr: think my bf filmed us having sex, not sure what to do or how to approach it?"
"My Husband (M31) wants me (F27) to stop giving rides to co-workers.


So to get right down to it. I work at a retail store, part-time, closing shift to get out of the house from time to time and to get extra pocket money. I used to stay at home full-time with our son (M5) but I found that I was becoming a recluse and it made my social anxiety 10x worse. I have been working at the store I'm at for almost 2 years now.   


There is this really nice kid there we'll call him Tim (M18) most people find him a bit annoying, because he talks a lot, makes lots of jokes constantly. But he's a nice kid who means well. His family is really poor. His upbringing was shitty. He lives with his Mom and younger (half) sister. (Dad has never been in the picture). He's also been struggling to save for a car because his mother needs quite a bit of financial help. I sympathize with this a lot. I grew up somewhat poor, and while my parents never asked me for money. They couldn't really help me either. I was able to do more because the kindness of others.   


My husband is a very black and white person. Things should be one way, and has no qualms about addressing it. I have given rides home to other co workers once or twice and while he was weary of that, and I could tell he was annoyed that it took time out of our time together (maybe 30 minutes max) all he said was ""Just don't become the store's personal Uber.""  


I take Tim home MAYBE 1 time a week, it's usually every other week. Most people don't have just closing shifts like me. Dropping him off takes me like maybe, and I'm not exaggerating, like 5 minutes max. His apartment complex is just off the road I take home anyway.  I call my husband everytime I'm leaving from work so he can unlatch the door for me. (Our son learned how to unlock the deadbolt). And about the third time I called him, and told him I was taking Tim home, my husband sighed and I could tell he was upset.   


When I got home later that night, we got into a fight because he said I was becoming an Uber service. I told him that it felt mean to say no when he asked me if I could give him a ride. Because I know that means a $10 dollar Uber, when it's really no trouble for me at all. And I know how much that $10 means for him and his family.  


This is where I fucked up. I kept taking Tim home but I stopped telling my husband. It felt cruel to say no. And it would seem out of character and I hated the idea of saying, ""Sorry but my husband wants me directly home.""   


Tim messaged me on Facebook last night saying ""Thanks for the ride, I seriously appreciate it."" And my husband asked me who that was when he heard the notification. So I told him, ""Tim messaged me to say thank you for the ride home.""  


My husband blew up. I understood why. I lied by omission. I should have just told him from the start. But then he started talking about how I should know how paranoid he is about my male co-workers because of his ex-wife who left him for one of her co-workers. How is that fair? I understand what a defining time in his life that was. I physically hurt for him because of it. But how is that fair? I met him about a year after it happened. He talked about how he had the philosophy ""I don't care who she kisses as long as she comes home to me tonight.""  


Why can't I get that same amount of trust? I don't want to sleep around, but I would also like the benefit of the doubt, that I'm not going to leave him to run away with this 18 year old CHILD. My husband told me ""That's exactly what \[ex\] would have said, and I'm sure she really meant it to."" I told him that I think it's pretty fucked up that his ex stole all of his trust in me away.  He tells me that I have no idea how trusting of a person he was, but that had changed before he met me. That I ""had never met that man.""   


I need to tell Tim next time that he asks for a ride ""Sorry I have to get home to my family."" and that while my husband understands what a shitty situation he's in that it's not my responsibility to fix it. And that he has to learn to make his own arrangements and save up for a car. I want to vomit thinking about saying that. I feel like to everyone at work that's out of character for me. I don't want to see him start scrambling and panicking because he has $.36 in his bank account and he can't afford an Uber. My husband is right about one thing, when Tim and I close together, he just kinda assumes (still asks but in a you can still give me a ride right? kinda way.)  


But most of all, I don't want my co-workers to think my husband is an asshole. I don't know what to do.   


I'm sorry that I rambled so much, and got sidetracked to a whole bunch of other problems.   


TL;DR Husband wants me to stop giving this kid I work with a ride home. I'm too empathetic to this kids issues and want to help. Husband has trust issues because I lied. Please help. "
"I (F33) have reason to believe my SO (M30) has installed spyware on my phone/laptop.


Throw away - which is hilarious, if the title is in fact true.   


My SO and I both were in really terrible relationships before we got together. I had just gotten out of a long term relationship with my kids' Dad, and he had just gotten divorced. We both came into this knowing we had trust issues, especially me.   


We had broken up about 3 months after we initially got together due to instability on both of our ends.  Neither of us were capable of having a healthy relationship, and after a surprise pregnancy and subsequent abortion I felt like I needed to focus on myself and finding stability for my kids' sake. I ended up breaking it off which he took terribly.  


I did not end up finding stability. Things in my life got much, much worse. We started talking 3 months later and I felt truly loved and supported. I was on the brink of suicide and he said everything I didn't know I needed to hear. A few weeks later, I became homeless and he opened his doors to me. We've been living together for a year now.

From the beginning, I told him that due to my past relationships going through my phone or spying on me was a deal breaker. A few months after I moved in, he confessed that he had taken my phone while I was sleeping and spent several hours reading years of conversations between my EX and I. He said he believed me when I told him what had happened in my previous relationship and how my EX treated me, but that he wanted to be sure he had the full story. He said he had gained such respect for me after doing it because it was exactly as I had told him. I told him that was a breach of my trust and I was furious. He said he wouldn't do it again and that he was sorry.  


A month or so later, he started acting oddly and making strange comments. I'm freakishly good at reading between the lines and confronted him with going through my phone again. He admitted to doing it. He said he was looking through my pictures this time - again while I was asleep - hoping to find cute couple pictures of us from our first go. He ended up finding sexually explicit pics of me with another guy while we were broken up that I wasn't even aware I had. He said he was ashamed of what he had done, and that that was something he never wanted to see. I didn't believe a word he said, but this time I made it absolutely fucking clear this was a huge problem for me and I WILL break up with him if he does it again.  


My EX was very tech savvy. I am aware of spyware and all the little ways someone can bypass security, although I don't know how to do it personally. When I moved in, my SO set me up an email under his admin account so I could work for him. I was hesitant, but he said it was more secure somehow. When I forgot my password, he got into the admin part and changed my password for me. Later, when I bought a new phone, he insisted on setting it up. I didn't want to but he made some excuses and I let it go not wanting to fight. He set it up under that email.  


Ever since then, every once in awhile, I will get that feeling that he's been reading conversations of mine. It's the way he says things, or statements that just seem to come out of nowhere that directly relate to things I've said to other people earlier that day. We've been having an ongoing issue for the last few months, and after I brought it up with a friend it has suddenly stopped... The ""coincidences"" just keep happening, more and more frequently.  


What if I'm just crazy? I feel like I'm being driven to tell friends about things I normally wouldn't because I'm angry he is spying on me. He is really uncomfortable with me saying anything negative about our relationship to outsiders. I don't agree, I think it is important. I was in a really bad relationship for 10 years and cut myself off from anyone who told me the truth because I didn't want to hear it. I don't want to do that again.   


I honestly don't know what to do from here. If I ask, I feel like he is going to deny it and just get better at covering it up. If he comes clean, it's over. He is so kind to me and has helped me so much in this past year. I believe he truly loves me, but he is also very possessive. He has made a lot of changes to becoming healthy with me and I'm very proud of where we are now. I feel guilty over having so much baggage from past relationships that I don't really feel like it's fair of me to throw everything away because of spying, but I know I won't be able to recover. I don't even know for sure if it is the case... if I bring it up I know I won't believe him either way so I don't think I should. What do I do?  


TLDR: I am almost certain my SO is spying on my texts/conversations but I can't prove it. This is a huge deal breaker for me. I don't think I will believe him if I ask and he denies it, and if he came clean it will be the end. I don't want to loose him, but I can't see how I could get past this. Outside opinions would be helpful."
"Is it wrong that I [27M] expect my wife [31F] to take care of housework if I earn all the money?


I've been a firefighter for three years now, and have been married for five. For the first two years of my marriage, I sold auto insurance before entering into firefighter training. For those same two years my wife worked at an indie bookstore and wrote freelance articles for some websites run by her former college professors. We actually met in college, but not in the way most people meet in college. She was a student earning her masters degree in literature, and I just happened to be trespassing on campus using the wifi.

After I became a firefighter we also had a son, who is now three years old. I work three days on (where I'm gone all day long), four days off, and am on emergency on-call at all times of course. When our son was born my wife and I both agreed that her mother could move in with us to help us with the kid. We rent a large house in the suburbs, so we have the room. My wife's father passed away several years before our marriage.

I'm generally happy in my marriage and we have regular sex, at least twice a week, which is, considering my work schedule, pretty regular. Sometimes I wish I could go to college and earn a degree (it's been a particular dream of mine to have a degree in art). Sometimes my wife's girlfriends give me a bit of a funny look when I tell them I never went to college, especially since she not only has a college degree, but also a graduate degree.

I am able to support all of us (wife, son, mother in law, self) with just my salary, so I don't feel too unaccomplished.

But my trouble lately is that over the years I've noticed that I'll come home absolutely exhausted from my time on-duty, and the housework won't really be done. I'll ask my wife about it, and she'll say she was tied up with caring for our kid and that anyway I should be doing half of the housework. I'm not thinking like some 1950s husband on TV where the wife keeps the home spotless and goes around the house in high heels and an apron, but it is really disheartening to come home to no food being ready and the floor being vacuumed. 

It's like, the moment I walk in the door, my mother in law and wife will act like I just ""tagged in"" and they tag out and go shopping or go out for coffee. Hello! I'm hungry here! And my son will be playing or sleeping and now I have to take care of him. I don't mind doing my share; I'll take care of my son when I'm home, but is it really too much to ask for a couple of hours to take a nap first? It's depressing to see a mess on the floor and signs that meals were prepared, yet there's no plate for me, and they know I'm coming home. Invariably I'll start vacuuming the floor, doing dishes, and other random household stuff. I'll be done in an hour, two at most. It makes me feel sad that neither my wife nor mother in law could do these things.

When I do these items of housework it's just cleaning up after them, and not myself. I don't really contribute to any mess at home because I'm very tidy when I'm there, and I've actually always done my own laundry at the station.

I tried talking to my wife about my concerns but she says it's sexist of me to believe that she should take care of all the housework. I told her I don't expect her to do all the housework because of course I will still take out the garbage and trim the trees and cut the grass. Then she acted like I was belittling her and suggesting she couldn't do these things. So then I said fine, you can take out the garbage and cut the grass and trim the trees and change the motor oil etcetera and I can vacuum and fold clothes, but she thought I was making fun of her.

Really I'm not making fun of her I just think that since it's not on the table who works to earn a salary (by default I guess that's me), she needs to do something at home to help the family too. She says that it's not fair for her to do all the housework since I get four days off every week. I say true, that's fair enough but when I explain to her how exhausting it is to be on duty three days in a row and that's why we get four days off, she thinks I'm exaggerating and making a hero of myself.

I don't expect her to do everything at home but I ask her maybe if she can have food ready for me or do certain chores while leaving certain other chores for me to do, then that can be more fair. She doesn't seem to really want to create a chart of responsibility though, and often just says the toddler stresses her out. I don't doubt her, I don't spend as much time with the kid as her and don't know what goes on when I'm not there, but I thought that's why I'm supporting her mother, too.

Anyway I don't want to fight with her and I know this post makes my wife look like a total B-word, but honestly she's not a bad person, and on a TMI level (sorry) she's amazing sexually. I know she means well but I also know her unmarried girlfriends have her ear and they're all college types with super progressive views, which I don't think necessarily are wrong but also I think I'm doing a little too much work here and am looking for advice on how to make my wife see things a little bit from my perspective.

Is it crazy to believe that if I earn 100&amp;#37; of the salary, that my partner should at least do a majority of the housework?

Thanks!

\*\*TL;DR: I work as a firefighter; wife is a stay-at-home mom. She thinks I should do half of all the housework. I'd like at least a hot meal when I come home."
"Gf [22F] has a lot of life-threatening allergies. We are visiting my parents in my home country and she wants my mom to cook for us. I [22M] suggested we bring our own food, but gf is upset b/c she thinks I just don't want to inconvenience my mom?


This is a big mess and I just need some outside perspective. I want to know if I'm being fair or irrational. 

So my gf and I are visiting my parents for the first time since we started dating over a year ago. My parents are SEAsian and still live in my home country. However, I came to the US at 13 to study and live with my uncle/aunt. 

We've been fighting over the past few days because she thinks I'm being insensitive. She asked me if my mom will be cooking for us, and I said of course but I don't know if she's capable of cooking specifically according to the list of allergies my gf has. I suggested that we bring back-up food that gf definitely can eat just in case, as my mom tries hard but allergies are seriously not a thing in my home country so it's likely she'll forget something or another. I didn't want to risk it. 

Of course, I told gf that I will relay to my mom the best I could about gf's allergies and dietary restrictions, but I only stated that I'm worried for gf because our style of cooking is very laid-back and un-western. There are no measurements and rarely any recipes. Recipes are all followed extremely loosely when they do exist. Even if my mom cooks something separate for gf, the risk of cross contamination is also extremely high as my parents tend to cook outdoors in a detached kitchen for a LOT of people. They are simply not educated enough to understand the different allergies and how to cook/prepare for someone with extreme restrictions and health issues. 

I was trying to be rational and helpful by stating that we should bring back-up food JUST in case. Because my gf's allergies also happen to be the ingredients in like 70&amp;#37; of our country's dishes (nuts, seafood, sesame, soy, etc.). I tell my gf that my mom uses certain condiments (like soy sauce or fish sauce) without thinking. Like she'll toss some in and do a taste and completely forget the dish even has soy sauce (mostly because the dish has 30 other ingredients as well). It doesn't help that gf's allergies aren't just mild allergies but extremely severe. She would have to go to the hospital if exposed to peanuts, for example. 

But gf is upset because she thinks I'm not trying hard enough to make my mom accommodate her and I only want to bring our own food so my mom won't be inconvenienced by her. She said her ex's mom was terrible about her dietary restrictions and intentionally tried to poison her because she didn't ""believe all her issues."" So she wants to eat my mom's food as PROOF that my mom is attentive and caring. 

I think she's being irrational. I see where she's coming from but risking her own health just to test my mom is seriously unwise in my opinion. She doesn't understand my local culture. My parents are beyond friendly people and my mom is deliriously excited to meet my gf, but there is SUCH A HUGE gap when it comes to dietary restricted foods and how to prepare them in a first-world country v. developing country. I would say there's a 90&amp;#37; chance of cross-contamination or accidental addition of something my gf is allergic too in my mom's meals. 

Gf isn't having it and insists that she will eat only what my parents prepare. She says bringing our own food is like having to apologize for her illnesses and she won't do it. She believes my parents will be good hosts and cook her food that won't send her to the hospital. I don't know what to do honestly. I've told my mom about how to prepare the food several times and she's confused every step of the way and asks a LOT of questions that show she obviously doesn't understand still. Our trip is coming up in 4 days and we are still fighting over this. Am I being irrational? Or is she? What should we do?

TLDR: Gf has a lot of life-threatening allergies (fish, soy, nuts) that also make up 70&amp;#37; of my home-country's dishes. We are visiting my parents in my country and gf expects my mom to cook for her. I suggested we bring our own food just in case as my mom understands very little about allergies and food preparation for people with restrictions. However, gf thinks I'm just protecting my mom and insists on eating ONLY my mom's food. I think she's being really irrational and careless. What should I do?"
"My mother [46F] went furious with me [19M] about my facial expression on a photo


However stupid the title may seem, the story is quite serious. 
It happened a few hours ago. We were walking around Graz during our summer vacation and my mom decided to take a selfie with some nice landmark behind her. I happened to be in the background and I made a silly face to the camera as a joke. 
Then we came back to the hotel and my mom checked the photo. She asked if I am proud of what I've done. I had no idea about what I had done wrong. She said my facial expression was showing my contempt for her activity of taking a selfie. I was like WTF, that didn't even cross my mind while making a face.  However I admit it could be interpreted as such. Next, I heard that it she's fed up with me (I didn't cause any other problems recently) and she demands respect and it's either her or me to leave the trip and come back to Warsaw. 
However, dad talked with her behind closed doors and my 'punishment' is to recite The Decalogue twice a day, repeating the 4th commandment five times. (They know of my atheism BTW)
This is quite a bizarre situation for me since I accidentally got myself into trouble. I'm gonna do what they want, since escalating the conflict is no solution

TLDR: made a silly face to the camera while mom was taking a selfie, which made her furious

Was my mother's behaviour normal? What else can I do to make things better?

Thank you all for words of advice!"
"My [32f] Husband [39m] is upset with me because I asked that he enforce our house rules while his daughter [16f] was here visiting for Father's Day. Was I


I guess I'll start by saying that we have five children in our blended household and Husband has two more children outside the house. In the house we have 8F, 9M, 11F, 12F, and 15M. All the children in the house are good, well behaved, well adjusted, respectful individuals. As is husbands oldest daughter \[21f\]. But this post is about his other daughter \[16f\], I'll call her Marie, which is a whole different story. We do not have custody of Marie. She's been in and out of group homes, psychiatric facilities, treatment homes for behavioral problem teens, etc. She's been diagnosed with ODD, BPD, RAD, and a host of other diagnosis. When she lived in our home she was out of control. She lied, stole, did drugs and drank, ran away, wracked up over $1800 in tickets, snuck boys in, and became violent with me and with our younger children. She is more difficult than all our other children combined and multiplied by 10.

  


So today, Father's Day, she came to the house to visit Husband, and it was during this visit he became upset with me. Though I let a lot slide with her in order to keep the peace, twice I respectfully asked him to enforce our house rules with her, and both times, while reluctantly doing so (sorta), he became upset with me over it, and started snapping at me about it. He's given me the cold shoulder for pretty much the rest of the day and evening. I can tell he's still upset. He didn't even say goodnight to me before going to bed. Husband is always defensive of her- he makes excuses for her, and let's her get away with far more than he would ever allow our other children to even think about. She has even told several people it is her life's goal to separate Husband and I.

  


The first instance today: Marie brought her 19 year old (reminder: she is 16) male to female cross-dressing boyfriend, whom she is currently living with, along with her. That was fine with me, once you get past the initial shock, he's actually a decent guy with a good sense of humor. Not really relevant to the story, but the 19 year old cross dressing boyfriend has a 3 year old daughter. Bringing the boyfriend over wasn't my issue, nor was the fact both of their necks are covered in hickies. My problem was that she kept sitting on his lap and wiggling around in front of us and in front of our other children. It was extremely uncomfortable for me, and I assume for our other kids, not to mention that it isn't the example I want set for our younger kids. I asked Husband to ask her to respect us and our home by not sitting on her boyfriend's lap. Husband told them to stop. Marie got very defensive about it. Her boyfriend became very embarrassed and appologised and blamed Marie for pressuring him into it. But ultimately they stopped. I thought that went ok. I did not try to say anything to her or try to enforce it myself because Marie does not respect me and has gotten violent with me in the past. She would undoubtedly spin anything I said to sound like I was antagonizing her.

  


Then issue two: Marie and her boyfriend (again remember that Marie is only 16) went out to my front porch, in full view of our younger children, and lit up cigarettes. I don't care that boyfriend did, he's 19, I don't care the Husband's oldest daughter does, she's 21. But I don't want our younger children thinking that we, as parents, will condone them smoking and let them smoke on our front porch before they are legally allowed to do so. I asked Husband to ask Marie to take her smoking out of view of our children. I didn't even ask that she not smoke at all... just that she do it where the younger kids can't see. He then blew up at me for trying to wreck his Father's Day. One quote from his angry rant was ""Do we really have to enforce all of YOUR rules TODAY on Fathers Day?"". Also ""Chill out and get over yourself!"" Then he sent our 15y son and his 21y daughter to tell Marie to move it elsewhere, rather than do it himself. After he snapped at me I ended up quietly crying in the bedroom. He didn't even care. Our (Husband's bio-son, so my step-son) 15y son even approached me and brought up how Husband would never allow them to act the way he allows Marie to and that Husband is like a different person when Marie is around. He treats 15y son and I like we're terrible people while he dotes on Marie's feelings. 

Was I wrong? Should I have just allowed his daughter to do whatever she wanted, no matter how disrespectful, and to hell with the example she is setting for the other 5 kids? What do I do now? 

  


TL;DR - I asked Husband to enforce that his 16y daughter not jiggle around on her boyfriend's lap or smoke where our 5 younger children could see and he acted like I was trying to ruin Father's Day and has been upset with me the rest of the day.

"UPDATE My [25F] friends [19F] boyfriend [19M] tried to take a snapchat of her, making fun of her, when she was being sick.


Firstly, I apologise about formatting as I am on my mobile. Also the original post is [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8fyyqr/my_25f_friends_19f_boyfriend_19m_tried_to_take_a/?st=JITZ0CJR&amp;amp;sh=0803459a) 

Secondly, I wanted to say that after my last post the comments on it were mixed. Some people thought it wasn’t a big deal and that I was overreacting, and some people thought that it was a red flag. In the end, I decided not to make a big deal of it incase I was just being daft. I mentioned what happened as casually as possible and she laughed it off, so I left it.

Anyway, this Friday I met him for the second time at a work social event. Once again, I got a funny feeling about him. He was loud, drunk, aggressive and he appeared to be alienating everyone around him. In short, he came across as fairly dislikable.

But I saw more of it than the rest of my colleagues, I felt like he was disrespectful to her, similarly to the snapchat thing. He made a snide comment about how she never wears make up and puts any effort into her hair. I felt like this was belittling. He also spent a good portion of the early part of the night flirting openly with another girl who was there. Also he said he thinks the only thing that’s cheating is PIV sex, and anything else is just ‘not right’. And, I felt like he kept trying to impress our colleagues at my friends expense, making fun of her, putting her down etc. He just said so many things I didn’t like, especially not for my friend.

As the night got on he got more aggressive. When I say aggressive I don’t mean he was necessarily picking fights with people, but I mean he was just extremely confrontational with everyone, arguing with everyone’s opinion, trying to one up everyone. And in my opinion, considering he’d met most people that night he probably should’ve made more of an effort to get on with them. He was also loudly telling anyone who would listen about how he was going to Dubai for a few months and how wild it was going to be.

The night ended with him being thrown out the bar we were in. And another colleague of mine walked outside and caught him screaming at my friend, whilst she was in floods of tears.

I feel awfully sad for her. I wish I had made a bigger deal about the snapchat thing, I wish I had gone with my gut and spoke to her about it when they first got together. I knew there was something off about him and now I feel like it might be too late to get involved. 

As, he has now gone away for a few months, I am hoping she will reflect on things and maybe decide she’s happier without him. I am convinced he will cheat on her in Dubai too as he has no respect for her even when she’s right in-front of him. I hope she figures out quickly that he isn’t a nice person. I wish I’d spoken to her, though I appreciate even then she probably would’ve done what she wanted to in the end.

TL;DR I should’ve listened to my gut. Snapchat boy is an arsehole."
"Step 1 (medical licensing exam) is ruining my [M28] relationship with my girlfriend [F27]; She did poorly and I'm struggling with empathy


**tl;dr** at the bottom.

Life hasn't been the same since step 1 results came back for my girlfriend. Step 1 is the exam to end all exams in med school. It's like the SAT of residency applications, and your score plays a huge role in which specialties you can pursue. Passing is a 194. Average is 230. Average for very competitive specialties is 245-250. Only \~20&amp;#37; of students achieve a score of 245 or higher.

Well, my girlfriend got a 195, but she was deeply, deeply invested in ophthalmology, a competitive specialty that she had worked with in the past. She talks about eyes like there aren't any other organs in the body, and she spent a better part of her first two years making connections within our school's ophtho department.

Here's where the trouble really begins. I'm an MD/PhD student, which means I am essentially stuck in our current city until I finish both degrees (8 years). No one from our school has ever matched *anywhere* for ophtho with a score that low, nonetheless in this city (which is a fairly competitive location). It's been about 1 month since she got the score back, and just about every night has been tears, but before I get into that, let me tell you about everything leading up to this.

\---------------

**The Lead Up to Step 1**

We met early in our first year. The relationship itself was amazing. She's gorgeous, funny, and interesting to say the least. I was an average student at first, but recognized that I needed to improve and pretty quickly rose up to the top 10&amp;#37; of the class. She struggled academically, failing one course and barely passing the rest. Med school is P/F for the first two years (except step 1), so she didn't make any effort to change. This turned into a point of conflict, especially since she often dragged me away from the library when I wanted to study more, **but it was something I realized I couldn't force on her.** This whole time we only fought about one thing: study time. I always wanted to study more, and she always wanted to study les**s. **

She wasn't lazy, but treated med school like a 9-5 job, and was often distracted during studying. Regardless of her grades or reports from classmates about studying like crazy, she she insisted she worked as hard if not harder than everyone else. I comforted her for 2 years through biweekly breakdowns whenever we got exam scores back. **I never mentioned my scores, but it was clear I was doing well, and she was clearly resenting me for it.** 

All of this was justified by our friend group, who insisted on continually telling her that ""P=MD, seriously don't worry about it."" I could see her clearly on a path to miss out on her dreams. I knew that for as much as telling her to relax helped her in the moment, she needed someone she trusted to tell her to step up her game. If I tried to even gently suggest that it wasn't abnormal to study longer, or that more studying would show better results, she saw it as extremely condescending. She started telling our friends (jokingly, but clearly with a purpose) that I was a ""gunner"" who studied day in and day out. **I quickly realized I wasn't in a position to change her behavior or attitudes. All I could do was be the best boyfriend I could be and completely divorce myself from her success.**

\---------------

**The Dedicated Study Period**

Students are given 6 weeks of dedicated study time. During this time people study daily for anywhere from 10 to 14 hours per day and review the things we were tested on throughout the first two years. She set a goal at 8 hours/day. This is getting long so I'll spare the details, but throughout the study period I became accustomed to receiving texts from her around 4:30 pm saying her brain was fried and she was done. Around 7 pm she would start pestering me, clearly feeling guilty that I was studying and she wasn't. I gave in around 8 pm, limited my studying to 10 hours/day so that I could help her with what was clearly intense anxiety, and I went home and watched several hours of netflix with her every night. This was hard for me, to feel like I was throwing away my time when I should have been studying for the most important exam of my life. I also started resenting her, feeling like she only cared about her own anxiety and not mine. I was desperately anxious and upset throughout this entire period, constantly moving between mountains of work and guilt-filled ""relaxation"" with my gf.

Throughout this time her practice tests showed clear indications that she would do poorly. She started with failing scores, started barely passing exams after a few weeks, and then miraculously scored very high on a final practice test (over 240). **Maybe I was wrong all along. Maybe I was the crazy one.**

\----------------

**Post Exam**

She got her exam score back and broke down. The last practice score was a fluke. For two weeks, I understood. I listened, usually for 3-4 hours a night, to her crying and venting. I told myself that even though it was preventable and largely her own fault, this is horrible for anyone, and I absolutely need to be there for her.

For a month after that, leading up to today, the crying has not stopped. Every night I wait until something is said that triggers her to go off. She cries and vents and talks about the same things. She blames everyone except herself. Every night I listen to an impassioned, tear-filled speech. It starts with how her parents are uneducated and have screwed her over (she grew up poor, but her father has a foreign college degree and was making $100K+ by the time she was in middle school). She moves onto how nothing has been easy for her, how she had to apply to med school multiple times, how she didn't get financial support from her parents (they did pay for college), how she has no one on her side (she had mentors I would kill for), how the exam wasn't fair, how everyone with a high score (myself strongly implied) is awful at interacting with co-workers and residents. Then she goes on a rant about how every other specialty sucks. How she'd rather quit medicine than do anything else (despite having $300K+ in loans). **She told me that if she had to choose between ophtho and me, she'd choose ophtho, and then later apologized and took it back.** I don't know what to believe.

I can basically recite her speech by heart now, and I'm losing my genuine feelings of empathy for her. I feel more distant than ever. It is her fault this happened, and I not only warned her 1000 times that it was possible, but I directly set an example of what it would take to get the sort of score that sets you up for those specialties. To this day she's looking for loopholes into the specialty. Finding out who to befriend and talk to, but she hasn't changed her study habits. I can tell already she will miss top grades due to written exams given at the end of every rotation. She gets great evaluations (she's a people person, and it shows), but even with connections to the right people, she's going to need to show massive improvement.

I already see her heading down the same paths. She's taking the ""seriously just relax and don't study so much"" advice to heart. It's like watching a slow-motion train wreck all over again, and she hasn't once told me she wishes she had studied harder or changed something about the way she did things. I just can't relate anymore. She has literally no insight. But despite all of this, she's a wonderful person outside of med school. She adds to my life in amazing ways I've never experienced with another person. This could all be for nothing if she can't (or won't) even stay in the city we are in.

So I guess I'm asking... how do I regain empathy for someone who clearly needs it, but maybe doesn't deserve it? How do I move forward and help her do the same?

\-------------

**tl;dr**

I don't blame any of you for skipping that. If you read it all, thank you. My gf and I are in med school. I am stuck in this city for the next 8 years due to my program, and she just nearly failed the exam that you need to score very highly on to match into her dream specialty. It was very clearly a result of lack of effort on her part and taking some very bad advice from peers while ignoring the good advice. Since getting her score back, she has blamed everyone but herself and has developed a nightly ritual of crying to me for 3-4 hours about all the people and things that have made her life so difficult. I'm losing empathy and losing hope for my relationship continuing. How can I regain empathy, and what can I do to get her out of this horrible funk?"
"My (30f) best friend (32f) suffered a stillborn. I'm about to give birth any day now.


My best friend and I both got pregnant around the same time and everything seemed so perfect. We were both having girls, and she was only a month or so ahead of me.

She gave birth last month and lost her baby. I can't stop thinking about it and it's killing me. I feel so bad for her and her husband and couldn't stop crying when I found out. 

I'm scared that if I have a healthy baby, I'll make them feel worse. I'm also scared that I won't have a healthy baby. I'm basically just scared. I feel guilty and I have no idea what to say to her other than ""I'm so so sorry"". 

This is going to sound ridiculous, but a part of me is now convinced that I won't have a healthy baby because there's no way the universe could be that cruel to them. I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety now and it's keeping me up at night. I don't want to make this about me, but my stomach is in knots thinking about it. 

Is there anything I can do for them? I want to give them space because I feel like my presence would just remind them of their loss (I'm almost 9 months pregnant) and I don't want to upset them further. But I don't want to neglect them either. We live in the same neighborhood and I'm scared to run into them now because it's still so fresh.

**Tldr: my best friend lost her baby and I feel guilty and terrified of what's to come. I'm scared she won't want to see me ever again.**

"I [21 F] feel uncomfortable after meeting my supervisor's [31 M] wife [33 F]


This is a bit of a weird situation. I'm a third year college student, and this summer I'm doing an internship with one of my professors. The professor in question, Matt, is one of the top researchers in our field so this is a huge opportunity for me. 

Matt is an excellent supervisor and this internship has been nothing but wonderful so far.

 Last night, my entire research team attended a conference at which Matt was a panel guest. When I got there, he called me over to introduce me to his wife, and that's when things got weird. She looks EXACTLY like me. Seriously. We have the same hair color and style, same glasses, same facial features, similar body types and heights, and were even wearing extremely similar outfits. It was like I entered the twilight zone. 

It was super awkward when we met, as we both were clearly aware that we look like carbon copies of each other, but Matt didn't say anything. I ended up sitting next to her when Matt went up to join his panel, and we made small talk for a few minutes before she said ""Sooo... We kinda look alike right?"" I was really relieved and thought we were going to be able to laugh about it, but she did not think it was funny at all and was super icy towards me for the rest of the conference.

After the conference, everyone went out to dinner and Matt's wife got a little tipsy. We didn't speak directly throughout dinner but she seemed very friendly and normal, much nicer than she had been during the conference. 

I thought everything was good and assumed I had just read her wrong, but as everyone was leaving and saying their goodbyes, she pulled me aside and said ""I know your game. Stay away from my husband.""

I was so caught off guard that i just stood there like an idiot and didn't say anything. She walked back over to the group before anyone noticed us talking.

Well now I'm extremely uncomfortable. I don't even know what she meant by her statement. I have no ""game"" and have never been inappropriate with Matt. 

I don't know what to do now. Do I bring this up with Matt or just pretend it never happened? What if I see her again? How should I act?

tldr: supervisors wife told me to ""stay away from her husband"" but i have no interest in him and have never been inappropriate at work. What do I do?"
"I [33F] decided not to let my parents [65/70] live with my husband [35] and me and now they hate me. Should I apologize so we can move on?


My husband and I own a small apartment building where we live in one unit and rent out the other two. I posted here once before.

Recently, my parents sold their house through a settlement/dispute with their neighbor and wanted to live with us. We initially said yes, then said no when they refused to sign a lease.

Then they decided they would sign a lease, and did, and then we decided not to honor their lease. We refunded them their money and they said it was okay, they understood and would find something else. It was very stressful for me because I always do whatever it is they say. I mean, sometimes we disagree, but this is probably the first time I actually went and said no; I usually just do whatever they want. I just was really stressed out with the thought of them living with us. They had a lot of demands about the property and I was nervous that there would be more after they moved in. Also, they have two dogs and the apartment is older with less sound attenuation and on the third floor. I wasn't thinking. So I told them no, leaving them about a week or so to find a new place, though most of their furniture was going to go into storage anyway. At one point they were looking at renting something out of state or buying something somewhere or something else entirely.

I should mention: I have always helped them move in the past. All along I encouraged them to do whatever it was that was interesting to them at the time, whether renting or buying a place in Florida, TN, or New York, all of which were options at one time or another. They have had months to make a decision and then didn't. This is the first time I have not bought boxes, packed, called movers, etc, since they moved in 1996. Usually I move them b/c they're not great at that stuff.

I know, it doesn't look good, I feel terribly guilty. My brother [29] lives with them and is an alcoholic and drug addict. He is not sober. He is suicidally depressed. I gave them some numbers for intervention people but they didn't really do anything about it. I don't feel safe with him living with them and I don't want him to live with us, and that's part of why I ultimately said no. He would have ended up in our apartment building for sure as he has nowhere else to go. My parents are both children of alcoholics and my mom is also an alcoholic but relatively high functioning.

My parents have guaranteed income that is about 4x what we make monthly and they also have cash to buy another house outright if that's what they want. I just figured they would buy something or rent something; there's lots to rent in their price point. They could afford to pay up to about $3500 a month or more, I suspect. I have another brother who lives out of state but he also is not talking to me I think b/c my parents already have. They have never given us money, though they did contribute a few thousand bucks to our wedding costs a few years ago, which was super generous of them at the time. Periodically I have had to lend them or one of my brothers money because they are not great with money.

Now nobody in my family is talking to me and I feel like an idiot. This happens from time to time, I guess. It's all little things. A few years ago we went to the movies at Christmas and I tripped and fell and hurt myself--I didn't see the step, it was dark. My brothers made fun of me and when I said it bothered me, my parents said I was being too sensitive. I am usually too sensitive with these types of situations. Usually I apologize profusely to try and make amends and make it up to them somehow, though I feel like I really transgressed this time. I feel really guilty.

TLDR: I told my parents they couldn't live with us and I essentially broke their lease, though I gave them the money back that they wanted to pay to live in our apartment. I feel guilty; should I apologize?"
"My tall friend[21F] seems bitter about the fact that most of the guys I've dated are tall even though I'm short[20F].


So this could totally just be me over reacting but my friend, let's call her Alicia, has become more and more vocal about the fact that I should stick to people that are around my own height. 

We've been friends throughout highschool where height wasn't too big of an issue but as she grew taller, I stayed short. I'm around 5'1 and she's around 5'9. 

Most of the guys I've dated have been quite tall. However, that doesn't mean i'm only interested in tall guys- I've been interested in guys with all sorts of shapes and sizes it just happens that the guys that end up working out with me are taller. 

At first, it'd be little jabs which has evolved into insults like my boyfriend and I looking like we're in a daddy daughter relationship or the fact that I should 'stick to my own kind'  and that i'm 'on her turf'and blah blah. It's not that often, just when we're a little tipsy and she always apologizes afterwards if I bring it up when we are both more aware.

However, it feels more and more pointed. Like the other day she straight up asked how it was even possible for us to be intimate. I actually got a little annoyed at that and told her I was flexible and we make it work. In hindsight, wasn't a very nice thing to say but I'm nearing the end of my rope. 

tl;dr: I tried talking to her about this over coffee but she just says it's all jokes and all that. How do I go about talking to her so we can resolve this?"
