"TIFU by trying to play my dad’s didgeridoo.


So my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in Australia 10+ years ago. My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I’d eaten too much cheese and couldn’t be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I’ve never actually tried to play it (it’s more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it’s time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what’s happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don’t think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

TL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

Edit; woah gold! And front page! Ta! Glad you all like/hate my story"
"TIFU by deleting my dad's 20 year old primary business email address and ruining his Christmas


So this just happened. Background: I'm in my early/mid twenties and recently transitioned from being a student to being on my own and paying my own bills. My dad has both a hotmail and an MSN (I know) email address that he uses for work. The msn one is one he's had for like 20 years.  

So I got a new Xbox One for Christmas and I decided that now would be a good time to disassociate my ~10 year old gamer tag from his email address and switch it to my own. I figured this would be a simple fix: almost any other subscription service I'm aware of has a way to do this. I did the googling, I checked Reddit, I scoured the menus of the Xbox and the only ""solution"" that I found instructed me to go into my dad's Microsoft account, add my new/intended email address as an alias, and then to remove his old ones as aliases. This originally seemed a little fishy but every old reddit post I found about my similar issue gave the same/similar upvoted solution so I figured that there was something that I was unaware of on the back end for how this all works. So I make the changes as instructed and of course it did not solve my issue as intended.  The Xbox account was now recognizing my new gmail account, however my dad no longer had access to his hotmail/MSN emails. No problem, I'll just go back in and follow the same steps in order to re-add his old accounts and then I'll remove my gmail. Everything goes well until I try to re-add the msn account.  When I try to do so, I'm given an error message that reads, ""restricted email domain."" 

Fuck. 

So for those unaware, msn is an archaic (paid subscription) email service that is owned by Microsoft that isn't supported too heavily by them when it comes to the addresses in the MSN domain. I spent almost 3 hours on the phone with customer support and every representative gave me the same message: my dad's account is gone. Just gone from existence. He cannot receive emails to it, he can't sent emails from it, he can't even have emails redirected to his still-existing email address. He also has no access to any of his old emails.  Again, this is his primary business email that he puts on his business cards and his company's website. There is literally no recourse for this except to ""attempt to recreate the email account under the same address after 30 days."" Although even this wouldn't regain him access to his old emails from the past 20 years. 

And the cherry on top: after it became painfully obvious that I wasn't going to solve my dad's issue, I connected with Xbox live support (which I should have done from the get-go) and after explaining what I would like to do with my Xbox account, they basically told me that Microsoft has no such way to change email addresses on Xbox accounts (when the Xbox account is connected to a Microsoft email address) without removing the email address in question from existence. 


Merry Christmas  :\


TL;DR I tried updating my Xbox live email address and basically deleted my father 20 year old email address from existence. Permanently. "
"TIFU by kicking my 2 year old daughter in the face


Happened yesterday... My daughter is 2 (well, will be at the weekend). For Christmas, she got a wooden kitchen and has been enjoying lots of pretend play; cooking, washing up, all the shit you do in the kitchen. 

We’ve been encouraging her to wash her hands regularly in readiness for potty training, and yesterday she was using her pretend ketchup bottle as soap and washing her hands in her little sink. This soon became washing mummy’s hands. 

I was merrily stretched out on the floor having a chilled 5 minutes while she occupied herself running to the sink and ‘getting some water’ then coming back to wash my hands. Then she decided to wash my feet. My tickle reflex booted in and I kicked her right in the face, really fucking hard. Luckily it hasn’t bruised but we had lots of tears and she had a big red patch in the middle of her forehead. 

Mother of the year right here but I guess it could have been much worse!

TL;DR - daughter was pretending to wash my feet and it tickled me so I booted her square in the face. 

Edit: It’s remarkable how many people thought it was her dad as they read this. &lt;Insert something poignant about sexism / gender roles here&gt;"
"TIFU by using Google Home to convince my kids they weren't getting any presents.


 So today I came up with an evil plan to use my Google Home to make the kids be good. I found that you can get the Home to say anything you need using the custom Shortcuts settings from the home app. So I spent a little time perfecting a role play between Google and myself.

Trigger:
""Hey Google, Are any of my children on the bad boys and girls list?""

Response:
""I have just checked with Santa and yes, both Laura and Joel appear on the bb and g list this year.""

After a couple of seconds of shock and confusion. Laura was screaming and Joel slowly sank to the floor bawling in disbelief. It took 5 minutes to convince them that I had played a trick and yes, I was bad dad.

Feel free to try it yourself if you hate your children. The action is 'repeat after me blah blah blah'

TL;DR kids will believe anything Google tells them. Don't use this against them.

Edit: for those asking how? Home App &gt; settings &gt; shortcuts &gt; https://imgur.com/gallery/BpcJN

Edit2: BB and G list is a reference to popular children's Christmas book. Aunty Claus by Elise Primavera. "
"TIFU by getting too drunk while playing pokemon Go


So this happened just now. Like I’m still in a towel from the shower.

My girlfriend and I are avid Pokémon goers. We have bet $100 on who can catch all the pokemon in every new generation first (she has won both 1 and 2). Due to the Christmas season she has been working 7+ shifts a week at her job as a server at a popular brewpub as many of her colleagues are out of town. She has not been able to catch many of the new Pokémon, and I am very much ahead of her in this bet, by a LOT. 

So tonight she gets off work around 11pm and she says she wants to go pokemoning. Ok, I’ve already been today for about 2.5 hours, but I’m game. We live smack dab in the middle of downtown and players have been setting off lures all day. There’s a “loop” of about 5 square blocks encompassing our house, our liquor store and maybe 25 pokestops all going off with a lure. 

So we head out. Immediately I have to poop. “fuck it” I’ll just hold it, what’s the worst that could happen? First trip passing by our liquor store we both buy two airplane bottles of cinnamon whiskey, as it’s like 30 degrees F out. To keep warm, you know? Second time around about 30 minutes later we each buy another because why not? The first two loosened us up and we’re having fun. We’re joking and laughing and really having a fun time just the two of us on Xmas Eve. 

UH OH! The feeling that I have to poop intensifies. Alcohol and walking has exacerbated it. We’re on the last loop of the night and my GF is like “dude one more loop and we’re home”. I agree that sounds fair, we buy two more shots of cinnamon whiskey at our liquor store and head home. The problem is for reasons only fate can explain we keep coming up on rare pokemon (or at least pokemon my GF doesn’t have). Every time I’m like “that’s great! I really got to go!!” and we just keep on playing. It gets unbearable.  I’m like “fuck it. you stay here I’m running home.”

Ok be honest: all of y’all have had that moment where you have to poop but you have a ways to go. You can run but it makes your poop more urgent. You can walk but it takes longer. What to do? Well I did a walk/run. I squeezed my buttocks together for all they were worth and I hustled home to the toilet. I stood there holding my waistband knowing that the act of squatting would unleash my angry bowels. Standing at attention was the only thing holding my poop in.

In one deft move I pulled my pants down and squatted over the toilet and projectile shit everywhere. Only I didn’t make it. Not a single drop of shit went into the toilet. 35% was on my clothes. Mostly my Hanes underwear, a bit on my long johns (like I said cold!), a large portion on my jeans, leather belt, and a drop or two on my T-shirt. 65% was on the toilet. The  toilet seat, the lid, the tank, the little space between the tank and the lid. Semi-liquid shit. Think Texas chili.

I’m freaking out. “OMG I not only shit my pants, I shit the entire room”
My GF knocks on the bathroom door. She just got home and she needs to use the toilet. Jesus. I’d been home only 30 seconds. That’s the time I saved by running? She walked and got home only 30 seconds behind me. This whole thing could have been avoided if I had just been patient. Whatever. “GO AWAY” I yell. Like I’m gonna let her know what’s going on. Yeah right. I’ll die before I tell her anything.

At this point I need to elaborate on out living situation. My GF and I live in a two-bedroom apartment we share with another woman. This woman is cool but works 6am in the morning. Me and GF are night owls, we stay up till 3am sometimes later. Her bedroom is against the wall of the bathroom. I’m already convinced she has woken and can already hear me frantically peeling off my clothes and starting the shower. I really don’t want to have to explain why I’m waking her up at 2 in the morning with multiple toilet flushes so I purposefully neglect to flush the toilet containing a literal shit-ton of shit covered toilet paper for fear of waking her. I think to myself “I’ll give it one good flush at the end to look casual”. Plus I don’t want my GF to get suspicious. The toilet paper builds into a mound. I chance a flush. The toilet clogs. “FUCK” Ok at this point I have no choice but to ask my GF for help because I am complete mess. I have gotten shit everywhere, all over my hands and the sink, I have shit running down both legs. I get shit on the doorknob just opening the door. Ew.

I go out to the living room naked. I say “Um.. I need help”. She says “Yeah I can see shit running down both your legs”. Yes it was gross. “Please help me” she stifles a laugh. No she full on laughs, “Haha you shit yourself haha”. She’s a good GF, in that despite her amusement she is supportive. She says, with my shit covered clothes on the bathroom floor, “Ok I’ll help you, but I have to go first.” The toilet is inoperable. She has no other choice but to proceed to pull down her pants and panties and pee into the bathtub that is currently running full blast with shower water. 

She goes quiet. She gets wide eyed. She looks up. A look of pure shock is on her face. “FUUUUUCK! I really didn’t mean to” I say “really didn’t mean to what?” she gives me that sheepish apologetic grin. I look in the bathtub. There is a massive gigantic shit in the bathtub. She screams, “I didn’t mean to, I couldn’t hold it” WTF? Are kidding me? I know that scream woke our roommate up. 

I say “thanks for making me feel a LOT better about myself” she says “FUCK YOU! It was an accident!” and runs out of the bathroom. So now I have shit all over me, Shit all over my clothes on the floor, Shit all over the toilet, shit semi-over the floor, and a huge turd in the bathtub. I have now to clean up all with a clogged toilet and no plunger. Also I am pretty sure my roommate has awoken and knows exactly what’s going on. If the noise didn’t wake her I’m sure the smell will. Ugh I want to kill myself. 

Well I jump in the shower (with a cold tallboy-this is not the time to be sobering up. I have shit cleaning to attend to, and I do not want to remember it. Plus, shower beer) and first order of business, squishing that big-ass turd down the drain with my toe. Fuck if I’m gonna pick it up. No thank you. Then I soap, rinse, and towel, and I put all my clothes in a trash bag, then another trash bag, then another, because you can’t be too careful. Best to have multiple layers. Then I delicately clean the rest of the toilet and the floor and every other thing that might have shit on it. I use steaming hot water and Comet to rinse the toilet from top to bottom and the sink and the tub, and the floor. I pray to god my roommate didn’t hear a thing. 
The toilets still clogged, but I put up a sign so hopefully she won’t venture in and see a toilet filled with TP that was clearly used for wiping shit off the floor and not for wiping shit off an asshole. Yes, there is a difference. Go try both and tell me there’s not. 

Anyway this will always be remembered at the Shitmas 2017.
Happy Shitmas everbody.

TL/DR: Projectile shit all over myself, my clothes, and my bathroom. Asked my girlfriend for help, and she promptly took a shit in the bathtub and left, leaving me with a bunch of shit to clean up on Christmas Eve. Merry Shitmas

Edit: thanks for the gold, and all the comments, you all are great"
"TIFU by thinking I was pooping blood and heading right to the emergency room. [NSFW]


Obligatory: not today, but happened last Christmas season. 

During one of my 9 am morning shits in December last year, I discovered a *lot* of blood on the toilet paper upon wiping. I never felt like anything had been wrong while the movement was taking place, so I had no idea what was coming. I could feel the color leave my face. Had to have been an 8/10 on the whiteness scale. 

I immediately walked and talked to my supervisor and said I felt sick enough that I needed to get checked out ASAP. They also made a comment about how white my face looked. 

On my way to the ER, which was close to my work anyway, I text a friend what had been going on and that I was going to get checked out, and no one else. 

I always wonder how people who work in reception deal with arrivals like mine. “What are you here to be seen about today?” Me, paraphrasing: “Ass blood.”

There’s been a history of colitis in my family. I have usually been health conscious and know my family’s medical history going a ways back. It also includes cancer. I had WebMD levels of self diagnosis freak out at first, even knowing it could be anything or even still more probably: nothing. 

I get taken back to the ER, take my clothes off, and am instructed to lay on my stomach. They inform me they are going to examine my butt to see if I’d turn anything and get a sample. As the doctor is looking in my ass, I can’t help but wonder if today will get any better, or much worse. 

He tells me he doesn’t see any sort of damage, and takes a sample to the back room to test. I’m sitting in there a while, trying to relax by listening to podcasts and not think about what happened so far that day. 

When the doctor returns to the room, he says here’s good news. Whatever I’d found was not blood. That relief is quickly replaced by panic and shame as I realized what I’d done. 

**Backstory/Flashback**

It’s become a joke to my friends how much I like cookies over the past decade. Jokes on jokes on jokes about me and my dear, sweet cookies. 

The night before my hospital visit, I visited my local Target establishment and stocked up on all things holidays. Ornaments, lights, a new angel for my tree, and holiday cookie mix. Among the two mixes I’d bought, *red velvet cookie mix*.

I made cookies that night as I decorated my home, and when they were done I told myself I would only have two. Two became 4. As long as I’d eaten 4, I’ll finish off the Tupperware. Eventually I couldn’t sleep, so I got up to eat more cookies with milk, like a good Santa. 

I ate a box of red velvet cookies in one evening. 

**Back to present**

The doctor had asked if I’d eaten anything with food dye in it. Why, yes I had. I’m 10/10 on the whiteness scale as I realize and explain what had happened. 

Bless that man's soul, he tried so hard to hide his reaction. The nurses behind the curtain sure couldn’t when he told them about the cookies. I could pinpoint the moment they learned. I nod, yes I deserved that. 

I wipe the rest of the lube off my ass and put my pants back on. Ready to put the not-quite-butt-blood incident behind me, I head back out into the world. A little more wary of cookies than I once was. 

Tl;dr: Thought I pooped blood, went to ER, nope, cookies. 

Happy Holidays everyone!"
"TIFU by giving my wife a black eye for Christmas because I wanted to prove to my daughter that I was a man


So, this happened on Christmas Eve. My wife cooked us this incredible dinner with candles and everything and as we were putting everything away to binge on some Christmas movie spree, my little girl said that people couldn’t *really* put candles out with just their fingers because nobody can touch fire. This triggered something within me. Here’s a chance to prove to my daughter that I am a super human being and she will love it. I tell her that I can and she doesn’t believe me, so I show her. 

I snuffed that candle out like a motherfucker, and proudly stood there with my “you see? I am a god!” eyes that I like to do when I cook a good steak, or do some cool shit in bed with my wife. I thought my daughter would be delighted, but she had her eyes wide open and she then started to blow at the table and I saw something in the corner of my eye; a little piece of the wick had broken off and fallen onto a paper napkin with christmassy shit written all over it, and my daughter pretty much caused it to ignite. Being a man, I put that puny flame out with my bare hands. I just bitchslapped that fire away and my daughter was very impressed. 

All of a sudden, I feel this stinging sensation on my finger, and noticed that fucking wick got stuck to my hand. For some reason, I blew at it like an idiot, thinking it would just fly off, but it just made it glow which caused it to hurt some more and my reflexes kicked in so I flailed around like I had a fucking tarantula on me whacked my unsuspecting wife in the face and smashed my finger on the corner of [our amazing bar](https://images.crateandbarrel.com/is/image/Crate/MaxineBarCabinetSHS15_16x9/$web_zoom_furn_hero$/170919165252/maxine-bar-cabinet.jpg) in the process. Blood was everywhere, my kid’s freaking out, and so we spent Christmas Eve in the hospital where we had an awkward conversation about domestic abuse (well my wife did). My wife’s now got this purply yellow thing on her face and I broke my ring finger and had to get a few stitches in my middle finger too. 

I don’t think she thinks I’m so manly, to be honest. The way she told my in-laws was a bit of a giveaway but at least she likes her Christmas present. 

Tl;Dr: tried to put out a candle with my fingers, got a burning wick stuck on my finger, flailed like a pansy and my wife and I spent our evening at the hospital. 

Edit: okay, I’ve gotten shitloads of messages calling me a shill or whatever. I literally just googled the bar. The only 2 photos I found immediately was the picture I linked and a Pinterest link (and it looks like reddit are not fans of Pinterest links). I didn’t realize it was from the manufacturer’s website, but there you go. The only reason I linked it is because people I’ve told this story to often asked me what I meant about the bar thing, and I’ve always had to link a photo. Thought I’d avoid that with this post, but apparently that seems to have backfired in a way I never even anticipated. 

Also, I’ve gotten a few really aggressive and messed up messages from some of you. Let me get one thing clear; I’m not abusing my wife or my daughter, so I’d appreciate if you’d stop sending me messages accusing me of such. Accidents happen, I fucked up, and I’m owning up to it here in this sub where people post stories of the dumb shit they do. I can assure you that both my wife and little girl are safe. "
"TIFU by bringing a whole pot of coffee to school on exam day


Actually happened today, about 10 minutes ago.

So I have exams today, and like many other students, I stayed up relatively late ~~redditing~~ studying. To counteract this crime against psychology, I decided to make some coffee. As I was pouring it this morning, I had the bright idea of ""why just bring one cup? Why not the whole pot?"". So I stuck it in my backpack, being sure it was upright, thinking I would just be careful with it. I proceeded to then brush my teeth and head to school.

As I was walking through the hall, I began to notice some wetness on the back of my leg. Instantly I had an idea of what it was. I rushed to advisory and pulled it out. It was 2/3 empty. A cup is maybe 1/4. It ended up rotating itself 90°, spilling out. But not that much spilled out of my backpack, so where could it have gone? Into my notes of course! Now all my notes for my exams today, including a textbook, are soaked with coffee. But hey, at least Hamlet survived.

TL;DR: Thought it would be a good idea to bring a whole pot of coffee to school for exams. My notes ended up drinking it.

COMING UP: TIFU by writing a TIFU instead of studying!

Edit: Since you bitches don't believe me: https://imgur.com/a/s6vtt

Also, I think I did decent on my first exam

Edit II: For those wondering, I'm in high school, not college. Also, I did pretty well on my second exam.

Edit III: I wonder if I should get a thermos. What do you guys think? "
"TIFU by attempting to help a naked prostitute on acid...


Made the 911 call just before 2am EST so this has actually just happened. 

Was just woken up by my dog alerting to something, before I could even open my eyes I hear screaming coming from upstairs. 

Our upstairs neighbour is male, single (girlfriend moved out recently, so I'm assuming) and usually quiet as hell. So I hear a female voice, repeatably screaming help me, he's trying to kill me, help me...followed by a lot of banging and crashing. I wake my boyfriend up, and immediately he's flys out of bed and starts getting dressed (it was that loud and intense he knew instantly).

 I call 911 as he's heading out the door and upstairs (should be noted that we don't share access to our apartment and both have front doors that lead directly outside). So I go through the conversation with the operator and go outside to make sure I see if anyone leaves. 

At this point I realize they are all outside (boyfriend, upstairs neighbour and female) she's still screaming so I shout for her to come towards me and away from the guys. Next minute I see her coming down the stairs and she's ass fucking naked (at no point has she stopped screaming) I grab her and head for my apartment (as it's 25F degrees out) when my boyfriend screams out ""She's on drugs don't take her inside"", I yell back ""well bring her some clothes or something then!!!"". 

This is when things start to go downhill...and she starts screaming that I am going to kill her and I quote ""Chop her up into tiny pieces because I'm a prostitute"". I'm attempting to reassure her when her phone is produced and upstairs neighbour says ""I think it's her Mom"". I grab the phone and the lady tells me she's her mum and that she's having a bad trip and to put her in the shower...and then WHAM! 

She cracks me right in the face! I drop the phone and grab her arms so she can't do it again. The mother, who is screaming ""id beat her ass if I were you"" (taking to me) is clearly not helping so I yell to someone to hang up the phone. This girl breaks free from me grabs her phone and starts calling 911...operator answers and she says nothing, it's the same guy I had before so when I grab the phone he tells me to go inside, I tell him she's going to run into the woods and he says so let her (lol).

 At this point she cracks me in the face again, so I'm shouting at 911 ""yeah any time the cops could arrive would really help right now"" while I'm saying this she grabs my arm and tries to bite me, now my boyfriend steps in and makes her sit down and holds her there. (He was talking to our landlord and his wife as they had now also come outside)

Now the cops arrive (who doesn't love seeing their ex husband at 2am 3 days before Christmas...am I right?!?! But that's a whole other story)...she runs to him (thank god) he grabs her and puts her in the back of his car without asking us anything, so naturally she starts flipping. She was attempting and successfully climbing through his divider and smashing his computer (lol I had to laugh) so he rips her out and hand cuffs her before putting her back in. 

I go inside as it's freezing and they will come talk to me right? I'm watching from the window now. Ambulance comes, they strap her to the gurney and cart her away. Then all the cops leave. No questions....so whatever I'm going to bed. Guess they assumed I didn't want to press charges 🙄

Now I'm laying in bed, icing my face. Sent boyfriend to check is upstairs guy was okay...he returned with 2 cans of dog food and some human (as in not dog food) jerky...guess upstairs guy was thankful someone came to the rescue...even if it was initially confusing who actually needed said rescue. 

Acid is one hell of a drug kids. 

TL;DR: though girl was being attacked, instead I was. 

Edit: Paragraphed

Edit 2: Clarification
1: Yes first arriving cop was MY ex. I'm just that unlucky that he happened to take the call...or am I?

2: Sounds like he didn't question anyone/take statements and told upstairs neighbour to go back inside and all the cops left. 

3: Upstairs neighbour told us it was acid when I first got involved. He also told the police and my landlord the same thing. That's all I know, I do agree it's not a typical reaction, acid is usually a goooooood time.
