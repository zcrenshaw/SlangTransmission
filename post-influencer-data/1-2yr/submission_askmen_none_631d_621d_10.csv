"Anyone ever get tired of everything and want to just drive for hours and spend the day somewhere completely random with your phone off?


That's what I'm feeling right now. I just want to download some good music and drive and cut off communication with everyone. I don't want to tell people I'm going for the day, and I don't want to detail my trip on social media anywhere (apart from this post I guess). I have an overwhelming urge to just..*leave*. School hasn't started back up, and I have no work obligations for the next week either. 

Anyone who has done that before, any advice regarding good locations in general (e.g. a beach, city, mountains) that are perfect for when you need to disconnect? Is it safe to sleep in my car overnight? Any advice at all actually would be great. I'm so freaking tired of everything."

"So I've been single for 8 years and sexless for over 10 years, it's having a huge effect on me mentally. How do you deal with this and stay confident/happy?


It'll be 9 years in February and 11 years in January. I feel so unwanted and generally miserable but I'm not sure what else I can do, pretty sure I've exhausted my options with the exception of flat out paying someone for their time.

Edit: to clarify, yes my friends, strangers and myself have considered and worked on everything we've collectively thought of and I am still stuck in a dry spell. I am asking for advice on dealing with these feelings, not on finding someone or trying to get laid.

Edit 2: Thank you to the people who read my question and offered some genuine advice for copeing, I really appreciate it.
After being personally attacked a few times I've decided to not read or respond to this anymore except for to some already ongoing conversations."

"What is the stupidest thing you've done in 2017?


I ask this fully knowing there are 6 more days in 2017 and that you can set a new record..

Use this as a platform to let your regret/guilt out and just MOVE ON. Whatever you've done, leave it in the dust of 2017.

Happy Holidays!

I'm available for anyone for any situation whatsoever. MODS please let me know if this is not okay. 

final edit: in the interest of time and my work productivity, I am unable to reply to a lot of these. If you need someone to talk to, PLEASE.. DM me or message me on Kik! Happy Holidays! "
