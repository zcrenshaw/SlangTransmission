"I made a man cry in the printer aisle today


I work in a technology retailer as a technology sales associate, and have a plethora of stories about people being tech-illiterate. This is not one of them. (Apologies if my story telling sucks, not much of a writer)

Today, a man who earlier today bought ink for his inkjet printer, was looking for laser printer alternative. I went up to him and asked what he was looking for, in hopes of finding the best possible printer for him. After roughly 10-15 mintues of friendly back-and-forth, we pick-out a few that would work perfectly for him. I assumed this new printer isn't a top priority considering he'd bought ink earlier. Since none of our printers were on sale, I told him I'd write down some dates the printers will most likely be going on sale on.

He looked pretty happy about that and thanked me.

I proceeded to write down all the printers we decided would work for him, every possible sale day in the next month, prices of toner, and what each of the important notes were for each printer.

I go to hand him my note, and he's wiping tears off his face.

&gt;**Me**: Are you alright, Sir?

&gt;**Him**: Yeah, *wipes his face*, I just haven't felt cared for very much recently... I went in for surgery earlier this month, and nobody so much as gave me a phone call. Thank you for spending this time with me today, I appreciate it.

I took my break right after that because I was about to start tearing up too."
"""I deleted the internet, please help"" - Little old woman


So I used to work at an electronic retail store. We were one of the biggest stores in my state, and I worked in the computers department. It was an early Sunday morning, which was typically our slowest time, so I took more time with customers. 

This particular day a little old woman walks quickly into my department, looking scared, tears in her eyes. She walks up to me holding her laptop and asks me why everyone is looking so calm. I ask her, why wouldn't they be calm? She looks me in the eye, scrunches her face, sobs, and says ""Because I deleted the internet, please help"".

**What I wanted to do:**

I ask her ""The whole internet? You deleted the internet?"" *goes on walkie* ""We have a code red in the computer department, we got her"".

**What actually happened:**

She cries and explains to me that she was scared that the ""internet police"" were going to arrest her because she deleted the internet explorer icon from her desktop. She was under the impression that because she deleted her icon, she deleted ALL OF THE WORLDS INTERNET OMFG.

Instead of normally sending her to the tech counter like normally with other customers who come to me with tech help, I sat her down and explained to her that she just deleted her access to the internet, and went to her Recycle Bin on her desktop and restored her icon. She realized how silly she was after I told her this and gave me a hug before leaving my store.

My inner demons wanted to mess with her, but I couldn't pull myself to do that."
