"A collectible 50p.


On mobile, so apologies. Before I start, we need some backstory. Here in England we have 50p coins, and some of them are decorated to celebrate someone, an event, or landmark. These can be quite collectible. Last year a series of 5 coins was released to celebrate the author Beatrix Potter, and certainly the older generations liked to keep them. By far the most sought after coin featured a character called Peter Rabbit, and it wasn't uncommon for people to ask me to try and find one in my till for them.

Fast forward to today. The coins are rarer than they used to be, but they are also sought after by less people. A lady comes up to my till, buys a few things with a total of £3.50, and pays with exact change, one of the coins being a 50p. Naturally I glance at it and remarked it was one of the Beatrix 50p's. 

W-Woman
M-Me

M- ""That's one of those Potter 50p's, haven't seen one in a while.""

W- ""Oh sorry can I take that back? I've got 4 of them and I want to give all 5 to my granddaughter.""

So I give it back to her, and she can only give me a £1 coin. She now needs 50p change.

W- ""Sorry about that love, I've been trying to track down these coins for months and I just got this one (Beatrix Potter Seal) from across the road there!"" 

M- ""Oh really? Which ones have you got so far then?"" 

W- ""I've got the duck, squirrel, the hedgehog and the seal."" 

At this point I notice the queue is growing, so I start fumbling around for a 50p to give her as change. By chance I looked down and happened to notice the Peter Rabbit 50p was half buried in my till. The last coin she needed. I quickly fished it out, turned it face up so the lady didn't see the design and gave her the receipt. 

M- ""Well good luck finding that last one madam, hopefully it turns up soon!"" 

W- ""Thank you love, have a good shift"".

She walks away, but doesn't get far before looking at her change to put it in her purse. She turns around and looks at me, now serving another customer. She walks past my till and silently mouths ""thank you!"".

I nodded my head and smiled. Rarely have I seen anyone leave our store looking as overjoyed as she was, definitely the highlight of my day.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: This got waaaaay more attention than I expected, thanks everyone! First Reddit gold too, thank you!"
"""You don't know that word? Well, then, obviously you know nothing of this language.""


I used to work at a Brazillian supermarket (in Florida). The customers were pretty much all Brazillians, leading to almost everybody speaking (Brazillian) Portuguese. My parents are from there, but I was born in North America. Although I do know how to speak Portuguese, sometimes my American accent bleeds through, and sometimes I don't know a word or two. Prople usually understand.

But not this one lady. Boy, did she have something to say. I was behind the customer service desk so I couldn't leave, but the lady asked me where something was. It was around the corner, near a certain shelf. I couldn't remember what the word for ""shelf"" was, so I think I said, ""fixture that holds things"" or something like that.

&gt; ""'Fixture that holds things'? What the heck is that? Do you even speak Portuguese?""

&gt;Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry I forgot the word for that (I point to the shelf), but what you're looking for is right around it.

Keep in mind, the shelf was in sight of both of us, but she didn't want to look.

&gt; You don't speak Portuguese. Get me someone else to help.

I'm a little confused (I mean, it's just one word I didn't know) but my manager happens to appear and I figure she's not busy.

(Keep in mind, this is all in perfect Portuguese)
&gt; Maria, would you be able to help this woman? Apparently, I don't speak Portuguese so I'm not able to communicate with her. She doesn't understand anything I'm saying, because, even though it sounds like Portuguese, she said it's not, so, honestly, I'm not really sure what language I'm speaking. But, that doesn't really matter, I guess. She needs help finding (item), which I said was over there, but I guess she needs to hear that in Portuguese, which, again, I apparently don't speak.

It turned out that Maria was well aware of this customer and she complained about *everything*, so she wasn't surprised that she was acting like an idiot. She almost stopped as she had to stifle some laughter during my monologue. The lady just kind of looked like someone had slapped her with an idiot stick."
