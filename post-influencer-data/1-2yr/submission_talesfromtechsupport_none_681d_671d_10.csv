"No ma’am I cannot unlock your computer!


I work in IT help desk. A lady called in all frustrated saying that she is locked out of her computer and wants me to unlock it. This is a very common type of call so I said “sure give me a moment....looks like you’re not locked out...can you possibly try again?” She gets all furious and says “You clearly don’t understand, I said I’m locked out and I need you to unlock me”. I get a little irritated at her raising her voice and say “you are definitely NOT locked out...are you using a laptop or a desktop?”....turns out, she’s using a PERSONAL laptop that has nothing to do with the company...meaning if she were locked out, I have absolutely no way of unlocking it. I tried to explain to her that her laptop is not on the same domain or network as the company so I cannot unlock her...she gets infuriated and demands that she speak to my manager, or as she put it “someone that knows what they’re doing”. Her husband then walks in and tells her he changed the login password the night before. She then promptly hung up. "
