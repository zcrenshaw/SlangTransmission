"Why is it so hard to get a traditional relationship as a gay guy?


I dont want an open relationship, I dont want 1 or two other guys coming into our relationship and all being boyfriends. I dont want a three way, four way, orgy, whatever. i dont want ""I dont want a label on our relationship"" I dont want fuck buddies, I dont want one night stands, I dont want to be your ""pet"" or you to be my ""daddy"" (unironically). I dont want ""I dont believe in marriage"" or ""it's just a paper"" I just want to date a guy that loves me unconditionally for 2 or 3 years, then propose and we get married and live together happily ever after. Why is this so hard to find, especially as a young gay guy?"
"First gay relationship: after 3 long and confusing years of having feelings for my best friend, we are finally together.


First gay relationship for him and for myself. I’m 29 and he’s 34. We first met through Grindr, we liked each other, but after a few months we called it quits. Remained friends but never crossed that line again. We never had sex not even when we initially liked each other.

He’s former Army Special Forces, I come from a very conservative family (Amish, to be honest) with all that going on we had a lot of confusing dynamics. He had PTSD, I had my own emotional demons. Entering into the gay world was exciting but overwhelming for both of us. I wasn’t out yet, he was but wasn’t comfortable with being gay at the time. I never thought I could form romantic feelings for a guy, it’s only ever been sexual...but here this guy was, all fucking perfect and what not. 

I knew of my feelings for him for years, I was crazy about him. I tried to get over him, dated other guys, hooked up, blind dates, I even dated a woman again...that’s how I desperate I got to get over him! Friends and family would always tell me “move on” but I couldn’t. He captivated every part of me, within the first 15 minutes of meeting, I knew it was different. It was like we had been friends all of our lives.

I never had a connection with someone like him before. Everything about him captivated me. 

Flash forward to the other night and boom...we laid it all out on the line. He came out from left field with “I have feelings for you and I’m not sure what to do them. I know you can’t reciprocate but it’s been killing me not being honest with you.” I died. 3 years of emotion, all bottled up inside..all my endless nights crying, praying, dreaming...all just fell into place in one moment. 

My point to this? Never did I thought I would be able to date a man...never did I think I could ever date him. Never did I think I could go against the norm. Never did I think a random guy from Grindr would end up being something deep and powerful lol 

I’ve had those lonely nights where nothing seems hopeful. Stay strong friends. If you want to be with someone then believe it’ll happen and go for it. 

Do what you gotta do to get you to where and who you want to be. "

"Do you ever watch a movie or a TV show and see that one random actor who is so hot that you just drop everything and start googling his photos while your brain is contemplating how someone can be so incredibly handsome?


I've been watching 'House of Cards' and there appeared this tall Swedish hunk [Joel Kinnaman](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/actor-joel-kinnaman-tapes-an-interview-at-good-morning-america-at-the-picture-id584171110?k=6&amp;m=584171110&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=kwzAePLwVbte0azt0ulU43RpvVUU4JIjZfJCQVtZkzo=) who is so hot, this dude is 120% everything I find attractive in a man. It's like his parents went to a computer lab in 1979 and created this masterpiece of a man just to mess with my head 38 years later. I've been just googling his photos for past hour or two mesmerized by his perfection. I would literally pay a million dollars just to kiss that [face](https://i.imgur.com/k37MS9F.jpg), not to mention his banging body. Oh my... Being this goddamn handsome should be illegal. I'm done... Somebody make me unsee him.

Does it happen to anyone else or am I just a pervert?"
"Why aren't gays calling their asses ""cockpits""?


I've heard it in porn, they'll call it, their ""pussy"" ""boy pussy"" ""bussy""? Idk it's just a thought I had looking at the cover for Top Gun."
"So, my straight friend...


...Called me a pussy, and since he's straight and likes pussy, does that mean he's gay for me and wants to fuck me like a pussy? I mean, why else would he call me something he likes unless he likes me, too? He's totally straight by the way, probably, I guess, whatever, I don't know. I'm planning to propose to him tonight just in case, so it'll be really awkward if he actually is straight."
"I saw my ex for the first time in 11 months...


At a crowded subway station this morning. We passed each other without saying anything. I was a bit shaken on the way to work and texted my friends about it but I went on to have a really good day. 

When he broke up with me I had a mental breakdown and I was at the lowest point in my life. I had been so scared to see him but today went much better than I expected. I feel proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished in a year even though it seems small. "
"My new Dr. bullied me and I want to report her


I've had the same Dr. since I was 14 years old but he retired. I'm 19 now if that even matters. For some reason, they assigned a new Dr. to me, and on my first appointment with her, she was treating me like crap. 

The first thing she did was give me a rude glance while she was looking at my chart. I'm trying to see a specialist for erectile dysfunction but my old Dr. didn't think it was necessary. When the new Dr. found out that I'm on PrEP, she asked, ""Why do you need PrEP if you can't have sex?"" 

When I told her I have sex with my bf she looked at me like she was disgusted and shook her head. I felt really vulnerable and powerless. When the appointment was over I wanted to cry in my car. I'm supposed to go back in January but I'm have anxiety attacks just thinking about it. It's to the point that I stress out about it for hours while I'm at work or spending time with my bf. 

I want to call and report her, but I don't even know what I would say. "
"Crummy cummy tummy?


Hey guys. Question for you: I have noticed a number of times after giving head (and swallowing) I get an upset stomach and/or the runs. Wondered if anyone else experiences this? Doesn't happen every time and I haven't noticed it with one guy more than another. Believe it or not, there's not a whole lot of research out there on this! :) I am hoping I'm not allergic, that would be terrible. Any thoughts or advice welcome (except for the obvious advice, of course ... ;)"
"What's the weirdest lie a guy has told you to get a hookup?


Figure this could be a fun topic. Mine: Yesterday a guy asked what i liked, I mentioned i like uncut, he sent me a picture of one, we ended up meeting up. He dropped his pants, revealing he was cut, and said ""oh shit i forgot and got circumcised right before you came over"""
"PSA to all the young guys wanting something from your fellow young guys...


Chill.

And I don't mean that in a derogatory sense. If you already think that you know what you want even though you haven't experienced it, cool. Good for you, and pursue it. But, as a hope to settle all complaints about young guys just wanting sex or being immature: it's because, scientifically, virtually all of you are.

There is a lot about the human brain that we don't know. But there are somethings that are well-established at this point. The big one is when the average brain stops developing: 25. And by develop, I mean mature/grow. A brain still changes in some ways as it gets older and experiences more things until eventually, it starts decaying (very very laymen verbiage here). So for the sake of argument, let's just assume that the cutoff for when your brain is actually an ""adult brain,"" is 25. That should answer a lot of questions in regards to maturity and the formation of ideas.

Then add in societal pressures, career and academic goals and needs, and throw in how many gay men are in the closet for so long and many don't come out until college, and even then take a while just to get used to their own skin. There's a lot of reasons why there's not an abundance of young guys that are just looking to settle down as soon as possible. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting that, but realize that you are probably in a minority. And it's not because guys are assholes. It's just because of the reality of the human brain and our society. So here's a quick breakdown of lots of reasons why you aren't as likely to find someone that settles down with you asap.

1. The human brain doesn't ""fully mature"" until age 25 on average.
2. Many gay men have a 2nd adolescence or sexual awakening due to them being closeted in middle/high school.
3. The stable person you desire that has a career and can build a life with you, isn't likely to have that career until their 30s.
4. Average age for the 1st marriage for a man is 29 (that's all men, straight/gay/etc).
5. Average age for the 1st marriage for a gay man as of last year was 40. (LGBT marriage is a fairly recent concept)
6. Sleeping with many people is a biological drive. Monogamy is a societal concept (not saying it's bad, just not a biological one).
7. You live in a single geographic area. Exponentially more men live outside your area than live inside it.

I'm 30. Married at 28. I didn't come out until age 23/24 and slept with anything that was human (mostly men) as much as I could, especially once I came out and didn't have to take extra steps and planning to hide anything. If you would have asked me at 25 if I wanted to marry (even when I had a boyfriend), I would have laughed at you and said marriage was a failed institution to make shot-gun weddings look legitimate. Then, something kicked me in the nuts. It was the thought of never being with my then-boyfriend again a year after we had broken up. Lots of soul-searching and empty one-night stands later, I knew that what my heart desired was what it already had and had lost. So I dramatically asked him to take me back and luckily he did. We got married 3 years later.  


There's nothing wrong you. There's nothing wrong with all those guys who don't want the same thing as you. You are at different places. Until you experience the thing you want and experience it enough, you won't really know that you want it. Because that's how the brain works. It's OK. You're gonna be OK. Just go keep living life. Don't turn down an experience unless it sounds unsafe. Only doing that will you put yourself out there enough to meet someone you actually want to settle with, and not just because of a societal or arbitrary goal, but because your heart will truly desire it.

I don't mean to shit on anyone's posts and I don't mean to sound preachy. Just... please. Relax and enjoy what experiences come your way or you seek out and who knows what will happen. Maybe your outlook will change and marriage won't be for you. Maybe you'll only confirm that it is what is right for you. Who knows. Hell, there's so many posts daily here about just wanting someone to chill and cuddle with, that you boys need to message each other just to say what's up and who knows what will happen. So... go experience shit. And don't be sad when others experience doesn't line up with yours. You're gonna be OK. There's never been a better time to be gay, and it will keep trending up for a while."

"I don't know how to move on


It has been one terrible year since my fiance died. Exactly one year ago I got a call from the hospital. I was at work when he passed, I wasn't even at his side. It was like a dream. I always had this inner voice inside me that was telling me that against all odds he would make it. But the voice was wrong. When he died I couldn't believe it at first. I thought it was all a brutal joke, I didn't even want to attend his funeral. Then I had my first panic attack. I felt as if I couldn't breathe, like the walls were coming at me and suffocating me. Then, we burried him and with him we burried my living self. After that I haven't felt a thing. It's like I am incapable of feeling, I don't know how to explain it better. I quit my job, deleted all my social media. I hardly go out. I just have no sensations, no excitement, I feel nothing, it's like I am dead on the inside. The love we had was everything I had ever dreamed of and even more and it lasted so short that I just can't believe it. 4 years. That's all it was. And now, at 26, my life is over."
"Is it possible to be gay but for only one dude?


I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I've never been attracted to a guy before. I can tell if a guy is physically attractive or not but I've never felt attracted or wanted to spend so much time with someone in the past. I don't know what to do or what I am?!

I met this gay dude a couple of months ago. We spend  a lot of time together, we see each other every 2 or 3 days when it's not everyday. I wish I could say we have a lot in common but we're total opposites. He's cool, funny, very calm, he always knows what to say or do, he's never upset and I am a shitbag.

At first, I thought I was enjoying his company because we had this *I call you out on your shit*  bros kinda relationship. But along the process, I don't know what the fuck happened, I kissed him. More than once. Several times. Mostly when I'm drunk because I feel less bad about it. I always feel bad afterwards but I think I enjoy it while it lasts. I guess I like it because I always find myself hoping he's gonna kiss me or touch me again.

Not so long ago though, things changed and I don't know what the fuck happened, we hooked up. Now, I'm going out of my mind because I'm wondering what's happening with me and why am I suddenly gay? If this is what I am. I know it sounds dumb. Is it possible? To never have fell for a guy before and suddenly liking one, out of blue, just like that? Or is it because I'm such a mess, it finally feels good to know someone goes through my crap and takes care of me? But then I wouldn't enjoy the sexual aspect that much, would I? I think about him when I masturbate. I might have feelings for him. But I'm not sure, maybe I'm simply fucked up in my head... 

Does anyone ever went through something similar and can point me out in the right direction to find my sanity again please? "
"is it weird that i catfished my boyfriend?


So i have known for a long time my boyfriend (20yo and im 22yo), goes on grindr occasionally... i saved his profile and so every now and then i go on and see when hes been active to see how often he goes on and trying to figure out why?  


then tonight he was online the same time i had gone on to see... so i messaged him pretending to be someone else and used some random pictures i found on the Internet to see what he would say and do... and basically hes keen 100% to meet-up for sex and exchange shirtless pictures etc 

soooo im currently sending him to a hotel in the city where no one will be and where hes expecting sex with another guy... hes going there after work and hes already messaged me goodnight and that he loves me. 

second person this has happened with.... is it me? like i just dont get it, why are guys so slutty... also any suggestions on what i should do or say without sounding like a stalking weirdo would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
"When you find out someone is gay, do they become more attractive to you?


I feel like the instant I find out someone is gay that I already think is attractive they just become way more attractive. Or if I find out someone that I like is straight they become less attractive. Is this normal?"
"[Update] I’m 15, I think I’m gay, and I don’t know what to do.


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7wxl02/advice_im_15_i_think_im_gay_and_i_dont_know_what/)


Well, it’s been a while. First things first, I’m posting the update to this on my main account because 1) I forgot the password to that throwaway and 2) I don’t have any reason to hide the fact that I am gay anymore. 


Things have changed...I’m 16 now, I know I’m gay, and I feel a lot better about myself now, and I couldn’t have done this without the help of this sub.


I thought I would basically go through all that’s happened in my life since I made that post, since some people wanted to hear an update. 


First, after making the original post, I got up the courage to come out to one of my friends (over text) and she was super supportive and watched Love, Simon with me, a movie that has still left a positive and encouraging impact on me. 


Since February, I have come out to 5 more people, the first 3 over text and the most recent 2 (the twins I mentioned) in person. All have been super supportive of me and helped me through things. I also made a friend on r/LGBTeens who talked to me and helped me gain confidence, and with their help I got up the nerve to finally text the guy I like. And I did it. And it was kind of awkward, because I’m an awkward person in general, but it’s okay, because I did it. 


And the biggest change came yesterday: I made a personal deadline to come out to my parents before we left on a trip, because I was becoming more depressed at home and hated hiding part of myself from them. 


With a lot of motivation from my friends and the online friend I made, and after pacing in my bathroom for a good 30 minutes, I finally went out into the living room and eventually got out the words to my parents. I started crying because it was just so much and it was the scariest thing I have ever done in my life. 


Though they’re Catholic, they were quite accepting and supportive and said they’d love me no matter what and that they didn’t really mean some of the things they’ve said about the LGBT community in the past, and that they’re glad I told them, and that they’re a little upset that I had to hold this burden for five years now. 


They did ask me to ‘reconsider God’ after they asked and I told them I don’t really believe in Catholicism because I don’t like how ‘engaging in homosexual acts’ is seen as a sin. And then my mom asked me to consider talking to a priest and even that you don’t have to be “intimate” in a relationship (but lol who are we kidding what’s the fun in being gay then?? I want to have sex LMAO) but overall they were still accepting and said they’d love me no matter what. 


And when I told my parents, I could literally feel a huge weight lift off my shoulders. I don’t have to stress anymore about this huge burden I’ve been preoccupying myself with and stressing myself out about for five years now. I’m free. I can be me now and I don’t have to hide it. 


And I have to thank this sub too. Without the original post I made and the help I got from all of you guys, I never would have gotten up the courage to admit that to myself, or come out to my friends, or come out to my parents. This community is what started everything and helped me so much in my path to acceptance. So thank you, thank you so much. 


And that’s pretty much all. I just thought I would post an update to thank the sub that helped me through the most difficult and confusing time in my life :)"
