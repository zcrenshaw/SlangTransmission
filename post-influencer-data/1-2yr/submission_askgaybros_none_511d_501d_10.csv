"I'm so happy, bros :)


In one of my classes at university, I met this guy who I'm working with together on a project. I always thought he was attractive and well-dressed but I didn't act on it. 

On Tuesday this week we had a field trip for class. We carpooled together to the destination and we basically spent nearly 4.5 hours chatting it up and I was simply floored by how well-rounded and cultured he was. He was so articulate and then we got to talking about our personal lives growing up and it's almost like our lives were a near mirror image of the other. In process of talking we came out to each other too. When we ended our field trip he invited me to get dinner with him sometime and he gave me a big hug. 

Yesterday night I asked him to dinner and he agreed. We again spoke for nearly four or five hours without stopping and I was really feeling him. When we were ready to part ways I told him something like, ""You're such an awesome human being. You're so confident and know yourself so well and I admire that blah blah blah."" When we said goodbye he gave me another big hug and then I kissed his cheek as we separated. He leaned in and gave me a kiss in return :) and then he invited me over for Netlix for tonight. I'm really excited and can't wait. Even if nothing major becomes of this I'm so happy to have meet this awesome dude and I hope we can remain friends after we graduate. Wish me luck tonight, bros!"
"Seeking advice on how to treat/take care of my gay son


I don't know if what I'm posting is allowed here. I've just been doing a lot of research and I would appreciate opinions from gay men.

I apologize in advance if I say anything offensive. It's not my intention at all. I'm trying really hard.

My son is 16 and I am 35, I'm his father. I got married right out of high school and we had him right away. He's my only kid. I feel like he's had a fairly normal upbringing. I would say his mother is a bit of a helicopter parent and can be overbearing at times.

He came out to us about 6 months ago. He was 15 at the time. I definitely didn't suspect this at all. He certainly doesn't have any stereotypical gay qualities.

His mother took it extremely hard. She didn't and still doesn't have anything positive to say about it. I've tried to stay neutral for my son's sake. He and his mother would get into explosive fights about it. She became quite toxic, in the sense that I didn't think that the language she used was appropriate or at all helpful. It would often lead to my son breaking down and crying.

My wife continuously threatened to kick him out for his behaviour, etc, which she often instigated. Her and I began fighting since she took away his phone and computer privileges. Didn't want him on the wrestling team anymore or playing rugby. His two favourite things which he is extremely talented at.

I decided it was time for us to leave and my son and I got a small apartment (there was no chance my wife would leave the house). It's only a one bedroom. I feel guilty not being able to give him better, but right now I'm stuck helping my wife pay for the house as well (she's never worked).

He has the bedroom and I sleep in the living room. Things are pretty good between us. He's opened up to me a lot without his mother around. He's made me aware that one of the friends that he brings around is more than a friend. Boyfriends? I don't know.

My issue is I imagine he senses my discomfort with it all. He's asked me multiple times if I still like/love him, if I'm still proud of him.etc. I always say yes, which is 100% true. Nothing could stop me from loving my kid.

What I struggle with is the fact that I don't like that he's gay. It's a feeling I don't really know how to describe. I guess in a way I feel embarrassed? I don't feel disgusted by the idea of it. Maybe I just find it a bit weird. It's something I don't understand. I get that it's not a choice though, which is why I would never verbalize any of these feelings to my son. I love him more than anything. I want him to love himself too.

My kid is my world in so many ways. I worry for him constantly. I don't want to make anything harder for him that it has to be. I want to be a good dad. At this point I'm struggling a lot with how to be a good dad.

What are things your parents did to help you? What are things you wished they'd done?

How do I navigate the boyfriend area? Do I just treat the guy like he was any other friend my son brings over? He often closes his bedroom door when he has friends over. When he had girls over in the past we always told him to keep the door open. Now I don't know what to do. Should he be keeping the door open? Can the boyfriend crash at our place like his other friends do from time to time?

Honestly, please, just any advice in general would be great. Despite everything with his mother I want my son to be able to look back at this time in life and have fond memories. I just want him happy.

Thank you.

"How to let my little brother know that I (and our parents) know he's gay and that we're okay with it? And that he doesn't have to hide his boyfriend from us.


My little brother (16) has a boyfriend! He's been passing the guy off as a friend since September. The charade needs to end. 


But when you and your friend disappear for 6 hours, and then you come back and reek of your friends cologne. When you're wearing your friends clothes. When you're wearing your friends jacket home from school. When you're using your friends hair ties. When your friend is over at your house just about every night. When your friend has an empty box of condoms in the passenger seat of his car. üòê When your friend comes to drive you to school or comes to your house just so you can drive them to school when you both have fully functional cars. When your friend comes over at 5 am in the morning obviously just to cuddle with you before school. C'mon now. 


These boys are bad at hiding things üòÇ


I'm happy that my little brother has found himself a cute guy. I don't want him to feel like he has to keep this boy at arms length from our family. I also don't want him to think he has to hide things from us! We're all playing for the same team and I feel like I need to remind him that and i need to remind him that our parents and I will always love him. 


Problem is, I don't know how to approach this topic without making him clam up or giving him an anxiety stroke üòÇ"
"Unexpectedly had my first kiss today


I‚Äôm posting this here bc this is a throwaway and don‚Äôt have enough karma on r/gaybros

I‚Äôve made previous posts on here if you want some background on me

Anyways, I‚Äôm 17 and I‚Äôm not out to anyone. Recently I became friends with a guy who I could have swore was straight a few hours ago. Over the past few weeks we have surprisingly become really great friends, and today at school he wanted me to meet him at the mall near our school after school. I was shocked and a little confused but I accepted. When I got there he seemed a little uneasy, but I jut brushed it off.we both ate and after we finished I asked what he wanted to do and he suggest we go to a photo booth. I haven‚Äôt had my picture in a photo booth since I was in sixth grade, so I excitedly agreed. On the first picture we both smiled, and during the period between the 1st and 2nd photo he grabbed my face and turned it towards him. A photo was taken of him holding my face. He leaned in and kissed me. Another photo was taken of him kissing me. The last photo was of me smiling with the biggest grin at him. I was in complete and utter shock. I had no idea that he was gay and he didn‚Äôt know I was either. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. He said he had planned this whole thing. My face was blushing and I just hugged him as hard as I could. I was so happy. I still don‚Äôt know how I explain it. Just thinking about it makes me happy. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and i managed to utter ‚Äúy-yes‚Äù. No one will know we are dating for a while probably, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if other people as long as I‚Äôm happy."
"Just something my boyfriend said that made me like being a feminine guy for once


As I was getting ready for bed, I put this new lotion I got all over myself because it smelled so good and it makes my skin smooth. When I got out of the bathroom, my boyfriend made the comment of how he loves how fem I am and the little feminine things I do like putting on body lotion before bed. And I was kinda shocked because I didn‚Äôt know he liked that side of me. He told me he wished I showed it more. It made me feel so happy and accepted inside and I just wanted to share that on here since I‚Äôve had a rough last couple of days. 
Any stories that you guys have of something that brightened up your week?share them! Cheers!"

"Master(bation) List of Gay NSFW Games


Here is a compilation of all the NSFW work games that I like, either having gay-focused action, or at least the option for gay action. 

I understand that most of these games have a lot of furry content, but I'll be honest, there's not a lot of gay NSFW games, and the ones that are there happen to be furry. In the midst of a drought, don't complain where the water comes from. 

1. [Strange Flesh](http://greatestbear.com/strangeflesh.html):
By far my favorite of all the games. Gay focused, beat-them-up side scroller with intense BDSM, hypnosis, and bear-style characters. Art done by blazingcheeks, if you're familiar with his work. Streamlined game with the best fap content, in my opinion. 

2. [Yag World](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/678412):
Simple, choose-your-own adventure with gay-focused sexy results. Simple, enjoyable, complete. 

3. [Corruption of Champions, Trials in Tainted Space, and Eden's Fall](https://www.fenoxo.com/play-games/?age-verified=02bdc63eaa): 
All of a similar style, and considerably the most classic on the list - RPG, gay optional text adventure with extreme fetish, often featuring furry or transformation (gender-bending). Corruption of Champions and Fall of Eden is fantasy themed, with Trials in Tainted Space is sci-fi. Corruption of Champions is ""completed"" ([Though I highly recommend seeking out the fan-modded version, as it has a lot more conent](https://forum.fenoxo.com/threads/coc-revamp-mod-v1-4-12b-for-coc-1-0-2.3/)). Fall of Eden and Trials in Tainted Space are WIP, with Trials in Tainted Space receiving more regular updates. 

4. [Lilith's Throne](https://lilithsthrone.blogspot.co.uk/?zx=585c2a6c8298e877):
WIP, similar vibe to CoC and TiTS, with text based RPG with gay optional interaction, with a higher focus on enslavement and rape - high number of furry and anthro characters. 

5. [Rack](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/655082) and [Rack 2: Furry Science](http://furry.science/):
BDSM focused creative tool - featuring predominately furry / anthropomorphic characters. You play the role of a scientist at Rack Laboratories, where you conduct sexual experiments on bound subjects. Rack is completed, with full public access, with humans available for those not into furries. Rack 2 is WIP, with only furries. 

6. [Bonfire](https://www.patreon.com/bonfire):
WIP, gay action only,  puzzle sandbox game, orc protagonist usually solving puzzles by having sex with other male orcs. Decent music. 

7. [Flexible Survival](http://blog.flexiblesurvival.com/):
Like the earlier games, text-based RPG, optional gay-action, post-apocalypse setting. Extreme fetishes, with lots of furries, though a lot of options to scale everything. The most elaborate of all these games, in my opinion. WIP. 

8. [Cloud Meadow](https://www.patreon.com/CloudMeadow/posts?public=true):
WIP, farming simulator with open world (think sexy stardew valley), gay-optional content (mostly hetero), with lots of furries (you're breeding your livestock). In most cases, your protagonist acts as the bottom. 

My question is, does anybody know anything else to contribute to the list?

"Sex is great... BUT CUDDLING PRETTY DAMN GOOD TOO


Yes sex is awesome (and life-changing even, it might be argued) BUT I feel that there is so much that needs to be said for cuddling and sensual intimacy. Yes, I know we all would love to find that top who hits our spot with every thrust or find that cute bottom that we can make gasp for air with our dick game BUT cuddling. Like I absolutely love when a guy and I can fall asleep next to each other and then wake up in each other's arms. That's one of the best feelings tbh. And then after that I we get to stare into each other's eyes. If it's morning, I get to observe the light gently outlining the edge of his face. I love weaving my legs with his and feeling our leg hair rub together. I love rubbing our noses together. I love when he runs his hands through my chest hair. I love receiving soft, wet kisses on my clavicles. I love brushing his hair back with my hand. I love it when he squeezes my ass. I love rubbing my hands all over his body and feeling his warmth. I love whispering sweet things in the other's ear. And I love being able to feel truly present for once and let myself lay there with him for a while because, for those brief moments, I feel like we truly are the only two people in the world. 

And yes I totally recognize everyone has different needs and desires. Some people have really high libidos and cuddling doesn't do it for them. Others have no sex drive at all but they still enjoy cuddling. Whatever floats your boat. Great! But I guess I just wanted to share this especially for our baby gays who are coming of age that sex doesn't have to be the end goal for every encounter you have with a dude. Perfectly normal to enjoy sensual intimacy if that's what you're both comfortable with. I don't feel that there's enough of that message in media portrayals gay relationships or pornos. Don't feel you have to race to the finish (cumming). Lots a gay dudes sometimes finish by cuddling instead. Anyway I'm rambling now. Hope this resonates with some other gaybros!"

I play the sims 3 and my life there is wonderful, I have a good paying job, a husband and a son, a big beautiful house. We go on vacations and parks, beaches and so on. This game is really addictive."
"What are my chances of dating? I have no penis. (Update: I have a boyfriend now)


[If you want to read my old post from 8 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6tzy0l/what_are_my_chances_of_dating_i_have_no_penis/).

I just wanted to pop back in and thank you all for your advice to me. You guys gave me hope and I didn't give up.

After my post I continued dating and looking for someone but didn't have much success. In fact I had several bad experiences as well, a few people mocked me or were assholes. I actually decided to go up a little in age, not much but date guys who are a little older rather than my own age. I was previously looking for guys in late teens or early 20s. Decided to look for guys in the mid to late 20s age group. I figured they're more mature and probably look for love and long-term relationships (which is also what I wanted).

Aaaand I can tell you how different my experience has been. Guys who are a little older are much better. Even those who rejected me were pretty polite and understanding about it. I finally found the right person, he's 26 and we had amazing time hanging out and I finally told him about my injury. I was specifically looking for total tops to not waist my and their time and his response after I told him was that ""he doesn't mind at all"" and that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

It took over 2 months for me to be ready to be intimate with him and he was patient and never pushed for it. And when I was ready he was great... very patient and very attentive. Exactly the sort of man I love.

As for the sex itself it was actually much better than I expected. I've been seeing a sex coach for a while now. In the first couple of months I was enjoying sex but weren't having orgasms. I didn't know if I even could. I've finally been able to achieve orgasms though. The sex coach helped me with this. I do guided meditation and breathing with her and apparently she says I need to learn to channel the flow of sexual energy in my body through my anus (and other body parts like nipples) instead of how it's originally wired which is penis. I know this doesn't have much scientific backing but it's been helpful.

My doctor thinks the meditation and breathing helps relaxing and also helps retrain my brain to extract more sexual pleasure from the anus. He says it's similar to how people who lose their vision end up with better hearing or smelling, it's not that their ears or noses become stronger but that their brain now puts more focus on those catch the stimuli that would have otherwise been ignored. He says there's as many nerve endings in the anus and prostate area as there is in a woman's clitoris so it's more than enough to achieve great sexual satisfaction.

Right now I'm able to achieve orgasms most of the times with my boyfriend. Some liquid comes out when I have an orgasms from where I pee which is my cum now. It's not as it was used to before the injury but smells very similar.

I hope things remain great between me and my boyfriend. Thank you again for giving me hope. I was ready to give up but you kept me going. I hope this update helps someone who might be willing to give up too, keep trying and don't be afraid to seek help! Happy to answer any questions you might have as well. "

I took the solgar capsules for a few days (once morning; once night time) and had much better  bowel movements (I could even eat dairy again). 

Butt anyway back to buttsecks. I didn't need to do deep douching like before (just the rectum) and managed to get fucked 3  different times in 5 hours without it leaving any unpleasant residues or smells.

"Has anybody ever called you a homophobe or tried to play the gay card with you not knowing you're gay yourself?


I can recall an instance in high school where I said I don't like pride parades and a girl got angry at me and accused me of being a bigoted, intolerant homophobe. I told her that I didn't hate gay people at all and she still didn't believe me. At this point I wanted to tell her I was gay myself but I didn't want to out myself in a class of 15 students so I just let her win that argument. In Sophomore year, this reknowned gay guy touched me on my shoulder in a creepy way and I told him to knock that shit off. He went on the defensive and said that it was because he was gay that I reacted the way I did and that if he was straight I wouldn't have said anything. He even called me a narrow-minded bigot who needed to be more open minded. In reality, I just don't like anyone touching me unexpectedly. I didn't tell him I was gay either, but I did tell him that I supported LGBT rights and he was just being an asshole who used his sexuality as an excuse to inappropriately grope dudes. We ignored each other for the rest of the semester.

Has anything similar happened to you?"
"After 22 years of being straight I have finally done it! NSWF


Hey everybody, so I have just been a lurker for the longest while. Its strange but from reading all the posts here I feel I have educated myself a lot. Regardless about two years ago when I was 20 I began to wonder about guys. Back then I would not see a guy and think ""wow he is hot"" it was more of an I wonder what that sex would be like. Thought I would snap outta it, blah blah... two years of denial eventually came to an end the other night. 

Long story short, we met online, he knew I had never done anything and was cool with it. We met up, talked, it was great, her was really cool. Any ways we walked to his place and sat on the couch. I got really really nervous. But he kinda grabbed me and made me stratle him as we kissed and all the nerves left. I thought the kissing was ok and  eventually I went down on him. After the first 5 or 6 up and down bobs.... holy shit I was hooked. I got like a rush in my entire body and I was incredibly turned on. Five or so minutes later he finished... thats something I will have to get used to. But all in all I was and still am happy to have finally figured it out. "
