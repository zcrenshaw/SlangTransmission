"I(25M) ghosted my gf(23) of 1.5 years after she cheated on me. she apparently has panic attacks and her friends and my sis beg me to get back with her.


This is a throwaway. All names changed. It is going to be long, so bear with me.

My ex Anna(23F) is my sister Abby's(23F) best friend. My sister and I were never close, mostly because I spent most of my life in a hostel and moved out pretty quickly after I got into college. When Abby started college, she moved in with me to save money. So I got introduced to her best friend of over 16 years, Anna, and we started dating. Abby had a huge role in this, because she seriously wanted us to end up marrying each other. However, the relationship blossomed and we moved in together. So, me, anna and abby lived together and it wad amazing. We were like a happy little family. The relationship was progressing smoothly, to my knowledge. We had plenty of sex, and Abby made sure she gave us a lot of privacy. It was bliss.

Until she cheated on me with her ex. I recently got a promotion and my work hours increased. So one day, I took a half day and came home to hear Abby yelling at Anna as loud as humanly possible. I didn't want to get into the middle of it, so I just waited for them to be over. She was yelling stuff like, ""You shouldn't have contacted (ex-bf). You shouldn't have fucked him!! Can you even imagine how hurt (I) will be!! If you don't want him, break up!"" this piqued my interest, and I went to the lawn and eavesdropped on their conversation. She had been fucking him for three months, and basically went to him when I was at work or when she told us she had class. Most of the conversation was her justifying her actions, and Abby yelling at her for being ""human garbage"" and that she shouldn't have told her. From what I could gather, Abby knew about this for quite some time. She was saying things like he ""charmed"" her into bed, that he was a God in bed and it had nothing to do with me. She loved me with all her heart, supposedly, but still had some unresolved feelings for (ex-bf). She wanted to experiment sexually, which she could obviously do with me. She was trying to validate her actions by saying that humans are not made for monogamous relationships, and that it doesn't matter anymore because she ended it. At this point my sister got a call and the conversation ended. I was heartbroken and went for a long walk, after which I called my best friend and asked him what to do. He immediately told me that I should just take my stuff and move in with him.

We made a plan. I would go home and act tired, and leave at night without their knowledge. I did what he said. My sister acted like everything was normal, and even though I tried to coax some information out of her, she didn't budge and stuck to her lies. This made me feel like she was at fault. She betrayed me, not as much as Anna, but she did. Anna even tried to initiate sex but I was utterly disgusted at her. When everybody fell asleep, I packed some stuff and left. I didn't leave a note or anything. I just left. I blocked both of them everywhere. I called my father and told him everything, and he supported my decision. But he said that I should try and forgive my sister, and I told  him that I would try. Within a week, I sent them a notice to move out within 30 days. Abby texted me from another number, and we talked for some time. She was extremely apologetic and said she didn't know what to do. She asked me for an extension on the date because neither of them have enough money to move out and that they'd move out within another 14 days. She offered to cut Anna out of her life to save our relationship, but I thought it was too late for that and that it didn't matter. I was not interested in any relationship with either of them because they had broken my trust when living under my roof, mostly on my money. She had known what was going on from the very beginning of the affair but chose to remain silent because she didn't want to damage her relationship with me or with Anna. I told her that I'd try to forgive her and hung up. I unblocked her at my father's request.

Meanwhile, Anna is miserable. Apparently her depression is back with much more intensity, she has panic attacks at night because I'm not with her, has nightmares of me getting married to someone else, and in general has a lot of anxiety. All she does is stay in my room and hugs my clothes(wtf!?). She has withdrawn from all her friend circles. She doesn't go to college anymore. She barely eats. She does send me a bunch of emails, but they go to trash and she is blocked on all of my social media. Now, Abby and some of Anna's friend have contacted me and asked me to get back with her because if this goes on she would die. They know what's happened between them because the (ex-bf) told them. He was just using her for sex, and did make that clear to her. He was unaware of the fact that she was in a relationship. He ended things when he felt she was developing feelings. But still, her friends ask me to talk to her again, even just as a friend.

Ideally, I should feel no sympathy towards her. She was well aware of the ramifications of her decisions. She could have told me, and maybe I could've forgiven her. She could've broken up with me. She could have done a number of things which would've resulted in this being much more pleasant for both of us. I really don't want to talk to her again, but I am concerned for her and feel a bit guilty over the fact that she is deteriorating mentally and physically over me.

I'm helpless. I feel like I overreacted. I feel like she deserves closure, at least. I don't know. I feel guilty because I cut my sister  out of my life. I need some unbiased opinion on my reaction, and some advice would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr : my(25M) ex-gf(23F) of 1.5 years cheated on me. My sister(23F), who is her best friend of over 16 years, was aware of the affair. She hid it from me. All of us lived together. When I found out, I ghosted both of them. I sort of reconciled with my sister. My sister and my exes friends told me that she is deteriorating mentally and physically and that I should get back with her.

UPDATE: First of all, I'd like to thank every person who lent me an ear. I haven't been able to respond to a lot of comments, but I have read every single one. 


Okay, so some people suggest that I should have a conversation with her. In all honesty, I don't think I am ready to face her anytime soon. The conversation she was having with Abby made me feel very inferior, and I don't want to feel that way again. That is part of the reason why I ghosted her instead of kicking her out. Her apathy towards the whole things was... Really hurtful. 

I don't want to see her or get back with her ever again, Just to be clear. Her mental state has always been fragile, and she constantly changes therapists because they are not good enough, or it was not working. She is on medication for her anxiety. I am fairly certain she has her medication with her, but I don't think she has been taking them. I still feel responsible for her though. 
As for my sister, I don't know how long it will take for me to talk to her again. But now I most certainly can't. 
I'll post an update in a day or two if something happens. "

"Babysitting exchange arrangement with my coworker's [26m] wife [22f] isn't working out for me [35f]. How do I politely end it without offending over the reasons why?


My coworker's wife is a stay-at-home mom who offered to pick my two kids (8f, 14m) up from school and watch them until I can pick them up, usually about 2 hours, on occasion 3. In exchange, I take her son with my kids and keep him for a 3-4 hours on two of the weekdays my kids are there and overnight on Fridays.
At first, I was pretty pleased with the arrangement but my kids are becoming increasingly unhappy with the situation as she now expects them to do a variety of chores on her behalf every time they come over.  


To some extent, I don't mind the occasional request for my eldest to take out the trash or my youngest to make the baby a bottle, etc. I definitely expect them to tidy up after themselves! But I do feel she's overloading them, especially my oldest. Yesterday she texted me as I was leaving work and asked me to pick them up later as my eldest wasn't done weeding her flower beds. I refused, arrived at my normal time, and her irritation at him leaving before finishing really put me off. My children shouldn't have to ""earn"" their keep, taking her son is supposed to be the exchange of ""payment"" and this is supposed to be a convenience for me. Why would I wait around at work for MY tired child to be finished doing her free labor?
When I asked my kids how often she expects ""big"" chores like that I learned they're consistently doing a lot of dishes, their laundry, cleaning windows, dusting, mopping, vacuuming, and she's had them clean her bathroom and refrigerator. I asked why my son hadn't told me about this and he shrugged it off saying that at first, he didn't mind because she has a baby but now she's stopped asking and just tells him to do more an more.  


After a lot of thought, I made other arrangements for my children today and want to make that permanent. I don't think asking my coworker and his wife not to expect my children to do so much for them would realistically lead to a happy conclusion. I think, based on my observation of previous interactions between her and others, it's more likely she'd take the nicest phrasing of ""my kids aren't your free labor"" very personally, resent me, and there'd be comments and an attitude towards my children going forward at the least. My co-worker continuously expresses his appreciation for the arrangement and wouldn't just accept I changed my mind for no reason. I'm good friends with my coworker but I'm not blind to him and his wife being very sensitive to these things and often working each other up over their perceptions of what they are entitled to. I'd still be willing to watch their son on most Friday nights without payment but now I'd want advanced notice instead of an assumed schedule.  


tl;dr: I feel like my coworker's wife is taking advantage of my children and want to diplomatically stop swapping babysitting services without upsetting them."
"Just found out people think I (27/m) am a creep because of how I communicate.


I'm a deaf guy, so I usually communicate with notepad on phone. I would type what I want to say and hand it to someone for them to read and type in their reply. 

Well... I have always felt a bit insecure about it, but it is what works the best. 

Recently, I saw a reply to comment on a post on facebook of someone I am friend with but didn't see or talk to much. One of the girls I tried to talk to a while ago was talking about how someone once tried to talk to her by typing on the phone and that it was so creepy. Then two other person chipped in to make fun of it and say that it is so weird and creepy and they would have run away. 

This really hurt me. I didn't even know what to do or say. It also is making me feel like I can't even go out or do anything anymore. 

Can anyone please give some idea or suggestion on how I can talk to someone this way without coming off as a creep? 

tldr;

I'm a deaf guy who talks to hearing people by typing on phone. Found out people think this is creepy. "
"[Update] Me [33F] and my husband [34M], together for 10 years – He is uncomfortable with how often I touch him


Hi Reddit. A little while back I wrote here for advice. [Here is my initial post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73kzs8/me_33f_and_my_husband_34m_together_for_10_years/). I didn’t expect it to be nearly as big as I thought it would be. I went into it trying to reply to everyone, because I expected a handful of comments. I tried replying to as many of you as possible but I did miss some, I’m sorry! Besides a particular comment that accused me of sexually assaulting my husband (which has since been deleted) most of you guys really had helpful responses and anecdotes. I really appreciate that everyone took time out of their day to read through my post and give me advice.

On to the update. This feels a little messy, because I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts, and I apologise. But this update did not go as I expected. A commenter said that it sounded as if my husband directing his emotions about unrelated issues onto me. I replied to be polite, but honestly kind of put it out of my mind. My husband has never really done anything of the sort, and I had no reason to suspect he would do that now. Well, turns out that commenter is clairvoyant.

It turns out my husband’s mother has been diagnosed with a medical issue and does not have very long to live. She was initially in the hospital about 2 weeks before my post, which I knew. What I didn’t know is that the doctors found some things that gave her a very short life expectancy; they weren’t sure what the problem was, but they knew what the problem would lead to. I, and my husband's siblings, were told it wasn't a big deal.

My MIL didn’t want any of her kids to know until she was diagnosed properly with the real source of her issues. My FIL went against her wishes and told my husband, who convinced my FIL not to tell any of his other children. He also didn’t tell me, out of respect for his mother’s wishes, until a couple of days after my post. 

So obviously my husband had been going through a *lot* of emotional things, that he didn’t share with me out of respect for his dying mother. He felt he couldn’t disrespect her wishes after his father already did, so his worry and his inability to lean on me for support culminated in him struggling emotionally, which led to our minor argument.

We have been discussing that our communication suffered  – and that it led to the conversation about which I asked for advice. That really hurt, and isn’t a good habit to have in a relationship. My husband had never done anything like this before, and he was quick to own up to responsibility about this. We’ve mostly been dealing with my MIL and trying to make her comfortable and happy, but we have spoken a little about what my post was about. As I said in my post, usually my touching wasn’t ‘too much’ for him at all. But if my touching is just too much right now because of everything else going on, that still needs to be addressed. My husband admitted that he usually loved it, but right now it felt like he was being overloaded with *stuff* and my touching contributed to that. He also admitted that he didn’t communicate that properly. We agreed that my husband would practice being more upfront and immediate about any discomfort I might bring if I helped him along by more regularly asking boundary questions when I *do* touch him, which I will of course be reigning in until he communicates that that can change.

We ended up agreeing that diversifying the way we show love would never be a bad thing. I showed him my post and we want to look through the love language stuff and communicate better about everything that I, and your advice, brought up in the post. But right now, we’re focusing on his mother, so we haven’t gone into it as deep as we’d like. 

So… a lot of what was in my post *is* a problem, but not as big of a problem as my husband initially made it seem like, and potentially it might be temporary (or it might not be). I’m just happy my husband and I are communicating again, so we can tackle everything as a team. We will still be looking through all of your great advice, but right now it’s just not a priority.

Thank you guys again. It’s only one update per post, so I won’t be able to update further along in the future when we’re more actively putting all your advice into practice, but I hope this update suffices.

**Tl;dr:** My husband was going through issues that led to our communication suffering. We’re dealing with that now, and it’s going pretty well.

"I [25F] sent my bf [25M] a goodbye message and blocked him after he added his ex back on facebook. People are telling me I'm being cruel and unfair.


Hi Reddit. It would be nice if I could get some advice and see if my actions were justified. 

My bf and I were in a long distance relationship. A few months ago, he started ignoring me and became distant, and his reason was because he was busy. I later found out that he's been talking to one of his ex and when I confronted him about this, he denied it and made me feel guilty. He then refused to talk to me and blocked me, without giving me any closure whatsoever.

After a few months of no contact, he added me again and even though I was still hurt by his actions, I eventually got back together with him on a condition that we wouldn't talk to any of our exes but now we're back right from the beginning. He's added her back on facebook and I feel so betrayed after he promised me that he would cut her off. At first I was okay with him talking with his exes but after he ignored me for them, that's when I became uncomfortable with him talking to them so we drew the line that we wouldn't add or talk to any of our exes.

Anyways, after I found out, I ended up typing a farewell message and just blocked him everywhere. I wanted to discuss it with him first but I feel like he's just going to lie to me again and I'd end up just taking him back again. Right now I'm just so hurt and I'm also scared that he might just ghost me again and I feel like that'd hurt me even more so I had to take the first step.

Anyways, my friends told me that I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him and talk it over or should I just continue to block him?

  
  ---   
TLDR: Few months ago, BF ignored me before to talk to his exes. Confronted him about it and ended up ghosting me. He came back to me after a few months and promised he wouldn't talk to them or add them again but he just recently added them again and after I found out, I sent him a goodbye message with an explanation and blocked him. My friends are telling me I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him first or continue to block him?

Edit: I've read the replies. Thank you everyone for the support. Now I don't feel as bad as I should. And to those who assumed that we met online and it was a fake relationship, we actually didn't meet online. We lived in the same city before but I had to move temporarily to finish my masters. We were planning on completely closing the distance by next year since I'd be done by then but I guess I wouldn't need to worry about that anymore."

"I [24f] moved in with my boyfriend [25m], I don't want his sister [19f] letting herself in unannounced or hanging out when I'm at home studying alone anymore. How do I ask my boyfriend this without making it getting weird?


It's tricky because my boyfriend used to rent this apartment alone so the key is a pre-existing situation I hadn't known about when I signed the lease. I like his sister and enjoy her company but I'm in school and greatly value my quiet, private time on my mornings. When she shows up in the morning she's not exactly inconspicuous. I already have a hard time studying with other people around which is why I don't just go to the library. I had explained needing a space to study quietly in a potential apartment and the arrangement was that I'd study while he was at work. I don't know why there was no mention of her hanging out at his place to get away from her roommate-crammed house.     

I understand my boyfriend and his sister are close so he doesn't mind unexpected visits but I'm very reserved and private and several times have wished I had some notice to put things away and freshen up (or even just knocking so I can put on appropriate clothes!) before she comes over. When I say things like this to my boyfriend he just waves it off as her being family and not minding but it's more about me minding!  

I'm worried because it feels like I'm starting to resent the situation, especially when I'm struggling to concentrate on homework because I ended up paying more rent for less amenities and a longer commute to school so my boyfriend could stay in his place where he's comfortable. I know I have to say something or it will just eat me up but what are reasonable limits and how do I phrase it?

"Frustrated with my [29 F] husband [31 M] of a 3 years who will only eat one food.


Ya'll, I'm going stir-crazy here, my husband has narrowed his diet to ONE FOOD (yes you read that right) and it's making our daily life so difficult and frustrating. The food is Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. I'm afraid you read that right too. Breakfast is a microwave cup of it, lunch and dinner are the boxes.

You can see how this would cause issues! Eating out? Nope! Snacks while hanging with friends? Embarrassing. Dinner with my family? Off the table unless he brings a box of the stuff and fixes it for himself while everyone else eats a normal meal. We eat Sunday dinner with his family and they put up with it, Lord knows how but he's the youngest and was always a tad spoiled. 

Those are just the social problems, there's also the nagging issue of his health. He goes to the gym and has for years, so he does exercise and is a healthy weight. That doesn't mean his body is getting the nutrients it needs. If he keeps this up I'm terrified he's going to do permanent damage soon. 

All right, now that I've ranted a bit, let me back up and just explain how this started: we been together 10 yrs total and married 3. He used to have a few things he preferred to stick with as his favorite foods (pretty normal I think) but he ate other things too sometimes. Now somehow over the past couple years, he's phased everything out gradually. Now only Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese remains. I'd say nothing but that has passed his lips that I know of since Summer 2016. I think back to that time and don't remember anything happening that could have caused it. No family problems, no money or work problems, no health problems, no significant life changes. Neither has he drastically changed anything else in his habits. His exercise routine is the same, so is his sleep and hygiene. 

So naturally, I've asked why. I've made meals he used to enjoy. I've calmly expressed my feelings of how much I love him and why it worries me. I've also begged, yelled and cried, the whole nine yards. He gets upset in response to all of it, and has told me many times: ""I'm a grown man and I can eat what I want. So what? It's my favorite food, it's cheap, and I don't force you to eat it."" This is his argument everytime. I get no explanation for the change except that he just decided since he's able to eat what he wants, he will only eat his favorite thing. I got no problem with it being his favorite thing. I got a problem with it being ALL HE EATS! It isn't healthy! He said his doc says he's perfectly healthy. I can't believe that. 

Maybe the worst thing about this to me is we want kiddos in the next couple years. I cannot imagine raising a child with a father who only eats one thing and a junky thing at that. By the time they're 3 that's all they'll want to eat too, and ""Daddy does it so why can't I!"" Nightmare!! Not happening! 

The way I see it is, if he doesn't change his diet we don't get children. That breaks my heart. If he doesn't change his diet I could very well lose him long before it should be his time. Writing this makes the social embarrassment problems seem petty in comparison.

What do I do??? How can I get through to him that this is a real problem, not me picking on him or being dramatic? 

**tl;dr** My hubby eats nothing but Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. I'm extremely worried about what this means for his health and our plans to have children. He says he does this because it's just his favorite food and insists I'm making a big deal out of nothing. How to make him see my concern??

"I [38M] don't want to do Football Sunday's at my friends [30'sMF] because of the kids!


Ok so this is not nearly as major of an issue as many others on here, but I'm just having trouble figuring out how to handle this situation without being an asshole.


For years now my friends and I all get together for Football Sunday at my best friends place.  We drink, eat food, watch football.  It's good times!  A few years ago he got married and they now have two really great boys, that I also adore!  They are now 5 and 2 yo.  Some of my other friends are now married and have kids also, which they bring over as well.  I am also married, but my wife and I don't have any kids.

The problem is that the games at their place just aren't fun anymore.  The game gets paused and delayed for upwards of an hour because of game day prep lagging behind.  The kids are all loud and interrupting during the game, everyone is just talking parent talk all throughout and no one is really drinking anymore.  

So for me, I'm unable to just enjoy watching the game, I pretty much don't drink either because it's just not that vibe and I spend most of the time wishing I had watched the game at home or a bar because then I would have been able to actually follow what was happening!  I'd like to transition to watching it at some other venue, whether alone or not, but I know my friends will notice and think I'm upset with them or there is some sort of problem.  Which means they will ask me about it and I don't know what to say!  I don't want to be like, ""oh your kids are distracting during the game."" because  I know they will be offended by that!


Does anyone have advice on how I can handle this?  I'm sure I'm not the first guy to have to navigate this situation!  Thanks!

"My sisters [19F &amp; 30F] and I [20F] planned a trip to Japan this December. My older sister [30F] got pregnant and pulled out of the trip but is upset that me and our younger sis still plan to go with someone else [26F].


Older sis: Anna [30F]
Me: Anne [20F]
Younger sis: Annabelle [18F]
Older brother's gf: Arielle [26F]

My sisters and I were planning a trip to Japan together for 3 weeks. We planned to go right after our younger sister finished her state exams which coincide with my uni holidays in December. My older sister is a teacher and the school holidays are also in December. Since all 3 of us are able to go we decided to take a trip together to Japan. Japan is one of the countries we have always wanted to visit. This trip was planned for months in advance and we already bought tickets and started arranging for accommodation. The problem is that my older sister recently found out she is pregnant - 11 weeks now. By the time we go she would be approximately 5 months pregnant. We are intending to spend 3 weeks in Japan. I know that my sister and her husband have been having trouble conceiving and I'm very happy for her. She and her husband have decided to pull out if the trip because they are paranoid about the pregnancy and if something goes wrong my sister will be in a foreign land which is something Annabelle and I understand. We returned all the money she contributed including the money for the plane tickets. We have been asking around for someone else to fill the 3rd person's place because we have already bought the tickets and are looking into accommodation.

My older brother's long time girlfriend expressed interest in coming and offered to pay for the tickets and cover part of the cost. So the trip is still going ahead. Yesterday we were discussing the trip over dinner with our parents and Anna had a huge tantrum. She cried and said we were excluding her from the trip even though she was the one who pulled out of the trip. It became a huge rant about how we were always conspiring to exclude her from events and how me and Annabelle don't see her as our ""real sister"" and that we were “mean” and “selfish”. She used those specific words. Anna is actually our half sister from our Dad's first marriage. Since me and Annabelle are so much closer in age, we went to the same schools and share a number of friends. but we don't treat Anna any different than our older brother. Anna was going on and on about cancelling the trip to prove that we really love her. Our parents tried telling her that she was being unreasonable since we already paid for a number of things including plane tickets and Annabelle and I have been working part time to save money for the trip but this turned into another rant about our mother (Anna’s step mom) excluding her and making her feel like an outsider. I feel that Anna is being unfair and unreasonable. Her husband didn’t say anything. Now Arielle feels guilty and considered pulling out of the trip (but my older brother convinced her to stay) and this whole thing has left a sour taste in my mouth. Is there a way to resolve this? We are still planning to go for the trip though since the tickets are paid for.

My older sister got pregnant and pulled out of the trip but is upset that me and my younger sis still plan to go with someone else. she threw a huge tantrum about us excluding her and making her feel like an outsider. She's the only half sibling from our Dad's first marriage. However, I feel that we have never treated her differently. Is there a way to resolve this without cancelling the trip? "

"My [27F] boyfriend [29M] throws tantrums and I'm getting sick of it


I'm possibly being a little harsh, but last night my boyfriend of 2 years had what can only be described as a tantrum. 

At around 11pm I had already gone to bed and boyfriend was next door in his office working (he's a teacher, and apparently this demands he work every waking hour, and there is nothing that could possibly be done to reduce his workload). He was playing music through his phone which was keeping me awake and so I got up and asked him if he could turn it down a bit. I wasn't aggressive, in fact I was asking apologetically because I felt bad that I was able to go to bed while he worked. 

His response was to pick up his phone, scream and launch it at the wall. 

It's not the first time he's has this kind of childish and irrational outburst. He blames the stress of his job and tries to down play it as if it's no big deal. But to me it is. It's downright frightening to be around someone that exercises so little impulse control. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking, other than how can I get my boyfriend to grow up? 

Tldr: boyfriend's response to being asked to turn down his music was to launch his phone at the wall.

He met Carmella for the first time on Friday night. They spoke for a little bit and I was there the whole time. Not once did she even remotely flirt with him or vice versa.

"Me [28F] with my BF[30 M/F] duration 1.5 years, My BFF (28F) came out as Lesbian and my BF is furious with me.


I'm gonna keep this short. I have been best friends with Nina for 12 years now. We became especially close about 10 years ago when she confided in me that she was Gay and depressed. She comes from a conservative christian family. She was dealing with a lot of personality conflict and was suicidal even for a while. I became her support and cheer leader and encouraged her to get therapy. I wnet with her to LGBT support groups and while her mental health improved, she decided to ""stay in the closet"". She dated a few girls through the years disguised as ""close friends"" and ""room mates"" I was the only one who knew about her relationships. 

Now, like many female BFFs we spend ALOT of time together and know an unhealthy amount of info about each other private and personal life. She has also supported me through my difficult times and is truly my sister in spirit. 

I have been dating my BF for a bit over a year now and things are getting serious we are at point of discussing future plans like moving in together and time line for marriage etc. We have a good relation ship over all. 

Now, 2 weeks ago, on her Bday. Nina finally came out. First to her family and then on FB to everyone. A lot of her family has abandoned her over it. so I invited her to spend thanks giving with us (I'm Canadian). We had our own small dinner with just some close friends on Saturday. At dinner Nina gave an emotional speech and thanked us for loving her as she is and then thanked me especially for saving her life (her words) and supporting her all these years.

well, after everyone left i could say my BF looked irate. I asked him what was wrong and he suddenly kinda exploded like YOU KNEW ALL SHE WAS  GAY? i was like yeah...and i thought he was upset i never shared it with him and started explaining that it was not my secret to share. 

He goes on to explain he feels betrayed that I had a close friend who would be sexualiy interested in me! He went on about all the times I spent the night at her house even sleeping in same bed with her and concluded that I have basically been cheating on him this whole time. 

I was baffled and mad and answered probably louder than I should have that he was insane and she is my best friend and basically my sister and what he was accusing me of was sick and he needs to either apologize or GTFO of my apartment. 

Well, he did. and later texted me to un-invite me to his family's dinner which was on monday. He said if he was this close to a girl I'd be mad too. I think his comparison is insane. anyways its been almost a week and neither of us thinks we should apologize. What do you think? what would you do? I'm tired of living like this even a break up would be less frustrating at this point. He claims I disrespected our relationship and i think he is way out of line. who is wrong here?

Edit: spelling

"My(27F) boyfriend (24M) has a history of cheating. I'm thinking of leaving, friends think I'm crazy. Advice?


We've been together three months. We get along very well, have similar goals, it's all just been generally awesome and I've been falling for him hard. 

Full disclosure: I had a serious boyfriend who cheated on me, so I'm paranoid as fuck. 

 My boyfriend and I had a conversation last weekend that freaked me out. He was talking about his ex girlfriend, Shayla. (They broke up about a month before we started dating, so this is very, very recent)

They were together for 1 year and a half, and unhappy for most of it. I'd heard him mention another girl, Liza, that he'd dated for a few months, and was confused about the timeline. It turns out he dated (hooked up with?) Liza while he was with Shayla. Multiple times. Once, he even had sex with Liza, then went to his graduation ceremony, and then home, with Shayla. 

I was disgusted, but tried to hide it. I asked how I could know that he wouldn't do the same to me. He said because he'd always been unhappy with Shayla, but was happy with me. All that tells me is that the minute we have a problem, he could cheat. 

I probed a little more, and he said he had had sex with other girls while dating Shayla. But that it hadn't entered his head to cheat on me. 

What also freaks me out is a conversation we'd had a month ago- he had been worried I'd cheat on him, and I said I wouldn't. ""But you can't know that!"" he told me. ""You never know who you'll meet, or what you'll do! There's no way you can promise me that."" Once again, that freaks me out- doesn't that just mean that HE can't promise that he won't cheat? 

Basically, I think I should break up with him, because I can already predict how this relationship will end. My friends think that he is awesome (Everyone loves him. He's lovable as fuck) and that I'm being paranoid and crazy.

  ---   
TL;DR Should I break up with this guy? He cheated on his ex multiple times, and that relationship ended in early June. I think I'll be next if I stay. "
"I (21F) snooped through my sister's (11F) phone


I know how wrong it was for me to invade her privacy, but I was worried because she kept on getting into fights with her friends (both 12F).

Over the past few months my sister has told me about numerous fights that she has been in with 2 of her friends, and I've been trying my best to support and help her. Naturally, she is 11 so she believes that she does nothing wrong and I have been approaching these fights with only her side in mind, because she has made our family believe that these girls are horrible to her.

This morning I looked through her WhatsApp messages and it's really not how my sister says it is. Her and her friends all ride horses, and my sister goes out of her way to insult their riding technique, their bonds with their horses, and saying that she is a better rider than them etc. When the one friend argued back my sister said some nonsense about her having ""anger management issues"" and being ""in therapy"" for it, which is a complete lie. 

There are a bunch of other lies that she has been telling her friends, and she is just generally very rude to them. She will tell me that they are rude to her and that they start fights with her, but by the looks of it she instigates everything. When her friends eventually say ""please just leave me alone"" she won't leave them alone. There is also lots of swearing and name calling.

I want to dismiss this as typical 11 year old behaviour because of puberty and all, but I feel like she is going to continue losing friends if she continues behaving like this. These are formative years and if she loses more friends her teen years will be even more difficult. It feels so out of character because she is the sweetest girl in real life and she is my best friend. It's like she is a totally different person over text.

I really want to help and support her, but she is incredibly stubborn and will never accept being wrong. I don't think she has ever said sorry for anything. We were raised the same way with the same parents, but it's just a personality trait of hers that she needs to work on, I suppose. 

I have spoken about this to our mother and she agrees that we need to approach this and doesn't mind ""taking the fall"" in telling my sister that she was the one who snooped, not me, because she would rather be the ""bad mother"" than have me be the ""bad sister.""

My question is, how can we approach this situation? Or is this just typical behaviour and I'm overthinking it all?


Tl;dr I snooped on my sister's phone and saw that she is very rude to her friends and tells me that they are rude to her and I'm worried she is going to lose more friends because of her behaviour"
"I (32f) caught my husband (29m) of 8 years having an online affair. He demands I open the relationship or leave the house.


My husband (29m) and myself (32f) married for 8 years have had an excellent marriage for the last 5 years, the first three years were a bit tough but we worked through issues and left our past behind us. 

We dealt with deaths of close family members, job losses, errors in judgment on substance use, mismanagement of finances. We always were able to find solutions to whatever was current until three weeks ago.....

My husband was shaving and he had left his phone in the kitchen so I moved it to the bedroom to charge as we were preparing for bed. A notification popped up that he had messages on skype. I didn't even think of anything we went to bed. 

The next morning we were preparing for work and he was taking recycling to the curb and once again a Skype notification popped up. I decided to open it up, nether of us use skype or I thought. I open it up to a multi month conversation with some women from across the country how they are in love and are planning to meet, naked pictures videos. They had been talking at night for hours at least three times every week sometimes more.

I was absolutely destroyed, I took screenshots and began sending them to myself. When my husband came into the house I exploded on him
With what I had found. He became extremely irate and told me either take it or leave it.  I could not believe my ears. I don't know what to do we haven't spoken in a day.

"I [22M] have very elaborate daydreams. My boyfriend [25M] is extremely upset about them.


A bit of context for the situation first. 

I grew up in a very abusive and neglectful home as a child. The only escape I had was daydreaming, and I learned to imagine extremely elaborate, detailed scenarios that I would inject myself into. Sometimes they would be centered around a book or video game I was currently consuming, and sometimes it would purely be fictional. In my daydreams I was able to make friends (mostly strong video game characters I admired) who could protect me, and I could leave the house and go on as many adventures as I wanted (my mother used to lock me in my room as soon as I came back from school). 

I left home at 16, and trying to scrape by alone as a teenager was not fun at all. I used to lie in bed at night daydreaming for hours about a new, better life, then falling asleep; in the morning I would count down the hours until I could go back to bed and continue where I left off. My mind created whole universes for me to explore with my imaginary ""friends""-- some of the more permanent fixtures are BJ blazkowicz from wolfenstein and master chief from Halo, my heroes as a child because I thought they had the strength to fight off my abusers. 

I met my boyfriend at 20, and we immediately hit it off. A while after we started dating, I told him about my daydreams and how big of a part of my life they had become. At first he didn't really take it seriously, and even mentioned that I must be using them as a sort of coping/healing mechanism from my painful childhood memories. It wasn't until very recently that he asked me out of the blue if my daydreams had any romantic parts in it. Thinking nothing of it, I told him that yes, I did have some romantic elements in some of the ""arcs"" simply because it was so elaborate. This led to him aggressively interrogating me on what my daydreams were about these days, who I was ""dating"" in my mind, and which ""base"" I'd gone with said character-- I resisted telling him because I've always considered my daydreams very personal, but he was relentless and I ended up telling him that I was recently attracted to Daniel Craig's James Bond. This sent my boyfriend into a rage and he made fun of me viciously, calling me a baby for having imaginary friends (I maintained that it was different, but he didn't listen), and told me that Daniel Craig himself would be offended that someone as pathetic as me would be crushing on a character he played, as if I didn't already know. He then made me promise not to daydream again, and when we were going to bed he kept shaking me awake every few minutes asking me if I was ""doing it again."" 

I'm very conflicted about this. I know that it must be rare for someone to daydream and imagine whole worlds and different timelines like I do, but at the same time it's not hurting anybody and I make sure it doesn't interfere with my real life at all. I don't understand why my boyfriend reacted so strongly against it. Is this something we need to talk about, and how do I bring it up? Should I just go straight to therapy to get rid of it?

"My (31F) sister (33F) won't allow my parents to spend Christmas with me and my kids


I'm basically looking for insight as to whether I'm out of line or she is (as I'm inclined to believe). Also I'm on my phone so please excuse any format or other errors. 

So a bit of background to what our Christmas usually looks like.  We usually all go to my sister's, we'll call her Samantha, Christmas eve night for appies and drinks after Christmas eve mass. Then my husband and I take our two boys (3 And 10 months) home to bed and spend Christmas morning alone just the 4 of us. While Samantha has my mom and dad ( who live with her) her 4 children and sometimes our other sister who's single and childless sleep at her house and spend Christmas morning together.  

Two Christmases (2015) ago I requested we maybe take turns, one year my mom and dad spend Christmas morning with them, and the next year they spend it with my family. My mom and dad agreed that it sounded fair and that they would spend the following Christmas morning (2016) with my family. Once Samantha got wind of this plan she lost it.  I was called selfish, accused of not wanting her or her kids around. I attempted to offer compromises but she wouldn't have it.  I wasn't allowed to ""take her parents away from her on Christmas"". She was unwilling to budge any of her usual Christmas plans to make this work for me and refused to even acknowledge that it was a valid request.  

My argument is this. We have a big family.  I'm one of four kids.  My brother (35m) has 5 kids of his own and managed to set his own traditions a few years ago after several years of our whole family sleeping at his house and having Christmas morning as one big happy family.  But our family has grown considerably since then.  He has 5 kids, Samantha has 4 And my husband and I have our 2 boys. It's not realistic to have us all sleep under the same roof anymore. Also my mom and dad live with Samantha, so her kids get endless time with our parents.  I want a small piece of that for my kids. I want them to have a chance to make some memories with their grandparents without having to compete for attention with my sisters 4 energetic kids. Is this unfair? Am I the unreasonable one here? Last year it grew into a huge argument that resulted in tears almost every day for over a week and Samantha still got her way.  It's taken everything I have to not allow the argument to affect my relationship with my sister long term.  Please, any advice or insight is appreciated. 


Tl;dr Sister won't allow Christmas to change to allow my family some one on one time with my parents. "

"Me [20 M] my sister (26 F] is obsessed with horses and has an illusion of real life, I don't know how to deal with this anymore


I live at home currently, with my mother [54] and my sister. Aswell as my handicapped aunt who stays at our house every month and then moves to my other aunt.

So yeah my mother has money issues, at home. My sister was gifted two horses at a young age because she is obsessed with it. Even though we don't have enough space for them to hold or the money. It's been around 10 years we live in this crap.

My sister first tried to force her fandom onto me when I was young. She manipulated my mother into forcing me to learn to horse ride. Made me buy equipment and stuff. She even went out to buy me a horse which I didn't even ask for and blames me now that I don't look after it. I couldn't give it away since it is on my mother's name, I'm not really the rightful owner.

Now so far, I've managed to cope with her behavior. But lately my mother inherited some money and she is trying to manipulate my mother into giving it to her. Not even share it with me. 

She manipulates everyone in my surroundings to think I'm the bad guy first so no one thinks that she is the real slimy scumbag azing after my mother's cash. She lies all the time lately. She even stated she overheard me begging to my mom to buy me a brand new car even though I haven't said such thing. i told my mother the first thing she should do with her money is go on a vacation on her own, without the issues and troubles at home.

I don't give a crap what she does with her money. For all I care she spends it all. I only wish if she would repay my money I borrowed her 3 years ago so I could have an eye surgery to repair my damaged eyes.

My sister at the same time is looking for houses with lots of stables for my mom to buy, or she's looking for a big car and van to move her horses around, or she is looking to build nice stables on our lot. 

She's angry that I talk my mother out of it. Often twisting the story when confronted into trying to blame me for something. It's tiresome and frustrating. Everytime she gets confronted she changes subject to that one time I forgot to close the door and that she got mad for example. You can't really argument with her because she starts yelling, crying, telling she's going to kill herself, etc...

Lately though I've began to worry because we had a brochure of a company that deals in building stables and other horse furnishing in the mail. I asked my sister if she had anything to do with this but she just acted like her nose bled. Now my mother showed me a letter that came with it that she tried to hide stating the order was done in my mother's name even though she didn't ask for it at all...

I don't know what the fuck to do with this anymore. I'm beyond pissed off at the moment. My mother is a very naive person that is easily manipulated because of her traumatic background and here my sister is just taking advantage of it for the fucking scumbag she is. I wasn't supposed to tell my dad about this inheritage, at first I didn't know why but now it's clear that my sister is trying to not hurt her image as daddy's little princess (I don't really come on good terms with my father like my sister because of it)

"My (25/m) boyfriend (33/m) said some horrible things to me and I don’t know if I can forgive him.


My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years and up until this weekend, things have been okay.

Saturday was my birthday and my boyfriend (F) decided to take me to Vegas for the weekend as a gift. F was sick most of last week and asked if I would be disappointed if we didn’t go and I was honest with him and told him I’d be slightly disappointed but not angry about it because I understood that he was sick and not up to it. He then insisted that we go even though I told him it really was okay.

We left Friday morning (we drove) and from the time F woke up, through the whole 5 hour drive he was in a bad mood. I offered to drive so he could rest but that only lasted for about 20 minutes before he made me pull over so he could drive because he felt like I was driving “shittier than normal” to annoy him (not the case at all). I tried talking to him but he ignored me and when I stopped talking talking to him, he said the vibe I was giving off was annoying and that I needed to knock it off and stop being sensitive and taking things personally. Then we got to the hotel and I checked us in but I couldn’t figure out how to open the door because the key card wouldn’t work and he accused me of purposely acting obtuse to try and get on his nerves which wasn’t the case at all. The whole evening pretty much went like that, with me apparently doing every single thing wrong, so I left for a few hours and when I got back, F was asleep but I didn’t know and accidentally woke him up when I came in and we got into another fight. I mentioned that he’d been in a really bad mood all day and that not everything was my fault. He lost it after that and said that maybe if I wasn’t “so fucking stupid” then he wouldn’t be in such a bad mood. F knows how I feel about being called stupid and I ended up tearing up because of it which made everything worse. He made fun of me and called me a “stupid whiny crybaby,” told me how “gross” my body was, said that I was genuinely the most annoying person he’d ever met, and that he totally understood why my ex used to beat me. Which was the most shocking and hurtful thing and was like a slap in the face. It was a lot and it really really hurt so I left and got a new room for the night and had a friend to pick me up Saturday evening. 

I didn’t talk to F at all until Monday when he called and apologized. I didn’t answer (he left a voicemail) and for the past two days he’s been calling and texting non stop apologizing for what he said, but I’m hurt and not ready to talk to him. Over the past few days I’ve really thought about our relationship and whether I want to stay with him or not after all he said. This is the first time he’s had a big outburst and said purposefully hurtful things to me like this and part of me feels like breaking up with him is an overreaction since this is the first time and he was sick and stressed at the time but another part of me wonders if this is what I’ll have to deal with every time he’s sick and stressed and I still have the words ringing in the back of my head. I don’t know what to do. Am I overreacting?

Tl;dr: My boyfriend said some really hurtful things to me over the weekend and has apologized, but I don’t know if I can get over what he said but at the same time, I feel breaking up with him may be an overreaction."

"My [22F] boyfriend [25M] keeps embarrassing me in front of others about my job/salary (Romantic)


Can't flair cuz I'm on mobile, but here goes anyway. My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years, and were long distance for a good chunk of that while I was in college and he was working out of state. His job doesn't have much mobility, so I compromised after graduation and moved to his state (where I didn't have any other professional or personal relationships or ties). I took the first job that came my way cuz hello, student loans. It's definitely not my ideal job, and I've been planning to quit soon to go back to school in the next 6 months-ish, once I've got in-state residency established.

But my boyfriend seems to think it's funny or harmless to embarrass me in front of friends and family about my low salary. He makes a lot of money and didn't have to go to college, so has essentially no debt or understanding of the tough job market, especially where we are located (I got a liberal arts education and we live in a pretty blue-collar/agricultural area). This weekend kinda was the straw that broke my back. We were at a wedding with a lot of his family, and one of his siblings just started a job very similar to mine, though her qualifications are significantly less than mine. He asked her what she makes, and she makes a dollar more an hour than me-- which he proceeded to announce to the entire group. I was mortified and so embarrassed, I just sat there in silence.  

We have a relationship where we both dish it out and I can usually take it when it's all in good fun, but he KNOWS this is a sore spot for me. How can I talk to him about this? 

TLDR; my bf thinks it's funny or no big deal to talk openly and embarrass me about my low-paying first job. How do I make him understand that it's not a joke to me?
--------
EDIT: Thank you all so much for the words of advice and different perspectives! It was so helpful to get some outside opinions. I spoke to my BF about how his actions made me feel, and made it very clear that this will not be tolerated again. He was remorseful and understood that he took the ""joke"" too far, so that's a good sign. Thank you again!"
"I (34F) went to Starbucks and the movies once with a friend. Now he won't stop leaving me angry messages.


Several months ago, I went to Starbucks once with a co worker. We had a nice time and talked a lot about our families. Another time, (several months apart) we went to the movies. I should add we went Dutch both times. These were not dates. We worked on a property that has both a Starbucks and a movie theater on site.  

In August, I began dating one of my long time friends. We used to be co workers as well, but we didn't begin dating until after I left the company and got a new job with an entirely different company. Everyone was happy for us and says we make a great couple. 

Everyone except the other friend. Now, he made no mention that he was unhappy before. In fact, I didn't hear a peep out of him until yesterday, which I didn't think anything of, because we go for several months without even talking. My last text from him was in March. You get the idea. Yesterday, I made a post about my homemade soup on Facebook. I'd never made it before and it turned out great! I was so proud of myself honestly. Boyfriend says ""Looks great! 🤤"" and other mutual friends of ours asked if my boyfriend could bring some with him so they could try it. I said sure, boyfriend jokes ""Don't run out of soup now!"" And I joke that I'll always make soup for him. 
Someone commented that we were so cute. The other friend? He commented that he was going to throw up, and could I please stop? 

It took me a little by surprise, but you know, whatever. Maybe it was a joke, but something didn't sit right with me. I deleted the soup post, because I didn't want it up anymore.

This morning, he's left negative comments on any post he can find. One was a funny meme, which he posted ""Who cares"" on it. Now, I know he's angry. It makes me feel uncomfortable and like I've done something wrong, when logically I know I haven't. 

I've learned over time that this guy is very angry and bitter. I do know that he is angry that he has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair. I also have CP, but I can walk. one of the things that put me off about him was how negative he is. He thought I would be angry about my disability too. I'm not. Annoyed sometimes maybe, but not mad. I also have friends and am friendly. He doesn't and I've discovered he snaps at a lot of people and just expects things. Instead of saying ""Excuse me"" for example, he demands that they move. It really turned me off and I started distancing myself slowly, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings by going no contact.

That ship has sailed now. I unfriended him this morning, without a word, but my boyfriend still works with this guy. Should I give him a heads up? Have I done something wrong?

tl;dr: Guy I used to work with is bitter that I'm dating another man and won't stop spamming my Facebook. "

"Every since I [19F] started university, all my values/beliefs have changed and I feel really conflicted/guilty


I'm not really sure what advice I'm looking for here but ever since I started university my beliefs have changed. In a sense, I’m happy that they have. I’m more open minded and accepting. 

However, I come from a traditional/conservative background so whenever I go back home I feel there’s a huge distance between me and them. Like I can’t relate to them anymore. I don’t think I’m better than them or anything like that, just our beliefs are so different now. I never use to think about the things they say at home but now I can’t stand to be around them when they express ignorant and sexist views. Despite their flaws, I love them so much and they really have been the best family I could have asked for. I don’t really share my beliefs with them or try to force my beliefs on them. But I slip up, like when they’re saying ignorant stuff I can’t help but comment.


Lately, the whole thing has been bringing me down. I feel so anxious and guilty. I’m afraid I’ll lose my family over this. They’ve already started to exclude me like I’m a pariah or something. I mean they love me but they’re acting like I betrayed them or something? My uncle called me last week to talk some sense into me. He told me that my parents didn’t immigrate to this country for me to become this person and endorse these values…blah blah. I feel guilty because I feel like I’m turning my back on them and their way of life. They’ve done and sacrificed so much for me but I can’t go back to the person I was before. 

Is there anyway I can deal with this or fix my relationship with my parents and siblings? I’ve been watching my mouth whenever I go visit but I’m still being excluded 

TL;DR: 2nd year uni student, beliefs have changed. Family not happy and feel betrayed by this. They're now excluding me or giving me the cold shoulder.

"My girlfriend [29F] wants me [25F] to stop talking to my best friend [26F]


Hello /r/Relationships. I'm going to preface this post by saying that I know I screwed up. I didn't handle the situation well, I am not doing the right thing now, and I am not sure how to carry forward. Sorry, this will probably be long. 


I met my best friend Andrea 8 years ago online. It was on a forum and we just started chatting online and eventually exchanged phone numbers to text. It was NOT a dating site or anything like that, just a forum where people chat about whatever. At this point in my life I didn't have a lot of friends (I pushed them away when I was in denial about my mental illness) and Andrea and I would text quite a bit. Even though we had never met in person, Andrea and I considered ourselves to be very good friends. I also had a rough couple of years with many people in my family passing away, me almost failing school, getting to a low point in my illness and finally seeking help. Maybe it's because of the online thing, but Andrea and I could talk about all of this and she helped me through my rough time. We have since visited each other in the others' countries a few times. I do consider her to be my best friend but that is it. Neither of us want a relationship any more than that and even just thinking about it is WEIRD. 


I met my girlfriend Emily about 3 years ago online (this time it was a dating site!) and everything was fine at first, she was interested in my friends, didn't mind when I texted them. But then one day, we were talking about Andrea and I mentioned that she has lived overseas her whole life and that we met online. This is when the growing hatred of Andrea began. Emily got very angry that I never told her that Andrea and I met online and had only met in person a handful of times. Over the next year, we would constantly fight about Andrea because Emily was convinced that I was in love with Andrea, she was in love with me, I used to be in love with her but now I'm not, she is still in love with me and is jealous, etc. 


I never hid the fact that Andrea and I very good friends and we consider each other our best friends (I know lots of people on Reddit think your SO should be your best friend, but my girlfriend's best friend is this other dude David - who actually used to like her - so we can have best friends other than our SO's). I've explained to Emily how Andrea and I became friends and I have also told her many things that finally convinced her that I am NOT in love with my best friend. There is nothing, however, to change her mind about my best friend being in love with me. 


I gave Andrea my address once because she was going to send me a birthday card and Emily got angry because now Andrea can come to our house and tell me she loves me in person. (what.). Every time Andrea texted me, Emily would get irritable and interrogate me: what did she text you? did you reply back? did you start the conversation? how did she know about that? One day, Emily and I were fighting about something unrelated, and I left to go on a walk. I left my phone on the kitchen counter and Emily decided to go through my messages. When I came home, she was extremely angry because she found a conversation with Andrea that I had not told her about. And I'm supposed to tell her every single time Andrea texts me. It was a really boring conversation about water bills, but Emily was angry because when she read through all my texts with Andrea, Andrea did not ask about Emily. I tell Andrea about things Emily and I did together for example, and Andrea doesn't specifically ask about Emily. Or something like that, I honestly didn't even understand. But in her mind, Emily thinks Andrea doesn't bring her up deliberately because she doesn't like her. And the only reason Andrea wouldn't like Emily is because she's in love with me. Emily says that she hates Andrea so much that if she ever saw her, she would push her in front of a bus. At that point, Emily made me delete all of Andrea's contact info so I could never speak to her. She also made me swear that I hated Andrea and that I don't want anything to do with her ever again. I know I shouldn't have, but I did all of that (mainly so she'd stop yelling at me). For the next few weeks, Andrea would text me and Emily would get practically GIDDY at the fact that I was now ignoring Andrea. 


Me deleting Andrea's contact info had stemmed from such a huge fight that I didn't want to bring it up again for a while, so nothing really happened. Emily still hates Andrea with her entire being, I still can't text or talk about Andrea. However, I missed my best friend... and this is where I screwed up again. I still know Andrea's email address, so I emailed her from my work email that I only access at work. I told Andrea that Emily hates her and that's why we have to email instead of text. It has now been about 4 months and I just have absolutely no idea what to do. I don't like lying to Emily, but I also don't want to lose Andrea as a friend. But I know that Emily is never going to like Andrea.

"My [24F] fiancé’s [26M] mom [57F] always asks us to take care of his sister [25F] when she passes away but I’m against it


I realize this could possibly be a long time out, but it’s something that weighs on my mind whenever it’s brought up (which is every few months).

My fiancé’s mother frequently goes over what he needs to do and where he needs to go whenever she passes away and during that conversation she always tells him, “and you need to take care of your sister.” I can’t help but be completely turned off by this and I’m afraid it would be a dealbreaker in our marriage if it happened. I know that when you love someone you should accept their family as well, but let me go further into this.

His sister is older than I am and still lives at home. Yes, this is maybe somewhat normal considering cost of living, but there’s more to it. She has no job and no desire for a job. She had one at McDonalds for about 3 months, but she stopped showing up as soon as she bought herself a car and borrowed $300 from her mom to pay for registration/repairs/her license with no intent to pay her back (her mom was very upset when she found out she wouldn’t be paid back). She stays in her room 90% of the day watching YouTube videos on her phone, the other 10% is spent outside smoking or eating. I’ve rarely seen her clean up after herself unless her girlfriend comes over and talks her into cleaning the house. She has threatened to hit me before and called me a “dumb bitch” because I was in the middle of helping her mom cook a family dinner and said no to taking her to the store to buy cigarettes. She doesn’t contribute to her mom’s household whatsoever, whether it be paying rent or even buying milk. (If anyone is wondering what happened after she threatened me, her mom whispered to me to let it go and ignore that it happened). 

In her defense, sort of, she had a gas leak that went unnoticed in her bedroom for a few months and she got very ill to the point of have seizures, but the gas leak has been fixed for years and she still leans on that heavily as a defense. She hasn’t had a seizure since it was fixed.

I haven’t brought up my feelings about this to my fiancé or his mother because I’m not sure how. I don’t want to put a strain on my relationship with either of them because I can’t stand to be around this person. 

I’m not sure how my SO feels about it. I know he gets frustrated with her taking advantage of their mother, but I know he also loves his sister as much as any brother would.

This scares me a lot. Their mom has had some health problems come up, which I’m assuming is why she brings this up so often, and I know if anything were to happen his sister would have nowhere else to go. But I also know that bringing someone into my home who has threatened me and free loads is something that would break me.

How do I bring my feelings about this delicately? Or should I just wait it out?

Tldr: my fiancé’s mom asks us to take care of his sister after her passing and I’m 100% against it but don’t know how to say so

Edit: I got more responses to this than I thought I would! I ended up falling asleep and I’m now getting ready for work, but I’m reading through everything as I can. Thank you everyone"

"Neighbor (30M) saw me (27F) directly after a traumatic event, things are weird and awkward now, what to do?


A month ago, my (ex) boyfriend and I got into a huge fight. He had been somewhat physical towards me before but that night was the worst. He is a huge guy and was yanking me around and throwing me like a rag doll. I really could not defend myself against a person of that size, using all his strength to try to hurt me. I still feel pretty stupid that I basically did nothing. 

But anyway, he had thrown me against the bedroom wall twice pretty hard and my neighbor next door heard it and he banged on our wall. I think this spooked my ex because he finally stopped what he was doing and left my apartment. Neighbor must have seen him- big tall angry guy cussing and spitting as he slammed the door and screeching out of the parking lot.

About 10 minutes after he left, my neighbor knocked on my door and at that time I was pretty numb and kind of detached from everything and literally just opened the door and laughed at him for some reason. He saw how bad I looked (think: your stereotypical battered woman on TV) and immediately offered to call the cops. I told him that it was pointless and I don't want to do that, so then he just started talking to me, asking me if I was okay, what do you want to do, is he coming back, etc.

At the time, I was really out of it and numb and shocked so I just answered him and all his questions. I think we talked for over an hour. Then he said something like, I'm sorry this happened to you, I hope you know it's not your fault, and for some reason I just snapped to reality and just cried my eyes out and he hugged me.

My ex came back a few days later to apologize and all that and I broke up with him then. He didn't take it well but it's over and there is literally nothing he can do to change my mind. He punched the wall right next to my head because I was dead adamant about breaking up. He is a romantic for sure.

Problem is- I see my neighbor constantly. I run into him every night when I go home, every morning we leave at the same time. I even see him at the post office and grocery store. I'm not saying he's following me or anything- we've always run into each other like this and we've always just been friendly and made chit-chat. 

But now it's like we shared this strange, intimate, embarrassing moment together and now we're back to just being strangers and neighbors and we have to act like normal neighbors again. It's not like I'm going to move because of this, and it's not like I can avoid him. I just feel so awkward and uncomfortable when I see him. There was just one time he asked me if I was okay, how are things, and I literally blurted out ""I dumped him. It's over."" He didn't even ask that?? It was so embarrassing.

I guess I don't even know what my question is. What can I do to stop feeling so uncomfortable and ashamed around him? Why do I feel this way? What should I do? I honestly didn't even thank him that night and I always felt bad about that. But now I feel like it's too late. I know he feels awkward and uncomfortable when he sees me too. We do the whole fake polite smile thing now. 

TL;DR: My ex boyfriend was violent with me and stormed out of the apartment. My next door neighbor heard some of the fight and also saw him go to his car and came to see if I was okay. We talked a lot that night and I also cried and hugged him. Now things are awkward as shit when I see him around town, which is pretty often. I know I can't avoid him and I'm not going to move. Will this ever get better? Is there something I should or can do?"
"Boyfriend of 10 yrs half-ass gave me a ring (but not really) and isn't excited about getting married


My bf and I (both 31) have been together for 10 years. We talked about marriage and hypothetical kids for a while now but i never got the feeling he is really committed to either. 

One weekend while we were camping I learned that one of our best friends was going to propose to his girlfriend within the next month, I was really drunk and got very upset. I told Dave about it and that maybe we want different things and perhaps we should spend some time apart. He pulled out his grandmothers ring and told me he'd been trying to find a good time to do it and wanted to get it sized first. So now I feel like an ass hole but he's had this ring for 6 months at this point. 

He decided we should not tell anyone bc his best friend and him made a pact that neither would propose on this camping trip for fear the other girlfriend might feel shitty. Fast forward 2 months. We are hiking in the mountains and he pulls out the ring to show me again. We talk about wedding arrangements what type of wedding we want. He never gives methe ring though... 

Fast forward 1 month again. He hasn't made any effort to go get the ring sized together. And we don't talk about marriage ever. He brought up casually in conversation that we need to think about whether we actually doing a wedding next summer. 

What the fuck is wrong with him?! What do I do? I honestly feel like we should just spend some time apart at this point and like he's dangling this ring in front of me but doesn't actually want to commit to anything...

 TL:DR - boyfriend has tried to give me a ring twice now and failed. Doesn't feel like he wants to commit and isn't excited about getting married. I'm feeling super super shitty about it. Thinking about taking a break. "
"My[24F] best friend[26M] of 5 years kissed me, confessed his love for me. I don't feel the same way and I think I lost him.


I met Carter[24M] the day I started working at my current job. I was brand new to California, and I didn't know anyone. Carter and I never had all that much in common, but we became fast friends anyway. Since then, I have met a few more people but Carter has become the best friend I have ever had.

A few weeks ago, I started to date a guy I met. Carter started to act a little distant. He said that he had some things going on in his personal life, and he didn't really want to talk about it. We talk about EVERYTHING, I was really concerned.

Things with the guy I was dating didn't work out(He still had feelings for his Ex, and decided to go back to her). Carter came over to give me a shoulder, and watch some TV, like we used to. Things were going great, I was feeling better, and it seemed like things with Carter would be back to normal.

Carter kissed me. It caught me by surprise, and I pulled away. Carter immediately said how sorry he was, and left. The rest of the night, he wouldn't answer my calls, and he didn't return my texts.

The next day, after avoiding me for the entire morning at the office, Carter asked me to lunch. At lunch, Carter laid down everything. He said that he wished that he hadn't kissed me, but now that he has, he can't take it back. He said that he is in love with me, that he has loved me for years, and he can't hide it anymore. I didn't really know what to say. So I stayed quiet for a long time. I finally said that I didn't want things to change. 

He said that if he had a time machine, he would stop himself from kissing me. Maybe then, he could continue lying to himself about the way he feels about me, but he can't. He said that it hurts too much. He can't keep being with me, without being with me. No matter how much he wishes things could go back to the way that they were, they just can't. He can't put his feelings away, and pretend that they don't exist. He said that he loves me, but he can't torture himself. He said that he was sorry, and he left. I tried to stop him, to follow him, and to get him to listen, but he wouldn't. 

All I could do is cry. For 3 days now, I've been doing nothing but crying. At work, Carter won't even look at me. He won't return my calls, or my texts. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my best friend. Should I date him, I love Carter, but I have never thought of him in that way. 

**TL;DR** My best friend Carter kissed me. I didn't return his feelings, now he is saying he can't be my friend. What should I do?"
"Me [27F] recently found horrible messages in a group chat about me, devastated and humiliated.


I [27F] was talking to [23M] on a night out and he said he wanted a selfie with me, so I smiled and took a picture with him. He posted the picture in the group chat of 20+ and made a comment about ""slaying tom's ex"" (For the purpose of this, my recent ex's name is Tom). He also made jokes about ""spitroasting"" me with other men in the group chat.
The idiot then added me to the group without realizing I could see the chat history. I can read everything so I saw the shit he wrote when I was sitting not a few metres away from him, laughing with his friends. I was deeply humiliated, went home and called him out on it in the group chat (Called him a liar, said I didn't even touch him etc). It was extremely uncomfortable as in that group chat was friends of my ex boyfriend who immediately messaged me asking what was going on. I had to justify to them what was happening - and the bastards said things like ""it's not like him to make things up"".
I am deeply humiliated, hurt and upset. I feel like I have to justify myself even though I haven't done anything wrong. I feel like I have a target on my head and can't reconcile why someone would be so horrible and what I said/did to make him think that was OK. Worst off - I don't want my ex to hear about it (Although he probably will from his friends in the group chat) because our break up is painful enough already. It has severely impacted my mood, drained my energy and made me paranoid.
How do I feel OK again?

"Mine [21F] and my boyfriends [22M] friends [24F, 26M] are getting married the day before we go on holiday.. they are expecting us to attend the whole wedding.


Hannah and Graham, our friends, have been engaged since around may of this year, they had originally planned to get married in August 2019.



They both previously posted in our group chat about possibly doing a ""secret wedding"" instead of a proper one where they won't need to invite all the people they originally planned and instead only immediate family and some friends. Something about it costing too much money and they would rather just do something small and be able to travel (which hell yes in my opinion, best idea ever!)



2 nights ago they then posted in the chat that they moved the wedding up to 21st march 2018 and would be doing the secret wedding idea. Problem is me and my boyfriend fly out on 22nd march (at 4am!!). We politely said to them we will definitely come to the wedding but leave around 8pm (wedding starts at 4) or something to get home (1 hour away) and get some sleep in us for the flight.



Problem is my boyfriend is one of their ushers and they've basically said my boyfriend is ""bailing"" on the wedding by leaving early and by not drinking. Which I kind of get by the leaving early but not drinking is somehow bailing? 



They've started sending us messages asking us to just stay the whole time and that it's a small wedding and we can just stay there overnigjt. They've also asked us just to g straight from the venue to the airport and have given us ideas like getting the last train back to our home city etc. 



But I have quite had anxiety specially when it comes to traveling. I have near panic attacks about forgetting things or going through security or missing flights etc. And having to pull an alnignter and head straight to the airport like they said is just not doable for me. But they really aren't listening.



I just wanted to know, am I being unreasonable? I get that they are one of our closest friends but they just so suddenly changed the date then expect us to attend the whole wedding despite us having other plans.



I was considering just changing our flights but we are flying out for a a football game for my boyfriends birthday (I paid for all the flights and hotel etc.) and my boyfriend isn't so keen on changing the flights as he really wanted to go for those dates. I've also had the flights booked for a month ago so it will cost quite a lot to change them.



I'm just really stuck on what to do as even if we do try leave at 8pm. I don't drive so my boyfriend would have to stay sober and I just don't trust him not to give into them basically forcing shots down him and then our whole way of getting to airport would be ruined.. so advice?

"Me (21F) with my friend (20F). I feel cheated out of my birthday.


I'm on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.

So it was my birthday recently and I'm one of those people that love to celebrate birthdays. Not to the extent of expecting a  ""birthday week"" or any of that silliness but I do get very excited. This year it was also special as I turned 21.

Now my issue might be a non-issue but I still feel hurt over what happened and maybe you guys can give me some advice. I have been planning my birthday party for a while (just a gathering with my friends with alcohol and pizza, but still special to have everyone together). All throughout the planning a very close friend of mine, ""Sarah"", has helped me and told me she'd make a cake so I wouldn't have to worry about that too and she'd bring me a card game so I wouldn't have to buy it. Now, she offered those things and I thought she was being nice and I was grateful... Everything was great, I sent out the invites to my party a couple of days before so people could give me a heads up if they'd be attending.
No one declined. Awesome.

The next day Sarah sends out her own invites to a party the day before my party/birthday to all people I invited. I was a bit taken aback and told her that I thought that may not have been the best idea to which she just replied that people [implying she was referring to me specifically] should be more spontaneous. 

The week went on, I dropped by her party to be polite but said I'd be leaving early as I had stuff to set up for my own party, in response to which half the guests seemed very confused as they though we had just ""merged parties"" and mine wasn't on anymore. I was a bit hurt but assured people that I would still be celebrating my birthday. Now to how this came to affect my party the next day:

- one of my friends said he couldn't come due to what sounded suspiciously like a hangover from the previous night. When I asked my other guests they high-fived for making him drink that much. 

- Sarah told me casually that she'd be late for my party (by 2 hours) and when she showed up she fell asleep almost right away as they had partied until way  into the morning. She didn't bring a cake either as she had served it at her own party. 

- nobody wanted to drink with me as they had done so excessively the night before, neither did they want to play games as they said they had ""played everything"" the night before. 

- The conversation mostly revolved around during inside jokes from the previous night that I of course didn't understand. 

Bottom line? I feel my party sucked I  comparison to hers the day before. I wouldn't have minded at all had she had a party the day after, I would have happily attended. But the way it happened made me feel like she tried to squeeze her party in to get attention. 

*TL;DR: friend had a random party the day before my 21st birthday party with the same guest list and same Programme that we planned together, making my party be stale and boring in comparison. Am I right to be hurt or is this a petty issue I should just let go?*

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up. There's a lot I want to say but people seem to confuse reasons I give for her behavior with me trying to rationalize it. If I say the reason she did it was for attention, that doesn't mean that's okay. At all. It was a shitty thing to do, and the more comments I read (sorry for not replying to all of you but thank you for your time!) the more I know I have to talk to her.
The question was never whether or not to cut Sarah out of my life, I have had truly horrible friends in my life, so I know the difference between someone using me and someone just being shitty. When I said I've had to defend myself on previous occasions, it was all regarding her change since she got dumped. She's miserable and self-centered. The latter alone doesn't immediately make a bad friend, in combination with the former however it becomes toxic fast. I know that doesn't mean I have to put up with it all, I have enough problems as it is.

However, she has supported me through hard times in the past, and I am not the ugly girl that gets to be with the cool guys through her. She's no Regina George, as people have mentioned. She's an insecure but outgoing 20 year old that lives by the rules of Instagram and let's the attention get to her head. Do I approve of that? No. Does it affect my life? Not until this incident, and I will not have another one like it  follow. Thank you for your replies. I'll talk to her when I see her next.

"My parents [64 M&amp;F] and I [32 M] had a horrible argument about wedding planning and our overall relationship.


I'm a 32 male, grew up Catholic, currently living in Los Angeles, engaged to a wonderful Jewish woman.  My parents who live in Texas and are very conservative and very religious (Catholic) told me they expected a priest to officiate our wedding (rabbi would be okay too, but they wanted a priest as well).  

I didn't have an issue with this, and my fiancee and I even went on a three-day Catholic wedding retreat, but the wedding planning is looking very expensive and time consuming, and we want to get married ASAP before her terminally-ill father passes.  My fiancee and I thought it would be nice for just the two of us to fly to SF for to get married in a civil ceremony at the gorgeous San Francisco City Hall, and then come back to LA for a celebration dinner with close family and friends that we would pay for (her family is destitute).

I told my parents about the proposed idea last night and our reasons for thinking, and asking for their feedback (I'm trying to do the right thing).  But it all backfired in my face.  My mom lost it, and said I've turned my back on God and she doesn't understand how something so important could be without God.  My dad said he didn't think any of our family on the east coast would even come out for ""some dinner.""  I told my dad that's up to them, but my fiancee and I have twice made cross-country trips to visit my aunts/uncles on the east coast, yet they never have come out to visit.  I told my mom that I have a wonderful relationship with God (I really do and try to read the Bible every day).  I also said it's not so black and white, and that I am not turning my back on God by simply not having a priest at our wedding.

My mom said that her opinion doesn't matter to me and that I treat her like a stranger in my life.  I asked what more she wants - my brother in NYC and I just flew about 2 weeks ago for her bday, we text almost every day, chat on the phone every Sunday, etc.  Yes, there is physical distance (my brother in NYC, mom/dad in TX, me in LA) - but my dad moved us around every two years growing up for his job, and we were never physically close to their families after 1992.  My grandparents have always been across the country my parents....

She said arguments like this make her feel like we don't have a relationship.  I told her that candidly their reaction to our wedding idea was predictable - they are always disappointed with me and they let their agenda and belief in what constitutes ""a good son"" to get in the way of our relationship.  Their past disapproval of relatively stable career options that I was considering that they thought were too junior for me (higher ed, legal sales, etc.) - they did put me through law school- and their need to control various aspects of my life, and their constant arguing (with each other) have gotten in the way of our relationship.  I told them that they always ask for an ""adult"" relationship with me yet they continue to try to treat me like a child by getting fussy when I do something outside of their view of what I should do with my life.

They think my fiancee is a wonderful person, but they both had this look of disappointment when I told them I was thinking of proposing - that really hurt me.  Also when the cost of the wedding has come up, they got nasty and asked what her family was doing to help (my parents are loaded and go on cruises every 6 months, her parents live in squalor).  I told them there's very little they can do unfortunately to help.  My parents offered ""to help"" with wedding planning and got very dodgy about paying for it.  Since they don't seem eager to pay for it (and I'm not asking or expecting them to), it didn't make sense to my fiancee or me to spend most of our savings on a big ceremony that neither of us really care about.  We just want something small and simple...and quick!

After explaining these things to my parents, they told me that I'm a bullshitter and I twist things against them and point the finger at them.  They said that I never meant the nice things I have written in bday/xmas cards to them over the years.  And they kept emphasizing how there are so much worse parents out there and how lucky I am, I just don't know it.

I was really stunned by these things they said as they hurt but they were also a bit delusional and dramatic.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads.  I want to make everyone happy.  If they're willing to pay for a wedding that they want, and it doesn't make a difference to my fiancee and me, then I think we should just along with it.  But the bigger issue is some of the things they said...I'm not sure what this means for our relationship.  Am I wrong to expect some sort of apology from them?  Maybe I am just rotten...I've just always have tried to do the right thing.  Either way they seem extremely convicted of their beliefs about our relationship and I'm not really expecting an apology or them to reach out.  

I would appreciate anyone has to help sort things out.  While on the the one hand, I do care about who's right and who's wrong, but I also care about having a healthy relationship with them.

  **tl;dr**: I had a giant blow out with family last night regarding wedding planning, and then our relationship overall.  I don't think they realize how they have damaged our relationship by being controlling over the years.  They refuse to even entertain that notion, and they point the finger at me for the distance between us.  Where do we go from here?!"
