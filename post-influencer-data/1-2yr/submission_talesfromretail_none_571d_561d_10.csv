"No...I really can't accept that as payment...


So I was working for a retail store that sold food items when I was about twenty years old (This was about six years ago). This really old guy comes up and he has about $15 in items and hands me two rolls of quarters ($20). Our policy at the time was to take any rolled coins into the back office to weigh them for accuracy.

I explain this and the guy is LIVID, he demands his $5 and will not give up. My manager comes out and explains that it will only take a second. After a minute or two of him yelling he finally throws his hands up and agrees.

We take his two rolls of quarters back and place them on our money counting machine. This thing was just a tiny little machine that could count bills or weigh rolls of change, it was never wrong in my experience. We weigh the rolls of quarters and the machine seems....confused. It says error but we figure there must be a problem with the machine, we pop open the rolls of quarters to do a manual count.

That is when we see it. The items inside are the same shape as quarters but are actually plastic porn tokens. They were silver with the word ""PORN TOKEN"" engraved on them and an address where they can be redeemed.

He was gone before we exited the office. I guess he didn't want his porn tokens back. :c

**Edit** A Minute not A Minuet. He was pretty old and probably not a great dancer, Not that I will ever get to find out. "
"You switching the label doesn’t stop us from knowing the object’s actual price!


This happened back when I was working part time at a small chain party supply store. We had things from basic party supplies, themed/branded supplies, cheeky age maker party supplies, baby showers, weddings, sweet sixteens, costumes, all kinds of balloons and seasonal stuff.

I was working register with one other girl, while another employee straightened things up around the store. Our manager was in the back.

This woman comes up to the register with a basket. I’m finishing up with another customer but I remember her looking a bit impatient as she walked up to my coworkers counter. My coworker is scanning things as my customer leaves and I turn around to sort out balloon orders (we got a lot of orders for party balloons days in advance). Suddenly I hear the customer speak in this really shrewd, pitchy voice.

“That price isn’t right!” 

I turn around and my coworker has paused, looking at a medium sized stuffed Mickey Mouse toy that’s part of our Mickey Mouse themed birthday set (don’t ask me why stuffed animals were part of the themes I don’t know). I sort of watch from behind her as she looks back and forth a few times.

“The computer is telling me this is the correct price ma’am.” 

“Well it’s not. The price on the shelf said it was $0.20!”

Now that’s an immediate red flag because there is no way something as substantial as a stuffed animal in that store is that cheap. Cheap in quality yes but it was part of a brand set and not a plastic trinket. Me and my coworker both have no clue what she is on about. 

“That doesn’t sound right. I’m sorry but the actual price of this is $12.59.”

“It’s label on the shelf says $0.20! That is misleading and unfair to customers- why is it so expensive anyways?!”

My poor coworker is a bit meeker now. “I’m so sorry for the confusion ma’am. This is actually $12.59. Would you like me to remove it?” 

The woman is still talking very snippy and stern, like my coworker is an idiot, but a bit more aggressively now. “No! I should only have to pay $0.20 because you are the ones whose machine is broken! Go look at the tag if you don’t believe me, and let me speak to your manager!” My coworker is a little speechless at this point and I’m just glad that nobody else was up at the counter because I felt like I had to pay attention to backup my coworker, with how much aggression this lady was giving off.

Anyways, my coworker turns to me and asks me to go check the tags on the shelf while she calls up our manager and I go to do just that. Customer is looking a bit smug now. I walk down the aisle to he Mickey Mouse area and look at the tags and oh ho ho, guess what.

This woman switched the tags.

Under the area of the shelf where the stuffed mickeys are stocked is a crooked, partially torn, not totally sticking white label reading $0.20. It’s not for the stuffed toys. It’s for the tiny plastic frisbee trinkets that you’d put in a gift bag. The tag for the actual stuffed animals isn’t under the frisbees, seems like she just held onto it.

I walk back up front where my manager is behind the counter with my coworker while this thief berates the store and my coworker and my manager tries to placate her. I interrupt with a polite excuse me and ask my manager to come look at the display with me, and when I bring him over there he actually takes a few seconds sighing into his hands when I explain what’s happened.

We get back up there and bless the man he tells the woman that the price of the item is $12.59, and that changing the label under the product won’t change that. She goes so red and her face gets really stiff. Before she shoves the basket and things onto the counter forward and says “Fine. If you don’t want a good customer’s money, I’ll go!” Like yeah, we are really going to have a hard time holding onto the $12 you’re trying to steal.

She struts out. The audacity of some people amazes me honestly. To this day I still can’t believe she honestly thought that would work.
