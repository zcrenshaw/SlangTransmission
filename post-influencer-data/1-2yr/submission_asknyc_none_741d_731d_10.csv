"Not a question just a Thank You


I returned from my trip to New York last week so I've had some time to reflect on my trip. Firstly I'd like to say a huge thank you to the people of this Sub and other related NYC subs.


I thoroughly enjoyed my trip and wish I could stay for longer.


My first fear was the airport, being an Asian Muslim donning a beard (albeit a British national) I felt a little intimidated based on stories I hear and to add to that I was landing at EWR (Newark) which doesn't have the greatest of reputations. I must admit the people at the airport were charming, I was in and out in a flash. The guy at immigration was such a nice bloke who wished me well on my visit.

On return to England the first question the vast majority of people asked me was how was the airports and honestly it was crazy to see the shock on their faces when I told them it was so easy and hassle free. I had this preconceived idea that I'll be treated like a second class citizen but I'm glad that fear was quickly rubbished.


Quite honestly I don't think I came across any rude or unwilling to help people and for that im hugely thankful.



I guess my favourate bit of the trip was walking around and stumbling acorss things. The most surprising would probably be how peaceful soccer matches are. I went to go watch NYCFC vs New England and hadly saw a cop or steward, it felt like a family friendly atmosphere unlike England where majority of the chants include profanity.



I wish someone told me how big the MET museum was... My god it was big I don't think I got the time to appreciate everything in there but it was great to see history from around the world.



I guess I want to say thanks for all the tips and advice on this sub but also putting up with us tourists.. I work in central london and we have a shit tonne of tourists so I know what its like to be the local.

Thank you,

A very happy Brit!"
"For non-native New Yorkers, especially those in the city less than two years, what do/did you do to overcome the 'I miss my friends/tribe to hang out with on a random Wednesday"" pangs, besides drinking alone in your apartment?


Absolutely serious inquiry. It hit me today I have yet to formulate an NYC tribe, not for lack of trying though. Sometimes you want a cool drinking/film forum/walking/museum buddy - no more, no less.  And while I make a mean pitcher of margaritas, drinking alone isn't always fun. I guess my TL;DR (hope that's correct, still figuring out Reddit) is - how does one make authentic adult NYC 'play dates' when over 35?"
"Last day working in NYC and want an iconic Brooklyn Italian treat for lunch. Should I get Defontes or Lionis for a sandwich?


Distance isn't an issue, I just want an Italian sandwich that will make me trip balls on flavor. 


Update: Got lionis, I'm actually about to cry. This is like the greatest sandwich I've ever had. It's almost sexual, no it is sexual. Like it almost massages my insides with joy. Fuck. "
