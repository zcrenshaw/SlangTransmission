"I am a male survivor of physical and emotional domestic abuse at the hands of a female. I want to share my story, AMA.


Let's start at the beginning. 

I'm from Canada, I live in a small town near the Québec-Ontario border.

This story starts with a relationship that started early in January 2007 and ended in June 2011, I was 21 when it began. She had a daughter before we met, we bonded immediately. I considered her my daughter fairly early in the relationship, she accidentally called me dad a few times. Those were great times. Life was good, and getting better.

Like most stories, this one started off on a good note. That being said, things always have a way of going bad when you’re not looking. I guess this is the part where I spill the proverbial beans. 

I am a male victim of physical and emotional abuse perpetrated by a female. This whole thing started over 10 years ago.

The abuse started gradually over the first year of the relationship. There's so much I wish I could remember, but due to this happening over a literal decade ago there's only so much I retained, and there’s so much I suppressed from memory. What I do remember causes a lot of anger and sadness. The memories also invoke a lot of anxiety, panic and pain, and I think it’s high time that I get it all out.

I've been punched, beaten, and scratched more times than I can count. I’ve been stricken with objects, and have had stuff thrown at me. The bruises and scratches healed but the memory of it still remains. If I had to choose which of the two types of abuse was worse, the physical or emotional, the emotional was by far worse.

If you want to know how to cut a person down to the point to where they have so little self-esteem and self-worth left that they start to believe it, let me tell you how. I've been belittled so many times I've lost count. I've been told that I was useless, pathetic, that I'd never amount to much, and she was the best that I'd ever have. This really wears you down after hearing it month after month after month. 

All the mental and emotional abuse got to the point to where I thought so little of myself that I ended up needing to stay in the hospital because of my mental state. This happened more than once. I wasn't allowed to have female friends, I wasn't even allowed to talk to my female cousins. 

I was even isolated from my male friends, I was never allowed to have them over to hang out. Staying at a friend’s place was out of the question; what if other women were there? Slowly but surely my friends abandoned me. Who could blame them? 

I was always accused of having adulterous affairs with other people, didn’t matter who it was. Cousins, friends, acquaintances, didn’t matter. Everyone I knew was fair game and grounds for accusation.

I remember trying to leave that train wreck of a relationship but she would always manipulate me into staying, saying that she’d kill herself if I left. She’d threaten to slice her arms up with knives, or take unknown amounts of random pills. What choice did I have? I had no choice but to stay. The emotional blackmail was too much.

I remember having glass bottles thrown at me when I arrived home late one day after visiting a friend. Flying bottles happened on more than one occasion. One of my brothers can attest to this, he was present when one of those times happened and heard everything. 

I remember getting beaten with a metal broom handle only to have it bend. Let me tell you about bent broom handles, they’re razor sharp. It literally cut a 3 inch gash in my right arm. When getting stitched up, I lied and said I got caught on a barbed wire fence while trying to jump it. The physical proof of that wound is permanently etched into my right forearm, look for it the next time you see me.

I remember putting my hand up with an open palm one time to get her to stop assaulting me, she did. Later, her dad told me if I ever put a hand on her I’d be in trouble, top put it lightly. That’s right, she told her dad that I was about to hit her, omitting that she was the one assaulting me in the first place. I learned that day that I couldn’t even defend myself against an onslaught. 

My own mother saw the bruises I suffered, most notable was my face. She asked how they happened, sure, but I was already so beaten down at this point that I said “I walked into an open door when I was tired.” I ask you, would you have believed it? She did nothing. 

I had no support system. I had nowhere and no one to go to. Do you know how many shelters there are for men? Here’s a hint, none. I had to suck it up because I guess that’s what guys are supposed to do. One time, a neighbour overheard a fight and called the police. Let me tell you what happened. When they arrived they essentially told me that if they had to come back again they’d have to take one of us in, and it wouldn’t be her. Why? Because she had red markings on her arms from when I tried to stop her from hitting me. I can’t even begin to describe the immense isolation and helplessness I felt.

When my firstborn child was on the way, I remember her telling me that she'd abort the baby if she didn't get her way. I remember her punching herself in the stomach while several months pregnant to force me into conceding in an argument. She would intentionally throw herself down a small flight of stairs to force me to stay after I needed to a walk to cool down after an argument. I remember her saying that the baby would call someone else daddy, and that I’d only get a photo of him once a year.

The step-daughter I loved more than anything was ripped away from me to live with her dad hours away. I protested but at the end of everything all I was told was she wasn’t my child so I had no say in the matter. I would rarely see her, then, after a while, not at all.

When my best friend Brad died in August 2010, suicide, I wasn’t allowed to grieve. When I showed any bit of emotion I was ridiculed, or accused of having more than just a friendship relationship with him. I still haven’t processed it, it weighs heavily on me. Fly safe Sled. o/

The relationship eventually ended when she punched me in the nose in front of our son when he was 9 months old, in June 2011. Why was I assaulted? Because I let her sleep after getting home from work after she had been taking care of our child all day. I wish I was joking. That punch caused a bleed that ran down my face and stained my shirt. I remember looking at him in his crib and decided he deserved more than that. I told my mom what happened. 

She tried to flee with my son all while dangling him dangerously over the front deck, a 10 foot drop at least. I remember mosquitoes were out in full force that night. The police were called and she was allowed to leave with him, despite how much of a danger she was to him.

I eventually got my son back, and she explicitly said that she wanted nothing to do with him. She moved to Arizona soon after. To think that some people still support her after all of this makes me nauseous.

Through the years of abuse, I never laid a finger on her. Part of me thinks that maybe I should have.

The whole experience has left me, well, broken. I have next to no friends, still no real support system, and what seems to be signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Depression set in and it never left. It’s been there so long that it’s become part of me. Anxiety comes and goes, it’s been a constant companion. Countless medications did nothing. Therapy did nothing. I’ve come to terms with being broken. I don’t know if I can feel love anymore. I don’t know if I even want to feel love anymore.

For those of you who don’t know what depression feels like, let me fill you in. A lot of people think depression is just a state of sadness. Just smile and you’ll feel better right? That’s not what depression is.

Depression feels like you’re constantly drowning, like you’re just trying to get one deep breath of air and as soon as you get it – it’s gone. It’s alternating between being stuck in the past and worrying about the future, there is no present. It’s like trying to go for a walk but you’re always knee deep in water going against you. Any motivation to wake up in the morning is near non-existent, sometimes you wish you don’t wake up at all. It’s being trapped in a mind that will rarely feel happiness and when you finally do feel happy it doesn’t feel right and disappears moments later. I got used to it, and learned to accept it’s who I am now.

I lost myself years ago. I’ve never been unable to cry since. I’ve developed a cold outlook on life, I’ve become more cynical. I don’t trust people as much as I used to, maybe rightfully so.

I don’t live for myself anymore, I died a long time ago, in 2011.

Today I live for my son, that’s good enough for me. 

In most stories there are happy endings. The good guys win, the bad guys lose, and everything goes back to the way it should be. This is not one of those stories. I will never be the same again. 

If you’ve made it this far, I applaud you, thank you, and leave you with a single question.

How do you tell your child that monsters are real?

Be brutal. AMA.

TR;DR: Abuse sucks and happens to men more than you think it does. Talk about it.


Edit: I'm going to update this post around 9pm EST tonight with more information. I will keep answering questions until midnight EST tonight.

Edit 2: Started out writing more information, ended up with a wall of text. Sorry for the length, grammar probably bad.

"I'm an emergency response unit aid worker, AMA!


I'm member of an Red Cross emergency responde unit (ERU) which supports local Red Cross organisations after disasters that they can't handle themselfs. Normaly floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurrikanes, and so on.

The field I'm specialised in is water &amp; sanitation. This means we can provide

* clean drinking water  (we have modular units that cran provide individual families up do modules that cann provide water for up to 40.000 peoples a day)
* sanitation (washing facilities, toiles, showers)
* waste management
* hygiene promotion (teaching how to stay healthy by washing your hands and so on)
* vector control (after floods moskitios, that can transfer malaria, or rats can become a big problem)

Other units we have, but that I only can answer basic questions are:

* IT and Telecom
* Logistics
* Basic health care
* Field Hospitals
* Relief

The Unit I work with is specialised on disaster relief. Meaning we are responding after disasters up to six month. After that the work is basically the same but is thought of ""normal"" development aid.

Note: I'm bit busy at the moment but I will answer every question.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold"
"Ask a starving venezuelan whatever you want!


My fridge is absolutely empty except for a piece of old arepa and some harina pan. Ask a venezuelan whatever you want, i'll probably die killed by hunger or someone that wants to steal me.
Anyone that wants to know something about this place?"
