"How I made more than minimum wage in two minutes


$Me
$Grandma: Sweet old lady, not too tech savvy, know how to watch the TV channels she likes, but that’s about it.

Her TV just recently had the power supply fail and it got swapped by a local tech shop.

We just got to $Grandma’s place to drop off some groceries and my mom went into the house while I stayed in the car. After some time ~~browsing Reddit~~ doing important work she told me that something was again wrong with the TV.

&gt;$Grandma: I Hope it’s not broken again. It was just fixed! Did they do it right?

&gt;$Me:I’ll just take a look.


I go into the living room. I see nothing wrong with it. I take the remote to turn it on and the power LED starts blinking. I think: “Hmm, maybe this is an error code or something? No, it’s regular.” I then put the remote down to unplug the TV, since the screen was on, but just showing a black image. When I put it down, the blinking stopped.
Weird, huh? I checked the buttons on the remote, from top to bottom

“Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, and then... the 1 button is stuck”

So, I un-stick it... aaaaaaand (It’s gone... No) it still shows a black screen. The blinking stopped, though. And the power buttons wouldn’t do anything. I unplugged and plugged it back in and boom it came back on. 

&gt;$Me: $Grandma, it’s fixed! The 1-button was stuck. 

&gt;$Grandma: Really? That’s great! Sooo, what’s your rate for one hour?

&gt;$Me: Are you serious? There are 58 minutes left! Come on, mom, let’s go. 


So in the end she more or less forced me to take the ten bucks. Great, I suppose. "
