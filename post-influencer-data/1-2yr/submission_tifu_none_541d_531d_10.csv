"TIFU by eating a $6,300 piece of Dove chocolate


Two weeks ago, I was accepted into a research study for healthy individuals to monitor the affects of a drug on their system and how long it lasts in the body.  I prepared for weeks, making sure I followed all the rules in advance.  It required 6 stays of 4 days onsite, and the restrictions were pretty lengthy - but it paid $6,300.
In the restrictions, it stated to avoid excessive amounts of a specific chemical found in chocolate and coffee, within 48 hours of the first dose.

My first dose was on a Tuesday, and Sunday morning, on my flight home from a work conference, I had a single piece of dove chocolate at 10am Central Time.  Not excessive, right?  Wrong.
Apparently they meant - No chocolate or coffee.

As I was sitting in the research center, getting ready to settle in for a few days, they asked the question about chocolate.  I told them the truth.  The assistant left to check with the director, and came back saying it was 47hrs from the time of my dose, so I was disqualified.  I gaped at him, and said ""wait! That was 10am CT, we are in Mountain Time, so it's actually 48 hours!""  He left to tell his director, and they both came back.  I was still disqualified.  Apparently, the last dose was possible at 8:55am.  I missed the cutoff by 5 minutes.  They wouldn't budge, and I was sent packing.

$6,300.... gone. Like that.  It still hurts.  Enough so, that it has taken me two weeks to write this.
At least it was Dove, and tasted good.  And the funny part? The inside of the wrapper said ""You can do anything, but you can't do everything."" - Shirley K Maryland

Edit: As I keep getting asked: This one was http://prastudies.com But search your area for paid studies, as they only have 4 locations

Edit 2 for clarification answers: 

Sorry, I walked away for a couple of hours and this blew up. I'm trying to answer what I can.  But the common themes:

1) I'm a woman.

2) I know, I could have lied... but I kind of have a thing about lying.  Also, I actually thought I was in the clear.  I figured the test drug was going to be a night time pill, not a first thing in the morning pill. Not to mention, excessive to me isn't a small bite of chocolate.

3) I don't work for Dove, or the study group.  This is truly just me screwing up.  And yes - I own my mistake.  I'm a project manager

4) I won't be taking legal action because I truly don't believe there is any to be had.  I ate the chocolate. That's on me.  Just because I don't agree with the language to which I was told to avoid it, doesn't mean I didn't still make the mistake.

Also, they were very clear about how compensation works, and I didn't reach the point of compensation.  Also - $6,300..although a lot of quick cash, is not a lot for litigation. No point.  I'd lose more than I'd gain. This way I'm also able to continue applying for other studies going forward.  They have new ones every week.

5) This is not about eating Dove soap. Which would have been really funny I think.

TL;DR - I ate a piece of Dove chocolate 5 minutes too late, and it cost me $6,300 because it was a restricted food in a research study I had joined.

"TIFU by teaching my kid that not eating veggies turns white people black.


This happened a while ago, when my daughter was about 4. She wouldn't finish her dinner, particularly her veggies, so I thought I'd pull out the old ""starving kids in Africa"" routine to make her feel guilty about wasting food. Living in a technologically advanced age as we do, I was able to illustrate my lecture with some photos of malnourished African children on my phone. She seemed to get the idea, finished her dinner, and left me satisfied with my parenting skills.

Months later, we were out at the shops, and my daughter casually remarked about a couple of black people in line in front of us: ""They didn't eat their dinner."" ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""Your skin turns black if you don't eat your veggies,"" she replied confidently as if this was a mundane fact of life. We are white.

I had a lot of un-teaching to do when we got home.

TL;DR: Accidentally taught my daughter that skin colour is determined by vegetable intake."
"TIFU by letting my friends slap my butt


This actually happened in 2015. It was summer and my best friend was in town, which meant lounging in the pool the entire day and drinking. We got really drunk and decided on playing a game called ""tap√£o"" (in english it means something like ""big slap""). The game basically consists in drawing a bunch of cards while counting 1, 2, 3 etc. until the card matches the number - that's when you slap the cards as fast and strong as you can so you won't be the last one.

So. I have a big butt. And my friends love endorsing that fact. My best friend, then, had an amazing idea: play the game on my butt.

I'm super drunk, so why not? My butt is great. I lay belly down on the floor and they proceed to play it on my butt. When the slaps begin, though, I feel EXCRUCIATING pain. Nothing like a normal hit on the asscheeks. It feels like there's something raw in between them, like they're slapping over open flesh. I cry out loud every time they hit me, but don't protest against it since everyone is having fun with my suffering.
It finishes, other friend offers her butt and life goes on.

But the pain never stops. If something, it increases. The next day I can't sleep because I'm in so much pain, can't sit down, can't do anything but cry and lie on the bed. They take me to the hospital.

It's a fucking pilonidal cyst. My friends ""activated"" the inflammation by slapping me on the butt with the strength of an angry gorilla several times. I proceed to spend the next fifteen days waiting for the abscess to get big enough so the doctor can squeeze it out. Worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life.

TLDR; I let my friends slap my butt so we could have a good laugh, the impact caused soreness on a pilonidal cyst near my ass and I had to go through excruciating pain in order to get it out. Never. Again."
"TIFU by trying to look up the movie 'Moonlight' and inadvertently exposing my entire family (including kids) to gay black porn.


** This is a repost but update because since then it's gotten much worse ** This happened a few weeks ago during a very rare family get together; we were talking and discussing small topics like the oscars in the living room in front of the large TV while the kids ran around and played.

I have my laptop hooked up to the TV so we can look up anything like videos or trivia facts and questions and my aunt had mentioned the oscar winning film ""Shape of Water"" that had garnered much praise in 2018; which had me thinking...last years oscar winning film was 'Moonlight' an incredible film about a young man struggling to grow up with a dark secret (he's gay).

However, for whatever reason I absolutely could NOT come up with the name of the film and I knew I had watched it but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get the name out. At this point I look like an idiot trying to explain to them about last years movie and my whole families staring at me so I said all right screw it; my trusty friend Google will help me out.

So without thinking of the imminent consequences and without thinking to just type in '2017 oscar winner' I typed in the search bar ""Movie about two gay black boys 2017"" and, honestly at that point my internet speed could not have been any faster, tons of images of porn sites, men on men, ebony, large black **** filling the screen and the kids stopped dead in the their tracks and my sister screamed. My aunt was laughing her skirt off and I turned beet red. We all kind of laughed and brushed it off until just recently my sister calls me up saying thanks to me now she has to explain sex to an 8 year old that she caught her looking up minecraft porn on her tablet; ruining her innocence.

TLDR: was trying to find the name of last years oscar winner 'Moonlight', couldn't think of the name so I googled my best description of it in front of my entire family on the large TV connected to my laptop, without much thought of consequence typed ""movie about two gay black boys 2017"" and intense men on men porn showed up. Sister calls me up weeks later explaining that now her 8yr old was caught looking up minecraft porn and I had ruined a young girls innocence. "
"TIFU by falling in actual love, nearly wrecking a marriage and a church


This is very recent and it's quite a story, but I promise you it's length is justified by my overwhelming need to get this out of me.

After working for two years at my dad's funeral home, doing all of the funeral home's charlie work, I decided that I needed to do some ""normal"" 22 year old guy work. Since I'm good with people, and wanted something much more lighthearted, a friend suggested that I just wait tables and bartend again at a well established bar and grill with him while I plan my next step.

I walked in and asked for an application. My family knows everybody in this little town, so everybody knows me. The owner asked me how I've been doing. We shot the breeze a while, and then he asked if I had met the new wait staff manager. I hadn't. He said she was wrapping potatoes in the back, and went to get her so we could be introduced.

Let me say real quick that I'm not a shy dude. And I don't normally have issues communicating with women. But I choked. I choked real bad. It wasn't necessarily that she was pretty. It wasn't that her personality felt golden. It was just that I simply loved everything she said, and did, and the way she did it. I'm not being dramatic. Maybe I'm not the only one that's experienced this feeling, but I swear she glowed. Here's the funny part. She was also suuuper awkward with me. We both stumbled over each other's words. It took us about four minutes of talking to finally act normal.

I started work the next day. She had my number and texted me saying she was very excited to work the bar with me. I knew that I was treading some very strange water for feeling the way I was feeling over someone I didn't even know, so I didn't text her back. It felt like something reasonable to do. Maybe I was busy.

The next day came and we both arrive at work at the same time. We had a wonderful time. We made a great team. We had the same horrible sense of humor. We were cerebral. We talked about our interest in music, and our favorite eras of history, pretty much everything except the shit that mattered. I decided to ask her, since she wasn't wearing a ring, if she wanted to go out with me sometime. She was sweeping and singing when I asked, and she kinda dropped her shoulders a little. Turns out she was married and had two kids. She lost her ring two days before. Her husband was the new pastor at some ""cool people under 50 that smoke but also love Jesus"" type church just outside of town. I hid my disappointment pretty well, said something like, ""That's okay, I'm just happy to work with you.""

That should have been it. But she invited me to come to their church to play for their praise and worship band. I did because I loved being with her. I buried my feelings as best as I could. So did she. Over the course of six whole months we were always around each other. Her husband became a very close friend of mine. When my house flooded a little during a hurricane, I stayed with them until it was fixed. In a moral sense we were very good, but as time went on, feelings started to bleed out. 

On Sundays at church she'd hug me a little longer than normal. I would text her late at night. She bought a new car and we went riding together in it after work. We started spending time in the church ""practicing songs"" when mostly all we'd do is talk. Talk about everything except what mattered.

One night at the church (I had my own key now), I was playing the piano. She comes in because she saw my car and said that we needed to talk.

Here it comes, I thought, and it did. She told me she loved me. She said she was feeling herself slipping further away from her husband. And that she hated me, and hated herself for not being strong enough to say no to being around me. It all hit me like a brick. I didn't think it was love. I guess I had been in denial. I told her that I'd rather not tell her how I really felt with all of the shit at stake. But she asked me if I loved her.

You know that trash compactor room in Star Wars: A New Hope? When it's squeezing everybody closer together? That's how the walls of that little church felt. I couldn't talk, so I walked over and held her. She's got tears in her eyes. I am in absolute shock that I was blind to everything. But I didn't feel guilty yet. No, I felt guilty after I fucked up and kissed her. It was the most happy, gut-wrenching, painful, soul-boiling kiss that ever needed to happen. Definitely nothing happened after that. Nothing.

Everything's better after that for about two weeks. We don't talk about it. We feel less heavy.

She told someone about it, but didn't tell her it was me. That person wasn't the best confidante, since they decided to tell the guy that first started that church. Of course she denied it happened. There's no visible proof. So there's no finger pointing at me yet. But it's likely to happen. 

TL;DR I fell in what could be actual love with a married pastor's wife, and now I'm just waiting for the real shit to hit the fan"
"TIFU by going on a Tinder date


The obligatory this actually happened last Friday. I met up with a guy from Tinder (we'll call him Tim) for a date. It was actually going pretty well, we had stuff in common and didn't seem as awkward as most dates. Drinks start flowing, I'm having a good time, and the night moves on. 

After we got to the 3rd bar he looks at his phone and says ""hey, my best friend (we'll call him Steve) is in the area, would you mind if he stopped by for a drink?"" I was having a good time and didn't care so told him to invite him over. 

We proceed to another bar where Steve is going to meet us. I then kick Tims ass at Street Fighter and am still having fun, oblivious to what's about to happen. 

In walks Steve and the world stops. I immediately recognize the guy. How you ask? Because a week prior I was talking with Steve on Tinder, we made tentative plans to meet. When the day came and he contacted me to confirm plans, I just wasn't feeling it. So I was a shitty asshole of a human and blew him off by not responding and just deleted him. Trust me, I know it was an awful thing to do and Karma chewed my ass right back...

So Steve walks up to us and it's awkward as fuck. Tim introduces us and instead of saying the usual ""hi"" he starts laughing and shaking his head. He says he needs a drink and walks off. I immediately tell Tim what happened and take credit for being a shit stain for doing that to Steve. Tim just awkwardly laughed and didn't say much. 

Steve returns, it continues to be weird as fuck (I deserve it). I try to cut the tension and just straight up apologized to Steve for being a douche bag. Tension got worse. Nobody was saying anything. I had to get out of that situation for a bit so I announce that I'm gonna use the ladies room. It's notoriously nasty in this joint so I leave my jacket behind. 

When I came back both Tim and Steve were gone, and they took my jacket with them. Thankfully bartender saw the whole thing so didn't charge me for their tab, I tipped him well to start being a decent human. 

TLDR: I blew off a tinder date, then a week later ran into him whilst on a date with his best friend. Got ditched and my jacket was stolen. 

Edited for further clarification: 1) To clarify for several people and the haters. I didn't stand Steve up or leave him waiting anywhere, we had nothing solidly planned and I just didn't respond when he messaged to make plans. I feel like I took the higher road and not only told Tim about it, but I straight up apologized to Steve as well. 2) I still highly doubt the whole thing was planned. Why would Tim spend several hours with me having what seemed to be a decent time, just to mess with me and ditch me? He honestly seemed like a good guy and up until the ditching and jacket incident. 

Update 1: I called Tim and he HASN'T blocked my number. I left a friendly enough voicemail so will update if he calls back. 

Update 2: Thanks for the gold!!! :) Was honestly not expecting this to blow up the way it has. All of these comments add to the hilarity of this whole story, even the shitty ones. You guys crack me up! Still no word from Tim though. "
"TIFU by spilling my urine all over an airport terminal.


This happened mere days ago.

I was flying home from an ultimate Frisbee tournament this weekend, and before my 6 am flight, I was really trying to rehydrate before the 4 hour flight. My seat is a window seat, and the two strangers to my right are both very asleep. Of course, halfway through the flight, nature aggressively calls and I try to ignore it, but I realize that I'm going to have to do something soon. I'm way too uncomfortable waking up TWO complete strangers to get up so I can go, but I'm about to piss my pants, so I decide that my old shitty water bottle can bite the bullet. After some adjusting and a well placed hoodie over my lap I do my business and fill THE ENTIRE 32 OZ BOTTLE. It was glorious. I screwed on the cap very tight, like as tight as possible. Bad move.

We are exiting the plane after we land and the entering the terminal, and I have the shitty piss filled bottle in my hand, ready to throw away. As I'm walking towards the trash can, I start fumbling my two bags, and I lose my grip on the bottle. It lands cap first onto the hard tile floor, and because the shitty thing was so tightly screwed on, it cracks, and 32 oz of MY FUCKING URINE goes all over the floor. The floor has no ridges at all either, so it just kept spreading. I just stood there for a second. Thank the Lord Almighty, a custodian was nearby, and started walkong over and saying ""No worries, happens to the best of us, I'll take care of it"" but I'm like ""I'm so terriblly sorry, but that's my urine. He gave me a really unfortunate look, and said ""Oh really? Ok. Well, that sucks. Ok."" I kept saying sorry, and he told me I could go. I didn't dare look at another soul and got the hell out of there. If you are reading this dude, I'm so sorry, I made your day immensely shiitier (or pissier), and you made be not literally die of embarrassment. You da real MVP

TLDR: Really had to pee on a long flight but didn't want to get up, peed an absurd amount into my water bottle, proceeded to drop it and spill urine all over the terminal floor aftering getting off the plane, the greatest custodian ever saves my ass and begrudgingly cleans it up"
"TIFU at a gas station in New Jersey


This just happened 15 mins ago. 

Some back ground I am from Texas and was visiting New Jersey.

So I pulled up to a gas station and started to grab the pump. Some guy comes out of no where and puts his hand on mine and says get back in the car. I freaked out and yelled ""get the fuck off me"". Had no idea where he came from so it rattled me. He said don't touch the gas pump I will do it for you. Now I thought this was some con job and while this guy pumps my gas another guy comes up behind me and robs me or something (yes I have been robbed before at a gas station). So I get really pissed and shove the guy and tell him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not fucking around get away from me‚Äù. He told me customers can't pump their own gas. Then it hit me I forgot most gas stations in New Jersey they pump your gas for you. I felt bad. Said I‚Äôm sorry and I got back in the car. When he gave me back my card I gave him a tip. He looked at me like ""wtf is this"" and just walked away. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to tip him or not but I felt bad for telling him to fuck off. 

TLDR: thought i was getting robbed at a gas station and just got in the way of some guy doing his job. "
"TIFU by being trapped at my University and making it into the local newspaper


This happened last week but I didn't plan on making a TIFU post until I read the local newspaper today. It's going to be long, let us begin shall we?

(Imagine that typewriter animation thingy they do in action thrillers)

*Time: Friday night 22:00*

*Location: My University*

I have been studying all week long for that huge accounting exam that I have this following Saturday and I'm really putting all my concentration and focus on those thousand different in and out accounts (kinda relevant for later, maybe an excuse for my stupidity? idk). So as I have a hard time concentrating at home and it was too late to catch a train to study on one of those I was at my uni solving older exams and noting down some important theory key points. The uni was slowly emptying and I started to see less and less people, no problem I mean it's Friday night and people usually head home or to some party at that time. Meanwhile I'm still in that classroom reading liabilities this accruals that and wrapping my head around left right account balances. At some point someone from the cleaning staff enters the room and starts emptying the trashcans and shutting down the projector. I was sitting all the way in the corner and the woman kinda gave me a signal that until she gets to my row I can finish whatever I am doing, I guess idk tbh. So she gets to my row asks me nicely that she needs to lock the room but that if I want I can head upstairs because they will do those rooms at the end and I might get some few minutes out of it. Soon after I am in some kind of studyroom (small room with one big table, kinda like a meeting room?) continuing my intensive studying (Yeah believe it or not Reddit on my phone had gotten very few attention that week).

A few minutes later a weird bell sound comes from the lil speaker in the room, not the usual ""class over"" bell but something similar (yeah everyone browsing¬†r/TIFU¬†is like, Ohhhh that's where it begins....). I don't care, again, depreciation this and inventory that, I am fairly sure I have turned into some kind of accounting software at that point. The same woman that told me to head upstairs before enters the room and tells me very nicely that she thinks that it is time to leave... I start packing my stuff and I head downstairs again (one of the exits is downstairs). Just before leaving the building I have the bright idea to check one last time if there isn't a room left for me to study bc. I'm quite sure that as soon as I enter my apartment I will straight drop dead on my bed, and I really need to study more. I remember this stairwell that is ""hidden"" (not really but it's not super obvious) behind a normal door that makes it look like there is a normal classroom behind it, but you can access more classrooms through that stairwell.
I press down the handle and (insert that Andy Dwyer GIF here, you know the¬†Oh shit waddup, yeees¬†thing). Great the stairwell hasn't been locked so I check some of the rooms that are connected to that stairwell and to my disappointment they are all locked. I go up the the stairs to check those rooms and closed too, ah shit well it was worth an attempt. A bit bummed I decide to finally go home in the end so I head downstairs again to the door where I came in. I press the handle down and.... locked (yeah if you hadn't figured out what was coming buddy I have bad news for you). No big deal it's a stairwell there is also an access to the main building where I was just before. Guess what, locked too‚Ä¶

*dramatic music starts playing*

*dolly zoom on the protagonists face*

*sweat starts running down the side of his face*

I forgot to note that our Uni was build in the architectural style of ""brutalism"" aka. concrete everything and make it look like a jail. So I am in that narrow stairwell locked between two floors in one of the side wings of the Uni. I figure out that while I was checking the other rooms someone saw that that one door wasn't locked and simply locked it. Friendly reminder it's like 23:00 Friday night and I got an exam tomorrow, adding to that my phone was slowly running out of battery (obviously, I mean yeah what did I expect).

Now I need to explain something that is key to the rest of the story but probably totally unknown to most of you. There is a popular App in the German speaking Uni community called¬†Jodel¬†which is basically a Reddit Light with geolocation. People can post short two sentence text posts or images directly taken (like not from your library) and everyone in the area can read it and uptoot it or downvote it. The whole thing is totally anonymous and it is basically¬†the¬†social media app of the Uni.

After a while I decide to post a picture of the stairwell and saying that I'm trapped at Uni, I comment my own post with a bunch of other pictures showing where I am. Now usually Jodel posts get around 5-10 uptoots and if you manage to post sth. creative you reach 60-80 uptoots. My post reached 150 uptoots in less than 20mins (yeah I was still locked in that stairwell). The whole thing literally blew up and every 5sec comments were posted asking how the fuck that happened and if they need to call the cops etc etc‚Ä¶

So I was reading the comments (battery slowing running out, like arriving at 3%) trying to find a useful advice. I'm going to keep it simpe, commenter Nr.5 shall become my salvation, he had commented since the beginning (that's why Nr.5) and had managed to provide me with the 24/7 emergency number of the Uni facilities. Battery is about to run out and idk if it's gonna last for the phone call I make a deal with him: if I don't comment that I made it out in exactly 1 hour, he shall call the cops to get me the fuck out of there.

*clock starts ticking, 59:59 until arrival of cops*

I manage to call the number and after being asked several times if I'm serious and if I'm not joking (remember it is Friday night, drunk students are the opposite of a rarity right now) I assure them that I'm very serious and that my battery is about to run out I need them asap. Guy on the phone audibly is pissed but well it's his job. He says he is on its way.
Now it's not too exciting I didn't jump out of the window because the building randomly started to burn and break my legs and Idk what the hell. Dude showed up, told me I am a retard and to get the fuck outta his sight now. Thanks I guess? But the stress wasn't over, my phone had died and I needed to comment that I am save before Nr.5 and the whole Jodel community calls the cops, which would have legals consequences for me if I wasn't there. I don't live that close to the Uni but I should make it in time. I get home make it in time, charge my phone, post that I am save 50min after the inital deal with Nr.5 and head to bed reading the hundreds of comments that were posted while I was without battery. End of the story right?

Not really, so today the uni magazine which is surprisingly good tbh and also read and distributed in the city is published. It is only published 4 times a year so it is a bigger thing and people are genuinely excited to read it. I pick one up and start just going through it, I get distracted and don't think about it anymore until someone shows me a whole page article thing about some idiot getting trapped at Uni last week and how the Jodel community saved him.

*fuck*

*itse meee, Mario Voice*

So everyone started speculating who they think it might be and if they know who it was and and and.... They started calling me a legend that should get his bachelor degree without examination (I wish) and also the biggest retard in this Uni and how the fuck I am able to function in everyday life (yeah I ask myself that too occasionally). Ofc the whole gossiping was ported to Jodel too where it is the top topic of the day already... meanwhile the original post I made is heading to break Jodel upvote records. My main goal right now is to keep my identity as secret as possible or I might get crowned King and then lynched like a french royal in the 18th century.

TL;DR Got trapped at Uni late at night, got the whole Uni App community cheering for my release and today the story got printed in the local news, which sparked a new wave of gossiping.

"TIFU by laughing in class, triggering a minor rebellion and the teacher to have a breakdown


This FU happened this morning. I don't think my first class (English Lit) had even been going on for a minute when the teacher accidentally typed her password into the login box, the screen being projected onto the board. Though she removed it quickly, the situation itself made me giggle.

The teacher was not amused.

I was made to stand outside the classroom, where I was yelled at in full view of students arriving at nearby classes and a couple of classes that were in progress. I don't remember much of this, but part of the onslaught involved the words ""You may just see me as a teacher, but inside I am a human too!""

I returned to the classroom, whilst the teacher briefly left with another to do something (unrelated to what had just happened as far as I am aware).

The whole class (only about eight people) were appalled with what they heard, and voiced their beliefs that the teacher picks on me way too much.

I do not actually agree with their viewpoint on this; I get why some of the things I do might annoy the teacher but I've never been in serious trouble with her before. I didn't feel like the shouting was necessary but I do completely understand why the teacher felt disrespected by what I did. In fact, I apologised profusely.

 Truth is, though the class doesn't explicitly know this, I'm on a certain spectrum and some of the things I do might be misunderstood/generally a bit annoying from the teacher's perspective. I think she can be stern, but overall I have a lot of respect for her. I think she is usually a very good teacher. Aside from that, I'm generally quiet and my work is usually considered the best in the class. It's my work *ethic* that the teacher mostly complains to me about.

Regardless of what I thought personally, my class began to voice their opinions on how *they* felt that the teacher had been a bit unjust to them in the past. 

Everyone shut up when the teacher returned to the room, and she sternly took a seat at her desk.

She said something along the lines of ""you've ruined this lesson already,"" which, to be honest, I'd expected her to say.

What nobody expected was probably the most unexpected person in the class to do what happened next. 

""Actually, Miss, I think *you've* ruined this lesson,"" said the voice from the back of the class. Let's call this student A. ""I really don't think Automaton120 deserved that.""

At this point a wave of something so bizarre just sweeps over the small class. Student A is usually quiet, unassuming and just gets on with things.

The teacher responded to A with, in the most condescending tone I've ever heard: ""really, A? I appreciate your opinion on this matter."" The teacher looked like she was going to turn into the Hulk; probably Red Hulk if we're going by the colour of her face at this point.

By now, the rest of the class is listening in absolute awe to student A but I am practically crapping myself. I can see this snowball rolling, growing...

""Actually, you know what?"" says student A, ""I don't think I really want to be in this class anymore.""

I could feel the cause-and-effect unfolding and I had no idea where it was going to lead. Nobody had expected this, for sure.

The last we heard was the sound of a chair moving, a bag being adjusted and student A closing the door behind her.

Nobody dared say anything. The teacher feigned calm, slowly dragged the mouse on her computer to ""shut down"". Quietly, she got up and wrote today's assignment on the board. And left. And didn't come back.

I actually got on with the assignment for once, all the while discussing whatever the hell transpired with the rest of the equally dumbfounded class.

About half an hour later, student A returned to the class. Evidently, she'd seen the teacher breaking down in the Head's office.

After a while, the Head came to our class and corroborated this. She told us that the teacher has been ""very poorly"" and ""ill"". 

The Head also said that nobody is in trouble with her personally, but the English teacher had already cancelled tomorrow's lesson for unrelated reasons. It'll be next Monday until we have her again, and the relationship between the class and our teacher is going to be very strained indeed.

To be perfectly honest, the teacher really isn't as bad as the other students allege and she has been known to, uh, get a bit emotional in the past. I blame myself for triggering this whole charade today, and even though I don't believe I deserved the whole shouting-at either I now understand that the teacher could potentially be going through something horrific and did not deserve to feel the way she ended up, either. 

TL;DR laughed at the teacher's misfortune, classmates believed I was unjustly punished and one of them walked out over it. Teacher (who I actually have a lot of respect for) left and had an emotional breakdown.

EDIT: No, I will not tell you what the password was."
