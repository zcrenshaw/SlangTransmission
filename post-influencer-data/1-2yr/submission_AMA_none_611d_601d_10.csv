"I'm a 20 years old guy with a Micropenis - Ask Me Anything (+18?)


So, yeah. I figured I never really talked to people about this, so I thought I could help someone or just feed your curiosity ;)
I am very, very small down there, you can ask me absolutely anything, I don't really mind even if you make fun. The goal here is to help people and entertain you guys. BTW, if this post is forbidden for some reason, I'm very sorry."
"I was raised by two parents who believe the earth is flat, only take Alex Jones supplements, and think vaccines are poison, AMA!


   I’m a 16 y/o F in college, still living with my parents. Title kind of says it all. They believe in almost any conspiracy you can think of, especially the flat earth theory. This is kind of niche but people might be curious? Idk! (: "
"I have stage IV cancer and am 32 years old. AMA


Hi there! This is my first post, so forgive me if I am doing this incorrectly. Here’s a bit of backstory so we can avoid the logistical questions: 

At 29 years old (a month before my 30th birthday in June 2015) I was diagnosed with stage IIIB cervical cancer, meaning it had started at my cervix, but spread throughout my uterus, my left Fallopian tube and ovary, and my lymph nodes. My paternal grandmother died from cervical cancer, and both of my paternal aunts had precancerous fibroid tumors and hysterectomies before they turned 40. I have been vaccinated against and have never had HPV, and it had been less than 2 years since my last PAP. I had never had an abnormal PAP. I underwent chemo therapy and internal and external radiation for about 6 months. In February 2016 I was NEC (no evidence of cancer). 

In May 2017 I had a routine PET scan where they discovered my cancer had returned and spread to my abdominal lymph nodes and small intestine. I had surgery and another 4 months of chemo and radiation. I am done with my 2nd round of treatment and am awaiting my next PET scan (next month) to tell me if I need more treatment or if I’m ok for now. 

After my initial diagnosis and treatment, I had a 5 year survival rate of 26%. After this recurrence, my 5 year survival rate is less than 5%. While I am not for sure “dying”, it is more likely than not I will not survive the next 5 years. 

Feel free to ask my anything at all. I am not easily offended, and I’m sure you guys are curious. I would be. Ever single part of my life has been affected by this disease and I’m eager to tell my story. "
"I didn’t finish college and now I work at Google as a designer. AMA!


Hey guys just wanted to reach out to those who were wondering if it was possible to get a job at a reputed company without a college degree. It was a rough path but if a dummy like me can make it anyone can!"
