"(AMA Request) Any Redditor that proclaimed they would leave America if Trump became president, and then actually went through with it.


I remember during the election, so many people were publicly stating they would leave the country if Trump were to be elected. Are you one of the people that actually went through with it? If so..

Why? Where did you go? Why did you choose the place you did? How is it going? Do you regret your decision? Plan on coming back?"

"I'm running for U.S. Representative of Louisiana District 3 as 'No Party' in 2018 - AMA


I haven't officially registered with the Office of Registrars yet, because I want to go about it the 'old-fashioned' way by collecting 1,000 endorsement signatures, instead of just paying the $600 fee to ""buy"" my way in to a candidacy (which I feel is incredibly wrong). But campaign preparations are well under-way.

Edit: My name's Dave Langlinais. Lifelong resident of Broussard Louisiana. Eagle Scout, served 9 years in the Army National Guard, including a tour in Iraq, and three domestic deployments. Two bachelor's degrees from ULL, one class away from a third. Own my own small business. Have a legitimate platform to run on, with twelve fleshed-out planks.

"I'm currently having a psychotic episode, AMA


I have been diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia (a year ago) and dissociative disorder (two years ago). Personally, I think the last one is invalid now since I do not suffer from the symptoms (or at least as much) that I used to have.

Currently, I am feeling extreme paranoia, a lot of shame, suicidal thoughts and generally unwell around my body. I expect auditory hallucinations soon. Don't worry, this is a walk in the park compared to my worst psychotic episode. Suicidal thoughts don't really mean anything to me either.

I do not take medications. Yes, I am ""safe"" and if it gets worse, I have someone I can contact. 

Doing this, because I want to be very open about my illness. Schizophrenia is very stigmatized, and doing things like this can help to remove some of the awful stigmatizations. I can provide proof of diagnosis, but that will takes couple of days. "
