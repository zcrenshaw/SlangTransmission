"emergency - update.


I just wanted to make a post to say  a big thank you to everyone who commented and  sent me messages. I didn't see any negative comments but apparently there were some but it doesn't matter because all I was thinking of while waiting to be seen at the hospital was that there are such good people in this world and that's all I'm feeling now, which is really very comforting as I've always felt a little lonely in NYC.

I went to the hospital and was told Urgent Care would be much cheaper. By the time I got there it was closed so I just got a hotel room and stayed there for the night. I made it to Urgent Care the next day before my flight home. So I'm fixed and safe.

Genuinely, hand on heart, never saw this coming in 3.5 years. The guy never hurt a fly and never even raised his voice at me. I have to go back to NY due to visa situation (conditional ATM). He is due to come with  me to my country for a couple of months for work anyway. I've suggested therapy and living apart but honestly I don't know.

Just wanted to add: I only had my laptop and could not find my phone. Skype was being a B as I had not used it in years and it wanted a whole bunch of verification I did not have. So that;s why I posted here, which in hindsight was probably silly but my mind was just wrecked that night.

Thank you again for all the help and kindness shown to me, it is something I'll always remember."
"For those of you that blast music on the train loudly, why? Don't you ever feel embarassed?


Was on the train at 4:40 am for work and couldn't get my 40 minute nap in because of this guy loudly blasting reggaeton. Pretty sure all of us wanted to kill that guy, and then I felt second hand embarrassment for him. How could he not feel any kind of awareness?? Someone explain!!"
"Emergency.


I’m on UWS. WHAT do I do if my bf is being aggressive and has already thrown me and tried to choke me? I can’t call police. No phone. "
