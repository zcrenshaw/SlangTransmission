"18 y/o moving to NY from Idaho update


Hey /r/asknyc 
Last year I posted [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/52t0jq/advice_for_an_18_yo_moving_to_ny/ ) to the sub asking for advice for moving as an 18 y/o who'd never been to ny on moving here. Well today marks exactly 1 year that I've lived here! 
/u/convergecult15 Gave me some good advice but said 65% chance I fail and move within a year... so thought I'd share that it's been a success! The hardest part is emotionally and the loneliness of it but after a year here I'm finally making friends and making career progress! Thanks for anyone who gave advice! (and if anyone out there is in a similar situation that I was in message me and I'll offer any advice I can) Here's to another year!"
"How to live off the street (student going homeless)




I have 200 to my name and I'm about to get kicked out tomorrow. NYC how do you live on the street effectively. This isn't a joke. I have interviews set up so I'm planning on getting a room within the month. While I wait for that I'm putting my stuff in a local storage unit. I have lots of used clothes I want to sell for some cash but I don't know where. I'm also gonna be at the Assistive Housing Office Harlem today. I'm looking for any pointers or tips on how to survive while I get enough money to get a room. I don't have friends who will let me crash so I'm embracing my future. Help me Reddit. 

Signed, a homeless student in need "
