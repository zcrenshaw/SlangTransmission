"A quick thank you to /r/AskNYC


I realize this might not follow the rules per se, but I feel pretty strongly that it deserves a standalone post (at least to get some eyes on it before it gets removed -- sorry mods, please don't ban me, just wanted to show some love)

Thank you to this community. I've been posting here for years over a number of accounts. I posted when visiting many years ago, I posted when living here for an internship, and I still post now that I live here permanently. 

This community has been like having local friends who can tell me the ins and outs of NYC. Because of you guys I've had great dates, impressed coworkers, learned some do's and don't's of living here, and otherwise explored the city in ways I wouldn't have otherwise been able to.

Seriously - thank you. It's pretty selfless to just post here giving tips, and so appreciated by so many. Much love."
"Which NYC stereotypes actually apply to you?


Light morning topic, we know about New Yorker stereotypes.  
*We're mean. We're rude. We're walkin' here.* 

Most of the time, stereotypes are an exaggeration but there are a few that are 99% spot on.

What are some that apply to you or your friends? 

If you're not a native, describe the time you realized you had fallen into a cliche. "
"As hard as this is, would any cat lover out there be interested in adopting my 7 year old tabby cat?


I really hate making this post, but I've exhausted my immediate circle of friends and family. My adorable companion over the past 7 years now needs a new home. I've been given an opportunity to move to and live in Colombia with a lot of constant travel, and it's just not feasible for me to continue to care for her. 


**About Mishka the Cat**

Nearly 7 years ago, I took in a kitten off the streets of Miami while I was living there. I was reading some Russian things at the time and eventually landed on the name of Mishka, meaning little bear. She was a kitten of only a few weeks when I found her. In this time, she has rarely left my side or the rooms I have occupied. Very early on, she was spayed and received all her shots. She regularly goes to the vet for checkups and is considered to be as healthy as can be.

Mishka can be very sweet. She likes to cuddle between your legs in the winter when it's cold and will often find her way sitting on the chests of people she has become comfortable with. She loves to nestle her head in your neck and lick your cheek if she wants scratches. She generally sleeps most of the day, with some moments of playful bursts of energy. She loves balls, string, laser points, cat nip, and the more of the usual things. 

She is incredibly self-sufficient. Even if you live alone and need to travel for 2-3 days, she does very well by herself. You can leave out a massive bowl of food and she will only eat as she's hungry, never gorging. 

Admittedly, she is also not perfect! She is very much a cat and any cat person will understand this. She can be territorial. If she doesn't know you, there's a likelihood she will hiss and claw, but only if you directly invade her space. She can take a little bit to adjust to new people, but give her a few days and she will acclimate. She does have her nails and likes to scratch, like most cats do. 

**Who you should be**

I am looking for someone who might be a cat person and understands what this means. Mishka is very lovable, but that does not always happen immediately. I have been her one and only owner, and she may take a little bit adjusting to a new person and space. Ideally, you would want a cat, but do not already own a pet yourself. Mishka has shared time with other cats and dogs, but she does best on her own.

Most importantly, you are looking for commitment. There's a good chance Mishka has at least another 7 years left, if not plenty more. I'd love for her to go to a home where she can be cared for with the idea in mind that this is a full adoption and not a temporary phase. 


**A little more about me and my situation**

I've been living in NYC for 5 years, but recently received an offer to live and travel South America that I cannot pass up. I would not be giving up Mishka otherwise. We have an incredible bond and it's hard to write this. I can only hope that she will form this with another person. I don't plan on leaving NYC until the end of May/middle of June, so there is some time. I've first tried most of my friends and family, but pretty much everyone in my life already has cats/pets. I currently live in Bushwick and will be happy to provide a litter tray, litter, food, cat mat, and everything you'd need to get started.
