"How to meet friends in NYC


Hi everyone. I am fairly new to the city. Been here for about 5 months, and Im finding it hard to meet friends. I know people here, but they aren't really my type of friends due to their lifestyle choices. (it's not them, it's me) I am trying to put myself out there, but i feel if i go to any meet up group, ill be the oldest guy there (29 male) and I would then feel stupid.  i try going to a local bar by myself, but I feel weird after a while being alone. I am okay if it is a quiet night like on a weekday, but not weekend. I have a lot of social anxiety which stops me from attending certain things, like meet up groups, but once I'm in there I am fine. It is just that, i feel like ill be the oldest person there. Anyone also come to the city new and had a hard time making good friends? What did you do to meet people?

UPDATE: First off, I would like to generally thank everyone sincerely who replied. This was my first post, and extremely beneficial! I sincerely thank you all. I thank you all for your honesty. I understand I have this social anxiety stupid thing, and I need to get over it, but I am trying! There are meetups I am super interested in, but I dont like to share my creative side with many people. It is just a matter of just going to one to break the bad habit. I did join the AMC (Appalachian mountain club) but that was 4 months ago, and haven't had the guts to show up for a hike, yet. lol. I am sincerely reading all of your posts, and taking them into consideration. Anyone meet any good lifelong friends moving to the city? Best meet up story?
