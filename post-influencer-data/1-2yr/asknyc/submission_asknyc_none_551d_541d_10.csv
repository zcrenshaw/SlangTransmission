"New Yorkers, what does you wish every newcomer knew when they moved to NYC? As well as tips and tricks for said newbies?


I'm moving from Nova Scotia, Canada to NYC in the next few months to get married (yay!). I'm 27 years old. Being from a small, Canadian Province I was obviously raised in a very different environment then the hustle and bustle of NYC. However, I am just as in love with New York as I am with my fiance.

I've visited quite a bit at this point, as well I don't need to worry about finding an apartment or things like that as I'll be moving in with my partner. However, sometimes I bump into situations where things I learned that were polite where I grew up (waiting for the light to change before crossing is a good example) aren't practical and actually end up annoying natives when you get in their way.

So basically, what are things you wish newcomers knew before they came to NYC to avoid pissing regular citygoers off? As well, any tips and tricks in general for people just settling down in your city?"

"Homeless man threatened suicide on the J this morning- what do I do?


I’m aware NYC has a homeless population. Call it a problem or a given of a big city if you want. Normally doesn’t bother me that much. I’ll give someone food if I have extra. But this morning on my commute - approx 8:45am - this homeless man, mid 40s, kept saying ‘excuse me’ loudly and walking between the cars. I thought “that doesn’t look safe.” Low and behold he’s standing between cars yelling “I’m gonna do it I’m gonna kill myself if I can’t get even a dollar I’m hungry I got kids to feed life isn’t worth living” etc. 
People start to look up, one guy, 20s, seems genuinely worried. Goes to him saying “no no, here man, look” and pulls a $10 from his wallet. Homeless guy comes back in, young guy starts talking to him, asking his name (Tim) asking about his kids. Tim’s now talking about how he has to feed his kids, he’s angry, etc etc. Hero dude is being really kind, giving free therapy essentially and suggesting  church and talking about how valuable human life is. Tim goes on to say “well they’re not really my kids, I’m not their biological father...” and talking about his anger and pain. 
Train stops before the bridge, Tim gets off. And I see him stop on the platform and count all the money in his pocket.

What’s the number to call for a suicide threat on a moving train? Even if this guy wasn’t serious, how would you get an MTA employee’s attention for someone who was?

When did this tactic start becoming a for panhandling? I found another thread from Jan 2018. Had anyone ever seen this before? What are your ideas to stop it? 

My worry is that many others will start to do this too as a means of begging and will completely desensitize the threat of suicide. Especially if children are watching. 

This is long. I was kinda shook up. Just want to discuss with fellow city-dwellers on what you might’ve done or any ideas for solutions as a whole. Be well."
