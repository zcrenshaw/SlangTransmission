"where can i go to scream as loud as I can for a little while?


Being in new york, it's tough to have to live close to so many people all the time. I want to know if there's a place where I can just go and scream at the top of my lungs as long as I can for a while. I think it's healthy and I just want to vent and decompress. Bonus points if I can do it in a place where my sound can travel or at least large enough that it echos. If I do this in my apartment, I believe my neighbors will call the cops on me. Thanks."
"PSA: Free Eclipse Glasses in Flatiron


In order to help stem the 80,000 posts about eclipse glasses, Chiquita Banana has a popup that is giving away free ones today (edit: this was posted on Sunday 8/20) on 23rd and Broadway. They're here today until 6:00. I was hoping they were giving away bananas, but this works too."
"Don't even know where to start. Very excited and very scared. First time in NYC after years of dreaming and fearing the city. Details below. (btw this sub was a real find!)


Sorry, it is quite long and a bit dispersive, I hope you'll find the patience to read through it.


I'm Italian, forty, and with my girlfriend we'll be visiting the city for ten days, Aug. 20th to 30th.  
We'll be staying in Williamsburg.  
It goes without saying that we are overwhelmed by the things we would like to see and do there.  
Obviously we will walk a lot (our idea is to visit Manhattan, walking a couple of areas each day, from downtown to uptown) and go to the three main museums.  
Me and my gf we love to walk, every time  we go visit a town, it can be Berlin, Turin or Ljubljana, we walk and walk and walk.  
Our main interests are: 
 
 * sunsets. We'd love to enjoy every late afternoon a different place where to admire the sunset ""flooding"" the city. 
 * restaurants (we've booked at [Ivan Ramen](http://www.ivanramen.com/) and we would like to go at Blue Hill, but it is too expansive).  
 * culture (to me NYC it is a cultural symbol, I feel so intimidated by it, also: everyone seem to be so cool that I was surprised, watching Weiner -- the documentary -- that actual ordinary people live in NY), mainly novels and films shaped my (naive, I am afraid) idea of New York. I expect to walk into a Woody Allen's movie or a Spike Lee's. Or to walk into DeLillo's, Auster's, Richard Price or Charyin's books. 
Basically what we are looking for is a place that is wildly romantic, literary, cinematographic. A remnant of the 20th century.  (Recently we've watched The Night Of, the mini series, it was outstanding).
* Ashtanga Yoga is also our interest and we've booked a couple of class at Eddie Stern's shala.
* I am vegetarian, for pure ethical reasons, but I like meat, thus my certainty teeters when people tell me: you must go to Shake Shack, their burgers are delicious. Is it true that eating SS burger's is pure joy?  
* Is there some meditator out there in this sub that feels to point out a place where I could go and to meditate in group, somewhere in New York, (simple mindfulness, Vipassana, stuff like that).

My idea is to stroll a lot and maybe meet regular New Yorkers, interesting, decent and authentic people, and maybe being invited at their place and cook for them, just to spend an evening inside a home of a family who lives in the city.

I sense that what I've written is rather vague, maybe because we are looking for an ambiance, an aura, a concept rather than the actual city.  
Also: the city scares the shit out of me: some pictures of Manhattan's massive buildings are so intimidating that I panic. I dream NY since I was in my twenties but I've never had the courage to go. I know it's weird, but maybe someone can relate to what I'm feeling.

* I am studying the subway map and trying to understand how to use it seen that it does not seem to be very easy. I am using [this](http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/basics.aspx), difficult but very useful. Does someone feel like giving some advice, any kind, to use it at its best please do.  
*  We are far from being rich, but we would like to do some shopping there, maybe nice simple stuff, nice and beautiful t-shirts, or American Apparelish style. And sneakers, Nike, models that we otherwise would not be able to find here in Italy. We are not definitely interested in designer's stuff like DKNY, or Hilfiger or, least of all, Italian designers.  
*  Golden rules to avoid annoying people: never stop or slow down while watching maps, but move to the right of the sidewalk; follow the Q and wait in the subway that people got out of the train and then move in; tips between 15 to 20% every bill in restaurant (not in bars or fast-food). if you want to add other tips and rules you're a welcome.  

Thanks a lot to anyone who will want to answer!"
