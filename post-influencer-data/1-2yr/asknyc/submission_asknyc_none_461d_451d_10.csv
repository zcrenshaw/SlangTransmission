"Places that serve alcohol at 8am in Lower Manhattan?


My coworkers and I are nurses who work night shift, and we want to get drinks and breakfast after work. Most places don't serve alcohol until 10am.. Does anyone know places that serve alcohol at 8am, in the financial district or tribeca? I know Sarabeth serves breakfast food and drinks at 8am, but was looking to see if we have other options.

Thanks!"
"What is the most clueless thing a tourist has ever asked you?


For the most part, tourists questions are pretty easy to answer, but sometimes they can be so profound that you have to take a couple steps back with them to find an answer. My personal worst isn't so bad. There was a group in the WTC station looking at a subway map to try to find the Statue of Liberty. 

What about you guys?"
