"Has Anyone ever called out a loud guilt tripping panhandler group on the Subway?


I know first instinct is to just ignore these people, but when they get into your face, lecturing you about how inconsiderate it is to ignore them, at what point would you call them obnoxious hypocrites. 

I was wondering if anyone here experienced a Subway drumming crew that has this act of guilt tripping you for ignoring them as they try to say hello to everone on the train. 

I wouldn't say I got 100% confrontational just now, I'm just not that committed to fighting blatant hypocrisy and I got places to be, but when they called out this poor woman sitting right next to them for not returning a hello, for not acknowledging their loud hissy fit, I ended up saying ""I think she just wants to be left alone.""

In response I got a loud, ""and I don't want to be ignored!"" Like asshole too fucking bad, I haven't heard a more entitled bitch in my entire life.

I get it that these people are desperate and are playing the guilt tripping card pretty hard.  But I take the A daily and seeing them emberass random people on the train is such a gross bullying tactic.  Seeing people encourage them is the icing on the cake.

I was wondering if anyone ever called them out on their bullshit and managed to get through to them, or is it just pointless to hope for something like that. "
