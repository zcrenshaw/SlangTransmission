"Seeking a compassionate early abortion provider in Manhattan


Please, no judgmental comments or trolling. 

Just found out that I'm 3 weeks pregnant. My partner and I are very happy together but are early 30-s professionals who are not ready to be parents for another five years or so. This happened to us a couple of years ago and I ended up having to go to a shady place in Brooklyn several times to get an abortion pill and paying several hundred out-of-pocket because I was temporarily uninsured between jobs. I don't regret the abortion but it was an awful, incompetent experience and I don't want a repeat.

I'm now fortunate to have coverage through my employer (Cigna Open Access) and am in need of help again. Can someone recommend a good care provider in Manhattan who accepts most insurance? I'm very early and want to have it done ASAP to avoid trauma and stress for myself and my partner (who is fully supportive). Prefer the abortion pill or Soft Touch procedure. "

"What's with the lack of social shaming, New York?


**Disclaimer**: I apologize if I sound combative or ill-informed about NY. I'm relatively new to NYC from Germany- moved here from Berlin for a job in tech several months ago. It's cleaner and safer than most of the movies and TV I've seen would have me expect, and I like it here so far, despite the city's quirks and the craziness of the American government.

But, I gotta ask, what's the issue with letting people get away with incredibly stupid stuff? What's the deal with people bringing their scooters on subways or letting their hound take a dump on the street without getting a stare-down from the rest of the street, or getting a fine from a cop for being a public nuisance? I know America is more individualistic than Germany and this city is very crowded, but the guy who brings his scooter on a train is clearly violating somebody else's safety and privacy. 

Are American cops way more used to taking care of more serious crime like assaults or murders? It's not uncommon in Germany and surrounding countries to see people being fined less than $100 for minor offenses, such as littering glass bottles, or at least being shamed by their social network for being inconsiderate. I've known a few folks who have been passed up for promotions for the way they've acted during social events or even fired in countries that have at-will employment.

However, at least a few of those guys are assholes. Which leads me to ask- how is it that 8.5 million folks are letting less than 1% of the population get away when it shouldn't take too much to confront them or put them in their place? Is it a live-and-let-live policy, or are people really that afraid of being stabbed? Is there just not a strong culture of social norms built into New York that keeps this from happening?"
