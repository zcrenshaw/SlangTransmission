"What do you like most about NYC?


Not from the US but I’ve been to NYC two times and it’s one of my favorites places on Earth. Why? Because it has everything (opulence, poverty, people from all over the world) and gives me the impression that everything is possible there, regardless of who you are. "
"Good place to cry?


I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and I am due a nice breakdown to let it all out. But crying with roommates next door is not an option, and parks are too public. Any semi-private places I can just bawl my eyes out for a few minutes and get going again? 

Edit: Thank you for all the suggestions. I'm not depressed (probably?), just been holding in some stuff for far too long and needed an outlet. Think I'll go with any spot/bridge along the East River then; there's just something about water bodies that makes everything look so small and pointless. Best to wait till the weekend cold wave passes I guess."
"UPDATE: She is kicking me out. She said I have two days (All recorded.) I'm the guy who lives with the person turning her apartment into an AIRBNB or something like it.


Hi everyone,

I'm the person in this thread 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/7csomk/rentstabilized_apartment_lease_holder_doesnt_live/

Well now she is kicking me out. Right now it's Friday the 17th and she said I have until Tuesday.

What are my options? She is telling me the lanlord does know she is about to move. I said that I wanted to talked to the landlord about renting the apartment.

I'm really anxious right now and she is talking to other people about the situation. And I don't want to deal with this people.

EDIT: Forgot to add, she also said she will be cutting off electricity and everything. All of this is recorded. I'm not sure if that adds anything.

EDIT: You guys and gals are so awesome. I can't thank you enough for the support and all this useful information. This is what the internet is for. Thank you a thousand times over. My mind is at ease."
