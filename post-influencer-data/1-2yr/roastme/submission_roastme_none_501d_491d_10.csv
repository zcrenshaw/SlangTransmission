"Reminder: The Bystander Rule aka. Stop roasting people not holding the sign you twats


Another reminder from your wonderful mods to take another look at the rules because apparently some of you fuckers can't read, so I gotta do your job for you.

The Bystander Rule aka: **Do not roast anyone in the picture who is not aware of the picture being taken.**

This means don't be roasting people in the background, anyone doing this will have their comments removed and repeat offenses will lead to a ban.

Cheers"
