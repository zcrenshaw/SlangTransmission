"How does straight sex work?


I mean, who's the guy and who's the other guy?"
"Friendly reminder...


You're awesome. And handsome. And cute, sexy, funny, gorgeous, intelligent, fascinating, amazing, endearing and most of all, loved.

Doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, how old you are, your height, weight, race, religion, sexual orientation, state of well-being, skin colour, eye colour, hair colour, you name it. 

I think you're great. You should too. :)"

"Is it okay to not talk to your boyfriend when you're together?


Sometimes when I hang out with him at his place we don't really speak for an hour  at a time . For example today he was playing video games while I read Harry Potter we were snuggled up on the couch and really didn't have much to say. By the time I looked at my watch I realized 1.5 hours had gone by without us speaking at all.

I was enjoying his company, I'm just worried if this is normal? Does anyone else go extended amounts of time in yourSOs company without verbally talking?"

What do you guys think?"
"Wisdom of your elders


It’s really frustrating as a gay guy who grew up in the 80s and 90s to see our youth failing to learn the lessons my generation learned the hard way, so I need to tell you all something you really need to know…

Frosted tips were a terrible idea the first time round. Nobody looked good with them. Not even Justin Timberlake. You look like an echidna. An echidna with no style.

"Had my first date ever tonight...it was great!


I'm 19 and I had my first ever date with a guy earlier tonight. We had met on Tinder, texted a bit, then decided to meet up at a coffee shop downtown. When I saw him he looked super cute, sitting there waiting for me. He said hey, and opened the door to the coffee shop for me. We both got drinks that weren't coffee, lol, and just talked to each other for an hour and a half. He was awkward, but in a cute and innocent type of way. I liked it. Afterwards we walked around downtown together, talking and getting to know each other more. Then he walked me back to my car in the parking garage, and we hugged goodnight. I'm the kind of person who likes taking things slow, at least for a first date, and he seemed the same way. We said we had fun and wanted to see each other again, and afterwards he texted me saying the same thing again. I feel really happy, just wanted to share my experience, and I can't wait to see him again! "
"What is something you wish more guys did in bed?


Kind of a ""gay copy"" of a pretty standard AskReddit."

"Anyone ever heard of ""myvidster""?


It seems like a normal run of the mill video bookmarking site, but once you remove safe browsing it's like a gay porn site. Wtf"
"Slim guys with not much muscle mass, some of you are really hot.


I know muscular guys get a lot of attention, but guys also like slim guys with chiseled faces, beautiful eyes and hair, long eyelashes, stubble, a cute smile and nice teeth, and feathery cheeks! Makes me want to cuddle and protect you. Bonus points if you're Middle Eastern or have some body hair."
