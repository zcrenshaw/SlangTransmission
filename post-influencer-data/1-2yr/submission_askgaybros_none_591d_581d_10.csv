"Last week I was suicidal...this week I did something I never thought I'd ever do.


Long story short, last week, I reached the lowest point in my entire life. 

I've always been okay with my sexuality, but I've not been okay with my situation. Being 25, living at home in the closet with a religious family, has been extremely difficult my whole life, but it really recently reached a boiling point.

I was depressed and contemplating suicide. I felt like I was lagging behind on life, seeing many people younger than me come out and live happy, carefree lives. I desperately want to be honest with my family, but they are deeply homophobic. 

In a moment of complete desperation, I reached out to a suicide hotline, which then, in turn, pointed me to our local LGBTQ center. Frightened out of my mind, I scheduled an appointment to stop by and chat with one of their counselors.

The next few days were awful. My mood was up and down, switching between hopeless and hopeful at a moment's notice. When it finally came to the day of my appointment, I was sick to my stomach and almost called to cancel. I even drove around the block a few times, trying to decide whether or not I should go through with this crazy idea. If I did this, I would finally be taking the first step to fully affirming my identity.

I took a deep breath and opened the door. The counselor took me into a back room where we just...talked...for over an hour. This was perhaps the most freeing experience of my life. It was the first time I had *ever* told someone about my struggles. The first time I had ever said ""I'm gay"" out loud in front of another person (even counting hookups).

But the most important moment was at the end of our session when the counselor asked me about what I wanted in life. I told her I wanted to settle down with a future boyfriend or husband, while sharing this part of myself with my family.

""Wouldn't that be nice?"" she asked.

I smiled and, without thinking said ""Yes.""

She leaned in close to me and said ""That smile...that is why I do this. You are beautiful and you are loved. You are a special person, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.""

I immediately started to tear up. My dad, bless his heart, is bipolar and can be emotionally and verbally abusive without realizing it, and I have developed severe social anxiety because of it. This was the first time anyone in my life had ever affirmed my sexuality instead of tore it down. For the first time in over a decade, I let my guard down and actually smiled...a real, innocent, free smile, like a physical weight had been lifted off. I wasn't trying to hide my voice or my mannerisms...I just ""was"".

It was such an earth-shattering moment for me, and one that I will never forget.

Throughout our session, the counselor helped me through steps on how I can eventually come out to my friends and family. I'm going to start by coming out to my best friend who lives across the country. We've known each other since elementary school, and are practically brothers. I will probably do this within the next week, so keep me in your thoughts.

Next step will be to come out at work, or more correctly, live openly without hiding myself..

Next, I would like to find a boyfriend, someone I can settle down with and have a family.

Finally, when I am financially stable and completely independent, I will come out to my family.

I hope this encourages someone tonight. There is hope. You are loved. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how dark it may be now. I know this is terrifying, but it all starts with baby steps. You are not alone.

**tl;dr I was depressed and suicidal about not being able to come out to my religious family. Went to a local LGBTQ center and was affirmed in my sexuality for the first time in my life without shame.**

UPDATE: Wow! I'm blown away by the response from everyone so far. After feeling isolated for so long, it feels amazing to see how welcoming this community is! I'll definitely keep everyone updated on the next steps of my journey as well. I'm hoping to come out to my friend tomorrow, as I think he has the best chance of responding positively to the news. Thank you so much, everyone. Within the last 48 hours, I went from feeling completely unwanted and unloved, to valued and treasured. I know this may sound sappy, but what makes us so special; we may come from all walks of life, but we're more than a community; we're family."
"Update: Feeling conflicted about my sexuality after getting really intimate with my best friend


It's been almost a month now and I thought I'd let you guys know what has happened since then. After that encounter I was VERY confused. I didn't know if I was gay or bisexual. Like I said in my first post, I have never really felt attracted to another boy before and this was really strange for me. But then I realized that the labels don't matter and instead of thinking ""I like a guy"" I thought ""I like (insert his name)"" and that's true. I don't like him because he has a dick, I like him because we have lots in common and he's a very compassionate person who always puts others before himself. 

Now I'll just get to the point. So after out we almost had sex that night, things became awkward between us. We tried to pretend that it didn't happen for a few days. But I talked to him about it and he admitted that he's in the closet and has had feelings for me for a long time. I told him that I felt the same way about him. He was very relieved and asked if we could have a serious relationship together and if we could go out on dates. My response was yes-but that first he needed to break up with his girlfriend like I did. He was very hesitant because many of our classmates are homophobic and they will accuse any guy who isn't dating a girl of being gay...but eventually he broke up with her and he was a lot happier after that. 

We have been officially together for almost two weeks now and I'm so happy. This feels right. "
"My brain auto-piloted and...


I ended up cat-calling a rather attractive guy in the middle of a store,  with my mom,  while grocery shopping. To be fair,  we both noticed him,  but I noticed that he had a nice ass and without thinking I said ""DAMN,  thick AF!. "" Both the man and my mom heard me. I practically froze to death in the middle of the aisle,  realized what I had said,  and died. To make it worse,  my lovely mother told the man I was to young for him. And they both awkwardly laughed. 

This is it. This is my life now.

What is the dumbest thing you've done or said in front of an attractive guy?"
"So that date I was nervous about was fricking amazing


So, I posted yesterday for the first time about being anxious for a date with a guy. I was really nervous and jittery, but it ended up going way better then I expected. 

First off, thanks to everyone who gave some advice/support, I walked out of work feeling way more confident about this.

Got ready, got a bus into town and met him at this park just a few minutes away from that noodle bar. He walked up looking like a bonafide model, and I feel like that is going to stay in my mind as the perfect example of a ""jaw-dropping"" moment. Went for a handshake but he just sort of laughed and ended up pulling me into a hug. It was a darn good hug, it has to be said. He complimented me pulling out of it and I guarantee I was blushing like an fool after it. 

We walked around for a bit before heading to the noodle bar, and honestly the best thing about the entire night was the conversation. It was like talking to someone I've been close with for years, and there's absolutely no difference in how he comes off online versus real life. It felt so natural just talking away to him, and that kinda rapport was the same throughout the entire date. 

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that **I DID NOT SPILL ANY NOODLES** and that's honestly my proudest achievement in life thus far. The food was delicious and we got a beer or two there too, which probably helped the conversation along a little more. 

It didn't feel weird compared to dates with girls. It just felt right. Like maybe even better than past dates with previous girls. It was like being out with a really close male friend but with that extra bit of tension and atmosphere to it. I fucking love that feeling.

I pretty much died laughing when he did this thing with chopsticks that made him look like a walrus, which was probably the goofiest thing I've seen him do. It was completely unexpected too, I just looked away for a second and then he had the ""teeth"" in. He doesn't seem to care much about what people might think of that, but it was just so fun to laugh about something so silly as that. It completely broke any nervousness I had left there, because it was so fun and he was so comfortable around me.

We split the cheque as planned, and the waitress winked at us when she asked if we were paying together or not. She was fricking fantastic, made a few jokes in passing to us and just generally being friendly as fuck the entire time. I doubt I'd have been as comfortable being a little flirty with the guy if she wasn't so supportive and chill about it.

We left the bar and since it was still pretty early, decided to head somewhere else. We walked around looking for a place to go, and I'm pretty sure he knew exactly where he was going all along, he just wanted a little more time walking with me. We were heading to this street with a load of bars on it, but on the way he asked if he could hold my hand. I'm still giddy about how shy he sounded in that moment, but holding his hand as we walked was fucking intoxicating. 

As we walked, we got a few looks from other passers-by. One particularly sour looking old lady gave a shitty glare at us, but he just squeezed my hand and ignored her. I was feeling pretty exposed right then, you know? He didn't give a fuck about her judgement though, which made it easier for me.

As if to turn that all around, we passed this gaggle of girls and they audibly, incredibly, collectively went ""AWW"" at us. I was practically skipping after that, lemme tell ya.


We ended up heading to a pretty cozy bar for another drink or two, and we ended up getting a table out of the way of the main hub of patrons. After we had our first pint there, he turned to me and asked if he could kiss me.

He definitely could.

It was fucking magical. Short and sweet, but it was perfect for a first kiss and he just had this fricking smile on his face after. I can't stop thinking about that damned expression. I didn't even fuck up, it was so natural and easy. 

Few more drinks, a *lot* more kisses and some more hand holding, and we called it a night. He walked me to the bus stop, kissed me goodnight and we parted ways. I was still a little tipsy but buzzing with happiness the entire ride home.

It was absolutely the best date I've been on. I seriously just had fun being with this guy and it felt so relaxed. I definitely want to see him again, and I've been in a crazy good mood all day because of it.

The best part? He messaged me before I hit the hay, saying he was so nervous about meeting up with me tonight and that he enjoyed every second of it. He had been dithering about whether to go for a kiss all night until we hit the bar, and even when he was asking if he could hold hands, he was still very nervous.

I assured him that he did everything perfectly and that I  thought it was sweet he was so nervous about that when I was way worse beforehand. The topic of me being nervous didn't come up in conversation earlier but he couldn't believe I was as nervous as he was about it. Got told I'm a good kisser too, so I'm pretty fricking delighted with myself.

He said he absolutely wants to see me again, so if anyone sees me at work smiling like a fool, that's probably why. Things went so well, and I'm so happy right now. Of course, it's early days yet and it still mightn't work out, but last night was so fucking surreal and we seemed to click so well. I'm hopeful that this might turn into something in time.


Thanks for reading my babbling mess again, dudes :)

P.S: **FUCK MEGANTRON**

"Netflix now has a show with full frontal nudity


Was watching Altered Carbon and it's super good (Netflix Original releases today). But I was caught off guard as a man with a giant cock walked in a room. Lol

I like the equal opportunity nudity in tv shows these days

**edit**: Just saw a second dick "
"Probably avoided being killed


First off, this is the craziest thing that has ever happened to me! I still can’t really fathom that it actually fucking happened. I guess it goes to show, that’s sometimes life is a little stranger than fiction. Or just as strange.

Okay, so I’m from Denmark and recently turned 19 and also accepted that I’m gay and came out to practically everyone I know, so yay me (I guess) 
Therefore I’ve also started dating and kind of experimenting a little, you know, just being young and enjoying it, not really thinking about what I’m doing. Or caring really. 
I would say, without seeming too egocentric, that I’m fairly conventionally attractive, therefore when I’m out with my friends, mostly at bars and such, guys often approach me and start flirting. I enjoy it of course, but sometimes there are some who are a bit too eager. And looking back, this guy who this whole story is about, was probably exactly that, but actually hid it well. 
So this one night I was supposed to go this gay bar with my friend, because she had never been, and really wanted to see what it was like. But unfortunately she got sick. And at first I thought about not going and just staying at home, but at the last minute I kind of changed my mind and decided to go anyway. It might be fun. I thought, heck I might even meet someone cute. Which I did, unfortunately. 
So I went, alone, and had a lot of fun throughout the evening. At one point this tall handsome guy approached me, and we started talking, and he was very charming and funny, but also seemed a bit shy and nervous. At this point I had gotten a few drinks, and I always get very flirty when I’m a little drunk. So our casual conversation quickly turned to flirting. 
To make a long story short, in the end he asked me out on a date, and I said yes, we exchanged numbers, and found a day, and then went our separate ways. I had a good feeling about this guy. 

Eventually the day came when our date was scheduled. We had agreed to meet at a place where you can go bowling and eat dinner afterwards. 
So of course we met at this place, and he brought flowers and gave me a hug. At the the time I thought it was a bit direct, because we barely knew each other, but it was sweet and he seemed nervous, so I didn’t think much of it. 
Our date went fine, we had fun and really seemed to hit off. But (of course there is a but) even though he was charming and sweet and funny, there was something off about him. Just a little bit. I can’t really put my finger on it, but I suppose he was just too charming and too sweet. Just too good to be true. 
Despite this we continued dating. During our time dating he never really talked about his personal life, even when I asked him about. He seemed more interested in me. Occasionally, when I bugged him about it, he would tell me about his childhood and parents, but I didn’t think he was being truthful. It was vague and just didn’t seem real, almost as if he had rehearsed what to say if I asked about it. 

Again, to make a long story short, after we had dated for a while we became more intimate and ended up having sex at his place. It was fine, but I didn’t feel like we really connected like you usually do. It felt a bit cold, like it was something to get over with quickly. Afterwards we cuddled a bit, and then he asked me (I kid you not): “If you had to kill someone, how would you do it?”. I remember being so confused and taken aback, that I didn’t respond. Then he said, I’m paraphrasing, “I would lure someone in, by meeting them at a bar and being so charming and sweet that they would agree to go on a date with me. Then I would start dating them, and charm them even more, so they would have no idea what was coming. What I had planned”. When I realized what he was saying, I was paralyzed with fear. It’s not like in the movies. You’re practically frozen because of how utterly scared you are. I then quickly got out of bed, even though I was shaking. I took my clothes, and I said I had to go to the bathroom (because I knew where it was) He didn’t respond, he just laid there and stared at me. I made my way to the bathroom, and quickly locked the door. I was so scared and could feel that I was about to cry. I had no idea what to do. I was shaking and almost crying, and then I just sat down and in a way panicked. I didn’t want to upset him, by acknowledging what he was implying, because that might escalate the situation, I thought. Then in a moment of clarity I remembered that my phone was in my pants. Instead of actually calling someone, I don’t know why, I pretended to be calling my sister and talked very loudly to make sure he could hear me. I thought that if he thought I was talking to someone, they would know if something happened, and therefore he wouldn’t do anything. I then put on my clothes and went on with this fake conversation. I continued with it when I went out again, and said I had to go because my sister needed my help with something. He was still in bed. Silent. I continued talking to myself on the phone until I was out of his apartment. Then I ran down the stairs outside into freedom. My heart was pounding so incredibly much. I was so relieved that I was almost laughing. I then took the bus home, and that’s it. I haven’t contacted him since, and he hasn’t either. 

So, that was it. Definitely the scariest thing that has happened to me. I wanted to tell this to warn everyone about who you meet, because they might not be who they appear to be. Or pretend to be. Just be careful my dudes.

Also I haven’t contacted the police about this, because he didn’t do anything to me. He just, I guess, in a way threatened me. But I can’t prove that. 
Or do you guys think I should? 


Update: Hey everyone! Thanks for all your advice. I will be contacting the police tomorrow, as I realize that that’s the best idea. Even if they can’t do anything, at least they’ll know about him. I don’t want the same thing to happen to anyone else. Or something worse. "
"What are your thoughts on hand holding + eye contact during sex?


Today I hooked up with someone (another 20-something), usually im a top but this time I bottomed, and the top was really confident. Took charge, made a lot of eye contact while he was fucking me missionary, (serious expression, deep blue eyes, I found it easy to look him back in the eye) but he also held one of my hands (our arms were outstretched on the bed if you can picture it like that). He'd alternate between the eye contact and assaulting my neck with his lips/tongue. And likewise when I was on my stomach and he was on top fucking , he'd also find a way to wrap one of his hands around mine. 

And I just realised wow, that was intimate as fuck. Sadly he was also sunburnt pretty badly in a few areas so I had to be careful not to hurt him but I gave him a massage afterwards with the appropriate gel to soothe it and that made him quite 😊

When I was walking him back to the train station to see him off and say bye, in addition to a hug, he also gave me a brief kiss on the cheek in the midst of the bustling crowd which I also thought was super nice but ah well, thoughts on the topic question? Sign of chemistry?"
"I'm Black and I've Been Sleeping with a N-Word Using Trump Supporter


So it'd been a while since our last hookup and I was super horny. We made plans to have fun at his house around 10 so I picked up the magnums and lube from the drug store and headed over. I get there and he meets me at the door wearing a white tank top and jeans looking gorgeous. I've been running business errands all day so I'm wearing a dress shirt and sweater and look like a nerd. That'd been our thing though, opposites attract. We got off on our differences.

Anyway we kiss and I have him tell me where the bathroom is so I can shower and get ready. After I'm done he shows me around his house a bit, introduces me to the cats, and then we end up in his bedroom and start getting down to business. We always have really great sex but this was definitely our best session. We're verbal and hot and sweaty and it's awesome. I'm the bottom and he's the top. I have the best orgasm of my life.

After we're done we lie on his bed and have a bit of pillow talk. Usually our hookups had been in the middle of the day so we didn't have time for conversation before. We talk about our families, region, and this other guy he's sort of involved with, who'd been our biggest problem before tonight. As we're getting dressed our conversation turns to politics. 

Inevitably we start talking about some of the things Trump has said, and there's this moment where he's struggling to remember something Trump said so we can talk about it. He says he thinks it was a moment when Trump used the ""n * gger word"" (full thing). I was shocked and thought maybe it was just a weird slip so I corrected him, ""you mean n-word."" I let the conversation go on and he talks about how he supports and voted for Trump, and even identifies with him. He refers to Hilary Clinton as a ""bitch"" and talks about how he doesn't trust the government. He goes on to say he's an ""equal opportunity racist"" and will call an elderly black woman driving too slowly in her car a ""n * gger"" (he uses the full thing again) just like he'd call someone a ""cr * cker."" Apparently he's made loads of money since Trump became President too. His whole demeanor changes as we talk. His eyes get big and he becomes unusually expressive. The more we talk the more and more scared I get as I realize ""Who the fuck have I been screwing?""

I think I'm going to ghost him on Grindr and delete his contact info from my phone. I'm worried our sex was some sort of creepy racial domination thing for him and I feel terrible.

Tl;dr Black guy sleeps with white guy. White guy reveals himself as racist after sex. Black guy feels bad. Plans to ghost him."
"My son came out to me today, looking for advice.


My son (12) told me today that he's gay. He says he has felt this way for about a year and that his friends know and are supportive (which makes me soo happy). I am honored that he felt he could tell me this and proud that he's comfortable enough in his own skin to tell his friends.  I have told him that his father and I love him so much and nothing in this world could ever change that and we will proudly stand behind him no matter who he chooses to love. So, my question is, is there anything your parents did or you wish they would have done that would have helped you feel supported and loved for who you are? We live in a small town and even though his friends are supportive now, we know he will probably face some hard times at some point. I want him to know that home is safe loving place where we all adore this sweet, caring, big hearted kid.  "
"[UPDATE] Am I Friendzoned?


Soooo...  A few months ago I posted a thread, asking if I was friendzoned, based on a few things that had happened... [Old Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7dmcyj/am_i_friendzoned_is_this_weird/)
    
Well...  Here's an update.
    
So, we continued seeing each other.  I still thought it weird that we ONLY went out on the weekends.  Then came January of this year.
    
It's the absolute weirdest reason to remember Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but on that weekend, we went out on Friday.  Nothing spectacular, dinner, and drinks.  As the night went on, he wrapped an arm around me and started opening up some details about his past.  Prior to meeting me, he'd been in 2 major relationships.
     
1. The woman he thought he was going to marry, who left him shortly after engagement.  
2. His first relationship with a guy, who attempted to rape him.  (This last detail made a LOT of things click in my mind mentally, like the fact that when we slept together, he wore EXTRA clothes, like a jacket, etc..., and I would sometimes catch him in something of a fetal position early on, like he was attempting to protect himself.)  
    
He said that we'd been dating for four months at this time, and because of the positive connection, and how well we'd meshed, he'd deleted his Tinder and Bumble.  He hadn't even thought about meeting up with anyone else he'd connected with on either of the apps anyway, after we'd met in person.
  
Him: What do you consider us?  
Me: Well, I know what I'd LIKE us to be.  
Him: Would you like to be my boyfriend?  
Me: I would  
Him: Ok, then we're boyfriends.
    
And that was the start of the shift in our relationship.  For the most part, things are just like they were (which I LOVE)...  There's an added bonus of being introduced as 'his boyfriend'.
    
The point I take away from this the most, is that sometimes you just have to take the ride life gives you, and see where it goes.  
  
Don't worry so much about when things become official.  
Don't worry about others opinion of your relationship.  
Don't end a happy relationship because it's not moving as fast as you want it to.
    
TLDR: Thought I was friendzoned, got my first boyfriend.
EDIT: Word jumbles"
"I'm lonely and just found out that a condom + thick cotton sock feels awfully close to fucking an asshole.


I fucked my sock for over 30 minutes and had the most intense orgasm in months."
"""I would never have guessed you were gay""


Or ""you don't look gay"", ""you don't sound gay"". When people say these things it seems like they mean them as compliments. How do you respond?"
"[UPDATE]Told my father about his homophobic wife.


tl:dr at bottom

Previous post where I explain the whole situation https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7uf3mj/dealing_with_my_dads_homophobic_wife/

I'm on my way to Melbourne. Since I have a 3 hour layover in Dubai now, I thought I'd kill some time and update (as some guys seemed interested in knowing more).

I first told my mother who just called me and asked me how I was planning my visit to my dad in Australia, she noticed I was a bit concerned so I explained the situation to her. She told me basically what everyone adviced in the comments of the post, she was *very* pissed actually and wanted to call my dad and have a serious conversation with him and his wife, she was very displeased and took it personal (a bit of profanity), she was saying things like ""Who the hell does she think she is to treat my son like that?, let me just talk with her, I will put that homophobe bitch in her place"" to which I begged not to, as I wanted to tell my dad first, and I didn't want to bring more drama in the situation, I wanted to handle it with my dad mostly and by extension with his wife. After a while talking with my mother(she was really heated and really wanted to talk with this woman) I coaxed her out of intervening.

Right after my mom I told my dad about his homophobic wife, I didn't sugar coat it, I told him how she's been with me, about her being rude, the way she ostracized me from family when he was not around, about telling the kids not to talk me or go near me, everything. At first he was disconcerted, as he was sure he had told her that I was gay (a few years ago as he remembers), and she didn't comment on it so he thought she was ok with it. He admits he didnt mention anything about my sexuality with her again, until  recently, when gay marriage was legalized in Australia (but this was well past I had told her explicitly), because, well there was no reason to, it's not a topic that pops up in conversation (and it makes sense, to be honest). So far it looks like my father told her and she just forgot about it (lol) and since I'm not particularly effeminate, she didn't have any reasons to think I'm gay, till I actually told her explicitly. He ended up believing me as I explained everything thoroughly (my lack of interest in coming back to Australia to visit him, how I suddenly wanted to travel the country all by myself instead of spending time with his family, and my general unhappiness when being in his house). He said I should have told him earlier and was also very disappointed in his wife, he expected her to be at least tolerant and supportive, as he has been like a dad to her kids (whose dad is away, apparently the kids biological father is not very responsible at all), he said he treats them as if they were his own kids, and it was very unexpected and unfair to learn now this new (homophobic) facet of hers and the way she was treating me .

I mentioned not wanting to go to his house till I'm treated with the respect I deserve, as I'm not putting up with her homophobic bullshit anymore. I don't want her to be my friend or anything, I just want her to tolerate me and allow me to visit my father without feeling like going through hell when staying at his home, and to see my little brother and spend some time with him as he grows up, in my upcoming visits. He said that he was with me, that he'd do his best to try to to talk some sense into her, and that he would find me a hotel near his house, but not for my entire stay as he wants me to sleep at his house, since it's my birthday and he wants to spend time with me. Wheter she likes it or not I'm still his son and have a right to spend time with my father, just as much as she does.

Well now I'm very excited I'm  going to meet my little brother (I brought him some gifts) and I'm finally seeing my father after more than a year, hopefully everything goes well, I hope my dad is able to talk some sense into her and things are ok between us (in the best case she treats me the way she treated me before).

**tldr:told mom, she got pissed and wanted to put the homophobic *bitch* in her place, but I managed to convince her not to intervene. Told my dad and he's on my side, he was disappointed in his wife, will talk some sense into her and will find me a hotel to stay till waters are calm. If anything I learned my parents are more supportive than what I thought.**
