0,"TIFU by pissing my pants, puking on myself, almost killing/losing a $1800 snake, and confessing my undying love to 20 different women on a facebook status (I tagged my girlfriend as well).


Happened last night, a good friend of mine drove us to a downtown octoberfest around 5pm, I had about six beers by 7pm and I was definitely feeling drunk. He only had two beers and offered to drive to a liquor bar we frequent, I completely forgot about the age old “beer before liquor never sicker” and we went. I remember drinking 2 rum runners at one bar and then leaving to go to another and this is pretty much where I blacked out. I woke up this morning in my bed, still dressed in my button down and slacks, covered in pee and vomit. I took a shower and checked my phone, I had sent a bunch of extremely embarrassing messages to random friends and old girlfriends. I checked my facebook and saw I posted a status confessing my love for 20 different women, and I tagged them. I also confessed that I loved my ex more than I could ever love my current girlfriend and tagged them both. I had a ton of missed calls and a voicemail from my girlfriend telling me she didn’t want to see me again. I ate breakfast and sat down contemplating my life when I noticed I did not see me extremely expensive female black eyed leucistic ball python in her cage. I was not sure my stomach could sink any farther but it did, I freaked out. I looked all over my room before finding my python wrapped up in my piss covered bed sheets. My guess is I took her out of her cage before falling asleep.

TLDR: Drank 6 beers before drinking 4-5 cocktails, woke up in a pool of my own piss and vomit, messaged a bunch of random women and posted on facebook that I loved them, girlfriend broke up with me, almost killed/lost an extremely expensive ball python. "

2,"TIFU By Not Understanding ""Netflix and Chill"" (NSFWish)


Alright this just happened about twenty minutes ago and I'm writing this while traveling home.


So this afternoon, I go and have fun with a friend of mine that is a female. We knew each other back in high school (we are college kids Seniors now) and recently started a friendship after we both found our that we had a similar hangout spot. This was was very pretty but never believe I had a shot with her for two big reasons.


Reason #1: I was known to be unable to secure a relationship and 

Reason #2: I was known to prioritize family, education and health over friends.


But one month into the school year, we still had regular hangouts--not dates-- and didn't hate each other.


So after having lunch, she asks if I want to come over to watch Netflix and chill for the night. This was primarily because we had decided we wanted to go to College Gameday together (Go Hokies) and her couch was hella comfy. 


You might have realized, ""Damn, my boy /u/personwhodidntknow is about to get it in."" One problem: I didn't understand the connotation of ""Netflix and Chill."" I thought I was just going to watch Netflix shows like House of Cards. The reason I didn't have Netflix was every single living environment had cable television. My dorm had it, my apartment had it. I had no reason to spend $10 a month on Netflix, even though I heard great things about to show. Plus, I had free HBO and Amazon Prime. 


I also didn't know about the phrase ""Netflix and Chill,"" because it wasn't something I would read. I never really browsed ""meme sub-reddits,"" never really saw the catch phrase.


So with that being set aside, I go on my way to her house and knock on the door. She answers in a large sweatshirt, and what I assumed were shorts on under neath. Being the gentleman that I am, I brought popcorn and began to cook it in the microwave, excited to watch whatever show she wanted to put on. 


I noticed that her roommates weren't around, so I of course asked where are they and she responded with a simple, ""oh they aren't here."" Nothing suspicious. 


I walk back with the popcorn and she isn't by the television. I didn't think much of it and simply sat down, nomming on some dope ass popcorn. A couple of minutes pass and I'm a little bit concerned.  

*Where the fuck did she go?* 

I call for her and she doesn't respond. I begin to walk around and notice that her door is cracked with the light on. I walk up, do a simple double knock and push the door open to find her laying on her bed naked. 


At first, I take a couple of mental pictures. Then, I tried to understand what was going on. She wasn't covering herself, she wasn't responding. She was just laying on a bed, staring. I mean, she looked sexy as hell but I wasn't sure what to do. 


So, being the smart ass I am, I asked ""Do you want me to pick the show?"" She looks confused and I start to panic. What do I do?


Next, I say the best things that comes to mind: ""Oh are we about to do it?"" She facepalms and shuts the door. Me, realizing what the fuck was going on, knocks on the door and tries to figure out what is going on, saying lines of ""Is that a no?"" and ""I didn't understand the scenario."" and that I thought she looked pretty. 

She tells me to go down stairs and I proceed to put a bag of popcorn over my dick to hide my confused boner. About a couple of minutes after finishing episodes of friends, I try to remove the awkward tension in the remove, using an excuse that I needed to pick up my drunk roommate. 


We say our goodbyes and I'm now sitting on a bus, realizing I could have gotten laid. 

TL;DR I didn't understand Netflix and Chill and missed out on getting laid. "
3,"TIFU by breaking both my arms whilst riding a bike I'm not allowed to ride


I'm a  backpacker travelling around South America on a miniscule budget, jobbing my way around. I've been working in a hotel in the Colca canyon, Peru. My boss splits his time between the hotel and his family home in Arequipa (a city 5 hours away).

We have mountain bikes for hire at the hotel (STRICTLY FOR GUESTS) and I'd taken to sneaking rides on the bikes when my boss is away.

Anyway, I took one of the bikes out in the morning and rode 45 minutes to the next town over. Glorious day, no problems, having a great time. On my back, I'm getting up a bit of speed (it's mostly downhill) when suddenly I hit an improvised speed bump made of rocks outside of a rural orphanage that wasn't there earlier in the morning. I go flying over the handlebars and into the road, breaking both of my arms and completely mangling the bike. 

8 hours and a $1300 ambulance ride to Arequipa later, I have to ring my boss and ask him to drive the 10 hour round trip to collect my stuff from his hotel and bring it to me in hospital. I also have to explain that I destroyed one of his bikes.

I am currently holed up in a hotel room in Arequipa waiting for my shitty insurance to organise a flight back to England. I can get dressed and type but, crucially, I can't wipe my arse. I was also supposed to move on to Chile for another 2.5 months tomorrow in preparation for a glorious Christmas return.

Bonus detail: The only reason that I rode to the town in question was to ask out a girl in a coffee shop who turned out to have a husband anyway.

TL;DR

I crippled myself while disobediently riding/destroying a bicycle owned by my boss and I'd have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.

Edit/update:

Just got back from an appointment at the hospital to redress wounds/stitching in my hands and had been having a great laugh with the receptionist while I waited to see the doctor. On my way out, I thought to myself  'you need to get back on the horse' so I asked her out. She is also married, and my mum called reception while I was in the appointment to check that I was OK."

So, unlike most TIFUs, this one happened not even an hour ago as I type this. 

My brother, ever burdened by the amount of study he needs, requested I babysit my niece whole he studies. No problem, no charge :) 

I decided to take her on a walk to the local convenience store, then to a park I hadn't taken her to before. We both go into the store, and she's just baffled by the amount of treats this store has. I told her I'd get her one, and hey....she saw the toys, too, so I just couldn't say no to the little Doctors kit she picked out, then I grab myself a couple Redbull (yellow is like Crack for me), her treat, the toy, and a pack of smokes. On to the park! 

We get to the park, and she starts running around aimlessly, chases me, then I totally leave her in the dust like an adult. After a few rounds of that, occasionally letting her catch me, she advises me that she has to go to the bathroom really badly. Okay, No problem....wait...it's a problem. No porta-potty's. Okay, McGyver...think! Cmon!

Lughtbulb moment: Let's just have her pee outside! Great idea, OP!

I take her to the woods to go pee privately. Well, relatively, considering the circumstances. We get deep enough to where I feel comfortable, then I told her how it's supposed to work, according to me and Hollywood: ""You pull down your pants and panties, squat down like *this (I showed her how)*, and pee. 

Now, the only thing she could lean up against was shrubs, so I let her lean back on my hands. At that point, I told her it was okay to go to the bathroom. She proceeds to piss straight forward, all over her shoes, underwear, and pants. Immediately, I kinda panicked. ""Wtf? That's not how it's supposed to go!"" Okay, so now I have my niece 20 minutes from my house, her pants, shoes and underwear soaked with urine, and no replacement for any. Thankfully it's slightly cold here. I took off my hoodie, and wrapped her in it, and carried her 20 minutes to my house, with the soaked clothing in the hoodies pockets. 


TL;DR

I took my niece for a stroll to the park, she had to pee, I showed her how I thought it was supposed to go, she pees all over her clothes, and I had to carry her back naked from the waste down 20 minutes back to my place in the hoodie I was wearing.

8,"TIFU by mistaking one jar of pickles for another.


This just happened maybe 4 minutes ago. I'm at work on a skeleton crew and we go on lunch. I go to the fridge to start my daily routine of taking a can of progresso soup and pouring most of its contents into a disposable cup to microwave, and then pour it back into the can to eat, so I never need a bowl. I'm a visionary ahead of my time, I know. Anyway, I open up the fridge to grab my water bottle and see a jar of pickles. Well one of my supervisors brings in pickles all the time that he prepares at home, and I remembered a couple days ago him telling me he made a new batch and to try them. Now seeing these I think fuckin score, there's a couple of peppers floating on top, he knows I love peppers. So I grab one and eat it. I then turn around from the fridge to the microwave (small kitchen area) to start my soup routine and my mouth starts burning. Not the normal burning that I so much enjoy when eating super spicy things, but the type that makes you fucking panic and realize that you've made a horrible mistake. So I hurriedly throw my soup in the microwave and turn around to grab some water. First mistake. Water plus hot is a no. Rookie mistake, I know, but with the urgency of my mouth screaming at me I was not thinking clearly. I realize that this was no normal pepper. This was a pepper straight from Satans garden. I'm am crying, sweating, have started hiccuping, and feeling like I'm going to puke. One of my coworkers comes around the corner and sees me and asks what the hell happened to me, only for me to be able to stammer out a few words at a time due to the pain of fresh oxygen touching my now wasteland of a tongue. He starts laughing and tells me they weren't the pickles I thought, and that it was another persons who has recently taken up pickling, and that the orange pepper was a fuckin habanero. Now I don't know what kind of fucked up habanero this was but it was hotter than anything I've ever tasted. Just as he's telling me this, the microwave goes off, and I open the door. I cooked the fucking can. I put the can in for a minute and a half and let that mother fucker fry. At this point my coworker is laughing hysterically and I still cannot talk to explain myself. The urgency of my mouth taking a shot of napalm completely broke my brain and rather than abandon my soup mission I chose to complete that task and move on. Now the microwave is all fucked looking on the inside. Now, I made myself some oatmeal and my mouth is fine, but my stomach is in knots and this is going to be utter hell on the other end in a few hours. 

TL;DR Ate a pepper from a pickle jar, was someone else's pickle jar, pepper was actually a habanero, broke company microwave trying to not die. 


I think I'll be staying away from spicy for a while.

Update: On my last break now, guts have not stopped wrenching, burping a bunch and I feel like a fire breathing dragon every time, and I've had to piss like 15 times due to the probably gallon of water I drank. 

Update 2: At home, on toilet. Can hear wife and kid having a good time while I am dying. So far, by as bad, but I know damn well from the way my stomach is grumbling that digestion is still taking place and the morning will be an entirely new evil. 

Also, to clear things up, I've eaten Carolina Reapers, Ghost Peppers, and a whole bunch of these little Vietnamese peppers, and I gotta say that this felt like the reaper all over again. I've never wanted to puke from something being so hot until today. It was insane. "
9,"TIFU By falling off a bike and getting 5 stitches in my vagina


Today I met up with someone from Craigslist to buy a bicycle. Mine is many years old, and it was time for a new one. I drove to their house and after inspecting the tires, gears, etc., took it for a test ride. Now I'm used to my worn out bike, with the little squeak in the back wheel and pretty unresponsive breaks, the main reason I needed a new one. This bike was practically brand new, like ridden once on a show room floor for 10 seconds new. And they only wanted $50 for it. A damn good deal considering the make/model and condition. So during my test ride I'm changing gears, testing the steering, and then it was time to see how the breaks responded. I eeeeever so lightly squeezed the hand break and BAM! The bike stopes on a fucking dime, sending me forward and over the handlebars, somehow crashing crotch first onto the front wheel and then the pavement. I felt a sharp pain in my groin, but quickly regained my composure and got back on, limp-riding back to the owners front door. Luckily they didn't see me eat pavement since they had gone back inside momentarily. Other than feeling like a complete idiot for crashing, the bike was perfect. I paid the $50 once the owner returned and loaded up the bike in my car.

Fast forward about an hour, I'm home and I feel very sore, but not too bad. Happy about my purchase and the prospect of frequent fall bike rides. I suddenly feel the urge to pee, so I go into the bathroom, take down and pants and HOLY FUCKING SHIT THATS A LOT OF BLOOD! I have an IUD and don't get periods anymore, so this is great cause for concern. After some investigation I see an inch plus long, extremely deep gash in my inner labia. I grab a sanitary pad, zip up and drive myself to the nearest Urgent Care. An hour later I walk out, the proud owner of 5 vaginal stitches and a $200 doctor bill. I guess I won't be riding my new bike for a while...


TL;DR I fell off a bicycle, landed crotch first on the front tire and had to get 5 stitches in my vagina. "
