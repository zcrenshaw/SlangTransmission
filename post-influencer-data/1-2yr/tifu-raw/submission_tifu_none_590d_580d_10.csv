0,"TIFU by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.


I'm in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go. Future me will hate past me for going because I used my student loans to go... but thats a different issue. 

Anyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

This goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*Explains above about material*
Prof: ""What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?""
Me: ""No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?""
Prof: ""Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.""
Me: ""It literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*Shows syllabus*
Prof: ""Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
Me: ""What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?""
*Prof starts laughing*
Prof: ""Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.""
Me: ""Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

I then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing ""This is a new one for me."" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!

Tldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.

Edit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.

2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.

Thanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

Edit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam."" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - CZ

2,"TIFU by walking with my hands in my pockets.


This didn't actually happen today, it happened very early yesterday morning. So, I had gone to a friend's house a few blocks away to hang out. Because they live so close, I walked over &amp; planned on walking home. 

When my friend got tired, I packed up my backpack, put on my jacket and headed home. I was walking with my hands in my pockets because it was cold out. At the end of the block, I stepped off the curb to cross the street, and the next thing I remember is spitting out a mouthful blood &amp; pieces of tooth. 

I had slipped on ice and, because my hands were in my pockets, I couldn't break my fall. I blacked out momentarily when I hit the ground, but I assume I landed on my face. My teeth punched a hole through my lip, and shards of tooth got stuck inside. 

Several hours in the ER later, I was patched up with 10 stitches (5 inside my mouth, 5 outside). They couldn't do anything about the tooth, other than put a protective layer on the broken surface. (It will have to be fixed this week when a dentist can see me.) 

TL;DR: Walked home from a friend's house with my hands in my pockets, slipped on a patch of ice, landed on my face, bit a hole through my lip.

3,"TIFU by putting tiny, annoying noise making machines around my house and forgetting where they are.


First off this isn’t a story from today, it really started on Christmas. I’m a big fan of pranks and annoying my brother, so my dad got me 3 little machines, each about as big as a gumball. Each machine has one button and once pressed they make noises once every 4 minutes or so, ranging from a phone’s alert sound to a doorbell. The one problem was, I never figured out how to turn them off and I just assumed they would stop after a day or so. I hid them around the house, went on vacation to Utah and had forgotten all about them, including their locations by the time I got back. These things go off infrequently enough that I can’t hear where they are and on top of it every time the doorbell sound goes off my dogs lose their shit. I found one of them and threw it away because I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off, but I still have 2 left lying around, waking me up occasionally and being annoying as hell.

TL;DR: I got three tiny things that make random annoying noises to piss off my brother, it totally backfired when I lost them with them left on and I still haven’t found 2 of them.

4,"TIFU By having my mom clean up my gallons of dried cum under the side of my bed.


OK so this actually happened 8 years ago. I was 16 and was just getting into the habit of watching porn on my phone in bed on the iphone 3GS at the time. Now keep in mind that my parents are very religious and conservative, and I grew up in what you'd say a privileged household as well.  

Almost every night right before going to bed, I'd watch porn for about half an hour whilst slowly stroking my dick. Just as I'm about to cum, I'd tilt my body sideways, dick aimed at the wall on my right, and shoot straight down there. I was in the mentality where ""if it's under the rug no one will find out"" similar to when you drop chips on the floor. 

Anyways, I kept doing this for about a year, and I never really bothered to look under the bed.  

One day, my room was messy and my mom was pissy. She walks in, yells at me for having a very untidy room then she says that's it, we're deep cleaning the room right now. She makes me go fetch cleaning stuff to help out. I remember being very pissed off because she interrupted what would be my afternoon fap session.   

So carpets removed, furniture moved around, and deep cleaning commences.  

When the bed was moved to the side, I almost shat my pants when I saw the horrific view of what was under.  

Sticky, yellowish, dried cum which was tainted down the wall, and into a massive puddle that had about a 10mm thickness, and you can actually see ants, and small roaches whom have been caught up and died right in that puddle. 

Now my mom casually asks ""what's this?""  

In panic, I told her that I was having Ice cream in bed one day and that I spilled it to the side, and forgot to tell her about it.  

She got x100 angrier at this point, telling me how careless and dirty I am. Nevertheless, she seemed to have bought it.  

Several minutes later, she started scrubbing the puddle of cum while I was looking in shame. I felt like biggest sack of shit on earth. Feelings of disgust, shame, and guilt overwhelmed me. I vowed to not masturbate to the side wall anymore. 

Anyhow, the nightmare didn't end there. After a few minutes of scrubbing, the now wet puddle of cum starts to emit odour. Shortly after, the entire room smelled of cum. It was the most disgusting smell you could imagine. I was horrified and didn't know what my mom was thinking at the time. I was just playing dumb and was pretending to move around shit in the room to make it seem I was helping her, when secretly I was shitting my pants. 

At the end of it, she just said to me ""Remember, god is always watching. He's very unhappy with you."" and left.  

Religious me back then cried in the same night, and I was begging for god's forgiveness for weeks in end. 

Not too long after however, I realised that I learnt my lesson, and that's when I started using tissues in bed.  

TLDR; Masturbated to the side of the bed for a year, mom wants to do a deep clean of the room, find cum puddle, tell her it's ice cream, she scrubs the whole thing making the entire room smell of cum. 

edit: Fuck did this blow up. You guys made me aware of the coconut story and the cockroaches story, I found comfort in knowing there are more fucked up redditors out here. Yes it is horrible what I did and disgusting, but I promise I'm a regular functioning adult in society now."
5,"TIFU by hitting a school bus full of children


Just found the TIFU thread this week. Thought i'd write one of my greatest fuck ups ever as an initiation. This happened back when I was a sophmore in highschool, when I first got my license.

I'm a big procrastinator. I usually manage to study the day before an exam in order to take them. This time was no different. I had this huge calculus exam that I didn't study well enough for. My mom packed me my breakfast, and I took it in the car to eat right before class because I was running late. However, it was snowing pretty hard for the first time since winter season started. I didn't have any experience on how to drive correctly on snow or ice at that time.  

So the entire car ride I was dreading when I would have to go and take the exam. I thought as a joke: Oh wouldn't it be nice if I could just drive my car slowly in a ditch and just say I got into an accident and didn't need to take the test. I laugh it off.

So it happens. I was rounding this large curve near my neighborhood, driving a lilll over speed limit. And my wheels hit a patch of ice. My car starts curving out of control, and to my luck, there's a school bus rounding the same curve. I smash into the side of the school bus near the driver's seat. I scream as I slo-mo watch my breakfast splatter all over me. My car is totaled but there's only a small dent in the school bus. 

When I look up. I realize that I didn't hit just any car, I hit a fucking school bus. The angry bearded bus driver shoots me the dirtiest look as he gets out of his bus. It's not until the second school bus comes to pick up the kids and transfer them do I see the small children filing out of the bus one by one. Thankfully no one got hurt. And because a school bus is government property, I had to wait for not only the police cars to come investigate-- but the state troopers came by to inspect the bus for damages as well. 

TLDR: karmas a bitch. wished jokingly to miss an exam via car accident, hit a school bus full of small children due to ice, missed the exam, came out with expensive ass insurance and no car.

6,"TIFU by getting an accidental nude Thai massage


So this happened about 6 years ago but probably one of my best TIFU stories .

So I was backpacking around Europe alone and was due to travel home on a very long flight. Given my backpack was quite heavy I got a really sore neck and wanted a massage before I flew home.

I was staying in Paris near the Gare du nord and asked the hotel concierge in French where I could find a massage place . He pointed me to a place down the road and off I went .

Arrived at a Thai massage place , I should note at this point that I have never had a massage from a massage parlour in my entire life , only from my mother who is a trained masseuse. 

So anyhows , I enter the place and say to them in French that I have a sore neck and want a massage . The lady points to the price list and says “I recommend 30 minute massage “ i pay and she asks me to follow her .

So we go down stairs into a basement Area . No alarm bells from me this appears normal , she then takes me into a dark room with a red light and asks me to derobe. Again this all seems perfectly normal to me , I’d never had a massage before and should have probably realised at this point that this was not the type of massage place I wanted .

I got down to my underwear and the lady said no take it all off . I remember thinking “oh they must just put the towel over you “ so I just go along and lay down on the bed on my front . 

The lady doesn’t put a towel on me and puts on some sensual music then proceeds to cover me in oil and begins to rub me. It’s at this point I’m like uhhhhhh ok this is quite interesting , but hey I’m here now . I also didn’t feel like I could get up and leave . It also wasnt much of a massage but rather just a lady rubbing oil all over me , but for some reason that didn’t strike me as strange either .

About 15 minutes in she’s asks me to turn over . I was like”what the f..” and realised this is it, I was getting a nude Thai massage and at this point I was this far in I just had to let it happen. I rolled over and covered my lady parts with my hands , because well other than my bf no one had seen me naked before . She then moved my hands to each side of my body and proceeded to massage my topside - babs and all. I was internally at this point just like ohhh shit this is happening.

It finished after some time and I left, the worst part was my neck was still sore and I was left covered in oil for my very long flight home 

TLdr: I went to get a neck massage and accidentally got a nude Thai massage . I left with my neck still sore and covered in oil"
7,"TIFU by locking my entire family in my bedroom.


In typical TIFU fashion, this didn't take place today, but rather a decade ago.
 I was a very small child at this time, on around seven or eight. Me and my sister's were playing a game in my room. We then shut the door, only to realise that it locks from the outside. Without noticing that the lock mechanism had been active, I shut the door, trapping my sisters and I inside. We screamed for our parents once we realised it was locked. They came and opened the door to see what was going on, and walking into the room. 

Now for the actual screw up. 

Like a complete moron, I forgot about the situation that happened LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO, and proceeded to shut the door with the lock still active. This trapped our whole family inside my room.

 We spent 3 hours in that room, unsure what to do, as my parents left their phones in the kitchen. After 3, grueling and miserable hours, we have the genius idea to scream out the window at random strangers on the sidewalk. This took place in the middle of the night, so we had very little hope. We were in the second floor and couldn't just jump out. To our complete shock and surprise, we grab someone's attention, and they come into our house to let us out. It was pretty terrifying having a random stranger in your house, but thankfully this person had no malevolent intentions. 

This is a story from my childhood, and I just thought I'd share it with you all, so you could have a laugh.

TL;DR: I was playing a game with my sisters, and locked us inside not once, but twice, only to have random stranger enter our home to help us.

EDIT: HOLY CRAP FRONT PAGE!"
8,"TIFU by not reacting to my cats warning scratches to the bathroom door.


Obligatory this happened a few months ago.

To give a bit of context, I own a (usually) well behaved tuxedo cat that when it's late at night sleeps in the bathroom because otherwise she will not let me sleep (such as knock everything over as if it's her first day in my flat). She's used to it since she was a kitten, so she walks into the bathroom and lies down to sleep by herself when it's bed time, and I just close the door. Door closes = sleepy time. Door open = cat shenanigans time. There's a scratching post, food and water, a small cat tree and a litter box in the bathroom along with some toys so if she ever needs anything while I'm asleep it's right there. I usually let her out as soon as I get up, and don't hear much from her at night because she just sleeps through it. When I open the bathroom she usually runs straight through the living room and outside through the balcony door. Sometimes she stays inside for a cuddle session first. She rarely ever uses the litter box and just prefers going outside. The weather has been pretty warm lately so she enjoys being outside, and I let her sleep there if she doesn't come in by herself at night. But yeah, usually she quietly sleeps in the bathroom.


Not this time however. I heard her scratching at the bathroom door at 5am which woke me up, I was super tired and thought to myself she probably heard movement and thought I was awake or something. Either way I was tired as hell and it was a bit stormy outside anyways so I just ignored her. This is exactly where I fucked up.


I fell asleep again and woke up a few hours later. Headed to the bathroom, open the door to let her out, and there was poop everywhere. Apparently she really wanted to go poop outside and wanted me to let her out for that reason, then just did it in the litter box. Which wouldn't be a problem, but she stepped into her own poop and then for whatever reason walked through the entire bathroom with her poopy paws. There was poop on the floor, the walls, towels, the window, the washing machine, on top of the toilet lid, fucking everywhere. I had to clean the entire bathroom. I don't even know why she decided to touch everything with her poop paw before cleaning it. Even on the sink and I've never seen her on the sink. What the hell yo.


TL;DR: Ignored my cat scratching on the door inside so she pooped into the litter box but stepped in it and decided to cover the entire bathroom in shit prints. I had to clean it all up.


Edit: Picture of the little devil https://i.imgur.com/AxDYeuB.jpg

Edit: No, I don't force her to be locked in the bathroom, she goes in all by herself. If she wants to get out she will let me know, and I will let her out immediately (exception was this TIFU - listen to your pets complaints!), but usually she sleeps through the night. Litter box is always kept clean otherwise no cellular life form survives the stink. Sometimes she doesn't sleep in the bathroom, her choice. I've had cats all my life so don't worry about her well being, she may be a little shit sometimes but I still love her. 

Edit: Doesn't matter if the door is closed or not, she needed to go *outside* and I would have ended up with poop all over the living room instead.

I never thought my cats poop would get so many upvotes. That's terrifying."
