1,"TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV


This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

MORE EDITS: There are quite some people asking for an AMA. Im already hated by the internet for ""milking that karma cow"". If you care I can do an AMA, it's the choice of you guys and gals. For today I have enough internet and I guess by tomorrow nobody will care anyways.

OH and thanks for the gold! Things are going so fast here I didnt even see it until now. Thank you unknown and kind strangers!

2,"TIFU by cumming into a coconut


EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

EDIT 2: RIP inbox

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

EDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit's history. Lord save me."
3,"TIFU by deleting Reddit's #1 top post of all time


Happened just now. Sorry for my possible slips as English is not my mothertongue. I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

I've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.

Later in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.

I'm sorry. I didn't want to. Please, forgive me everyone.
I'll commit Sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.
If somebody working for Imgur sees it here, please, report it to who it would be most appropriate.

**TL;DR: I deleted Reddit's [#1 top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/62sjuh/the_senate_upvote_this_so_that_people_see_it_when/?sort=new) picture by playing around with Google sign-in on Imgur.**

P.S.: resubmitted because it didn't have TL;DR in the beginning

Edit: link for clarification (try clicking the original ""Senate"" post's title link).

Edit 2.0: **I guess *I am the senate* now**

Edit 2.6.5.32: I submitted the bug to Imgur's contact form just in case...

Edit 4.1.15: **just got from work to find a message from [u/_BindersFullOfWomen_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_BindersFullOfWomen_) on the behalf of Imgur's team, so the bug seems to be closed by now, the picture's back too** That's pretty cool and fast of a reaction for such a huge service, especially for me since it's already post working hours for me (I know, I know, time zones'n'shiiieeet).

4,"TIFU by honey dicking my wife after she found my used condoms...NSFW


Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

I went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

Fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

TL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.

5,"TIFU by scratching my dick and destroying my neighbours £20,000 summer house


A common theme in this sub, this didn't happen today but in fact yesterday!

First off I'll give you some context; I'm a fat, miserable sack of shit with a receding hair line.

I also live in the beautiful countryside of Scotland, in a village with around 100 people in total. The village is right by the coast so the views are pretty fucking good.

Now my house is in ""an area of historical interest"" which means that in order to get the simplest of work done ""change a fucking lightbulb"" I've got to get permission from my local council.

They agreed to let me cut down this ugly ass tree that blocked a good chunk of my view. On one condition, they provided the contractors that did the work. I agreed, happy to get the cunt out of my garden.

So come yesterday I was super excited for once to finally get rid of this tree, I'd put in for planning about 2 months beforehand so they took their damn time. 

It was a two man team with a chainsaw, fair enough. No tension or nothing to keep the tree straight. I left them too it.

About an hour later one of the blokes is at the door asking me to give him a hand, I agree, ""making myself useful"". 

They explained the situation and told me they needed someone to hold the top of the tree and stop it from falling into the neighbours beautiful summer house. I said sure. They'd already taken about 1/3 of the tree down. So I put on my gloves and they begin cutting down the tree, when suddenly my pubes start going on fire, so my retarded ass goes and scratches his dick for one second and you just see this 4 meter tree land right over the wall on their summer house. 

Needless to say contractors left kind of quickly and the neighbours are away on holiday. Halp.

TL;DR Miserable sack of shit stops holding a tree to tickle his pickle and it ends up destroying the neighbours summer house whilst they are away on holiday.


EDIT: I've been to see the council and they've said they're going to be in touch. I'm expecting a court case. 

EDIT: Council have had me in their lobby for hours, not sure what they're doing on my property or with the tree. Might be getting assassinated by MI5, will update soon.

EDIT: Apparently one of the labourers were severely disabled, and according to the council shouldn't have been working in the first place. That gives me some hope.

EDIT; Fuck me this blew up. I do appreciate gold. Need to clear up the ""summer house"" phrase I used which has confused the yanks. It's basically a glorified shed to chill out in the garden."
6,"TIFU by going permanently deaf after intense sit ups


I was on my last exercise, which was just your regular old sit up. I get to the point where I can barely finish a full sit up, pushing myself hard to finish the last few, when I feel a pop in my left ear. My ear starts ringing. Nothing else was wrong with me though, so I shrugged it off, quit my workout, and went to sleep about an hour later.

It's 6 am when I wake up. I look at the time, but I notice everything around me seems to be spinning. I also realize the sound of every movement I make only seems to reach my right ear. Something was definitely wrong, and I immediately remembered the pop in my ear the night before. At this point I'm not *that* worried yet.

But I start googling my symptoms, as you do. I usually don't get too affected by all these ""*you have cancer*"" or ""*you're going to die!*"" diagnoses you always find, but this time it struck me that everything definitely pointed to a serious issue: a fractured round or oval window. This can cause serious hearing loss. By now, I also found out that every movement I make causes intense vertigo and nausea. This is the point I start panicking a bit.

After a visit to the doctor, a nice morning of throwing up from nausea, and then a hospital visit, I'm told that it is probably exactly what I thought. Apparently it is extremely rare, but this can happen during a workout. I'm given steroids for a higher chance of recovery and get sent home. Two days later I get a call from the doctor, asking if I can have surgery the next day. She explained it didn't feel right to her and she wanted to diagnose the problem and possibly fix it as soon as possible.

I had the surgery, and everything seemed healthy. She explained that this meant it was likely indeed a fracture in the oval window. Fractures can be so small, it's possible you will never locate them. During surgery, she something to the oval window to increase the likelyhood of recovery, but that's all she could do.

Now, after more than a month of recovering from the vertigo I can do basically everything I used to be able to. Hearing in my left ear is gone. I've been told that it's very unlikely to recover. My balance is still somewhat off but I've been told I'll get used to that. I'm already mostly used to it. Hearing with just one ear has many downsides, and don't get me wrong it fucking sucks, but I've learned to live with it already. Well, other than the fact that I am now somewhat terrified of the thought of this happening to my right ear as well.

Now what irrationally stings the most about this whole ordeal. I'm a big Linkin Park fan. I had even pre-ordered the collector's edition of their last album. This story happened the day before the Linkin Park concert in Amsterdam that I had tickets to. I obviously couldn't go. It's a selfish thought, but it really fucking stings now that I know it was the last opportunity to see them live.

*****

**TL;DR
I was working out using bad form and breathing techniques, feel a pop in my left ear, wake up deaf the next morning with extreme vertigo. Had surgery and medicine, but to no avail. Am deaf in my left ear now.**

*****

Edit: wording and spelling

Edit 2: some people asking what the TIFU was... I mean I literally did sit ups so hard and with wrong breathing techniques  that I put too much pressure on my head and ripped a vital part of my left ear. I think that counts, even if some bad luck is required as well.

***Edit 3 (now bolded because this is important): To those saying ""Another reason not to work out"" and actually mean it: I was incredibly dumb. Please remember that. I held my breath, which is dumb. I kept going when my body barely could, which is dumb. I strained all my muscles to get those last few sit ups out, which is dumb. Etc. Working out doesn't cause this. Being a dumb fuck who doesn't know what he's doing causes this.***

Edit 4: Thanks for the 2x gold! Don't really know what to say. Really appreciate it!

And another Edit, number 5: FRONTPAGE! :o I really appreciate all the kind words. Everyone wants to give me advice and help me, and that's amazing. The internet isn't always a shitty place after all. Also love all the messages I got! Don't have time to read them all right now, but I will tomorrow!"
7,"TIFU by not listening to a TIFU about a TIFU about using a coconut as a fleshlight.


I hope this will be the last time this happens, so make sure you read this carefully to make the most out of your cocofleshlight.

I read the first Cocofleshlight story and thought that was pretty gross, but was a little intrigued.

Then I read the second story and thought that was devastating, but I was still intrigued.

So I found myself a coconut in the closet and made sure it was big enough for my schlong, and made sure it wasn't infested with something. 

*Now here's the mistake I made*

I left the coconut water in to enhance my experience, and also I was weirdly turned on by fucking with water involved.

Turns out, I'm allergic to coconut water, and my dick swelled up and block the hole.

I panicked and ripped my cock out, which cut it horribly.

So here's the lesson: DONT FUCK COCONUTS

TLDR: Didn't listen to two posts, fucked a coconut while allergic to coconut water, fucked up my dick real hard."
8,"TIFU by telling my supervisor that his wife(also mother of two) is a cheating bitch.


I'll start with some quick backstory. I recently moved and took a pretty good job sandblasting in Greensboro. Probably the best job I've had so far. The crew I work with are pretty cool and the job itself is pretty fun. My supervisor has a goofy/comedic personality but does a great job balancing that side of him while also being a good supervisor, so this to me is perfect. 

So earlier today my supervisor and I were chatting during our break and somehow got on the topic of cheaters/breakups . I mentioned to him a relationship I had 15 years ago where I was cheated on. He asked if I ever got back in touch with her and I said no. He then asked if I ever looked her up on Facebook, and I told him I  never had urge to want to see her again and called her a ""cheating bitch"" (big mistake this was.) So after pushing me to look her up, I get on FB and look her up and sure enough I find her(The profile pic was just of her). I show him the picture and he starts laughing thinking it's a joke. He then asks how I knew she was his wife? So I also start laughing thinking he's joking with me. 

I scroll over to the next profile picture and see them together with their kids. I've never felt such a feeling of confusion and fear like this in my life. I immediately remembered hearing from a friend a while back that she ended up moving to Greensboro but i completely forgot about that when I moved. I apologize to my supervisor but my mind was so shocked I'm not quite sure I was making sense. He seemed to take it ok and said it's not a big deal, that this was a long time ago. And we went back to work. 
 
So now I'm freaking out about if he's gonna tell his wife (my ex) about what happened and how she's gonna react. He seemed fine leaving work but if it was me I'd be wondering all sorts of things about our past relationship that would eat at me. What are the chances something like this happens? Why couldn't I have pulled up the profile pic first and just keep my mouth shut. Tomorrow should be interesting. 

TL;DR Moved for a good job. I called my ex a ""cheating bitch"" in a conversation at work. Found out she's now my supervisor's wife. May not have a job soon. 

Edit 1: As I'm reading through my story I see I could of filled in more details to make things more clear so apologies(my first TIFU post) Getting ready for work so I'll try and update seeing how this blew up overnight.

Edit 2: He's been pulled away on a side project today so not sure what time I'll get to see him. But I appreciate all the feedback and tips. I'm beginning to agree with most people saying I probably got brought up in their convo and got lead into to that topic. But I'll try and respond to as many comments as I can. Will update when something happens. 

Edit 3: So found out he's out on lunch break until around 1230.  We'll be working together when he gets back. Going through comments I agree saying losing my job was a bit overreacting. I'm now expecting more of an awkward tension between us. Not sure how I would feel if this were the other way around. 15 years is long enough to move past most things. 

Edit 4: So it didn't take long before he came up to me and started chatting. Right off the bat starts with ""so I told my wife about what you said, and she wanted me to tell you that you're a little bitch!"" And immediately burst into laughter. Welp, not what I was expecting but I went with it and laughed with him. He goes on telling me how she knew I started working there from her friends(not sure who yet) and told him about us dating before. Told him everything. I again apologize feeling like he might of taken some offense, but quickly realized he didn't give a fuck after he made a comment about how he knew she was a dirty girl before but she's now only dirty for him :/
But we keep talking and come to find out he was trying to find out what I thought of his wife (my ex) while keeping it secret. The opportunity came up in convo yesterday and I fell for it. But he said he didn't expect what I said and though it would be ""hilarious"" to tell his wife about it first before letting me know.  So everything seems cool he said he hopes that doesn't make anything awkward between us and shook my hand. He did however mention that him and his wife wanted to me to hang out and meet the family this weekend. Not sure about that just yet. But either way I wanted to thank you guys. Going through the comments helped make some sense out of this and put my mind at ease a bit. Seen a lot of people calling this in advance but I was so mindfucked I didn't see it. 

Edit 4.5: He's not the same guy I caught her cheating with. Seen a few people ask about that. Neither of them have Reddit, they're both Facebook junkies according to him. And I'm not sure I'm cool calling this guy my eskimo brother. Seems.....odd."

11,"TIFU by reading the TIFUs of coconut fuckers..


Im on mobile so sorry about format. First time poster, tldr at the bottom. Sorry if my English is bad.

Be glad, im not fucking or trying to fuck a fruit in this post, infact, I dont think I'll be buying fruit for a week at least. It's bad luck.

Onto the fuckup.

I read the first TIFU yesterday, and let me just tell you im really giggly, anything can make me laugh. So i read the first maggot post, had a good belly laugh, and went to bed. I woke up like two hours ago and decided that I wanted to cook breakfast. 

It was going pretty well, made myself a cheese omelette, put on the kettle for some  tea, and I'd been craving boiled eggs for a while so I took two, put them in the pot and turned on the stove.

Now I decided it'd be a good time to scroll some reddit, so I did that, for about 7 or 8 minutes, at this point I started reading about the 2 more people who had their fair share of bad coconut experience. While I was reading that, the water the eggs were boiling in starts bubbling, and the kettle starts whistling too.

Never try to handle hot boiling water without paying full attention to what you're doing. Especially when you're laughing at other people's fuckups. 

My hand missed the handle of the pot the eggs were in and landed on the hot, hot surface of the kettle. Naturally, I screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK"" on the top of my lungs and jerked my hand back, only to knock over the pot the eggs were in, onto my legs.

I cried. It burned. I was wearing shorts and barefoot.

TLDR: Was reading coconut fleshlight fuck ups and boiling eggs. Was laughing and not paying attention, spilled boiling water onto my legs. Was wearing shorts and barefoot.

Edit: word.

Edit 2: Im A-okay, to those asking. Ive bandaged up my legs and im not removing that shit for another 24 hours until i know for sure that my legs would look human.
Also, I like eggs, I eat eggs often, sue me."
12,"TIFU by flashing my landlord


I have a weird living situation. I live in the upstairs apartment of a home with two middle aged men that live downstairs. The house is away from town, kind of far off from people. So I don't usually expect cars or people passing the house often. 
Because of this I tend to keep blinds open on the windows. These windows are floor to ceiling, big, definitely see through windows. I have my own entrance because they prefer to use the back door. Because of this, very rarely do they see the front lawn, unless they are driving to go somewhere. 
 Anyways, I get home from a run. I have one of those sports bras that unzip in the front. So being as stupid as I am, I am standing in front of the window looking out at the fields across from my house. While doing this I am slowly unzipping my sports bra and my boobs pop out. About 20 seconds later,  I see one of my landlords staring straight at the ground walking as fast as he can across the lawn to the door. I hurried and jumped  to the side out of window view.  

Every time we run into each other is so awkward now. I know he's seen my boobs. He knows he's seen my boobs. But we don't talk about it. Just a hello and a wave when we pass each other outside. Just thinking about it gives me anxiety. I bought black out curtains the next day. 


TL;DR I took my bra off in front of my window and watched my landlord run for the hills when he noticed. Now my living situation is so awkward. "
13,"TIFU by forgetting there was a shell chambered in my shotgun


This happened a few years ago and it still makes me feel ashamed because I’m the first to tell anyone about the importance of gun safety and how to appropriately and respectfully handle a firearm. 

Any who, I went to the shooting range with my friends to let off some steam. At the time, I owned a few handguns but recently purchased a 12-gauge, pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip for a little over $200 (what a steal) and wanted to christen it. The rules at the range for shotguns is that you can only use slug rounds (a singular, heavy projectile) not birdshot (basically, a bunch of bb’s). So we get there, go into our own lanes, load up and fire away. 

Since I had the newest gun, all my friends who came wanted a go at it. I obliged, loaded the shotgun up, and people took turns blowing holes in the target 25 yards away. I remember putting the gun down on the table after my last friend had a go with it thinking it was empty. I switched it up and began having fun with my other firearms. 

Time passed and we start unloading and clearing everything and locking our firearms up. Traditionally, I always unload and to be sure, aim the gun down range and pull the trigger to clear it. After locking up my handguns, I grabbed my shotgun by the grip with one hand, tilted it downward to where the barrel is pointing at the ground, and pulled the trigger to clear it. BANG! To my surprise, there was a round chambered in the gun and it blew the table into flying splinters and made a huge crater in the floor. Everyone in the range jumped and the range officer came running over screaming his head off. 

To make a long story short, the owner revoked my membership and banned me from the range and I had to pay for the damages. No one was hurt, but the fact that I didn’t correctly handle my firearm was the worst fuck up of all.

**TL;DR: Went to the shooting range with my friends. Recently bought a shotgun and wanted to christen it. Forgot shotgun was chambered and blew up the table into smithereens and left a nice crater in the floor. Got banned from the range and had to pay the damages.**

14,"TIFU by being tempted by the magnitude of coconut fucking posts. NSFW


Mom, I'm sorry.

After the first 2 posts of cocoNUTing I was getting a little interested, but decided against giving in to the combination of being incredibly horny and curious  at the same time. 


Then the next one came.

I heard my mom's voice in my mind, ""If all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?""  But the devil on my other shoulder told me that as long as i didnt let it fill with maggots, or drill it to small, or slice my dick on the pullout i would be fine. Boy was I wrong.

I grabbed a spare coconut from a decorative fruit bowl, and begun drilling with a knife and a twisting motion. I lubed up and begun the time old ritual of coconut fornication. 

Now, this whole process was quite loud and i was negligent to the fact that my family was still home, but by the time I realized this it was too late. 

WHOOOSH 

The door swung open with such speed that I couldn't react. There was no warning and because of the little bitch I am freaked the fuck out and ripped it off my manhood faster than a bullet.

""What The FUCK"" My mom said while seeing me throw a coconut off my bleeding dick. Before I could say anything the shut the door and hasn't said a word to me since. This just happened, Wish me luck guys.

TL;DR
Somehow convinced myself that following in the footsteps of my coconut fucking brethren was a good idea and i'm now probably going up for adoption soon.

Like most TIFUs, this didn't happen today, but ~10 days ago.

US applications for colleges begin in late August. I’d decided to join an NIT(National Institute of Technology) in India until I got a response from the states. I got accepted to National Institute of Technology(NIT) - Andhra Pradesh, or so I thought.

My dad and a couple friends decided to make the journey memorable and go by road. All cool. We drove across Maharashtra, into Telangana and finally to Andhra. A 930 Kilometre journey, and given how Indian roads are, it took us 16 hours; though we did stop several times for bird spotting, and adoring the view of herds of deers galloping along the horizon.

Regardless, the road trip was riddled with mind blowing greenery of the South Indian country side as we drove toward our destination, Tadepalligudem; where the NIT campus is situated.

We finally report to the campus, and move towards the admissions counter. The attendant there straight away denies us citing that I was never granted an admission in NIT-AP.

Panicking, we report to the admissions coordinator, who explains:

On my allotment letter, it was stated that I had gotten accepted to “NIT-AP”(In that exact phrase). The problem here is, there’s an Andhra Pradesh and an Arunachal Pradesh. Both are referred to as “AP”. Basically, I travelled 930 kilometres to the wrong state.

No where in the allotment letter had they stated “Arunachal Pradesh”, and living in the state right next to Andhra Pradesh, all six of the people with me never even thought of it; we went all the way there, only to find out we’d come to the wrong state, 2,930 kilometres away.

But we had a fun road trip! So yay….. I guess?

TL;DR: My allotment letter stated I had been accepted at NIT AP; being from Maharashtra, I assumed it was Andhra Pradesh and did not even consider the fact that it could've been Arunachal. Basically, went 2,900 kms to the wrong NIT AP.

16,"TIFU by not listening to a TIFU post and getting my dick stuck in a coconut


Mandatory context 

So today I was browsing r/tifu when I noticed a post about a guy continuously ejaculating into a coconut. When I read it I was shocked and kinda turned on (wtf i know) so I went to the supermarket around the corner and bought a young coconut because they are very common here in Thailand.

The fuckup: 

OK so since my parents were at work I decided to cut a hole big enough for my erect dick to fit using a knife. Long story short it took me an hour to do this but it the end I made it. I lubed my penis up and starting pumping it deep, it felt like really good but when I decidd to try to take out my dick out, it got stuck. The thing is I made the fucking hole just small enough but not big enough for my mushroom tip to get out. What made the matter worse is that my erection wasn't going away and my dick is still stuck in the coconut. Thankfully I managed to break it in half by carefully using a hammer.

DO NOT FUCK WITH COCONUTS PLEASE.

Sorry if my english is bad. I try my best to learn.

TL;DR Tried to fuck a coconut but my mushroom dick tip got stuck.
