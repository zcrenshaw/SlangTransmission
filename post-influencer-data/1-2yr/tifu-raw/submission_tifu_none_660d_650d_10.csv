1,"TIFU by not going to the hospital when I knew something was wrong with me


As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...

Sunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

As I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

I got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.

I woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.

I woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.

I went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!"" (Dave Chappelle voice)

The Dr. came flying into the room and said, ""Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!""

My life stopped. ""A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?"" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

What happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, ""couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" She told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

As I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

My parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!

The first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

But wait...there's MORE!!!

6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

I awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

The surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

Fast forward, to October 2, 2017.

My vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

I could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

I was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

I did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...

I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.

What this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.

I refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.

I tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health

-ZK

(TLDR: Had a stroke at age 29, almost died, had brain surgery, recovered, went back to work only to have a seizure my first day back caused by the stroke and am still awaiting return to work)

2,"TIFU by getting my work raided by the SWAT team.


So today about 5 minutes before my shift started, I was looking at the desk in the back and realized a small circular object that looked like an alien. It had two eyes, then a mouth that was pretty small at the bottom of it. Stupid me, not knowing what the fuck it was decides to press both of the buttons to see if it did anything or what it was, and the mouth part of the object lit up red for a second. Holding it in my hand, my manager walks past and I say:


 ""hey Kyle, what's this thing?""


His eyes go into panic mode and says ""whatever you do, do not press that button."" 


I'm like ""well what is it?"" 


""It's the silent alarm, put it back."" 


I just think oh fuck. ""Umm, I kinda pressed it like 2 minutes ago."" 


""Wait are you being serious?""


""Yeah, fuck.""


He goes and tells my other manager and they're like well shit, they know the cops are gonna show up any second since even if we called them they are required to come anyways. To add to this, before they come in they are supposed to call the store to check to see if it was a false alarm or if we didn't answer there was actually an emergency. Well guess what, our phone system was down today so we couldn't receive calls. 


A few minutes later as I'm working, all of my coworkers and managers start looking outside like holy shit. I'm like ""what?"" Turns out the whole perimeter was being surrounded by law enforcement. Nothing happens for a couple more minutes until a whole fleet of cops flood the building. One of them starts talking with my managers while the others start searching the whole restaurant. Everyone in the building eating was like ""what the actual fuck is going on."" After the whole situation was explained everything was resolved and they all left, but boy was it a fuck up on my part. Lesson learned? Don't push random buttons at work. 


To add even more to this, two of the cops who raided the place earlier came in a few hours later to get something to eat. I obviously gave them their food for free and they were really happy about that. One of them asks me ""so who was the fucker who set off the alarm?"" I was just like ""umm, that would be me officer"" and start explaining the story of how it happened. They were both laughing, said it was fine and that it happens all the time (surprisingly). They were just happy they got some free dinner, and I'm glad I could make their night a little better :)


TLDR: Pressed a random button at work that ended up being the silent alarm, SWAT team surrounded the perimeter and raided the building, came back and got some free food later. 


Edit: you guys are probably right in saying it wasn't the SWAT team, I didn't know any better but I remember there being maybe 5 cops inside and more outside VERY heavily armed (way more armed than I've seen normal cops). Either way it was defiantly a spectacle to watch.


Edit 2: Here's a picture of the alarm that I clicked - https://imgur.com/a/26QjV you can see how it kinda looks like an alien/toy. Credit to /u/screamingfurby for finding that pic, I was going to just take a picture of it at work tomorrow but now you guys don't have to wait. "
3,"TIFU by going Black Friday shopping


I needed some sweatpants because I only have one pair and thought why not since there were sales everywhere. The first place I went to was a sports apparel store that had tons of sweatpants. I grabbed quite a few to try on because finding pants that fit in length is impossible for a short man. There was a queue for the only fitting room area in the store, so I had to wait in line for a few minutes. I get inside a room eventually and try on my pants. Half of them fit correctly but the tags up close were only $5 off of $60 sweats because fuck a certain widely known brand endorsed by athletes. It was getting hot in the changing room from all of the movement and I was wearing a sweater to top everything, so that wasn't making things better. I grab all of the pants and leave the room. Immediately, someone rushes in and goes inside. I do a quick patdown before turning in the pants to the counter person near me and can't feel my phone. Next, I couldn't feel my wallet either.


I looked down and saw that I wasn't wearing any pants.


My heart stopped and my soul curdled like spongebob when he had to work non-stop when I realized this. Looking up, the counter guy was wide-eyed as well as the people waiting in line. I was so caught up on leaving the hot room that I fucking forgot to put my own pair of pants back on. Using the sweatpants to shield me undies, I ran over to the room and started pounding on the door. 


""Whaaaaaaatttt"", a woman's voice annoyingly creaked out.


""MA'AM, I LEFT MY PANTS IN THERE AND REALLY NEED THEM""


""I'm changing right now, so give me a minute.""


I don't know if she misheard me or if she thought I meant pants I wanted to buy, but I had to sit down on a chair with a gaggle of sweatpants covering my shame. This was one of those rooms that the door went down to the floor so she couldn't have kicked them out to me or thrown them over. I picked a ceiling tile and stared at it  because I didn't want to catch anyone else's attention. After the longest 20 seconds of my life, the woman comes out and I rush back in. My pants were on top of the mountain of clothes I had set it on, so I dropped everything else and put them back on. Putting them on in the fastest amount of time I've ever gotten dressed, I scurried the fuck out of there and didn't look back. I ended up not buying anything and almost passed out from an anxiety attack on the way home.


I don't think I'm ever going to try on clothes ever again nor go back to that store.


TL;DR: Went to try on pants and left my own in the fitting room; just mf end me."
4,"TIFU by being a horny teenager. [NSFW]


__Someone told me to post this here. I've only told close friends this story; but ill tell it for the karma.
Note: this was nearly 15 years ago, any advice on masturbating now just doesn't help; thanks though!__


When I was coming into puberty. I was jacking off a lot, but my house had a ""no locked doors"" policy and my family would walk in a lot for no reason. I came up with the idea of turning on the shower in the bathroom attached to my room; then would jack off in my bed. Family thought I was showering and would let me lock my door. There was a second room attached to my bathroom, which meant two doors in the bathroom(will be important later.)

Well one night, I start my routine. Turn the shower on; grabbed a handful of conditioner, return to bed to beat the meat. Well about 10 minutes into this particular sesh, I hear my father stomping up the stairs shouting my name. My heart starts racing.

 ""How the fuck does he know im jacking off?!?"" I think.

""I can't get in trouble for anything right now, he will think I can't hear him in the shower.""

I lay perfectly still like a T-rex is approaching. He begins banging on my door, shouting my name. I hear him run around back toward the guest room to try the other door to the bathroom. ""What the fuck is his problem?!"" I think. Not sure if the other door is locked. I jump out of bed so I can hop in the shower and get wet so he thinks I was actually showering. I open the door to the bathroom- and a small wall of water released into my bedroom. The entire bathroom had flooded. Some how a rag had fallen onto the shower drain, and flooded the whole bathroom. I opened the door to the guest room, buck ass naked with a huge boner on. (I have no idea why it didn't go down..) it was raining downstairs, dad was the angriest I had ever seen him.

I ended up having to spend the entire night mopping the water up with towels and throwing them in the drier. my dad had to replace a lot of the second floor. And my family ripped on me about that story for years after.

Tl;dr I ran the shower to hide my jacking off and accidentally flooded the second floor bathroom of my parents house."
5,"TIFU By cooking foraged mushrooms


So. This happened a few weeks ago but I’ve been meaning to post this story here since. It all begins when I found a few giant puffball mushrooms out in the woods. For those unfamiliar with a giant puffball. They are gigantic white and delicious mushrooms that look like this.  https://imgur.com/gallery/Mnay6 my fuckup comes while I was frying some up the next night. I seasoned them in breadcrumbs and cheese and ate a bunch of them. I thought they tasted a bit off but didn’t think much of it and went to bed. At 3 AM I was awoken by one of the worst upset stomachs I’ve ever had. I rushed to the bathroom and had a real bad time in there. I immediately thought that I was poisoned by the mushrooms and began frantically doing research online. I would have been in a lot of trouble if I incorrectly identified a mushroom and ate as much of
It as I did. Luckily I was safe on that front as giant puffballs are one of the easiest wild mushrooms to identify. So, I began thinking about the entire cooking process the night before when it hit me. I used castor oil to cook them in. I had purchased it at the Indian food store a couple weeks prior and had just run out of olive oil. At the time, neither me or my girlfriend had any idea what castor oil was or what effect it had on the human digestive system. For those who don’t know, castor oil is used in medicine as a natural laxative. It has been considered  a cure to constipation for years. The label on the bottle I bought had no indication that it was used for that purpose and I in fact just thought it was a traditional Indian cooking oil. So. I spent the rest of the day near or
In the bathroom and learned a very valuable lesson. Don’t cook with castor oil. 

TLDR; cooked a giant mushroom with laxative oil. "
6,"TIFU by getting tetanus and making dozens of people think I’m suicidal


EDIT: probably wasn’t tetanus, was most likely Staph A.  Thanks for pointing this out, u/heavenpunch

This happened 2 years ago, and I still cringe when I think about it.  I had to cut out cardboard for a school project, and cut my finger in the process. Soon after, like the absolute dumbass I was, I took a picture of it and posted it to snapchat, with the caption “FML.”  I soon realized what the looked like when people started asking me if I was okay, and I went into full damage control mode but nothing worked. I had to explain to everybody that I was stupid with a box cutter and wasn’t cutting myself. Few believed me, and it took me a while to calm everything down. 

A week later, I noticed the cut getting all weird looking. I told my dad, and he immediately knew what was happening.  I was brought to the ER and had tetanus. I had to get multiple shots and I was kept at the hospital for multiple days.  When I went back to school people were even more suspicious since I was gone, and I’m still hearing conspiracy theories about it. 

TLDR: don’t be stupid with a box cutter."
7,"TIFU by giving away 20 BitCoins. KillMePlease.


Obligatory TIFU. Didn’t actually happened today. 

Early 2013, I was 3rd year college when my school required Computer Science(which I belong) and IT students to attend a forum to be held in another school. 

The forum was technology related. There were different companies who presented and had a quick Q&amp;A from students. 

One of the presenters were people from BitCoin. To be honest, I wasn’t really interested before, during and after their presentation. It didn’t get my attention(yeah fuck me). The main reason it disappointed me was there were only VERY FEW establishments in my country who accepts BitCoin at that time. It didn’t look promising to me because of that. 

So, they had Q&amp;A just like the other presenters and there were few students who were quite interested and asked them questions.

Then here’s the fuck up. 

After the presenters from BitCoin have finished their presentation. They told us, the attendees, that they have a surprise for us. There will be few people who will be receiving BitCoin(and again, I wasn’t interested). 
They told us to check the under of our chair to see if there’s something. All the attendees were checking their chairs and because I wasn’t even interested at all, I didn’t even bother checking the chair I was seated on.

Then the person beside me who was my classmate, checked the under of the chair I was sitting on. And VOILA! My classmate saw the surprise, and because it was my chair, I took that “something” from him(Haha!). 

It was a pouch. Just a small pouch. There were around three(3) items IIRC.  One of which was a piece of paper where a code was written on it(of course not a simple type piece of paper). Apparently, it was the “BitCoin code” with the instructions which I didn’t bother reading. 

The amount? 20 bitcoin. Yes, 20 FUCK*NG BITCOIN. 

Suddenly, another classmate of mine(a girl) rushed to me who looked so happy(I can still remember how happy she was that time) and asked me to give her the BitCoin, if it was OK with me. 

And yes, yes, you’re right. Because of my fucking ignorance, I just gave it to her and just kept with me the pouch. Yes. ONLY THE POUCH(fucking genius, right?). I forgot who I gave the other items. 

And now the value of bitcoin is already at ~$8,000. It just makes me want to kill my self. KillMePlease. 


TL;DR: Had 20 BitCoin. Gave it to my classmate because of my ignorance. 

EDIT: Spelling

EDIT2: I’m not sure if the speakers said something about the current price of BitCoin at that time. Maybe they did and just so happened that I was not paying attention. The girl I gave the BitCoin to is my officemate. We work in the same company. Recently just asked her where the BitCoins are and she told me “It’s gone.”

I don’t mean to sound rude or whatsoever, but reading some of the comments made me feel better. Knowing that there are people out there who had far worse experience with BitCoin compared to me is comforting. 

EDIT3:  “people from BitCoin”, what I mean is  “presenters promoting BitCoin”. I forgot the name of the company those people belonged to. 

EDIT4:  Thanks for the gold!

P.S. not a native English speaker. Forgive me if there are some grammatical errors. "
8,"Tifu by trying to make grilled cheese the lifehack way


This happened about 4 years ago.

I wanted some grilled cheese.

I recalled seeing a life hack with this photo: https://imgur.com/gallery/Yg4iP

I happily turned my toaster on its side, popped in the bread with the cheese and went to the bathroom.

1 minute later I hear my mother yell ""What's burning!?"" followed instantly by our smoke alarm going off.

I rush back into the kitchen only to find in my horror that the toaster is on fire.

My mother rushes in, gasps and says ""What the hell did you do!""

At this point I'm fumbling trying to figure out what to say and what to do about my fiery toaster.

""I JUST WANTED SOME GRILLED CHEESE IM SORRY""

She quickly filled up a bowl of water and I unplugged it from the power. She then poured it over and out it went.

It's a bit fuzzy, but I 'think' at least one of those slices wasn't wet or burnt. I believe I ate it as she threw the toaster outside.

Nothing else was damaged except for the counter. There was a burnt spot in it which I still see when I go to visit my family every month.

TL;DR : I tried to make grilled cheese by putting my toaster on its side. It caught on fire and burnt the counter. "
9,"TIFU by hiding my girlfriend's birthday present too well.


Let me set the scene here. My girlfriend's birthday is creeping up this Sunday. As a birthday treat, I decided to take her on our first trip abroad to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, last week. This trip was planned way in advance and everything from our flights to our accommodation, and even our cab to the airport was all sorted months in advance. About a month before our trip, I decided to treat myself to a new watch. While browsing online for my watch, I came across the ladies version of my watch. Seeing as how my girlfriend already knew about her birthday treat, I thought ""Hey, why not surprise her with a watch on her birthday?"". I instantly clicked and bought her watch, and the watch I wanted, and was planning to surprise her with her watch on the day of her birthday.

A month passes and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of our watches. As I bought the watches from the same website, but from 2 different merchants, I knew beforehand that they will not be arriving at the same time. True enough, hers arrived last Tuesday while mine was being shipped. As mentioned earlier, I had booked a trip to Cambodia, and we were due to leave on Wednesday morning. Our flight departed at 7am which meant we had to be at the airport by 5am (early morning flights are the cheapest). As we lived 45 minutes from the airport, I told her to crash at my place as it'll be more convenient.

Now here's where I F'ed up. Her watch was delivered to my office last Tuesday. I was held back at work a little more than expected (clearing up my work before my 3 day absence) and I had to rush home, do some laundry, pick my girlfriend back to my place, and pack for the trip. As I had a lot on my plate, I hastily hid her watch somewhere I know she won't find, and left to pick her up. Everything from there on out went according to plan. The next 5 days in Phnom Penh was easily the best holiday I've ever had. Arrived home on Sunday night with a very happy girlfriend.

Fast forward to today, my watch finally got delivered, and it instantly reminded me of her watch. I had in fact totally forgotten about her watch as I was initially too occupied during our holiday, and was too busy playing catch up at work when I got back. I had dinner plans with my girlfriend earlier tonight, so I skipped out of work a little earlier today, so I could take her watch to get it adjusted. It was one of those metal strap watches and I had to remove a few pieces on the strap so it would fit her. When I got home, I started to realise I had totally forgotten where I hid her watch. I've searched the entire house, and my car, and I still can't find that damn watch. I clearly remember bringing it home a week ago, and stashing it before picking my girlfriend up. Unfortunately, I haven't got the slightest clue as to where I hid it. I guess all those bong hits from college is finally catching up with me. Luckily for me, I still have 2 days or so before her birthday so I guess the search continues...

TL;DR. I hid my girlfriend's surprise birthday present and now I can't find the damn thing. "
