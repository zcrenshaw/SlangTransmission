0,"TIFU by applying for jobs for the past month as ""Titty Boobowitz""


I've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and I recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. I should also mention that for almost ten years I've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. It's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. Or so I thought. I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:

***I have to say when ""Titty Boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

Ooops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

TL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.

EDIT: Just because I didn't make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up. We had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. I'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to TONS of idiots like me. At least I didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

1,"TIFU By Revealing That I Had Secretly Hid In My Roomate's Closet During His Pre-Bedtime Ritual


Obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

I lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we’ll call them Ned and Ethan. The three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. The most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out Adam Sandler’s At a Medium Pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (Everyone thinks they’re hilarious in college, I know).
The most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. But one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in Ned’s bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of Adam Sandler on my shitty Washburn 6-string. 

Trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but Ned was no random college student. Ned was the 6’3” milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. Ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. Ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. In short, Ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. So to me, that meant that whenever Ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

So I grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he’d think I had went to bed early), and snuck into Ned’s bedroom to position myself in his closet. It was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/UC2H/HMVJA37Y/FYAUC2HHMVJA37Y.MEDIUM.jpg). Ned’s bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so I’d have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and Ned, in case I accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. But directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was Ned’s computer and desk. 
Ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. Due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, I could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. The 12 inch proximity of Ned spiked my adrenaline, and I began to control my breathing. My back was pressed against coat hangers, and I had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. Ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and I had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([Artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/XmLM5Bh.png))

As Ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. Ned did not reach for his glass of water. Ned did not opt for the pajamas. Ned did not leave his desk. Ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

A million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. If I make myself known now, he’d be immensely embarrassed and angry that I had just violated his privacy. But if I *didn’t* speak up now, chances are I’d have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. So I was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while Ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. It felt like I was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

My hands began to cramp as I awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn’t generate an ounce of noise. My legs began to jitter as I compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as I waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell I was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

After Ned’s satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a Kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that I had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

Ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and I had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. All critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until I remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. But with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would I get the phone out my pocket? Somehow I did, and I texted Ethan in the next room over:

&gt; foogama: In Ned’s closet. Was trying to do Medium Pace gag. Ned started wanking before I could start. Now I’m stuck in the closet and can’t get out. Need help.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethan: LOL right.
&gt; 
&gt; foogama: Ethan, I’m dead serious. I need you to help create a distraction for Ned so that I can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethan: …we’re going to need to have a talk later.

Right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). It was 10:45pm on a Thursday, but I could hear Ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **“HELLO? WHY YES NED IS HERE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NED! NED COME HERE, PHONE FOR YOU!”** Ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. How this never raised suspicion, I’ll never know. It was a cordless phone. There was no need for Ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. But thank god he did. I bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and Ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

I was forever in debt to Ethan for saving my ass, and we never told Ned. That is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in Ned’s wedding. There was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we “found interesting” about Ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, I was convinced by Ethan to write “That he enjoys anal sex with large black women” because it would make a fun “bachelor story” over 10 years after the fact.

But of course that’s not what happened. The best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we’d be reading the bride’s, and they’d be reading Ned’s. And of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. I didn’t even know her name. I had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

The bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. Ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. He immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. I immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. Ethan and I waited for Ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. We were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – Hid in my roommate’s closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride’s best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

I've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

EDIT: Thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for Ned. Ned is a really great guy and I'm sure we'll be fine.

EDIT 2: I got ""Ethan"" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. You can [find his comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

3,"TIFU by accidentally branding the shape of a penis onto my arm


This didn’t happen today but about 3 weeks ago, but the fuck up is just now starting to show itself. The original idea was to brand myself with an arrow, because why not, it’d be badass. So everything is bought; the branding iron, cleaning supplies, and alcohol. I’m obviously not going to stick a hot piece of metal to my arm sober, so I proceed to get shit faced. So after heating it up in the fire and actually going through with it. Everything’s fine, it looks like and arrow and besides being slightly off center of the lines we drew out it’s looking pretty good. We clean it, wrap it up, and head inside to call it a night. Now here we are, about 3 weeks later and you can’t even see an arrow from the place we stuck the actual brand, but a dick shaped burn all around where it’s supposed to be. I’m not sure if the arrow is going to reappear once it starts healing some more, but I really doubt it and I’ll probably be stuck with a dick shaped brand on my arm for the rest of my life. 

TL;DR 
Tried branding the shape of an arrow onto my arm, now it looks like a penis

4,"TIFU by explaining to my 9 year old what prostitution is


So this happened yesterday. Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee's and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought "" Heck yeah, I'm totally winning as a Dad right now"". So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it's subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying ""Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit"" as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says ""Dad, what's prostitution?"" To which I responded ""Oh, it's just a form of business that some people choose to do""....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says ""Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution"" My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.

TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me."

6,"TIFU by eating frozen breakfast burritos before a wedding.


Now, my guilty pleasure are those frozen breakfast burritos you get for like $5 for 8 at the grocery store.   Sausage, potatoes, eggs, and cheese wrap up in floury deliciousness.  I usually get them once a month when I stop by the grocery store after the gym.  

Well today, I burned through my saturday morning workout quickly since I had a wedding to get to and didn't want to waste time before heading over to pick up my girlfriend.  So I picked up some burritos from the grocery store to eat as breakfast since I knew I wouldn't get to eat again until 4ish.   

My first fuckup was eating all 8 of them.   They were just so good.   I was reading and didn't realize I had eaten all 8 of them even though you had to cook them individually.   Oops.   


So this wedding was out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Pennsylvania, nice town though, pretty but middle of nowhere.   We get there after a nice 2 hour drive and lots of Sheetz coffee (fuck up number 2).   


Wedding went well, was at this farm, cabin type place off a river, the reception was at the outbuilding.   The odd thing was this place didn't have a bathroom.  They had two porta-potties, a men's and a women's room type deal.  They weren't the nice ones, but the nicer ones that ""flush"" by having a sort of lid that acts as the bottom of the bowl so you can't see the shit and it keeps the smell down.   Had fun at the reception, cut a few rugs, ate lots of food, drank lots of liquor because they only had bud light cans for beer.    Was going well but my stomach was not happy.  


After all of the breakfast burritos were forced through by the coffee, gin and tonics, and mediocre wedding food, the burritos were ready to pop.    I couldn't hold it anymore.  And it isn't like we could drive down the road to a sheetz or anything, since again, this is middle of nowhere.    I had to shit, I had to shit now, and it was going to happen in the porta-potties.  


It's a nasty, awful, moist shit that looks like uncooked brownie batter.  I feel amazing after.    Like a shower after a week in the woods relieved.  I had the sweats but felt like I could beat up Arnold Schwarzenegger.    Then I looked and realized I had to flush this monstrocity.  


The porta-potty wouldn't accept it.  The lid, bowl thing only went down a little to let stuff in.   It kept running over it with the blue liquid, but it wasn't moving.  It was caked on there.   It then dawned on me.  


I just clogged a porta-potty.  


Well shit, I decide I don't really know these people, I'll just pretend it wasn't me.   I leave.....and there's a line.  

First in line is the father of the bride.  


I mumble a ""it's broken"" and shuffle away in shame and defeat.  


Find my girlfriend, pretend everything is fine and say we should probably get going (she drove, I was not drinking and driving, this isn't THAT kind of fuckup, seriously, don't drink and drive!).   

So everything seems good on MY end, which is great, except I sort of ruined the wedding.  


I heard through the grapevine they had to close that porta-potty.   So they had one porta-potty for a ~75 person wedding.   Apparently the cabin farm barn thing had toilets too that the wedding party was using, but for everyone else they had one option.   Coupled this with the fact it was far from the hotels and people decided to start leaving.  


**TL:DR**  I literally caused a wedding to end 2+ hours early because I clogged a porta-potty full of frozen breakfast burrito shit burritos.  "
7,"TIFU by lighting a jar of peanut butter on fire


I work as a nanny on weekday afternoons for two elementary-aged girls, and as part of this make them a snack when we get home from school. Today the older of the two wanted apples and peanut butter, so I go to get the jar of peanut butter from the fridge, only to find the fridge has been turned up and the peanut butter is frozen. Not a problem, I’ll just stick it in the microwave for 10 seconds and soften it up. I put it in, start it, and turn around to continue cutting up the apples, and no less than 6 seconds later the girls start screaming bloody murder and pointing. I spin around and see that the jar of peanut butter is on fire. I snatch the microwave door open and the flame immediately goes out, but the girls have already started crying, their two dogs are barking, the house smells like burnt plastic, and one side of the jar is black and melted. I was completely at a loss for words and stood there, mouth open, trying to process. I eventually calmed the girls down and realized the microwave was fine and it hadn’t been as big of a fire as I thought, but they’ve told me I’m never allowed to microwave anything for them and I guarantee the first thing they told their parents over dinner was how their nanny started a kitchen fire. 

TL;DR I microwaved a jar of peanut butter to soften it, it caught on fire in front of the kids I nanny, they are scared of the microwave now

*edits:
 I know not to microwave plastic for long periods, it was for 10 seconds, not long enough to melt it.

The fire was from tin foil left on the rim

Natural peanut butter needs to be refrigerated since it has no preservatives (although I buy the chemical shit and never put it in the fridge, I agree with you who think that it’s weird)"

9,"TIFU by exploding a car battery in my laundry room


Truly a tifu, as I was dealing with the aftermath this morning at around 1:30AM. Let's set the stage, shall we?

Towards the end of the summer my boat would no longer hold a charge on it's battery. Thinking the battery was the problem I pulled it out and replaced it with a new one. That one lasted about a week, so I tracked the problem down to  a corroded wire on the motor. Problem solved, old battery left as backup in the garage.

Fast forward to late October, start bringing stuff in before the cold hits. Batteries always go down to the laundry room for trickle-charging during the winter. Seeing how the charging circuit was faulty I figured I would put the old battery back in rotation for charging. Its turn came due about 2 days ago. Clamp the leads onto the terminals, show a good draw on the meter, away it goes.

So that brings us to this morning. I get roused from bed by the smoke detector downstairs. Start running around assessing each room and stop at the laundry room door. That's where I was greeted by a cloud of toxic gas. 

About a quarter of the top of the battery had blow off, as well as a good chunk in the front, where it was drooling black fluid. After running around opening windows to clear it out I got down to the task of clean-up, which at this point was a surprisingly small amount of acid on the wall behind the battery, and a little on the bench and floor.

Here's where the tifu multiplies. At this point I had been cleaning up in my boxer briefs and bare feet. I grab the battery by the handle, lift it slightly to make sure it will hold, and then swing it around and down to my side. This is when the one side of the battery decides to let go and splash the rest of its contents onto my leg and the floor. Again, boxer briefs and that's it.

After a little bit of freaking out (and ow, ow), I got the acid rinsed off and finished the rest of the clean-up still in my briefs, but now sporting a pair of rubber boots.


TLDR: I exploded a battery in my laundry room at 130am and tried to clean it up wearing only my boxers.

Edit: missed some details on the battery explosion.

10,"TIFU by not knowing what cracked olives are


This will be quick, and although it isn't as monumental as some of the things here I'm still pissed off at my stupidity. Oh, and it's happened this second because I'm still eating...

I love olives possibly more than any other food. I eat them everyday. Earlier, I bought a pack of ""cracked"" green olives in a chili and garlic vinaigrette that looked like they'd go amazingly with my tuna salad. I make my salad at work and add in all the ingredients: spinach, avo, red peppers, tuna and then the olives. Can't wait to eat this bad boy! 

Maybe I was too excited, maybe I'm just dumb, but I simply assumed the cracked olives were the same as pitted which I found out in the worst way possible after my first bite and I crunched down on a huge olive pit. 

My jaw is fucking sore and after I finish my salad I'll need to inspect if I've cracked a tooth or not. 

TL;DR: I don't know olives as well as I thought I did. I'm an idiot 

EDIT: Cracked olives are olives that have been cut open but not pitted, so they still contain pits - must have been created for easier ""self-pitting"" - or, as pointed out, to let them marinate "
