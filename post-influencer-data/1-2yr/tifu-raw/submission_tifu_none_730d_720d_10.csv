0,"TIFU by buying a used PlayStation 2 on Letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.


This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.


*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.


TL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

Edit: Hi, Reddit! I just wanted to say many thanks for the gold AND all the offers for cockroach-free PlayStations!  warms my heart, and I'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. Happy Redditing!"

2,"TIFU by going on the wrong date


So I match with this cute girl from tinder. The conversation is flowing and I suggest we go out for drinks this past Friday. She agrees and we set the time and place. 

When I arrive at the bar 10 minutes early i try to see if she already arrived and I see her standing by the bar. She made eye contact with me and I greeted her. We started talking for quite sometime and I was getting weird vibes from her so I suggested we go grab something to eat. We get out and as I see her more clearly under the street light I exclaim ""you don't look anything like your tinder profile pictures"". That's when it hits me... This is not the girl I had a date with and just straight up hit on some random girl. I try to ask ""you are not Melanie (name altered)"" and she seems pissed of that I don't remember her name but I'm more confused than ever. 

I look at my phone and see 5 angry text messages and 3 missed calls. 

My new date didn't find it amusing and lost interest and my original date wants nothing to do with me. 

Spend the rest of the night eating take out pizza and watching Netflix 

TL;DR: accidentally hit on a girl in a bar that looked like my tinder date. Fucked up both dates. "
3,"TIFU by accidentally activating the Emergency Lockdown alarm at my school on my second day as a student teacher


This happened yesterday. For those of you who don't know, Pre-Student teaching comes just one semester before student teaching. Essentially, I have to observe in a classroom for 80 hours total. Beyond observation, I will eventually teach some lessons. This was on my second day of observation.

On my first day my coordinating teacher (CT) had me simply observe her class, telling me that she would ease me into the way she does things before letting me teach a few things to her classes. 

As I was only 5 minutes into my second day, I was still just observing, sitting at her desk. Now, this is important. She's having me sit at her official desk while she walks around the room and stands at an informal monitor setup. Yippee, I feel important (not really).

So while she explains to her class what they will be doing for the day, I just watch and fiddle around a little at her desk. I was absent-mindedly running my hands along the bottom of the drawer of her desk, and just passing the time. I felt something with one of my fingers and pressed it in, without thinking it was anything other than a latch or something for the drawer. Oh my fuck, was I wrong. Now, the second I felt the thing I touched actually compress, I knew I fucked up.

Cue the loudest fucking alarm you've ever heard in your life. Now this isn't a constant tone, but rather a constant message, stating the following: 

""EMERGENCY. EMERGENCY. PROCEED TO EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN. THERE IS A THREAT IN THE BUILDING. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ALERTED AND IS ON THE WAY""

I damn near shit my pants, the students all start freaking out, most assuming it was an impromptu drill, and my CT immediately runs to the door, locks it, and shuts the blinds. 

Instantly I try to motion to her that it was me, but she runs back to her computer. As it turns out, a school-wide email was also sent to each teacher, telling them exactly where the alarm was coming from. 

Go figure, my CT saw that it was coming from her own room. She then finally turned to me and saw the look of horror on my face. She then spent the next 5 minutes trying to alert the main office that it was, in fact, a false alarm. In the first few minutes of the 5, a police officer arrived to confirm that it was just some dumbass (me) who had set it off.

I spent the rest of the day completely red-faced whenever near any of the faculty and I was appropriately poked fun at by all of them. 

At least I came away with a story that my university professor says is ""one that I doubt will ever be topped"".

TL;DR I pressed a button under my desk that I didn't know existed, setting off a school-wide alarm used for active shooters.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! It's my first. Glad I could share a neat/funny story. 
"
4,"TIFU by taking an UBER.


So a college friend recently bought a new place with his wife in his wife’s hometown, and invited a bunch of us to spend the weekend. 

I road trip over to suburbia with my buddy, and, through a series of wrong turns and detours, we were last to arrive. We don’t stop at the house first, and meet my friends out at a “Main Street” type bar that looked like it was filled with the whole town’s drinking age population. 

We booze, chat, and everything is great. As is typical of my friend group, people filter out at different times. Everyone is heading back to the couple’s house for extended shenanigans. 

I’m many drinks deep at this point and chatting up a few people, so I’m the last to leave. I’m not too concerned, because apparently we’re only a few miles away from my buddy’s place. I text for the address, order an Uber, go outside and wait. It’s pouring and at least ten other people are waiting for cars. I see a black Camry pull up on my app, see the back Camry on the corner, run over and ask the driver if it’s my car, hear an inaudible mumble that sounds like yes, decide that’s good enough for me, and jump in. We get into a five minute convo about how terrible the weather is while we drive to my friend’s house. 

Driver stops at a generic suburban house with a long drive way, says this is you, and I get out. It’s pouring harder. I run through the rain. See lights on in the house. Hear music playing. Knock twice to be polite. I expect it to be unlocked, as my friend said they’d leave the door open, so I immediately let myself in. Walk down a few flights of steps toward the noise, arrive in what looks like a den, and say hello. 

Then the screaming starts. SCREAMING. I’m momentarily confused why there are screams of terror, but then I realize - I have no fucking idea who these people are. 

Drunk and confused, I have absolutely no clue what to do. I decide I need to get out and turn around and run outside, to the end of the driveway and stand there, in the rain. I look down at my phone to text my friends, and see I have several missed calls. 

The gears start to turn, but before I could work it out one of the guys who was in the house comes out and starts yelling at me from the end of the long driveway asking what the hell I am doing, and tells me the cops are on their way and he’ll kill me if I come any closer. 

Simultaneously, another car pulls up, this one with guy in it.  He gets out of the car, surveys the scene, and goes “dude, I think you got into my Uber.”

Finally, everything makes sense. Now while I’m explaining what happened to the new arrival, so he could tell his friends I’m not a murderer and just a drunk asshole, the cops arrive. 

Luckily they got a kick out of it. 

TL;DR I got into the wrong Uber, and accidentally walked into a stranger’s house, almost got killed and got the cops called on me.  "
5,"TIFU, the story of how I was rescued from death by my school bully


So a few weeks ago, me and the boys decided to have a nice little gathering and crack open a few cold ones round the fire. 
I had told my parents I would be back at 10, but didn't specify to them that I meant AM not PM, and that was my first mistake. 

Upon arriving at my friend's house, the clock drew 8:00, and I got a call from my parents asking if I was still coming home at 10... in the evening. Immediately, I tried to bargain, but to no avail (thus is the life of a teen raised by strict parents). They told me I would have to get a lift back home, but due to nobody being able to do such a thing, they said I would have to walk.
Angrily, I packed my things, drank one last coldie, said goodbye to the boys, and set off into the beyond.

To set the scene: my friend's house was in a town, surrounded on all sides by rolling fields and musty forests, and it was 6 miles away and 4 villages from my house.
I left the town, setting off at a brisk jog as the sun began to set. By 9:00 I had passed through Village 1 and made it safely to Village 2, by which point everything was grey. The sun had set, and night was on it's way. Feeling already defeated, and only 1 mile into my trek - I asked for a lift from a stranger, to which he replied ""fuck off"".

So at this point i'm just wandering country roads on my way home, but decide to take a shortcut to pass time. 
And this is where I fucked up.
I took a right turn after Village 2, and walked through endless fields, stood in fox shit, got cut all up my arms and legs (I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts) by tall reeds and thistles, and I got well and truly lost. 

By this point, 10:30, I had missed my deadline to return home, and was in the middle of nowhere in complete darkness - the only lights being the far away orange glimmer of Villages 3 and 4, and my hometown. It was still miles away.
Nevertheless, semi-drunk me thought he knew his bearings, and wandered aimlessly for another full hour, falling into ditches and getting caked in mud, until my iPod's battery finally died and my one source of light faded away.
I was next to a motorway, and I thought I was on the right side of it, however my home was across the sea of traffic (not really a sea, more of a stream due to the late night drivers). 

I decided against running across the motorway, because at this point I thought I was on the right side of it anyway. 
I eventually stumbled through a small forest and ended up in a cornfield. So bearing in mind, it's now 11:30PM, it's pitch black, and I can only see about 2 feet in front of me... oh yeah and i'm in a fucking cornfield.
So I continued my Outlast 2 journey, wandering through this massive maze of maize, until I heard rustling.
Barks soon followed, and I heard the padding of desperate hungry feet behind me.
""FUCK!""

I remember screaming, I ran faster than I ever had, as the barks of dogs chasing me grew louder and louder - and they were big fucking dogs, we're talking bloodthirsty Great Dames.
I was heading towards a tree, my only safety, when a blaring light shone across the corn, illuminating me and the dogs that now ran towards the source.
""OI! WHO THE FUCKS THAT!""

They thought I was a poacher - the farmer's wife and the farmer - but even after telling them that I was merely a lost crybaby 17 year old boy who wanted to go home (and had pissed himself) they still refused to give me a lift home. 
Until...
""Who are you talking to, Mum?""
A voice sounded to her left.
""Some boy, he's lost.""
""What's his name?""
She told him my name, to which he replied with a laugh.
Long story short; I had ran onto the farm of my school bully's property, and after giving me a full-on fucking roasting, he and his mum drove me home at 00:00. 
I stumbled in, covered in my own piss, tears, fox shit, thistles, reeds, mud, and pollen (giving me a very nasty allergy and forcing my left eye shut). 
I didn't even talk to my parents, who didn't even ask if I was okay, and fell asleep.



Tl;dr: I walked home from a party, got lost, chased by dogs, and was rescued by my school bully.

Edit: numerous people complained about a lack of paragraphs so I have added them in, very sorry everyone. I was going to edit out ""Dames"" to ""Danes"" but apparently the misspelling is quite funny so i'm gonna leave it.

Thank you so much for giving me gold, this is my first proper post that took effort to type so i'm quite gobsmacked it was gilded, thanks again! :)"

7,"TIFU by accidentally circumcising myself


So this did actually happen today, albeit very early in the morning.



Matched with a girl on tinder late one night, after a couple messages back and forth she ""persuades"" me that it's a good idea for her to come over. Not really thinking much of it, think to myself 'yeah sure let's get laid'. I make a point to always mention beforehand that I'm uncircumcised (being from the US, I've never had sex with a girl who knew what an uncircumcised dick even looked like) and she's fine with it.



Cue having sexy times, and she is really good at giving head. Like, really good. Like, so good that when she bites my tip just a little, I have to make her stop, but only for about one whole second. Everything else goes about as expected.



The next day I'm going to take my morning pee, and it hurts. Not like a 'STD sting' hurt, it is fucking excruciating to pull the head back to pee. Upon closer inspection, I notice it's because my head is *literally detached a little bit from my foreskin* I'm dumbfounded. 'She didn't bite that hard' I think to myself, it was more of a playful scratch if anything.



So I text her. We had planned on doing it again, but I had to let her know that I had a tear on my dick, and it might be a while. She's really sorry, and this is where I discover the real culprit *she has a diamond stud on one of her teeth* so I had received fellatio and had my dick torn by a diamond.



This was all roughly two weeks ago. I could pee and masturbate without any problem or pain very shortly after, so I think I must be in the clear. We arrange for another late night hookup



Fast forward to that hookup very early this morning, and when I attempt penetration, up roars the fierce foreskin pain once again, like it had just happened, even though it had been two weeks. I figure 'well I'm here and I'm sure as shit gonna give this a go, or my name ain't Traceur98'



So while I am having a fine and dandy time in doggy position, tinder girl stops me, and quietly, almost whispers, ""I think you tore me"". Turning on the lights reveals that sure enough, there is blood coming out of her, on my member, and especially on my bed. She begins to apologize profusely, she's so sorry, this has never happened before, she doesn't know how it's even this much, and I say everything is okay, just hop in the shower and I'll clean up.



After she's hopped out, and drained a noticeable amount of blood into my shower drain, I hop in as well, and it hits me like a brick wall.



*that's not her blood, that's mine*



I ask her to come into the bathroom and show her the now puddle of blood in my tub coming from the now very severed head of my penis. I assure her I feel fine and that it's not her fault (she's almost in tears at this point) and that I'll just clean up a bit, and that it might be the last time I have sex for a while.



My doctors appointment is tomorrow. This will be a joy to explain

TL:DR Tinder girl blows me with a diamond stud, rips my peepee, the next time we have sex, makes a bigger rip in my peepee."

So im in the shower singing along to an acoustic version of Sweet Child of Mine with Slash and Myles Kennedy. I reach for the bottle of shower gel, its almost empty but no biggy, il swing it a few times to force the remaints to the bottom of the bottle.

First swing... no shower gel.. second swing.. nothing. But its OK. IM A MAAANNNN, IM GONNA SWING THE SHIT OUTTA THIS BITCH...

So, grabbing the bottle by the end with both hands, I raise it above my head and swing down with all my strength... connecting sweetly with my flacid penis and saggy shower balls...

I spent the next five minutes bent over emmiting a queer shriek, which was somewhere between pain and laughter as i comprehended my own stupidity. 

TL;DR Shower gel bottle was empty... tried to force the last out..Swung it into my balls. "
9,"TIFU by not wearing a bra while cooking. NSFW-ish?


So, this actually happened last night while cooking dinner. 

A little preface here. As a kid I wad always skinny. Like, really skinny, lanky and just kinda awkward. I'm in my 30s now and over the last five years or so my boobs have gotten big. Way bigger than they ever were even in my 20s and somehow I've not gotten used to them. They get in the way often. Ok, on to the story.

My bf got off of work a little late last night so I went to sleep. I had promised to cook though, so I asked him to call me when he was on the way home so I could get up to start dinner. He did. I was a little groggy and just threw on a wife beater and shorts when I got outta bed. No bra. He gets home, I happily have 3 pots almost finished on the stove. One of them is kinda tall as its a steamer pot. It was on the front burner and done. Steaming the hell out of my rice and veggies,  just as it should. I stand on my tiptoes to reach the dial to turn it off. OVER the pot. WHY I wouldn't MOVE a giant steaming pot first is a mystery to me. My common sense failed as did the small support offered by my tanktop. My left nipple landed square on the lip of the pot. I dropped my beer, fell to my knees and almost threw up. Couldn't scream. Couldnt move. Couldn't think. It was like blue lightening. Pain, pain and more pain. It took me a minute to regain my faculties. When I finally did I put a cold compress on it and took some advil. I sat on the couch, holding my burnt but now cold boob, in stunned silence for a long time. My bf finished taking the pots off the stove...

Today, it looks a lil like a brand. Its a straight line of burn, right across the left side of my areola, pretty dark colored but not blistered, thank God. Still taking advil cause anything that rubs against it is a whole new, fun ride.  It's an idiot reminder I'll have for a while, too. Not that I need one. It was a hard lesson that I wont be forgetting any time soon. My bf offered to kiss it better. Yeahhh, no. Not for a while. 

TL;DR Didn't wear a bra while cooking and made crispy nipple for dinner."
10,"TIFU by shutting down a server in another country.


Obligatory this didn't happen today but roughly a year ago.

I worked for a large world-wide company in one of their remote location branches on a small island. Because of the size of the island I live on they couldn't have a disaster recovery location that is far enough away from their office so their servers are all located and managed by another one of their offices in the UK.

I had to do some work on one of the servers to amend a user's permissions for a folder on the network which was no problem, done it many times before.

Now for the fuck up. As some of you may know, there is a slight delay when you're using a remote connection onto another device (roughly 1/2  a second in this case). Once I'd finished what I needed to do I pressed the start menu, moved my mouse down to the 'log out' button and clicked. Unfortunately I hadn't accounted for the delay and the mouse moved a bit further than I thought and by the time the click came through, it was over the 'shut down' option. As much as I frantically tried to click cancel it was too late. The server shut off almost immediately.

I then had to have a very awkward conversation with my manager and a phone call to the guys in the UK asking them to turn the server back on and explain why it was an unauthorized shutdown.

tl;dr - Didn't account for the delay on a remote connection to a server stored across the Irish Sea, shut it down instead taking our network shares down for about an hour.

EDIT : RIP inbox.

A few common questions or statements to clear up;

* No the server didn't prompt for a confirmation for a shutdown - I literally had about 1/2 a second before it went off

* Yes the delay was quite high and no I don't know why but that's how it's always been when I remote anywhere off of the island

* I understand now that there are keyboard shortcuts or better ways to go about logging out of a server but at the time I was just out of a very junior apprentice technician role where I was basically a dogs body for the company so I had very little administrator experience at this point. I appreciate most of you are trying to help me prevent this fuck up from happening again and I thank you for it but I've seen about 5/6 comments about the same few methods which has just kind of flooded my inbox.

EDIT 2: A few people seem to be doubting the credibility of my story. I can't tell you why it didn't prompt for a shutdown, I can't tell you what sort of server it was. All I know is that it was either 2k8 or 2k12 (we had a mix and I honestly can't remember which one this was). I was not an admin by any means - I worked in a first/second line support role where we occasionally had to do some work on various servers. Believe me or don't, doesn't really matter because what happened, happened."
11,"TIFU by borrowing my mom's car


OK, not exactly ""borrowing"" and not exactly ""today."" This was over 30 years ago, the summer between my freshman and sophomore years of high school. I remember it like it was today. A whole lotta fuckups in this one. 

A few things to consider: At 14 years old, I was five foot nothing and about 90 pounds. My mother's car was a 1983 Mercury Grand Marquis Colony Park station wagon. To me, it might as well have been the Titanic. Oh, and my parents were into grounding/restriction as punishment. This was well before the era of timeouts. 

Now the story: I was already grounded for sneaking into my mother's sewing room in the middle of the night and talking on the phone. But, being the stupid 14-year-old know-it-all that I was, this particular night I was back in there on the phone, talking to a girl that my parents did not like or approve of me dating. She was a bit of a rebel and a bad influence on me, as this episode will prove.

She asked me if I'd ever driven before, and of course I hadn't since I was only 14. She then dared me to ""borrow"" my mother's car and drive the 12 miles from my house to hers. It was almost 2 AM, about the time all the bars in town closed up and the drunks did their best to avoid the cops as they drove home. I told her I didn't know if it was a good idea.

She then double dog dared me. Now, as you may or may not know, there is no getting out of a double dog dare. I told her I would agree ""against my better judgement."" I took her car key and house key out of her purse, and and I was on my way. I had been watching my mother and father drive and figured, how hard can it be? I didn't know how to adjust the seat. I didn't take into account the fact that I had never seen him drive her car.

I knew how to get to her town, but I wasn't 100% sure on the streets in her neighborhood. This was well before the era of GPS and cell phones. She lived on the end of her short (3 houses) street, and any cars going towards her house would shine their headlights right into her mom's bedroom window. I figured I would do the ""smart"" thing and back down the street to avoid this problem. Of course, since I'd never driven before, I only used the rear view mirror and didn't look at the side mirrors once.

That is until I heard and felt metal on metal. It took me a few seconds to realize what I had done and to stop the car. There, directly alongside me, was another car that I hadn't noticed on the side of the street. I went into mini-panic mode and pulled forward a little too quickly. More metal crunching. I steered toward the middle of the street and backed into her driveway.

She came outside and reached for the car door. It wouldn't open. Back door, same thing. She climbed in through the driver side and we took off. I was too scared to be pissed off or to think clearly, but she made me stop and pick up the decorative molding pieces from the passenger side of the car. 

We ended up in the parking lot of a fast food place. She couldn't get her door open from the inside, either. She helped me try to reattach the molding to the car. Here we are, two 14-year-olds with no tools and no auto repair experience, at 2:30 in the morning in a fast food parking lot, trying to make a car look like it hasn't been in an accident. All of a sudden, I heard her scream, ""FUCK!"" and watched as she flung these pieces of my mother's car into the street. She climbed back in and calmly said, ""Take me home.""

She directed me a different way into her neighborhood so the headlights didn't shine into her mother's bedroom window as we got to her house. We got out, she kissed me on the cheek, and said, ""Good luck."" And she was gone.

I was in full panic mode at this point and practically flew home. At one point I was doing 90 in a 35 on a bridge that stands close to 100 feet above a river and a canal and has a railroad crossing (at-grade, not under the bridge) before a steep climb to a traffic signal. All I saw was the green light, and I gunned it.

I can only imagine what it looked like from the outside, this boat of a station wagon bouncing across two sets of railroad tracks. I was extremely glad that my mother always insisted on the use of seatbelts. I felt the car bottom out at least twice before I got up the hill to the light, which had by this time turned red. I took a deep breath and waited for it to change.

I got home just after 3. I put the car in the driveway as best as I could, but I knew that my dad would know when he got home from work in five hours or so that something wasn't right. I didn't want to look at the passenger side of the car again. I went in the house through the back door, put my mom's keys back, and went to bed. I couldn't sleep.

Sure enough, around 8:20, my dad walked in the house, woke everyone, and yelled, ""What the hell happened to the car?"" My sister, 13, and my brother, 11, obviously couldn't have done it. My mother would've said something to him. That left me, and I tried to play innocent, but I've never been a very good liar.

The repairs were close to six hundred dollars (which, for a jobless 14-year-old in the mid-80s, may as well have been a million). Bodywork, paint, rear bumper, muffler and tailpipe, rear suspension. I became one of those kids who haul a lawnmower around the neighborhood offering to cut grass for five or ten bucks. Eventually, I made enough to pay my dad back.

Oh, yeah, a couple things that I failed to mention. This took place on my dad's birthday. What a perfect gift!

The car that I sideswiped, as it turned out, belonged to my brother's godfather. I actually heard him say, ""Oh, don't worry about it. I'll just blame my neighbor. Her daughter is quite the rule breaker, and it's only a matter of time anyway."" He was talking about the girl that I had stolen the car to come to visit in the first place!

Last thing: my parents refused to let me get my license until I turned 18 as part of my punishment. I had to ""learn to drive"" in the car that they bought for my little sister. 

TL;DR - Stole my mom's car at 14 in the middle of the night, sideswiped another car, bottomed out mom's car, tried lying about it, lost 2 years of driving privileges."
