0,"TIFU by plagiarizing my last essay in college and getting expelled.


It was for my last gen-ed, a simple 500 word essay. I wanted to go out that night so I said fuck it and copied a wikipedia paragraph and changed it up. I thought it was good enough to pass turnitin, apparently not. Its up to the teacher to determine what punishment I could have gotten. She sent me to the dean with the recommendation that I be expelled. Now the dean told me I can't graduate. I spent 4 years working on an engineering degree. I have over $100,000 in loans, and I can't be hired without my degree. My life literally vanished in the matter of 20 minutes.

Worst part was that I could have taken a 0 on the assignment and still passed with a B. 

TLDR: Got kicked out of school for plagiarizing my last college essay which I could have taken a 0 on."
1,"TIFU with a jug of tea and a jug of ancient spit/urine


TIFU, To begin my harrowing tale you must know I spend anywhere from 3 to 5 days a week in a pickup running around several western states doing my job as a heavy construction company consultant. These days are usually a minimum of 6 hours on the road, but usually are more like 8-10.

When you’re spending these kind of hours on the road with tight deadlines and appointments that have to be met, you find shortcuts and time savers. One of mine is mastering the art of pissing in a jug.

On top of this I chew tobacco religiously, usually one or two tins of the stuff a day. That being said when you have a full bottle of spit, it’s much nicer to pour it in the piss jug than it is to pour it out the window and end up with redneck racing stripes down the side.

Usually these jugs get tossed after a day, 2 tops but sometimes stuff just slips through the cracks. This was one of those times.

Today I used my extra personal vehicle for work, company truck was in the shop and no way I’m taking a nice rig on some of the roads my line of work takes me. It has been around 8 months since I used this vehicle last, and in a perfectly sized little cubby behind the passenger seat there is a shelf just right to hold a gallon jug.

Fast forward to tonight, and I’m just driving back from a really shitty day. Windows down, Foghat blaring, I reach behind the seat to grab my gallon of sweet tea, spin the lid off, and take a gulp.

I literally almost died.

The putridity of this concoction could not be replicated in a CIA biological weapons lab. It was exactly how you’d expect 8 month old urine and dip spit left in a hot truck cab would smell and taste, but worse. Oh so much worse. A chunk from a strange gelatinous skin that had formed on the surface bounced in my mouth and into my throat. The projectile vomit that ensued immediately caused me to fully stomp the breaks taking a 1 ton truck from 65 to a dead stop in what has to be record time. I smashed the grill and took out 2 linear posts jerking onto the road shoulder.

That wasn’t nearly the worst damage.

My sudden vomit and violent breaking caused the jug to go flying into the dashboard, smashing and spraying a geyser of this unspeakably evil fluid all over me and the interior of the truck.

It was physically undriveable. Years on a farm gave me a strong stomach, but this was impossible. Period. The smell from my clothes made me retch uncontrollably, and it took a solid 20 minutes of stripping and puking by the roadside until I was able to control it long enough to get a pair of overalls from my trailer, even still my skin that had been exposed to the biohazard had an oily stench that remained.

I unhooked the trailer, called our wrecker, and had them tow it to the shop. The wrecker driver drove us back without a word, though albeit a green face and the windows fully rolled down in 45 degrees drizzly weather.

I sprayed out the interior of the truck with a pressure washer, but I fear even that isn’t enough to remove the permanent, permeating soiling the truck received. I’m 4 showers in and there is still remaining smell on my body. I’m beginning to believe this is a job more suited for a priest than hot water. As for the clothes I was wearing? They’re getting about 3 gallons of diesel and a match tomorrow morning. There is nothing salvageable there. Nothing.

TL;DR drank ancient piss and tobacco spit, almost died and witnessed firsthand the worst smell ever to grace the face of this earth."
2,"TIFU by not cleaning up after a LAN party


So this happened about a month ago and I'm writing this now because I had a nightmare about it last night. 
I invited 3 of my buddies over to my house for a LAN party, and I prepared for it with tons of snacks and alcohol. I even went and bought a different friend's old Xbox One off him just so I could stop feeling left out (I was a PC and PS4 person beforehand with no one to play with :[ ). The night went extremely well, and in fact, it was one of the best nights I've had in a while. We stayed up all night drinking and playing Monster Hunter, PuBG, and Fortnite in my basement where I have a man cave set up. 
Now, I am NOT a drinker. I probably drink a beer about once a month when I'm super bored. My friends always joke about it by asking me if the beer in my fridge is the beer they brought over a month ago (it is, but I don't admit it lol). So when I woke up that next morning, I awoke with the biggest hangover I've ever had. I essentially slept through that entire next day on my couch. The thought of cleaning up the beer, liquor, and soda bottles, along with all the chips, dip, and salsa strewn around me didn't even cross my mind, let alone getting off the couch. I just locked the basement door that day (so my SO didn't see the tornado wreck in there) and tried sleeping off my hangover. I figured I would clean it up the next day and no harm would be done. 
Well, actually, a few days go by and I go down into the basement to clean up. To my surprise, I found the door unlocked and slightly ajar. I just figured that I had forgot to lock the door. I was hungover after all and my SO would have said something if it was her. While I'm cleaning, I noticed that my gaming desk was surprisingly clean, which wasn't right because I had definitely spilled crumbs and alcohol all over it two days ago. I credited my dog Rex for the cleanup of my desk and just continued cleaning. After finally finishing, I sat down at my gaming desk and prepared to hunt some beasts with a buddy on Monster Hunter. To my surprise, however, my Xbox wouldn't turn on! I tried plugging it into a different wall outlet but it still refused to turn on. I tried turning on my Xbox manually by pressing the button on it instead of using the controller, but again, it didn't work. Then, I noticed that the power brick had no light on. ""Well at least I narrowed the problem down to the power block."" I thought to myself as I grabbed the block and unhooked it from the Xbox and outlet. That was my biggest mistake. Right as I unhooked the block from the wall, I felt a burning sensation all over my hand. When I looked down, I saw the most horrifying sight of my entire life. 
ANTS! ANTS!! ANTS!!!! Hundreds, thousands of tiny ants were pouring out of the power brick! So many, in fact, that I couldn't even see the brick. On top of that, I could barely see my fingers. I was holding it in a cradle fashion so the brick was touching my stomach/chest area as well. Ants were swarming my hands, arms, chest, and pants at this point! As soon as I realized what was happening, I literally jumped up in the air (dropping the block of course, scattering at least 1000 more ants all across the floor) while shouting ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!"" I shook my hand hard while using the other to swipe off as many as I could. Then, still screaming and swearing at the top of my lungs, I proceeded to literally rip off my clothes while simultaneously running up the stairs. My SO and Rex had just run over to the top of the basement stairs when they saw me screaming, running, and tearing my clothes off. I ran up those stairs so fast and I plowed right through them as they both let out little yelps as they fell down on opposite sides of me. I proceeded into the garage and grabbed the bug spray. It said it was for flying insects but I figured it would work anyways, and thank God it did. I sprayed my arms and brushed off the last remaining ants. I stood there, catching my breath and watched the remaining ants as they shriveled up and died. I was furious. I always got and hated the feeling of something crawling on my skin when watching insect documentaries and such but this time, it was real. And they killed my Xbox. Now, I was going to kill them all. As I went inside with the can of bug spray and a rubber mallet in hand, I heard a scream at the top of the basement stairs and then proceeded to get plowed over by my SO and Rex (guess I deserved that). She ran upstairs into our bedroom with Rex in her arms and hid in there with him for the next few hours. I got back up and proceeded to spray my pants which where lying on the basement stairs and then went into the basement to unleash vengeance. I moved slowly inward determined not to miss a single ant. I smashed all the stragglers with the mallet before moving on to their base of operations, my Xbox power brick. It was still COMPLETELY covered in those tiny motherfuckers. Even around it, a carpet of ants ran around looking for whatever had disturbed them. It was here that I unleashed my weapon of mass destruction upon them until the supply was all but empty. The ones outside the block got blown away as they got hit by the gas of death, but I didn't care. I was going to insect bomb the whole house no matter what and then deep clean the place afterwards. I watched as the ones inside the block came crawling out before curling up and dying. Vengeance was so very sweet at that moment.
A few hours later, I washed out the remaining dead and dying ants with purified water at the sink and watched with a grin as their lifeless bodies spiralled into the drain. After drying the block I decided to try and see if it worked because why not? And to my surprise, my Xbox booted right up! It was a small victory during that horrifying experience but one that I gladly took. The only bad part was, my left hand was bitten to shit and I couldn't play anyway. Plus, the feeling of ants crawling on my skin was ever present for the next few days. Even today, while writing this book, I've had to swipe across all parts of my body because I keep feeling those little shits all over me. 
TL;DR
I didn't clean up after a small get together which fed a colony of ants that ended up moving into my Xbox. Proceeded to get covered in ants while trying to find out what was wrong. "
3,"TIFU By Trying To Be Conservative With Paper Plates


Not recent, but around 3 years ago I was making myself a nice afternoon snack.

I had just got done cooking up some juicy ballpark hot dogs on the stove and it was time to chow down. Now, at the time, I was super tired of washing dishes, so I had bought a big stack of generic paper plates from the grocery store. I wanted this stack of plates to last, so I pulled a single paper plate from the stack and put it on my counter. It was now time to load up my hot dogs with some ketchup and mustard.

I'm super fired up, my mouth is watering, and it is finally time to sit down and enjoy my meal. I grab the paper plate and walk out of my kitchen to head over to my computer desk. My desk was just a few steps away where I would be putting my plate down and enjoying my meal while I browse reddit. 

Right as I arrive at my computer desk, my paper plate turns into a limp pancake and my beautiful hot dogs start falling in slow motion before my eyes. I was frozen as I watched them fall, but it hadn't yet clicked where they were going to land. I was standing directly over my custom PC that has a open vent on the top where a big ass fan feeds air into my PC. Here is a picture of my [PC case] (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2500x2500/cooler_master_rc_912_kkn1_haf_912_mid_tower_1065260.jpg). As you'd guess, my hot dogs land ketchup and mustard side down, directly on top of the running fan. Fuck me right?

The fan then sucks up every drop of ketchup and mustard and proceeds to spray it on almost every square inch of my PC's innards. At this point, I'm devastated. My meal is ruined and my computer is drenched is condiments.

Luckily, I turned off my computer and no damage was done, but I ended up spending well over an hour cleaning that little bastard out. I just wanted to eat a hot dog man.

TLDR; Made some hot dogs. Put hot dogs on a paper plate. Top off my hot dogs with condiments. Paper plate buckles under the weight of the hot dogs and they fall in a running PC fan that sprays ketchup and mustard all over the inside of my computer. "
4,"TIFU by leaving my phone in my pocket.


This happened about 2 hours ago, and I can't describe how upset I am. 

My morning was going great. Got to work, helping customers (Starbucks), awesome. Go to break, and I take out my phone to text my wife and see how she is. I nlook down at my phone, and my heart sinks. It's a classic 'death blue screen, and has one word on it; erasing... As I frantically try to press and hold any button combination, I realize my attempt is futile. My phone contents are gone.

Ordinarily, who cares, right? Apps can be downloaded, messages retrieved, whatever. Unfortunately I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. Those of you who don't know, it has no memory card. Samsung's real fuck up. So what's my loss? Three years worth of pictures of my two children and wife, going back to before my son was born.

""But u/Ryuujin09 surely you uploaded your pictures to the cloud?"" Nope. I'm stupid. No cloud, no computer save, just gone.

It seems my thigh wanted to break into my phone and do some rummaging, so much so that my password was inputted incorrectly enough times to not oknly lock out my phone, but to then restore factory settings.

Tl:dr, phone in pocket, thigh tried to break in. Phone protected me by deleting everything including three years worth of pictures."
5,"Tifu by putting Nair down there


This happened about a day ago. I had gotten tired of shaving the scrambled eggs between the legs, as it caused a lot of irritation. I heard of this lovely prodect called Nair. 

I was looking forward to sexy time with my boyfriend as it was my day off. I had tested the nair on a section of my leg to make sure my skin wouldn't react badly. It was perfectly smooth and not irritated what so ever by the morning.

Flash forward about an hour. I put the nair around my fun house, being careful to smear it on and not rub it in. The package said to let it sit for 3 minutes or so and I began my weight, passing the few minutes on reddit.

About 2 minutes in I start feeling the burn. Now I hadn't thought to cover anything so as not to get it in the sensitive part. I also had two sores on the upper regions (no I don't have herpies, these are a different story, yes I also have good heigine) I figured it was normal. I've heard of people saying it burns a bit but not too bad. 

The 3 minute mark pops up and my whisker biscuit feels like it's practically on fire. I go running into the shower, grab a wash cloth and start scrubbing all that is Satan off of my cooch. When I complete showering and dry off, all seems fine. Then I realized that I was bleeding on both the sores, I shrugged it off and went to game while waiting for my SO to come home. It was then, on the first loading screen of far cry 5, that I realized. I had gotten some nair on my clit.

Now the burning sensation can only be described as rubbing icy hot into your clit. Which if you're curious about, you really shouldn't be. This along with some of the more delicate skin on my lips and the sores were practly on fire.

I spent the rest of the night with a cold rag on my virtical bacon sandwich while my SO teased me for my stupidity.

There was no sexy time that night.

tl;dr I put nair on my lady parts. Ended up with a cold rag the rest of the night."
6,"TIFU by telling a first date that I eat my skin flakes.


This happened about an hour ago and I'm still cringing. 

So I'm sitting opposite an attractive and  funny woman I met on tinder. The conversation is flowing, we've just discussed movies and we're having a laugh. It comes up in conversation that my father is Dutch. She asks me if he's a crazy Dutch guy and if I've inherited any crazy Dutch traits. 

""Oh yeah"", I say without hesitation. ""I totally eat my own skin flakes.""

Blank stare.

""I carry them around with me.""

Nervous laughter. Looks over my shoulder. 

That's when the penny drops. She didn't get the joke because she hasn't seen Austin Powers. Cue very awkward explanation and very weird call backs  throughout the night to eating skin flakes. 

The date ended with her saying I'm ""interesting"". Pretty sure I'll end up  alone with permanent cringe lines on my face. 

TL;DR made a spectacularly weird movie reference during a first date that ended with us both being grossed out. "
7,"TIFU by accidentally playing a cruel joke on a stroke victim


This happened some time ago but only just occurred to me as a legitimate TIFU.

A young girl at my work recently had a stroke. It's a relatively small office, everyone knows her and she is well liked, so everyone knew what had happened and supported her in any way they could. A very touching and supportive community.

The stroke rendered her unable to perform her duties properly and as such she was re-allocated to my section (IT). As they were setting up her desk in preparation for her arrival, they needed a keyboard, and I remembered I had a spare one - so I handed it over, thinking nothing of it. Between then and her arrival to the new desk, I quit my job and had left. 

She returned from rehabilitation leave and was due to commence her new job in the IT section. Lighting and other adjustments had been made to her desk to accommodate her condition. She sits down, goes to type in her credentials to log into her PC.. and has an absolute meltdown.

The keyboard I had handed over when setting up her desk was one I had switched all the keys on, to help me learn to touch-type. All the letters were completely jumbled. She thought she was having another stroke - and she knew that another stroke could likely mean death. She thought she was actively dying because I had given her a jumbled keyboard.

I'll never know how many people actually believe me when I say it was not intentional. I wonder myself sometimes, it's such an outrageous coincidence.

TL;DR: Accidentally installed a jumbled keyboard onto a desk to be used by a stroke victim, made her think she was having another stroke and about to die."
8,"TIFU by literally tearing myself a new one [NSFW]


Throwaway, for obvious reasons.

To start, it’s good to know that I’m an extremely hairy dude. So hairy, in fact, that the only places on my body that the grace of god decided to leave bare are my palms, the bottom of my feet, and my face. To all my fellow redditors not cursed with this genetic fuckall, there are a few things that this hair really gets in the way of. The most notable of them all is shitting. Taking a clean shit through a blanket of ass hair is so damned-near impossible that I had almost given up completely, until an idea dawned in my head that eventually would lead to my doom. Why not shave it? 

This was about 3 months ago, and at that point I used disposable safety razors to shave. I took an old one into the shower and cleared the jungle without any issues.

My next shit was fucking glorious. I felt like a new man, and nothing could stop me from shitting cleaner than Mr Clean himself.

I carried on this practice for the next few months, dumbfounded at my newfound power. Every shit was an absolute delight and I thought I had it all. It all ended when I switched to shaving my face with a straight razor. I no longer had the tools to perform my sick ritual, and was forced to stop until I remembered to buy more safety razors (a laughable proposition). Because I was too scared to shave, the jungle was slowly allowed to grow back, and I slowly descended back into the shitty hell I had once known. 

Tonight, I decided that I was done with it, and that I would face my fear. I would reclaim my glorious asscrack even if it meant getting a few tiny cuts. What could possibly go wrong? 

Everything. Everything could go wrong. 

I entered the shower, put my leg up, and began very confidently. The first few strokes were smooth and successful, and I perceived that as a good omen. Everything was going according to plan, except one small detail. Because of the width of my straight razor, in order to get to the hairs that really counted (the ones surrounding my anus), I had to shave with the blade facing my anus, instead of facing away, like usual. The thought “no biggie, you have steady hands” ran through my head, so I continued onward in my deforestation. I got one whole side clean, and hastily began the other side. This was when I learned that the adverb “hastily” should NEVER be used to describe shaving an asscrack. On the next sweep, I slipped, and time slowed to a halt. I knew where the blade was going to end up, and I knew that only god could stop it. When it finally hit, it didn’t hurt at all, but all I could feel was a thin strip of steel directly on my anus. It was then, that I knew I had fucked up and butterflied my anus. I removed the blood-soaked razor from my asscrack, and all that I could think of was how glad I was that I was in the shower. However, I also knew (by the amount of blood) that it was a pretty serious cut and that taking a shit for the next few weeks would suck ass. 

This all happened about a half hour ago. Now I’m sitting in humiliation in front of my roommate (who has decided to turn on the movie Inception to celebrate my asscrack inside an asscrack) with alcohol soaked gauze stuffed inbetween my asscheeks. Everything burns, and god has truly left. If I can take a comfortable shit in the next few months, I’ll celebrate.

Tl;dr: I butterflied my asshole open in the shower and regret everything."
