0,"TIFU by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.


So this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

Rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. She was exceptionally fine so I decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. Everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. We move onto the main course and I notice a more than offensive smell, Must've dug up something deep. So I finish her and end the night.

A day later and my throat is sore, but I think nothing of it as I was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

Two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. I go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins I see the doctor. With a look of concern on his face, he tells me I need to go to the ER. 'The ER?' I asked 'is it really that bad?' The doc asks me how long it's been hurting and I told him I had just noticed it today. He tells me it's very Aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. So I head down to the ER to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. He finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

A script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and I'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the ER for tonsilitis.

Edit:

Fun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)

And since I finally made it to the front page, hi Mom.."
1,"TIFU by removing my Diva Cup. NSFW


After getting tired of shoving bits of cotton in my 'nanner curtains for years, I switched to the menstrual cup a while back. *For those that don't know, it's basically this little silicone cup you pop into your lady bits and you can wear for like 12 hours.*

Anywhoo, after sleeping all night, I needed to empty it. I headed to the bathroom, lined the toilet with toilet paper to prevent splash back, and proceeded to remove it. Now, I always look to see how full the cup is after removal. It's a weird thing to do, but I think it's kinda cool to see how much is in there. 

Apparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. As I was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. Not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, I jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.

 Remember what was in my hand? Yeah, It was a full cup. **Everywhere.** On the tub, on the wall, all over me, it was a mess.
Naturally, my SO heard me yell, and the thud of my lard ass falling off the toilet and came running, only to find me on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, yelling about a spider. I'm surprised the poor guy didn't faint.

TL;DR: A spider surprised me, I threw blood everywhere and my SO thought I was dying.

Edit: Holy shit guys, I wasn't expecting this many responses! For those asking, my mom came up with the nanner curtains thing and it stuck lol, and spider bro has retreated to his corner of the bathroom. Also the boyfriend is fine, slightly traumatised, but he'll live."
2,"TIFU by giving the cat a Dutch Oven


So this happened this morning and I'm going to post this on an alt account because people know my main one lmao.

This morning, like every morning, I took a shower. I woke up kinda late, and was real hungry, so I went straight from the shower to the kitchen to make myself a sandwich.

I was wearing only my towel because I'm a lazy shit and no one's home. As I'm grabbing the sandwich shit, the house cat is rubbing up against my legs. Now, a note on this cat - I hate it. I hate it SO MUCH. It isn't cuddly, its real bitey, and it also fucking hates me back just as much. And now, because food is involved, it wants to be MY FRIEND. Fuck you, housecat. FUCK YOU.

I get this idea in my head that it would be hilarious to hotbox the cat with a fart. I can trap it under the towel since it's right there under me and she will literally not know what is about to be unleashed. I put my sandwich shit down and I commit to the plan, because I'm a fucking retard.

So I squat down a bit, because I want a nice seal using the beach towel as sort of shower curtain against the floor. I want this shit HERMETIC. Fuck YOU, cat.

In position, I'm giggling, mostly naked in the kitchen, about to fart on a cat. I release the hounds. Nothing happens. I try harder because at this point I am committed.

Something happens.

The cat is now covered in a thin film of watery liquid shit. Aghast at this development, cat decides to GO BATSHIT AND PANIC. Cat claws the everliving shit out of my ballsack and streaks off around the house. I had to chase it down and throw a poop-towel over it to calm it down, and then quickly take it to the bathroom to both bathe the cat (which it hates) and peroxide my torn up balls (which I hate)

e- the cat was given my sandwich as recompense  
e2- a lot of people are real mad and acting like I specifically woke up this morning with the malicious intend to shit on the cat. This was not the case. I misjudged a harmless fart. Please stop threatening me with violence, lmao. I am already suffering the instant karma of a blended nutsack.  

&gt;LIZARDS REPLY CORNER!
Alright, I'm getting a lot of ""wow this didnt habpen u lier"" stuff. So here we go. Stuff goes direct to my mail thingy and Im gettin real tired of answering individual people.

Q: WHY DO U OWN A CAT IF U H8 IT  
A: I don't. It is my housemates cat.  
Q: HOW DID THE CAT STAY UNDER TOWEL SO LONG JET FUEL CANT MELT STEAL BEAMS  
A: Have you... have you seen a cat begging? Or a cat shoving themselves into a small place? Cats are basically liquid. I can't pretend to know what goes on in the mind of madness.  
Q: Y DO EVRY1 BUT ME SHART!!! ITS A LIE  
A: Its not like this is a common thing. When it does happen, I'm gonna post it, because its HILARIOUS. Other people also find it funny and post it, so it gets upvoted on sites like this, and you are inundated in Sharting posts, I guess? So you see it all the time and think everyones lying about it, and to be fair, maybe some are. But yeah, you'll see it a lot.

3,"TIFU By Burning My Right Eye Retina After Looking At Solar Eclipse.


Well... not today but about 20 years ago. I was young teenager in a summer camp and did not know any better. I looked at the sun through my partially closed fist (to reduce aperture) with my right eye. I have a small spot in my right eye that kinda static (like TV static). Whenever I take eye exam (reading letters), I have a very hard time reading letters with my right eye (because of the burned spot).

I have since got LASIK (I had a slightly bad vision) and my right eye came out slightly worse than the left. All because we could not get acurate reading (I kept screwing up reading part).

Burned eye retina, like mine, is incurable and inoperable. I will have to live with this all my life. It's not bad enough that would render me disabled, just annoying sometimes. 

Please watch out for kids looking at the eclipse. They will see that all adults look at the sky and do the same. That is what I did. 

Please be aware of eye protection tomorow.

TL;DR burned my right eye retina looking at the solar eclipse and now can not pass eye exam. 

Edit : since evrybody asking. I've looked at it for around 30 min. It was partial eclipse. 

Edit 2: jeez, so many of you replying with the same experience. This issue needs to be better explained to the public, maybe tought in schools. "
4,"TIFU By melting a hole in my solar eclipse glasses with a beam of focused super-light from binoculars.


I want to preface this by saying I'm okay, no catastrophic eye damage to me or my father.

We aren't in the path of totality, but we still bought a few pairs for viewing. Now I'd like to say I thought I'd be one of the smart ones this time around, but looks like I almost bought a one way ticket to Stupidville.

As we were watching it, I got the bright idea (Pun definitely intended) of grabbing my binoculars and trying to see through with the eclipse glasses. So I put the glasses on first, then brought the binoculars up to my eyes. Took a minute to find the sun, but eventually I did and it was awesome! We could see some sunspots and the lines were so crisp and clear! It was pretty cool, so I let my dad give it a go as well.

As I took a second turn, I noticed my right eye felt irregularly hot. I brushed it off, especially since the binoculars favored the left lense for viewing. Once I was done looking I took the binoculars off and noticed my grave error; THE LENSE OF THE BINOCULARS MADE A BEAM OF CONCENTRATED SUPER-LIGHT THAT MADE A HOLE IN THE GLASSES THAT ALMOST FRIED ME LIKE A LIGHTSABER TO THE RETINA.

I threw the glasses off my face and look down from the sun and we both checked our eyes for ghosting images. Thankfully, we were both fine! But looking back, I nearly became one of the people I laughed at so naively.

[Proof](https://m.imgur.com/PpVZr0q)

TL;DR Used solar eclipse glasses with binoculars which melted a hole through the UV filter, almost disintegrating my corneas

UPDATE: Woke up this morning and... I'm fine. It's been approximately 16 hours since the incident. No discomfort, pain or spots. I think I'm in the clear for now. My right eye *was* closed for a significant part. I think I'd know if that super-light was in my eye even for a second. Thanks for all of your concern!"
5,"TIFU by having a spicy shit and ending up having my family think I'm gay


This happened around 30 minutes ago and I'm still in shock.

Here's some background: My parents are very very old fashioned. They both come from Slavic origin and are stuck in their ways on the topic of homosexuality. I myself am not homosexual, but will have a hard time trying to explain that to my family whenever they come around.

The fuckup began yesterday night when while hanging out with my friends I made the stupid decision of chugging a half full bottle of hot sauce on dare. I knew the consequences at the moment: searing hot mouth, watery eyes, the works. Little did I know the consequences the next morning would bring. I woke up to the sharpest searing pain in my stomach and the feeling I wanted to throw up. I thought it was because I was sick because I had never experienced this kind of pain from anything other than sicknesses. 

My first reaction was to go for the laxatives and Tylenol. Within 30 minutes I was in the bathroom proceeding to have both the most satisfyingly smooth but painful shit of my entire existence. It was nearing the end of my jalapeno shitfest when by habit I grabbed my phone. I had missed calls from my friends and I quickly remembered I promised to hang with them because summer is nearing for us soon. I wasn't too worried about my parents, my mom was working till 6 and my dad had an appointment. I quickly wiped my ass, grabbed 50 bucks and left to go hang. 

Fast forward like 2 hours and my ass becomes an inferno. I think it's a combination of the spicy shit I took and the fact that I wiped a bit quicker than usual. Regardless I can't wipe it now that I'm hanging out with friends, I need to use baby wipes or take a cold shower or something. It starts off bad but as the hangout progresses so does the pain. by the end of the night my asshole feels like Satan himself is ripping it to shreds. It hurt to sit, it hurt to stand and by god it hurt when I occasionally had to fart.

I tried to have a good night and pretend nothing was wrong but the fact that the sun itself was exiting my pooper really put a damper on my mood. I got home late at night, a lot later than usual and before I could even say anything to my parents I ran to the bathroom to soothe my raw anus. I pulled down my pants and began to spray the coldest water imaginable at my butt. At first the contrast between hot and cold hurt, but as I adjusted it became heaven. I began slowly cleaning my ass with a bodywash and shampoo mixture and it felt utterly amazing, the closest thing I can compare it too is a angel kissing your ass. Little did I know I forgot to lock the door in the rush. With my hand rubbing my ass, my eyes closed and letting out a soft satisfying moan my mother walked in. She was probably worried because I never come home and ran to shower that fast, I made it a habit to say hi to her when I came back, so her concern was understandable. Still I can only imagine the look on her face as I basically fingered myself. I only realized when it was too late and she had left to tell my dad. 

I quickly scrambled to get out of the shower and I heard my mom downstairs, crying on the couch while my dad consolidated her. I heard her say something along the lines of, ""now how will we ever have grandchildren?"". Now I'm sitting in my room trying to plan out my course of action but waiting has probably worried them more. I thought Reddit would just enjoy this little fuckup of mine. hopefully my family will understand before they call all of my relatives.

TL;DR had a spicy shit, didn't wipe too well, when I finally did get to soothe my ass I forgot to lock the door and my mom walked in on me rubbing my pooper and loving it."
6,"TIFU by drunk driving into permanent body damage and sobriety. (Very long read)


First off I don't condone driving while intoxicated and think it's an idiotic and selfish decision.

I'll start by saying this happened November 11, 2016 so this is still fairly new, and I am still undergoing surgeries. I'll start this with some back-story.

Okay so at the time I was 25 and dealing with some personal life problems. I was with my girlfriend for 4 years with 2 breakups in between. We had broken up somewhere near September for the final time. I wasn't the perfect boyfriend and had a few slip ups, alcohol was unfortunately the main factor. I wasn't mad that we ended it but I was a little depressed. 
I was laid off from my cushy oilfield desk job of 4 years at the beginning of the year. Since I was moved up with no schooling or previous experience in my field, it was near impossible for a similar job for similar pay. So I took a temporary job in a warehouse since I'm not prideful. For a fraction of my last salary of course.

I have a roommate and his girlfriend, he ends up never having a job the entire year of our lease.
He's an alcoholic and addicted to his prescription pills that alter his mind. (I forget the band) 
He wants to drink with me 24/7, we get shitfaced on weekends, him everyday. I wouldn't say I was an alcoholic before him but I was already drinking heavily. Living with him influenced me to drink more than I should have been.

-The day of the accident and the following week is from word of mouth not memory.

It's Thursday night and tomorrow is a holiday, my coworker/friend invites me to go out drinking with him. We hit up a few bars and end up spending quite some money. It's good therapy for me since I feel like my life is falling apart. Apparently I get cut off at our last bar. My friend tells me I try to leave but he takes my keys and wants me to crash at his place, he lives in the neighborhood. I live an hour away. I somehow convince him I'm okay and get my keys back. I crash 10 minutes from the bar.

I'm on a curvy lone road with no guardrails. I drive 120 mph off the road into a culvert and fly right into some type of pole. I hit the pole at 110 mph. (Where my odometer stuck at) my car bounces the tail end into a tree. I'm still conscious. The front end of my car is now where my knees are. Parts of the engine are on top of me and it catches fire as they are trying to get me out. Luckily I'm near one of the best hospitals in Texas and I'm swarmed with fire trucks, police, and ambulances.
They are able to put our the fire immediately before it spreads, I have minimal burns on my right hand only.
They use the jaws of life to get me out and apparently I'm screaming in pain. Once I'm in the ambulance I go into cardiac arrest and lose pulse, I die. They use the defibrillator and being me back. Once in the ER, I go into cardiac arrest again and die once more. They revive me again. 

They put me in ICU while I'm in critical condition. I'm not stable so they are unable to do any surgeries for 4 days, mind you every limb except my left arm is broken to hell. I'm in a coma for a week. I finally stabilize and they are able to start on the long list of required surgeries. The first surgeries are on my back since I broke my lower spine, L4. I require a 8 hour spine surgery and have plates/screws placed to hold my spine together. (I'm no longer allowed to run for the rest of my life) Next surgeries are on my legs, both ankles broken with the bones sticking through. The orthopedic surgeon informs my family he 100% is about to amputate both legs due to the severity of the damage. Once in surgery he finds out he can save them and operates. The right is fixed 100% with long plates and screws. I have arthritis already from the injury. The left ankle was the worst of the two with a shattered heel, and my Achilles severely torn, fractures everywhere and some bone missing from the left side of the four. It never leaves the cast the entire duration of my hospital stay.

My right forearm is broken very bad, both bones are broken. My arm is wide open, you can place your drink in my arm. Muscle has died due to my arm being left open for 4 days when I wasn't stable, they have to cut the dead muscle out and start maggot therapy for a week to eat the remaining dead tissue. My tendants and nerves are severed, I no longer have feeling or movement in my hand. After another surgery, they close the huge wound with a skin great from my thigh. My leg is on fire for days and is the worst pain I've ever felt, injuries included. I get put on dilaudid every 4 hours and I'm as high as a kite.

I have a collapsed lung so I have a chest tube put in. Once they remove it, I can't breath and they realize it was placed wrongly. They have to do surgery to reinstall it. It's very painful and I get knocked out with ketamine.

Now to my face. I have multiple fractures in my face. There's two openings in your skull in your cheek area near both sides of your nose where the nerves come out of. I fracture both holes and have nerve damage in my nose, teeth, and mustache area. My nose is broken badly and the bone is under my right eye. My jaw is broken and dislocated. I have two black eyes and my right eye is damaged to the point it is oozing green puss and I have 100% purple vision. It heals eventually with medicine. I get plates in various spots of my face where the fractures are. I get my jaw wired shut, and a tracheotomy is performed with a breathing tube installed that doubles as where my voice comes out of. Weird. It has to be cleaned daily with a suction tube where it feels like I'm suffocating.
I also have a brain injury, there is a bleed on the brain which causes sorry term memory loss and problems receiving too much memory at a time. That heals with time.

The doctors estimate a 18 month hospital stay. I end up in ICU a little over a month before being moved to inpatient therapy on the top floor for one month. I have to learn how to walk all over again and learn to use one hand. I get discharged in January.

After a few months in physical and occupational therapy all while in a wheelchair, they schedule another arm surgery. May 11th I have a nerve repair surgery. He pulls every single nerve he can from both my legs to replace the damaged nerves in my arm. I now have numbness in both legs in certain areas. The nerves should take a year from surgery to heal, and I might get some movement back in my fingers. Might.

July I have another surgery in my left ankle because it healed crooked and my tendants are out of place. He needs to rebrake the ankle to correct it. He ends up braking it again and fixing my tendants, also fusing my ankle with permanent screws.
I have anther surgery next month (September), and another in February.

I ruined relations with some people, lost the respect of family and friends, and disappointed myself. This is my rock bottom. 

I was 130lbs and my bac was 0.24. I was not charged with a dwi, but my insurance counted it a total loss and won't pay a dime. I have $12k left to pay. Karma I guess.

The only good thing from this is I have given up alcohol and cigarettes and am on a path to be a better person.

EDIT: I immediately fell asleep after posting this so I didn't see any of hateful comments which got this thread locked. If you feel strongly about this post, feel free to send me a message, I promise I'll get around to reading the flood of messages. All of them. Also Since I never got a chance to reply to anyone, I'll answer some questions here. 
1.) I am not back to driving yet, my license is still valid since there was no DWI. I do need to get a police ride-a-long to approve me to drive again. My insurance knows the reason and I am in no condition to drive anytime soon.
2.) The BAC was found out in the ER, I've spoken to the sheriff a few times about my missing gun I keep in my car, never mentioned any possible charges. 
3.) This wasn't meant as a rant, informative piece, or anything really. If it helps you, great, if it pisses you off, that's okay too. It was just on my mind when I saw there was a TIFU subreddit. 
4.) I've never blamed anyone for my actions, they are my own. And the back story wasn't to be excuses, it was just to explain why I ended up drinking so much that night. 
5.) For people asking what made me think I could drive in that condition, obviously I was not in my right mind. have you ever tried to argue with a drunk person, have you seen the dumbest things people do while drunk? It doesn't excuse my actions but logical thinking is nonexistent while drunk. 
6.) Sorry if I wasn't clear on the $12k, that's what I owe left on my car. The hospital bills are through the sky, and near impossible to pay.
7.) I'm sorry if it seems like I'm listing excuses in the beginning, I was only trying to include some back story. I'm not the best story teller/writer, so it may have been misinterpreted. I don't blame anyone for what happened, I don't even blame alcohol. It was a decision I made that was solely on me. I never once blamed a single person other than myself. I think there would be more questions if I only posted the crash.

TL;DR I drove drunk and ended up losing the use of my dominant arm, as well as certain movements in my left foot."
7,"TIFU by calling a woman a watermelon


This happened several months ago, but the aftermath of this FU haunts me almost every day at work. It was a normal day of work, and one of the gals I work with wore a lime green shirt and bright pink pants (totally different from the normal black and blue I see all the time). I remember seeing her early on in the day and thinking she looked ready for spring/summer, but thought nothing more at the time. Later in the day, I was walking down a hall when she turned the corner, and in an effort to avoid the normal ""How are you today,"" I instead blurted out the first thing that came to mind...which was ""Hey! You look like a watermelon today!"" My heart sank as I instantly realized our work relationship would never be the same, and I had possibly permanently scarred her tender heart. She looked both surprised and horrified at what I had said, and passed by without saying anything. We've barely spoken since then, probably because she's worried what kind of fruit I'm going to call her next. She has not worn the same colors together since. 

TL;DR: I called a female co-worker a watermelon after she wore green and pink to work. Her self-esteem was clearly hurt, and our work relationship remains awkward as ever. "
8,"TIFU by stopping my dog from staring at the eclipse.


This happened yesterday, of course.
I have 4 dogs, but the one in this story is a 1 year old bulldog who weighs about 60 pounds.
Bella is a curious dog, and she spends a lot of time looking out the window.
So when the eclipse was about to begin, I closed the curtains in order to prevent having another blind dog, and all was well. 
That's when a small crowd a couple houses down starts cheering as the moon passes the sun. Bella's ears perk up and she starts to sprint towards the couch so she can look out the window. I spring into action and snatch her up. She excitedly swings her legs around and clocks me right across the face with her freshly clipped nails.
Ouch.
Now I have 2 slash marks across my face. Thanks Bella.
That wasn't enough for the bloodlusted pup, as she then kicked me right in the balls with a vicious stomp.
More ouch.

In hindsight I realize she probably wouldn't have even looked at the sun...

Edit: I realized how stupid this was about 3 seconds after I did it. No need to remind me.

Edit2: TIFU by posting to TIFU.

Edit3: TIL reddit is mean, thanks for showing love to the nice users.

Edit:4 Gold? WHAT? THANK YOU MYSTERIOUS MAN! 


Tl:dr, stopped my dog from going blind, dog assaulted me.

9,"TIFU by thinking I outgrew a food allergy because I don't know how allergy meds work


So this actually happened this morning. Some background on the incident:

When I was a little kid I ate some carrot cake with fresh coconut shreds, and suffered a mild allergic reaction. My throat swelled slightly and it was uncomfortable to breathe, but I was fine the next day. Since then I've avoided coconut at all costs. 

Well, at some point this summer after learning curry is made with coconut milk, I realized I was able to consume coconut milk without any issues. Maybe I outgrew my allergy. After trying to reduce dairy in my diet, I started using coconut milk to make chia pudding. I've been eating this coconut chia pudding almost every morning for the past few weeks and had no issue...

... until this morning. I eat my chia pudding for breakfast as usual, and that's all I had. Over the course of the next few hours, I became more aware of how swallowing felt uncomfortable, I was queasy, my face tingled, and the lymph nodes in my neck were sort of swollen. I was also sniffling and sneezing, but I attributed this part to outdoor allergies. I was trying to get off of allergy pills, and usually my seasonal allergies are extra bad when I'm ""withdrawing""  from them. 

Then it hit me. 

All summer I've been taking one of those OTC allergy meds because I couldn't deal with my outdoor allergies, but didn't realize that antihistamines work on mild food allergies as well. 

I wasn't having allergic reactions to coconut before, but it's not because I outgrew it... it's because I was taking antihistamines... 

Once I realized this I took a break from work and went straight to the store to get some non-drowsy allergy meds (so I could drive home later). A couple hours later my throat is no longer puffy and I can breathe better. I'm still a little shaken up and queasy, but I'll be fine

It was really scary having even a mild reaction since nothing like this has happened to me since I was a kid. It was definitely uncomfortable and I panicked, but I'm so glad it wasn't worse. 

No more coconut milk for me :(

TL;DR Didn't realize allergy meds work on food, had been eating food I am allergic to, and suffered an allergic reaction once I stopped taking the meds. 

EDIT: This is the most notifications I've had in my life so I don't know where to start! Thank you for sharing your stories! Also, thanks RedditMD lol. I promise I'm fine, and if I felt like I was going to die I would have gone to the ER. And yes, I'm planning to see a professional about my allergies to be safe.

EDIT 2: Of course there are tons of coconut banging jokes... I only remembered those posts right after sharing. As a girl, I'm not really sure how that would work... and I don't think I want to lol. "
10,"TIFU by water boarding some birds


This happened last night. My mom is away for a week and she wanted me to water some of her flowers for her. The flowers are hanging in baskets [similar to this](http://balconygardenweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Million-Bells-in-hanging-basket.jpg) from hooks in the ceiling of the veranda.

Now I need to preface this, my Mom has had these flowers out all summer. As it happens, a month and a half or so ago, some birds decided to make a nest in there. The birds are probably some kind of finch, or at least they're no [bigger than this guy.](http://www.jessupaviary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Teddy-7.9-mellow.jpg) My Mom was always terrified to water the plants because she didn't want to get dive bombed, so we moved the plant further down the porch, and only watered it when the birds were gone. When the plant wasn't hanging (or if you're tall enough I guess) The nest and eggs were easy to see through the flowers, but when it's hanging it's anybody's guess what's in there. So here's where I fucked up.

So I've been watering these plants every second day for a few days now, and some of them are starting to wilt. I figure I haven't been watering them quite enough, so this time I'm really going to pour some water in there. As I'm making my rounds, I realize that there's a plant further down the porch that I hadn't noticed or watered all weekend. So I went down, got on my tippy toes, and poured that watering can solidly into the plant.

 First second, everything is fine. By second 2, the flower is starting to ruffle in a panic, but my brain doesn't quite register what's going on. Second 3, two birds flop out of the flowers and onto the deck, one after the other. They're dazed and weren't able to fly out of the plant, and are quickly trying to get their bearings and assess the situation, all the while squeaking like mad men. 4, Thud. A fledgling bird literally and audibly thuds onto the deck. By contrast, the parents landed like cats. By this time I'm fully registering what's happening, and I want to help the fledgling back into its nest if I can, except that 5. Mom and Dad have gotten back on their feet, their wings mostly working, and they're pissed. Squeaking loudly, they started hopping and flapping around, not quite able to fly from standing. Jr rolls off the deck in an attempt to get on his feet. This was the last I saw of Jr. 6, Mom manages to get up on the railing, while dad is on my car ~8 feet away. They are mostly postured around where Jr fell, but they are very aware of me and react when I try to get close. They are in fight AND flight mode, scared but not quite ready to commit to a full retreat. 

This all took about 6 or 7 seconds. It was at this time I'm sad to say, that I decided it was best if I left. Where the fledgling had fallen was behind some shrubbery, and as I went down the deck to look for him, I couldn't see him anywhere (must have waddled off) and it seemed I was stressing the parents by looking. I figured(hoped really) if they had some time to group with Jr they'd be fine. Jr's wings were mostly in, he only barely looked juvenile compared to his parents, so I hope he was able to fly back into his nest. 

I hadn't seen the birds in a few weeks and totally forgot about them before watering. There was 3 eggs in the past when we looked at the nest a month ago, so I'm really hoping only Jr survived to babyhood, or else I have 2 more birds drowned on my conscience. Sorry Bird's :(

**TL;DR:** Forgot about a nest and accidentally water boarded an unsuspecting family of birds.

**EDIT:** Just got home from work, so wanted to give you guys a quick update. For those of you concerned about the other 2 eggs, [There were no bird corpses,](http://imgur.com/a/AtcHu) so presumably they didn't hatch or they left the nest before Jr. I also haven't seen or heard the birds since then."

*Happened a couple months ago, but still worth sharing. 

We all do dumb stuff when we’re tired. Especially when it’s the middle of the night and we need to relieve ourselves. And even more so when we’re out in the deepest part of the woods, on a camping trip, and have an itty-bitty fear of the dark. 

Imagine, if you will, the tiniest of camp clearings set into the side of a mountain. One cut into a wooded slope so steep, you wonder just how far you’d roll if you took even the smallest misstep. Now imagine it’s dark as sin in the dead of night, with just enough moonlight to see the outlines of everything. That’s what I awoke to in my tent, with Nature’s Calling roiling in my gut.

Stumbling out of my tent in PJ bottoms, gripping nothing but some toilet paper and my flashlight, I began looking around for the nearest latrine. There wasn’t one. It was too steep. Not wanting to foul up our campsite, I decided to clamber up the slope a little bit and fertilize the trees above us. Keep in mind, I wasn’t really thinking straight. Just a zombie with a need for the drains. 

I pulled myself up the slope, slipping on dead leaves all along the way. I got about forty feet up and decided I was good. There I squatted, took care of business, made sure I was dirt-free, and sluggishly began slogging back down the slope.

Something rustled behind me. It was approaching fast, running over the leaves at a rapid pace, coming straight toward me. Adrenaline cut through my foggy state in seconds and warning signs flashed in my vision: DANGER! ANIMAL! KILL YOU! RUN!

I bolted down the hill, yelling at the top of my lungs, slipping, sliding, almost tumbling through the trees. The rustling continued after me, hot on my heels. My friend, who’d been sleeping soundly, was up and out of his tent in a flash, shining his light in my direction as I slid toward him with my pants around my knees and screaming for help. 

Now the edge of our little campsite is dug into the slope, so there’s a bit of a drop off. I slid off it at high velocity, hit the ground hard, and ended up slamming my face into the ground, breaking my goddamn nose. My friend wasn’t paying attention to me though. He stood over me, the rustling abundantly clear in the night air as he shined his light around to pick out the threat. 

I hunkered at his feet, crying and shivering, my nose dripping blood and mucus from where I’d busted it. Then the threat made itself known. A brown mass slid off the embankment and dropped right on top of our tent, almost caving it in. Immediately, the smell followed--pungent and revolting, with a hint of trail mix. Even through my busted nose, which was now clogged with blood, I got a good whiff. It slid down our tent for a good ten seconds, before flopping to the ground. 

My friend held his flashlight on it the entire damn time, then shined it down at me. Then he doubled over laughing, not caring about my busted nose or that he’d been so rudely awakened. After I took care to bundle my nose a bit, we began to figure out what happened. 

Apparently, the deuce I’d dropped on the hill possessed just the right amount of density and viscosity to begin sliding down the slope and not break apart. The embankment, slick with dead leaves, afforded the perfect conditions for it to stalk me all the way back down to my campsite. I never heard the end of it, my friend called me Little Brown Sliding Hood from then on, and we had to head out early to attend to my goddamn nose.

So for any campers out there, if you shit in the woods, make sure it’s not on a hill. And if it is, dig a hole first. 

TL;DR: I took a shit on a hill, it rolled down after me, I thought it was a wild animal chasing me, and ended up breaking my nose as well as earning the nickname “Little Brown Sliding Hood” for the rest of the trip. "
13,"TIFU By thinking I would be alright if I only looked at the eclipse for a couple of minutes.


This happened today, unsurprisingly. I am ashamed of myself. 

I found out sometime a couple days ago that I was in a place that has 90% visibility of the eclipse. Well I had read the posts about your eyes being damaged and stuff like that so I tried to find a pair of eclipse glasses, but they were gone everywhere. But I figured I could use my phone to see it alright. During lunch (it happened where I was at 11:47 am) , I went outside and held my phone up and tried to see it. Surprise, I really couldn't see it on my phone like I thought I could. I figured if I only looked for a couple of minutes I would be alright. I was wrong. Very wrong. I looked at it for the time it was at the full 90% with my naked eyes, thinking I would be okay. When I looked away I saw a black/purple dot in my eyes. I thought that would fade away. It has now been about 5 or 6 hours since it all happened, and the dot has still not gone away or gotten smaller. 

Tl;Dr didn't listen to advice, and now there's a chance I permanently fucked up my eyes. 

Edit - Yes, I am completely stupid. However after visiting the optometrist, it turns out that there is a very slim chance that I will be have normal sight once again. It just will take several months, if not a year. But I am a pessimist and so I'm not hopeful that that will happen. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. "
