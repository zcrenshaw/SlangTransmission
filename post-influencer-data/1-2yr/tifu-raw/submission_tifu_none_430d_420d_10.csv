0,"TIFU by suggesting Twin Peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.


About two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

As a joke I wrote in Twin Peaks as one of the suggestions.

I am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.

I am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

The day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

About an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

I have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. ""I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today."" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

Other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

It took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

I was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

I came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.

TL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting. Bosses did not research Twin Peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. I got written up for it. "
1,"TIFU by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.


This fuck up took place 15 years ago when I was around 11 years old.   I had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

Now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say ""No pain, no game.""   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.

I removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

TLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.

2,"TIFU by trying to have a threesome with my girlfriend.


So this happened last night. My girlfriend and I have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. Yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. She called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and I agreed.

They come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. I knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. So I play some music and bring out some drinks. Everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.

The girl brought two 4Locos and starts chugging. (For those who don't know 4Locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that's 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) She has two of them. Then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (I didn't drink or smoke at all) By that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the Hennessy I have and starts making out with me. The girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. But a few minutes later she told us she's really tired and wants to go back home. I'm bummed out but we all get in the car and I drive her home.

I'm driving her home down these dark back roads. The whole time she's telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she's sorry for being so tired and all that. Then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds I guess? Anyways I pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. She gets out and starts sprinting down the road (Rip Me) I start chasing her down the the dark road and I catch up. She looks me dead in the face and asked me who I was. I told her I'm her friend and that she's not feeling well and my girlfriend and I was taking her home. She's says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. She waves her arms and screams for help and I grab  her saying wtf are you doing? Then she bites the shit out my hand. I let go and she runs into the street. I'm a black guy with dreads and she's a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. She managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. My girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. The girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. The couple calls the police. The police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.

No sex was had but instead I got a few cuts from the bite so that's kinda kinky I guess.

Tl:dr- Girlfriend comes over with her friend for a threesome. Friend gets drunk and high instead and runs away. Friend freaks out and bites my hand and strangers calls the police. Police takes her home"
3,"TIFU by trying to stand with no legs


This happened about a week ago. 

So some context to this. I was born with no legs. I have never had them they didn't even develop past like 2 inches of a femur but you cant really tell. 

I came home from fishing with my in-laws and was dead tired. I went from door to shower to bed and had no intentions of waking up before 10 hours. My wife woke me up so that way I could eat dinner. So I get up and am totally groggy and not really capable of thinking right.

My wheelchair is right there next to the bed so I scooted to the edge and sat there for a moment. For whatever reason I thought it would be a good idea to try and stand... It was not until it was to late did I realize what I had done but it all became slow motion... the fall... and seeing the floor get ever close. Now I have a very good tolerance to pain. While staying active I have broken bones and cut myself up on rocks and such but nothing was able to prepare me for this... I landed flat on my balls...

I tried to scream but no sound could be heard however I am sure our neighbors dogs were losing their shit. I vomited and tried to move but couldnt even breath. My wife is having a hard time trying to show concern and hide her laugh at the same time. 

She has heard stories about how I have hurt myself in similar ways (waking up late for work with morning wood and nearly breaking my dick on a stair) but she never witnessed one.

The Doctor was stumped on how to react outside of ""heres some pain killers dont move for a while"" 

Also  I swear time become relative cause I am almost positive I watched 2 Alaskan sunsets but it was only for about a hour I was on the floor in a puddle of puke. 

TLDR: have no legs, tried to stand up off the edge of my bed and smashed my balls. "
4,"TIFU by having sex to the Wii Mii Channel theme song.


So this actually happened today, like 2  hours ago.

Ive been in a relationship for about 18 months now. And we have had kind of a dry spell when it comes to the hanky panky time. A little over a  month to be exact. Finally things have started to be less stressful in our lives. We both have jobs again, and money is flowing in.

So to celeberate our first pay checks this week, I decided to cook a romantic candle lit dinner for us. Everything was going great. We started cuddling on the couch watching her favorite rom-com, and the foreplay starts. YES! Dry spell is gonna be over!

So we get up and head to the bed, things start to get really hot and steamy. She goes to find a condom and I get the music playing. So I find a good playlist on my phone and press play. Only issue is I still had shuffle selected from my work out earlier today...

Things are going smooth as butter, the deed is being done and everyone was having a pleasent time. Then the [Mii Channel theme](https://youtu.be/E9s1ltPGQOo) started playing....

I tried my hardest to ignore it, my Girlfriend started to snicker. And before I knew it my head started to bob to the beat of the music. At that point she bursts out laughing and the beast with two backs was no more. 

TL;DR: Was having sex, mii channel theme started playing, no more sex.

PS: Gonna give it another shot here soon. Shuffle is for sure off."
5,"TIFU by trying that one thing with a gun that they do in the movies.


This happened about five minutes ago. tl;dr @ bottom

While I was browsing around on reddit I realized that I had left my pistol laying out on the bed. I reached over and grabbed it, dropping the magazine with the push of a button. I still wanted to clear the round in the chamber, but then I got what has to be my *greatest* idea of the day.

""Wonder if I can eject the round and catch it in the air like they do in the movies.""

So I jack the slide back and immediately let go. I instantly feel that this is dumb idea, but now it is too late. 

The long thin mark on my left thumb is kinda weird. It should fade in a minute or two. But the small chunk of flesh that got peeled back is going to take a while to grow back. 

tl;dr: Tried to catch a bullet moving in the air, moved the pistol slide through a chuck of flesh instead.

Pre-edit before the comments start coming in: Guns aren't toys. I'm a grown ass man that should know better. I received combat arms training while in the military. I'm not suicidal. There are no children in my home, and my roommate would never enter my bedroom without asking first. Unicorns are hard to ride, but even harder to catch since they don't exist. The pistol is legally owned, and I am in compliance with all state and federal laws. Mainly because ""Don't be a dumbass"" isn't on the books in my state. And, FFS, *GUNS AREN'T TOYS,* tales, *DID YOU FORGET YOUR TRAINING?!*"
6,"TIFU by taking a date into a life or death situation to impress her


I met this very attractive girl at a house party. Things went well. Very well. The morning after, we talked a bit and decided to keep in contact. Stuck for exciting first date ideas, I defaulted to my favourite passion - mountaineering. To my surprise and delight she agreed enthusiastically. Absolutely brilliant. The journey there goes well. We're chatty and flirty, and the weather is crisp and clear. We reach the start of the climb bright and early, with enough time to complete it. 

As we climb, I'm assessing her fitness and confidence. She seems confident, warm, and fit enough. At this point I should tell everyone it's the middle of the coldest winter we've had for thirty years. Thick snow abound, we proceed upwards. Although we are obviously underequipped, I make the decision that the conditions permit summiting, with a little care.

Halfway up and it's stunning. The view from the top will be insane. She's beginning to be a little tired, but her spirit is strong. It's still fairly early in the day so we can slow down a bit. The snow and ice are a little thicker here (2ft, 60cm), so I can see why she's tiring. From my experience on the mountain, we'll summit and return to base within maybe four hours, just an hour after sunset.

She's a little quieter now, in retrospect because she's struggling and too proud to say. She gets snow in her boots, but I have spare socks. She reveals it's her first ever mountain climbing trip. I am slightly concerned but she assures me she wants to complete it. The clouds thicken, but we're an hour from the summit and I know we can make it. 

The wind picks up, hitting 50mph (80kmh). I have a thick beard so I'm fine, but she isn't. I lend her face protection, and she assures me again she's fit to complete it, although she looks frozen and exhausted. We soon summit. Temperatures are hitting -12c and wind speed is now approaching 65mph. Spindrift is making it hard to see more than fifty meters. Thick cloud and fog had blown in, and we're two hours behind schedule. She's shivering uncontrollably and it's getting dark. There's no shelter, no respite, no hiding from the bone chilling wind.

The path is dangerously close to the leeward slope, which drops off a 600m (1800 foot) cliff. In this weather, cornicing (dangerous ice that overhangs cliffs) is a risk, and I can no longer see the safe route. We can't stay on the summit and we can't descend by the only known safe route.

Emergency situations. We light our torches and I check our map. There's a grade 3 gully (a steep scree scramble) about a kilometre along the ridge. I weigh up the odds of us surviving in a snow cave overnight. They're not good. We're going to have to descend. She's holding back tears and obviously unhappy. Our torches light up, mine dazzlingly bright against the virgin snow. Hers less so.

After an hour of hard walking through snow at times up to our shoulders, we reach the gully. Looking down, I see nothing but fog, ice, and inky blackness. My head torch lights up jagged rocks hundreds of meters below. It's our only route and we have no choice, unless we want to freeze to death. We discuss it and decide we'd rather risk a fall. 

Her torch dies. 

Fuck.

We begin the descent, knowing if we slip we'll tumble 700 meters to our deaths. There is no chance whatsoever of survival if we fuck up, although I try to distract and reassure her. She's a booky city girl and this is her first outdoors experience, so she trusts me, even though I can see her physically shaking from fear. 

Although we are a little sheltered from the wind it is hitting 80mph (136kmh) in some  parts of the gullies. Spindrift (microscopic particles of ice driven by wind) races up to us, burning our eyes and faces. We have no protection for it beyond a scarf, which she uses. I give her the only pair of gloves we have, tolerating the icy cold on my hands.

We descend painstakingly slowly, maybe a hundred metres an hour. It takes us eight hours of anxiety-ridden, bitterly cold climbing with just one headlight to make it down safely. I go twenty meters ahead of her each time, leaving her in the cold and dark while I find a good route.

The panic is audible in her voice and I know if she breaks she's going to flip out and probably kill us both. I'm calm and professional, talking her through each handhold and step as she comes towards me. She's scared and slow, and inside I know our chances of dying are uncomfortably high. Eventually we make it, but it's not over yet.

At the bottom, we take a moment to recover our wits, but I know there's more. We have to cross a kilometre of bog, and then over a waist-deep river with a thin layer of ice on it. I carry her some of the way, feeling guilty for getting her into this mess. She's mostly dry, but I'm soaked and borderline hypothermic. The effort of movement is the only thing keeping me warm, and if I stop I know I'll freeze in minutes.

My torch begins to die as we make it back to a path I recognise, and by the time we reach the road (at 1am) it's barely a flicker. 

We've missed the last bus.

She puts a brave face on it, but I know we're too cold to stay out long.

We put out our thumbs for a lift, and after an hour a kind lady stops and drives us to somewhere warmer. We get in the car, and she breaks down, losing her temper with me and crying. I sit mutely, knowing I deserve it and that I nearly killed her. 

We make it home safely and never speak properly again. She's unfriended me on Facebook. I'm just glad she didn't murder me as I slept on the way home 😂 

I think she looks back on it fondly but it was a disaster.

TL:DR 

Bag a date with a hot girl, and proceed to nearly get her killed on a terrifying yet thrilling winter mountain climb in a blizzard, with no winter equipment. I don't think she realises how close it was."
7,"TIFU by cutting a lime on the beach and giving myself chemical burns. (PSA)


On the 4th of July I went to the beach. Drank some Coronas. Surfed a little. All was good.

Despite putting on sunscreen, when I got home I realized I was super sunburned all over my chest and back. My girlfriend was too. We both slathered on some aftersun and nursed our wounds....didn’t think much of it

2 days later the sunburn was improving, but I notice a weird rash appear on my stomach. It was a crescent shape, red, raised, and had a bunch of tiny fluid filled blisters. 

Over the course of the day those blisters got bigger and gnarlier. I also found new spots popping up on my back, sides, and arms in various lines. At first we thought it was just from the regular sunburn...but it didn’t make sense that the worst spot would be on my stomach ...which was the least sunburned area.

I started freaking out a bit panicking thinking it was Shingles or Lymes Disease or some bacteria infection I got from surfing. I can’t afford my health insurance premiums right now.

Ended up posting a pic on a doctor/Dermatologist board. One guy immediately suggested it was either  a regular burn or “Phytophotodermatitis”. Others suggested a jellyfish sting.

I knew it wasn’t a normal burn, and I didn’t think it was jellies (it didn’t hurt enough), so I looked up the last option. Apparently Phytophotodermatitis occurs when chemicals from certain fruits and vegetables react with sunlight, causing what are essentially chemical burns on the skin. This can also cause permanent skin pigment changes and scarring in the affected area. 

A second name for this condition is “lime disease” or “Margarita burn”...apparently one of the worst culprits and the most common cause is getting Lime juice on the skin then going out in direct sun. Bartenders are vulnerable for this.

Then I remembered...on the beach that day we were drinking Coronas. I’d cut up a lime for it. Only we didn’t have a knife with us so I used a sharp sea shell. The rash is in the shape of the edge of that shell. I must have cut it then rested the shell on me. The secondary rashes were in areas I probably rubbed with my hands after handling the lime.

Here’s a pic of the main rash. https://m.imgur.com/we9UnDX

So yea, I gave myself chemical burns by cutting a  lime on the beach. Thankfully I’d used a lot of sunscreen that day and was in the water most of it or it could have been much worse.

**Tl;dr** Cut a lime on the beach. Discovered what Phytophotodermatitis means. Gave myself a potentially permanently scarring sea shell shaped chemical burn. 

PSA...don’t fuck with limes on the beach

8,"TIFU By wearing a sock with a tide pod tumor for a five hour shift


A few weeks ago I was folding my laundry when I noticed one of my good socks had the remnants of a tide pod stuck to it. I, being lazy and not wanting to throw away this precious sock, decided to throw it in the drawer and deal with it later. Fast forward a few weeks and I need some socks to go to work. I look at the tide sock. Most of the detergent has dried up. I think about all the good times I've had with this sock and say fuck it I'll wear it today. All my other socks are thin and stupid but this sock knows whats going on. 

I work the drive thru at Chick-fil-A and we do the whole order takers outside thing. So I was on my feet for a good majority of my shift in the hot sun.  I had about twenty minutes left of my shift when I started to realize my foot was really hurting. Kind of stinging. But not the bottom of my foot like I'd stepped on something, but the top of my foot?? I was really perplexed and walking was getting a bit more difficult. When I got home, I took off my shoes and peeled off the tide sock. Immediately I put two and two together. My poor foot had been scrapping up against these detergent chemicals for hours. I felt like my foot was burning away. Now its starting to scab up, a constant reminder of my stupidity. I've been referring to it as my acid foot for now. 

I have an eight hour shift today and I think I'm just gonna put a big ole honkin band-aid over this thing. 

[acid foot](https://imgur.com/a/7yfOXe1)

TLDR: Dont eat, or wear tide pods. "
