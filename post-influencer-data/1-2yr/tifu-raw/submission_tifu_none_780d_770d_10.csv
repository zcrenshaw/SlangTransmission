0,"TIFU By Farting During Mass and Making the Priest Laugh


This actually happened about an hour ago. I'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

So...I'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when I feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

No biggie, this has happened before, I'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. But alas, my body had other plans.

We stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, I'm starting to panic, not sure if I can hold it. We finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as I land on the pew...

IT HAPPENED!

Now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel's trumpet.

The church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

The priest stands up at his chair, says ""I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.

At this point I decide it's a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

TL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church. "
1,"TIFU by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. [NSFW]


Brief summary:

I was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. I took some and expected the typical described results. What I did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. I was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

Ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. Confused, yet dedicated, I proceeded onward. The next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""How could this be happening?"", I thought, but I was far too invested at this point to give up. The next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as I considered the consequences of my actions.  

My little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. Also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. I'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.  

**AFTERMATH: WARNING NSFW(no blood)**

I'm anticipating a few questions so I will address them here:

* Were you ever erect?
     * I achieved at most half-chub intermittently for less than 50% of the entire session.
* Did you finish? 
     * Yes
* Was it worth it?
     * Absolutely not
* Did you use any lube?
     * No
* Does it hurt?
     * Terribly
* Why did you do it?
     * Because apparently I have no self respect.

TL;DR: Got high and beat my dick like it owed me money for six consecutive hours - excruciating pain and shame ensued."
2,"TIFU by having a really high pain tolerance.


So bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. 

Day one: I am lactose Intolerant, and I had a stomach ache, no big deal I probably ate something I shouldn't have. No harm done.

Day 4: stomach ache is still there. I'm a medical professional, I realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. Wrote it off as having too much ice cream.

Day 6: I thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but I shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? This was like 4/10. 

Day 7:  I realized I had a lump near my anus, I thought huh that's not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, I've had a few before no biggie.

Day 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one I've ever had, 6/10 I'll pick up some cream and Advil long lasting relief capsules from Target should be able to push right through.


Day 11:  I start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (I work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. So I go work thinking okay I can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. 

Well I'm not having a vacation now, because I'll be in the hospital for a few days. Apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and I just figured it was a stomach ache. Turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. The doctor told me that if I didn't come to the hospital within the next couple of days I'd be dead. 

TlDR; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn't realize my appendix blew up until way too late. Ruined my vacation.

Sorry for format I'm on mobile, I'm also on Dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. Credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, I was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that I would have died on.


Update: so I had a few people question why I felt Pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? So I talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. The lump I was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.



UPDATE 2: apparently I have Crohn's disease :/ lots of pain at the moment. I'll update once everything is for sure."
3,"TIFU by petting a cute little cygnet (baby swan). [NSFW]


""This didn't happen today"". I am new here, thought it'd be cool to share it here. Brace.

I was an 11 year old kid back then and I liked to pet animals on the first sight of 'em (still do). My parents were making plans to visit the beautiful small village where my father grew up. To Spend a few days and come back. My father warned me a lot about various short tempered animals and birds in there, especially swans. And of course little me didn't pay any attention. I was too busy to fantasize about the cows and goats and sheep (in a platonic way).

So there I was, terrorizing the whole village's wild life (kinda domesticated I guess). Apparently they didn't like to be touched constantly by a stupid kid. By the second day every damn cow, hen, goat, and sheep was running away by the sight of me -praying for my premature death. The crows lost their privacy and peace. They all conspired against me and it worked.

On the morning of the fourth day I went alone to the edge of a big pond on the outskirts of the village and discovered one of the nests of some local swans. Some (3-4) cygnets were playing around it and didn't mind me coming near 'em. One, especially friendly cygnet came near me out of curiosity and I picked it up from the ground in a gentle manner. It was chubby, cute, and warm. As I was looking over the pond while sunbeams touched my face through the red edge of the clouds - the swan mother arrived from the pond with two fully spread wings. I thought she was coming to congratulate me for being the new David Attenborough / disney princess of the village.

The swan went straight for my baby maker and grabbed a mouthful with her beak. I've never received a blowjob till now but her job blew my fucking soul out of my body. The clouds turned black and the sun went dark. Those who think nut hitting is worse than childbirth should try a swan sometimes. I was in great pain. Her wings hit me hard on the rib cage and knees and the silly cunt cygnet enjoyed the whole show from my arms. After 30 or so seconds of agony and Russian Ballet I was finally able to disengage the bastard from my penis. I quickly put down the baby and ran for home.

My upper trousers were soaked in blood. My mother nearly fainted by the sight of me. I just told my father ""swan!""... he quickly grabbed me up from the ground and ran for the doctor's house. I got two stitches on my nutsack and one on the penis and lots of ointments for the bruises on my chest, hands, and knees. The doctor told me that the cygnet saved my face because I was holding it near my face. The mother swan would never attack near her baby. My right seminal duct was nearly chopped off but apparently my blood soaked jeans saved it. 

My asshole sister who never misses a chance, asked me after I came home from the doctor's, ""First period huh? Tell me about it."".


TL;DR : Mother-swan nearly chopped off my balls when I picked up her baby."
4,"TIFU by mistaking shampoo for body lotion


I'm the sort of ""fair skinned"" guy who gets a sunburn when I think about the sun. Last week I went out to walk the dog and water the garden. No more than 10 minutes was planned so I didn't put on sunblock. My mistake.

I burned my inner elbow. The part that folds together when you bend your arm. It does not get much sun and somehow, magically, burned.

I keep scent and fragrance free lotion around for that kind of problem. I'm also a bit dry-skinned so I tend to moisturize my entire body after a shower.

After two days the sunburn was starting to crisp over and crack where my elbow joint was. Leaving open, raw skin to give me pain.

Still, I doubled down on that lotion. Easy enough right? I'm using it every morning! 

By day three it's spreading. My face is dry and starting to peel. My forearms are drying out. My... pole and bearings are drying out - peeling - and the sack is cracking and hurting.

My wife starts to get concerned. I went from thinking ""sunburn + heat rash"" to eczema. I've had that before, but only when I lived in the desert and the air was incredibly dry. I get concerned, when the goods are sloughing off skin like a molting insect it's time to be concerned.

Still, I triple up on the lotion. Working it in *everywhere I'm peeling* to try to counteract the dryness. 

Today I wake up, no change. The broken skin is peeling generously; it's not really getting better.

I shower and decide to go see the doctor. My wife's hesitant to even touch me and, yeah, that's not going to do.

After my shower I reach toward the lotion bottle on the shelf while thinking of the doctor call I'm about to make. Suddenly something registers in my mind. The lotion bottle.

It's been turned backwards all week, so the safety label is what I see - but there is a smaller product logo and my brain tells me to look again. I look again.

""Head &amp; Shoulders"" (for oily hair).

Yup, I applied Head &amp; Shoulders to my sunburn. To my face. To my body. To my Johnson. In an effort to moisturize my skin I'm adding chemicals that want to dry it out...

tl;dr: I've been rubbing shampoo into my body and my testicles are peeling like a snake that's shedding it's skin. Odds of Sexy Time until this clears up: 0%

Edit: Well this took off just a little. Updated facts: 

1. Here's my inner elbow after a day without shampoo: http://i.imgur.com/fIFha6N.jpg

2. My balls didn't sun burn. I use lotion after showers. I thought it was a new bottle of lotion. Thus the spread to both heads, and my back today. 

3. Thanks for the gold - if only it didn't come from my wife and friend who are actively mocking me 0.o

Edit #2:

4. Why didn't I smell the signature scent of Head &amp; Shoulders? Because I have a very weak sense of smell. 

5. Far too many of us have jacked off with shampoo as kids. Pissing fire fixes that fast doesent it?

6. No pics of my dick unless my wife approves of your tits.  PM's welcome! /s"

6,"TIFU by eating expired chicken tenders


At my job, we serve chicken tenders and fries, among other things. They come in a box and sometimes we pre-make them before rushes and put them under a heat lamp for people to grab. After they've been sitting for 45 minutes, they are considered expired and are supposed to be thrown away. It is against corporate policy to eat the expired food and it must be thrown away. 

Pfffft. As if we're all going to do that. 

Now granted, I'm a manager, so I should be enforcing that rule, but it's supposedly for our own safety, so if people are willing to put the risk on themselves, so be it? 

I've been warned by a superior a couple times not to eat it, but usually the conversation goes: 

Her: ""You paid for that right?"" 

Me: ""Yeah of course"" 

And then we laugh and go on with our days because nobody really cares about 10 minute expired chicken tenders right? 

Cue, the new General Manager. 

I'm eating expired tenders in the office with him and the other superior I usually joke about it with. We're talking about some other work related item even though I'm on my break and not supposed to be doing any work whatsoever. She heads home for the night. The moment the door shuts behind her, new GM swings around in his chair. 

Him: ""You get those tenders from a restaurant?"" 

Me: ""Oh no they're from our stand."" 

Him: ""Oh ok. They any good?"" 

Me: ""Yeah they're pretty good. Think they've been getting better since we've been detail cleaning the fryer even more regularly."" 

Him: ""That's cool. Did you pay full price for them?"" 

Me (thinking this is part of the joke): ""Oh you know we get our discount and all that."" 

Him: ""That's weird. I don't see your name on the list of employee discounts for the day."" In my head I'm thinking, damn he's taking this joke pretty far. 

Me: ""Well I thought I paid for them, if I didn't I can go do that right now."" 

Him: ""How do you not know?"" I get nervous at this point. 

Me internally: ""What the fuck is happening"" 

Me out loud: ""Uh well I mean maybe something happened and the transaction got cancelled I don't know I'll go pay right now."" 

Him: ""What do you mean the transaction got cancelled? Did you pay or did you not?"" 

Me: ""UHHH I thought I did but I'll go pay now!"" 

Him: ""So if I look at the cameras from a few minutes ago, I'm going to see you pulling out your card and trying to pay for these chicken tenders?"" 

Me: .... 

Him: .... 

Me: ""Okay I don't know why I'm lying right now. They're expired. I know we're not supposed to eat them."" 

He went on to describe how lying isn't something he's going to tolerate then stormed out of the room. I lost my appetite and threw away the chicken tenders in the office trash can. Fifteen minutes later he called me back into the office, took my keys and fired me. 

To make matters worse, I carpooled with my roommate this day, and had to wait for him to get off in six hours; plenty of time to mull over losing my job for eating expired chicken tenders and fibbing my way into oblivion.

TLDR: I ate expired chicken tenders and lied to my new boss about it. He fired me."
7,"TIFU by inadvertently pepper spraying my family


Ok. So my fuck up actually happened yesterday evening.

I was makiing some hamburgers to go on the barbecue. When I'm making burgers it's quite the process. So here I am, all my ingredients are out, I'm making my burgers. In go the onions, in goes the hot peppers. 

Burgers go on the grill, so I start cleanup. The peppers I have are finely chopped peppers from my garden last year. When I'm putting them away I notice a piece of onion had fallen into the Tupperware with  my peppers and left a moist spot. 

Here's my fuck up. I decide to toss the dried pepper flakes in *microwave* for 30 seconds to dry, while I put other stuff away. I look back with 7 seconds left on the timer and the microwave is **full** of *thick* smoke, and my peppers were on fire!. I opened the microwave, released this pepper bomb into my kitchen. 

Within seconds I'm coughing uncontrollably and yelling at my fiancee to get the dogs out of the house. We couldn't go back in for over an hour and we both were coughing for about 15 minutes. It felt like I had sniffed peppers, and inhaled them. Like pepper burn... on your lungs..

Tl;Dr
Burning hot peppers create harmful fumes. Do not microwave."
8,"TIFU by using google autofill and being convinced that I was secretly a woman


My wife and I have been trying to conceive for a long time. Years actually. No reason why really, but as we investigated, we started with the assumption that she was infertile.

It took about a year of so for her to run all the tests, see all the various doctors, run all the possibilities to ground before we knew definitively she was not the issue.

So I got my semen tested and learned I was effectively infertile. I was producing such a low amount of sperm that it would be impossible to impregnate someone. Also found out that my testosterone levels were very low.

So the investigation continued. The next step was to get hormonal testing done and an ultra sound on my junk, etc. Then I would bring the results to the urologist.

First, a little about myself. I am in my 20s, have competed in several Iroman races, done dozens of triathlons, race bikes competitively, run 20+ miles a week. I like sports and am very competitive. I have a lot of muscle. Look like a lacrosse player. I consider myself pretty manly.

So I never once thought I wasn’t a man.

But I was at my desk at work when my general practitioner sent me the lab results. I immediately started pouring through them, googling terms I didn’t know to figure out what it all meant. I am a huge WebMD user so this was right up my ally.

Well come to the karyotype. The report indicated I have KARYOTYPE 46 XY. No idea what this meant, but I knew it had to do with chromosomes and I knew it was important.

So I quickly typed it into google, looking around as I did it to ensure no one was watching (we sit in open cubicles). I saw the Google search bar auto populate and I hit enter.

Google had auto populated KARYOTYPE 47 XXY. Close enough for me not to catch the error. The first link was a wiki article on the XXY chromosome, otherwise known as Klinefelter syndrome.

I begin reading and the first sentence tells me the primary feature is sterility. I thought, ok that checks out. Goes on to say symptoms are subtle and people don’t realize they are affected for many years, ok that checks out because I haven’t noticed anything yet and am in my 20s

Continue reading, other symptoms include man breasts. I haven't been working out that much and gained a little weight. my overall critical self was like, oh yup I have man breasts.

Went on to say lower libido, and I hadn’t been particularly interested in sex recently, so yup that checked out.

I went on to read that people with the 47 XXY KARYOTYPE often share development features of women, have low testosterone and must undergo testosterone and hormonal therapy to effectively retain masculinity.

At this point, even though all the other symptoms didn’t check out, I was convinced I had this hormonal disorder and quite possibly a woman trapped in a man’s body. I was freaking out, not thinking logically anymore and went straight to sweating at my desk, rapid heart rate, as I scoured the internet and wiki for more information. A coworker came by to chat, and I snapped at her to go away.

It was about 10 minutes after the initial google search that it dawned on me to double check my google search was correct, and relief ensued.

TL;DR got blood test results back, googled a slightly different KARYOTYPE, and spent the next ten minutes of my life convinced I had a hormonal deficiency and was secretly a woman.

UPDATE: This TIFU is a result of my ADD and impulsive google searching, along with my ignorance of biology and science. I am making fun of myself/laughing at myself and wanted to share my experience with ya'll. I have no intention of misrepresenting folks that are transgender and I certainly don't mean to belittle anyone's identity or life experience. 

I also don't mean to insult anyone with Klinefelter syndrome. This was simply a reaction to having my identity abruptly challenged and jumping to illogical conclusions. Thinking I was anything else other than a typical male would have yielded the same reaction.

Also, there is more to the story as to why we tested my wife first. But pls know that I am not a complete doosh. Not only was the decision mutual, but predicated on medical history and other sensitive information that I just don't want to get into. Despite all the logic behind it, I feel horrible that we didn't start with me.

This TIFU has many layers. 

Thanks for all the love :)

EDIT: fixed two grammatical errors."
9,"TIFU and almost drowned


Today I fucked up by almost drowning


This happened yesterday, July 23rd. 


This was easily the closest I’ve ever been to death.


My friends and I were on our way back from the local bike park, about an hours drive from where we all live. We decided, since it was a warmer day, that it would be a good idea to go cliff jumping at a nearby lake on the way home. Especially since it’s literally on the drive home, it seemed like the best way to cool off, rinse the dust off, and end the awesome day of biking we had just had. 


When we get to the cliff, the winds are HIGH. I’ve never seen this lake this crazy. Waves were whitecapping, and the waves looked pretty sizeable. This lake is usually as calm as glass.


What all of us didn’t take into account is the height of the cliff. The cliff is probably ~35 feet above the lake. So what we interpreted as 4-5ft waves were closer to 8-10 feet in height.


 Now, we’ve all jumped here before. Many times. This is usually *the* place to cliff jump. It’s easy to get up the side, by climbing up a rock face and there’s a bay just around the corner, maybe a 5 minute swim (if that) in calm weather. Our plan yesterday was to jump, and very quickly swim back to the bay, which we had already noticed, was very calm and easy to swim in. We are all good swimmers, and we thought that the waves being “4-5 feet tall” that this shouldn’t be an issue at all. 


After about 10 minutes of waiting for the waters to calm down a little at the top of the cliff, we all jumped. I was last into the water out of 3 guys. My friends were already hollering at me “YEAH! The water’s great!”. 


I must not have braced myself correctly, because I instantly got easily half a lung full of water when I jumped. Immediately not off to a good start. I coughed it out pretty quickly, but already this had taken some energy out of me. 


After yelling out at my friends how nice the water was, about 10 seconds later I realized that we were in some serious shit. The waves were FAR bigger than we had each anticipated, and I immediately started swimming towards the bay. Maybe another thirty seconds later, I realized that I was hardly moving, and that I was essentially not moving anywhere. 


I looked back at my friends, me being the closest to the bay at this point, by about 10 feet. I will never forget the sheer look of terror on my nearest friend’s face. Immediately I knew we were in some serious shit. 


I turned around and immediately thought to myself: “Okay, stay calm, focus on not taking on water and timing your swimming with the waves”


This was a good idea, I just didn’t execute it well. I took on a few (I honestly can’t remember) more big gulps of water, barely able to clear my lungs before them filling again. 


At this point I yelled straight up so my friends could hear me “ABORT THE BAY, CLIMB THE ROCKS” and I could hear both of them yell back in agreement. 


As you could imagine, the rock face of the cliff was being absolutely thrashed by these waves. My plan was to time my swimming with the waves, latch onto one of the rocks, and get a firm handhold, stay close to the rock, and let one wave hit me, and then keep climbing. I had done something very similar when I was ocean kayaking a few years prior. 


So, while fighting to keep water out of my lungs, I latch onto one of these rocks, straddle it with both of my thighs, press my chest up against it, and hack up some lake water as I feel the water receding down my legs and back out. 


At this point, a giant twelve foot wave hits me, the impact itself wasn’t the problem, but it pulled me back out with it with a force I have never felt before. I was off the rock in a heartbeat and instantly down to the lake floor, roughly ten feet down. 


I put both of my hands above my head, slightly spread out, to try to feel for any objects above me, and push off from the bottom, away from the cliff. 


I’m now back out to the lake, once again trying to time my swimming with these giant waves. This is where I start thinking to myself: “Is this how I die? Am I going to drown today?” 


Now I’m exhausted, gasping for air, barely able to stay afloat. I can’t swim in these waves much longer. I look to my right and see one of my friends, about fifteen feet over,  up on one of the rocks, just as a wave hits the rock, showering him in water as he disappears from my view.


**Focus** Look at the rock, time it, touch the rock, and climb as fast as you can. 


I swim forward with everything I have and latch onto the same spot I had before, only this time I waste no time, I’m 6 feet up this rock in what feels like half a second. I feel the next wave lick my feet and lower calves.


My second friend is now less than two feet to my right, he pats me on the back and asks “You good?” In between my hacking up water I nod and he continues climbing. 


After about 15 seconds I climb up another 10 feet to a flat ledge, already trying to peer over the rock face to see our third friend. He’s up, about 10 feet out of the water, bent over, coughing up water. I Yell “Hey! You good?” He doesn’t lift his head, just raises his left hand and gives me a thumbs up.


We climb another 15 feet or so, and we’re at the top. All of us flop down on the warm rocks, soaking wet, shaking, and bleeding as the sensation of pain comes back into focus. All of us have scraped up shins, I must’ve stepped on a sharp rock, because my foot is red, starting to bruise, and starting to swell. I’ve never been happier to be injured in my life. It’s way better than drowning in that water. Both of the other guys have minor scrapes and bruises as well. 





I fully realize that this was an incredibly stupid decision, and I’m extremely thankful to be alive. Today has been weird. I feel incredibly lucky that I survived and I cannot stop replaying the situation in my head. 





TL;DR Misjudged how high the waves were. Jumped off cliff into raging water, almost didn’t make it out.

10,"TIFU by spilling coffee on an autistic boy.


WANT TO HERE THE AUDIO CLIP THAT CAUSED ALL THIS CHAOS? [Wake Me Up Inside (Feat. Screaming Best Friend)](https://clyp.it/xhd5hkak)

So, let me get one thing straight first. Spilling the tiniest amount of not particularly hot coffee on this boy is only the tip of the iceberg, and nobody got hurt from this. Physically anyway, my self-worth is hurting. This was a good two years ago, I'm new to reddit, but my self-worth is still hurting thinking about it.

I had four hours of public transport ahead of me, but I was ready for this. I'd created a two hour music playlist, and the other two hours was committed to finishing a book that I never got time to read. I settled in for the first leg of the journey, and put my headphones in. I pressed play.

Things were great for the first few stops, but as time went on, the train began filling up, and the once empty seat around the table I had settled at, became a family picnic area and playground for three passengers who took the seats at the table I was at. It's worth mentioning at this point that I had a window seat. So basically I was stuck, when things went terribly wrong.

So, the young boy, his older teenage sister, who was using an i-pad, and his mother beside me, who was reading what seemed to be a recently bought book from a station's WHSmiths, settled down for the journey. And the young boy quietly played with his toys and sipped his ribena and ate his banana sandwich, all while I happily listened to music with my earphones in at half volume. Everything was fine.

Until that is, the track changed, and a mp3 began playing that I totally did not mean to put on my playlist. My best friends voice, screaming at the top of his possibly drunken lungs 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence began blaring in my unsuspecting ears.

Imagine a full grown man, literally screaming the lyrics, with no backing track, as loud as humanly possible, and I still think people would struggle to fully appreciate how devastating this was to my poor ear drums. It. Was. Loud.

And in my shock and pain, I wrenched the ear phones out of my poor ears as fast as I could, being that I could not get to the phone in my pocket fast enough to not cause possible deafness.

But in doing so, the ear phone swung right into the face of the mother passenger to my right, causing her to lurch forward, spilling some of her cup of coffee on to the table. And the coffee went on her brand new book, her scarf, her daughters ipad, her son's toys, sandwich, carton of juice, and his hand...

Now, this is where it's important to remember that the coffee was not hot, it did not burn the child and the child did not complain or show any shock to this having happened. He didn't even notice the splash of coffee until his mother started yelling.

And boy, did she yell. ""What have you done? There's coffee all over this table, it's on my boy! You've burned my boy!""

Immediately awkward and apologetic, I scrambled to my feet to help clear up, not remembering the luggage rack directly above my head. Down I went, hands on the table, knocking the cup completely over, as I hastily stammered apology after apology. I was a mess.

Well, she was screaming. People stood up in their seats to watch the carnage unfold at our once peaceful table. The teenage girl was crying about her i-pad, immediately stopping by the way, when she realised she'd just hit the side button and it had gone to sleep. The mother was screaming about the coffee on the table, the now spilt ribena that her son had dropped, the struggles of being a mother with an autistic son, the wet pages of her book and the bright red, incredibly embarrassed mess of a 20 year old semi-stood and stooped next to her, attempting to soak up a whole cup of coffee with a single used tissue.

And then... The boy began wailing. He started pushing everything off the table, and - it wasn't really crying with tears - it was just frustrated noise. I felt like an absolute monster.

Needless to say, I got the hell outa dodge. When the woman stepped into the aisle to reach up for her bag, getting out baby wipes and tissues, I stepped out clumsily, apologising continuously, and making for the train door to the next carriage.

With coffee down my front, a bump on my head and a lobster red face, I stepped into the next carriage, then made for the next, and the next, until I was at the other end of the train. And in the eerie silence that compared to the chaos I had just left, I sat and considered how I never seem to be able to have an uneventful train journey. Literally. Every. Time. Something goes wrong. And this time? I sort of spilled lukewarm coffee on an autistic boy.

TL;DR - I jumped, knocked a mother sitting next to me, coffee was spilled, lots of screaming, lots of apologies, probably a mountain out of a molehill."
