0,"TIFU by being a good Dad to my daughter


The TIFU was last night, not this morning.  

As I do most nights, I check on my kids just before turning in myself. My daughter seemed a little restless, but nothing out of the unusual. As I was leaving her room, though, I heard her mutter something. She often just says sweet things like, ""I love you, Dad"" or sometimes she talks in her sleep. Either way I usually listen in. So I paused at the door and asked, ""Did you say something?"" Another mutter and she rolled to her side. I knelt down beside her (she has been opting to sleep on the floor lately). This time she growled a bit and her dinner of hotdogs, carrot sticks, and orange juice made a quick exit onto her blankets, hair, and stuffed animal collection. I sat her up and was rubbing her back reassuringly and she finished coating the remaining blankets and sleeping bag with what seemed like an endless supply of orange liquidy pulp. An hour an a half later we were finally getting her back to bed after a shower and a few more sessions of upchuck/cleanup/rinse &amp; repeat. The 3 other garbage bags of laundry that didn't immediately fit in the washing machine would have to wait until morning. 

""Where's the proverbial FU?"" you're asking. It's right here. See, as a Dad, I like to be prepared and protect and provide for my family should situations arise when I can make life a little more comfortable in hairy situations. I'm also fairly pragmatic in that if I can avoid or mitigate the effects of a disaster I will. That being said, I'm prepared for most emergencies. I've got several boxes of gear with duct tape, batteries, rope, tie downs, flashlights, toilet paper, etc.. They've come in handy before and undoubtedly they'll come in handy again. 

Being an avid reader of all things reddit, I remember from a LifeProTip post that you can help vomiting kids find the target they're aiming for by placing a glow stick in the bottom of the garbage can. Well, this summer's camping trip used up all the little kid glow stick bracelets. No worries, über Dad has got you covered. I'll just dig into my disaster prep stash and break out the beefy, industrial glow sticks. Now what I didn't realize was that these particular glow sticks had been subjected to some pretty intense West Coast heat for the last few summers. The worst thing that could happen was they no longer worked. Wrong.

Heading through the living room I soon found out that the components inside the stick work great. The structural integrity of the plastic stick, however, had become brittle with age and temperature fluctuations. As I bent the glowstick, the plastic immediately burst spewing forth a shower of luminescent liquid. Absolutely everywhere. It hit the ceiling, the walls, full bookcases, the shoe rack, the furniture, the carpet, and the blinds. Everything within a 15 foot reach was coated in a bright, neon green spray pattern that would enthrall Dexter Morgan if he used luminol and blacklighting. For just an instant, I seriously felt like Carl Sagan leaving my comfortable living room and stepping into a magical place with ""billions and billions of stars."" Then reality immediately crashed back in on me when I realized that not only did I spray luminous, oily glow juice everywhere, but also flung the broken, thin glass shards from the capsules inside those sticks. So began another hour plus round of cleaning and glass shard hunting at zero dark thirty.

TLDR: Read a LPT about putting glowsticks in sick buckets, ended up creating a mini-universe in my living room.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words, support, and my most upvoted submission. You're all great! Reading all the comments made my day after such a seemingly long night. And thank you to the golden guilded cherry popper for one of my comments below. Not sure what to do with it, but the gesture is appreciated.

1,"TIFU by having to give my 5yo son $100 for beating my high score.


Happened a couple of hours ago. 

I’ve been playing this game I stumbled across recently. 
You know the ones, free, highly addictive, but jam packed full of advertising. 

Anyhows, I thought I was an absolute champion when I scored 34 earlier today. The first thing I thought of was boasting to my boy when he came home from pre school since he likes the game too. I was all in his face like “I’m the Game King”.  

I figured my 5 year old had no chance of beating my score as the highest I’d seen him get was a measly 21 - and he fluked it, so I told him I’d give him $100 (Australian) if he could beat my score. 

Never underestimate the power of a huge financial incentive. I heard uncontrollable laughter about 15 minutes later. Sure enough the little guy had cracked my high score. 38. 

Parents of Reddit will understand you can’t go back on your word with children. His piggy bank just got $100 fatter and I’ve had to put up with “I’m pretty good aren’t I Dad?!”  :)

TL;DR Got cocky, told my boy I’d give him a $100 if he beat my high score. He did. Never underestimate children and the power of a financial incentive. 


Edit: understandably my original post was removed by mod. Made some small changes so it didn’t appear that I was an advertising genius.

2,"TIFU by falling for a starving musician's absurdly excellent strategy for getting laid


Oblig: So this happened back in my early 20's.  But I consider it a fuck-up (for reasons that will become clearer if you read on; or just skip to the tl;dr for the boring short version).  
  
I met a guy through mutual friends at an after-work meet up &amp; after some chatting he came through with that old chestnut ""we should go out sometime.""  Seemed like a good idea at the time, so I agreed.  We thumbed our respective numbers into each others' mobile phones.  And when he called a couple of days later, we arranged to meet at a bar/restaurant for a couple of drinks and then dinner.  
  
When I got to the bar, I looked around for him and was a little surprised to see that he was sitting at the piano.  At first, I thought it was one of those places where they let anyone with moderate talent have a go, but it was a rather upscale restaurant so it didn't seem likely.  I walked over and said hello.  He finished playing the piece and then sheepishly admitted that he was actually working there.  That was a little weird, but I went with it.  The plan was, he said, for us to hang out and have a few drinks while he played.  And then when his set was up we could go have dinner, because he really didn't have a lot of money but he wanted to take me someplace nice and, anyway he got a free meal during his break from his gig.  
  
I almost decided to bail right then and there.  But he was a pretty good pianist, and he had a decent voice.  I shrugged (mentally) and figured I would stay and listen for a polite length of time and then make some lame excuse.  
  
I sat on a chair next to the piano &amp; nursed a couple of *Cuba libres* while he played.  At some point, said ""it's kinda loud in here"" (admittedly true- the bar *was* getting pretty crowded).  Then he scooted over and patted the piano bench.  I scrunched on next to him so we could hear each other over the sound of the piano and the people talking.  
  
Little did I know that this was the first step in his dastardly plan.  
  
Well, I sort-of knew.  I mean, it was an obvious ploy to get me to sit closer (News Flash, guys: you're *usually* not as subtle as you think you are).  But I thought that was *all* it was, and I was so wrong.  
  
A few songs later, he just stopped and told me ""you know, ever since you said you'd go out with me, I've had this tune in my head.  It's like something beamed it into me, and I can't stop thinking about it.""  And then he played a few notes.  Then he tried out a few chords.  Then a few more notes and chords.  Changed keys.  Fiddled with the time signature.  Diddled around with high keys.  Improvised a bit.  ...
  
... piano playing intensifies ...  
  
Pretty soon, this vague melody starts turning into an actual song.  With a chord progression, notes, fills, and- damn, it's pretty darn good!  I'm like, digging being RIGHT THERE as the creative process happens.  He keeps looking at me and changing things, and every time he does it gets a tiny bit better.  And finally, it's almost perfect.  
  
""Wow,"" he says.  ""It's like it just *CAME* to me.  Like the music was there sitting right next to me or something.""  I blush.  Perhaps heave a bosom or two.  
  
And then the *coup de grace*: ""I think I'll call it Maggie's Song,"" he says.  
  
And that, my friends, closed the deal.  I decided that if he wanted to delve into the Treasures of the Sierra Maggies, he would not need no stinking badges.  

And then, as if by magic, his friend the bartender (who I was introduced to earlier) comes over and tells us that if we want to have dinner he could clear us a table.  We had some nice conversation, finished dinner (he at least paid for the whole thing- I would have gladly gone halfsies even though his meal was on the house), and then he went back to his gig for another hour or so...  
  
&amp;lt;INTERLUDE&amp;gt; I should have figured it out right then, because at one point he announced to the bar that he was going to play an original song ""inspired by the beautiful girl sitting next to me.""  And then he played the song straight through, no errors or hesitation, no pauses to tweak this or that.  But I was so star struck at hearing Maggie's Song's public debut and a little embarrassed by the attention, that I completely missed the obvious.  &amp;lt;/INTERLUDE&amp;gt;
  
We made it to his apartment (barely- I admit to some fairly racy back-of-the-cab macking).  I was only mildly disconcerted by a) his three room mates, b) the fact that his room's furnishings consisted of an end table next to a mattress on the floor, and c) the piles of dirty/dirtier/dirtiest laundry lining the walls.  We did the deed.  Vigorously, and to the tune of Maggie's Song.  No, really- he hummed the (admittedly catchy) melody in time with ...stuff..., which probably was the most impressive feat of the evening.  
  
Eventually, festivities concluded, and I attended to the wrap-up of what was my first (and is still my only) one night stand.  Cab home in the wee hours wearing the previous evening's clothing and a bit of exhaustion the next day.  Not as bad as I'd imagined it to be, actually.  
  
**The Fuckup:**  So, a bit of a tumble with a cute guy who I'd somehow inspired to write a beautiful song that I still had going through my head three days later?  And all it cost me was the price of a couple of pre-dinner drinks and some cab fare home- how is that a FU?  
  
Well here's how:  Two days later, I notice a couple of red welts on my calves and lower back.  They itch like FUCK.  I figure I just got bitten by mosquitoes or something and let it go.  Then more welts.  They heal.  But then two weeks later I get more just like them.  I think maybe I have hives so I make a same-day apt with my doc, expecting to be told to get some cortizone and not eat so much dairy.  But he takes a look and says ""have you ever noticed little back dots anywhere in your floor or carpet?""  And I'm like ""black dots?""  
  
He said he couldn't be sure, but based on my description of the timing he suspected... you guessed it: bed bugs.  And then he told me to buy some OTC benedryl and cortizone cream and said I should try to figure out what kind of insect it might be and not get bitten by it so much.  No word on the dairy.  
  
Sure enough, as soon as I got home and started looking for it, I found evidence of the little fuckers.  Thankfully, I caught it early.  I now know more than I ever wanted to about the subject.  Apparently, it takes a while for an infestation to catch on, so I was lucky that I found it early.  I called an exterminator, followed their instructions to the letter, and was able to prevent a biblical plague.  
  
One of the things I had to do, per exterminator instruction, was contact the owners of any place I thought I might have originally picked up the bugs.  Which meant I would have to get in touch with Mr. Pianist (who had been maintaining radio silence since he wrote and debuted ""Maggie's Song"" and shtupped its muse all in one evening).  He made the usual excuses about not calling (it had been two weeks, so I was well over my initial disappointment) and admitted that yeah, maybe, he might have some bedbugs, but they were totally not a problem.  I was like, whatever, and told him he should call an exterminator and do something about it.  And that was the last I heard of the guy.  
  
Except that at some point later, I was telling this story to one of my girlfriends, and I got to the point where I was at the bar and he was playing piano.  And then she says ""and let me guess- *he wrote a song right there and named it after you?*""  
  
Turns out, Maggie's Song is also Grace's Song.  And Jennifer's Song.  And Jodie's Song.  Or whoever's song who he happens to be trying to screw that night.  Apparently he's got this down to a science.  That same song goes from random twinklings on the keyboard to a full arrangement in a single evening EVERY TIME.  My brief moment in the spotlight was shared with a number of other unspuspecting muses, at least some of whom probably went on to an evening of pleasure and parasites.  
  
And as much as (in retrospect) it was painfully obvious, that didn't make it any less painful.  I felt so stupid.  Years later, I would watch How I Met Your Mother and realize I'd once been had by something that could have been right out of the Barney Stinson Playbook.  
  
tl;dr: got asked out by a starving muscian.  inspired him to write a song.  melted.  got lucky.  got bedbugs.  found out i wasn't really the inspiration.  "
3,"TIFU by kissing my best friends wife while he saw it.


This happened tonight so its a real TIFU. 

Came over to my friends house to help him out with his garage. A few beers where had as were laughs and all the whatnots of a casual get-together with friends. Some more people showed up and it turned into a small party, after all was said and done people were ready to go to bed. 

My friend, his wife and I were sitting around playing music and jamming, when he went outside for a cigarette me and the wife hugged, like many in our group of friends do, thanking for the evening. And I dont remember if she kissed me first or I kissed her first or if we both did at the same time, but we kissed and made out for a couple of seconds. And we hear a knock on the window.. 

My friend comes in, punching and kicking both our asses. Mopping the fucking floors with me, beats the everliving shit out of me and tells me to get the fuck out. I bail and since we were pretty far from any town and didnt have any money for a cab I had to spend the night in a abandoned caravan. Got some texts from another friend of mine earlier today saying that my friend wants to divorce his wife because of our fucking stupid mistake... FUCK..

I fucked up, reddit. Big. I want to bury myself in a hole in the fucking ground. 
How can I fix this?

TL;DR Went to party, made out with friends wife, got the shit rightfully beat out of me. Probably caused a divorce. I fucking hate myself. Im so sorry buddy...
"
4,"TIFU By getting into my boyfriends car.


Obligatory this didn't happen today but rather about 4 years ago (I have a reason for saying that so calm your tits).

My (then) boyfriend (now husband) and I went to Orlando a few years ago (in October actually) for a surprise/engagement trip. We ended up taking his mom's white Chevy Volt since it was better on gas than our vehicles. At the time, I was working at a bank (just started actually) and had the sweetest co-worker ever. Super young, very religious, parents were die hard Pentecostal people. Anyway, my boyfriend still had his moms white car, as he was going to swap out vehicles the next day. He was picking me up from work, he had texted me a few minutes earlier to let me know that he would be there soon. We had a big window at the top of the staircase that looked out to the parking lot and when I saw a white car pull up, I high tailed it down the stairs so we could go home. I run across the lot, fling the door open and hop in. Much to my dismay, the driver is *not* my sweet boyfriend, no. Instead, she's an older lady who I had never met so I did the only logical thing I could think of, which was to scream ""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?"" at the absolute top of my lungs at. Then I realized, this is *not the volt*, I jumped into someone else's car and screamed at them. I jumped out and ran back across the parking lot, back into the bank and called my boyfriend and asked where the hell he was. 

Next day at work, my co-worker pulls me aside to ask if I might have possibly screamed at her mother the night before. Whoops. 

TL;DR Got into the wrong car and screamed profanities at an older lady.

Addition** Yes, I know the title is sort of misleading. I genuinely assumed I was getting into his car, obviously I was not, but that's why I named it that. It was a little more catchy than ""TIFU by getting in the wrong car"". For those of you who are getting pissed and commenting ""click bait"", just call me Buzzfeed and move tf on. 

** for those of you who think I'm an asshole.  Yes, yes I am an asshole. But this was a legitimate mistake. I know I startled her, but I panicked and ran out. No I did not go back and apologize because I was too embarrassed. My co worker and I had a fine relationship afterwards so there were no hard feelings left over. She teased me about it a few times. 

** This was 4 years ago. I cannot go back and apologize to the lady or my coworker. I no longer work there and I lost touch with her after she got married and quit. I don't even know what her last name is to reconnect with her on social media. "
5,"TIFU by throwing a toaster into a tornado


This happened in may just so we are clear

My area received several tornado warnings and people were advised to be cautious and prepare necessary items to ration e.g. batteries, flashlights, water, and other stuff.

I already did everything I needed so I thought of an incredibly dumb but interesting idea of throwing stuff that didn't work into the path of a  twister, considering it'll be someone else's problem by that point.

Enter EF1. I spotted a rope tornado moving easterly to my location so I grabbed my non-functional toaster and started to drive like a son-of-a-bitch i was. The sight was surreal as I approached that fucking vacuum of death, with debris flying like a motherfucker and wind howling like my granddad's loose farts. I quickly placed the toaster in its path and it took it. But what I didn't expect is to receive something back, and that was a fucking 2"" nail speeding at me. 

Like a bullet, that thing penetrated me harder than anything I've received, and to make matters worse it hit me just below my shoulder where I was previously operated on. Long story short, I had to explain to a doc and insurance company why I had a 2"" nail in body.

edit: ok ok i get I'm stupid 

tldr; i fucked up by dumping a toaster into a tornado, which resulted in me being penetrated by a flying 2"" nail

8,"TIFU by taking back candy from poor mannered children


First, I understand I overreacted these are kids and I shouldn’t of let this affect me as much as I let it. Also this happened like 45 minutes ago I have the note that says I have a meeting with the dean of students to be scheduled sometime Monday.

With that said let me give you some knowledge of things before the incident that has now placed me into administrative detention or whatever they wanna call it.

Our dorm allows neighborhood kids to come in and participate in trick or treating during Halloween. Me and my roomate bought way too much candy so that we could be “that dorm” we’re talking full size snickers and everything.  We kept the door open and played fifa while the kids would come by and take candy from the box we set outside. 

Now I don’t know if all kids are like this but taking literally hand full of full size snacks and having their parents just walk by and not say anything.  Hand full after hand full of course the majority kids were very nice and only took one or two which was fine. 

The first incident came where the kid has asked his mother “how many can I take” she responded with “well there’s no note here honey. So you should take as many as you want” loud enough for us to clearly hear it and gave us a look. The kid only took two so we let it go. My roomate looked at each other and said “some people suck”

Now for the TIFU part, this bratty fucking spawn of Satan little girls comes and screams “lazy” since we are here playing fifa. Proceeds, to take at least 10 full size snickers and isn’t stopping. I stand up run to the door and take back all the candy she took from us. Which of course means she starts crying and howling how im really mean and I’m not sure what else (it was not English at that point). Which also introduces douche bag dad, who then gets in my face threatening to fight me until I give his daughter the candies she wants. Now I’m no macho fighter guy but this piece of shit is like 5’4 not that intimidated I stand my ground not saying anything which turns into a screaming match where I say numerous thing I’m not proud of. Specifically, is “that wife beater a costume or real life”. 

After getting separated by other parents and roomate he goes and complains with other parents and I am now sitting in my dorm waiting for to be informed of my colleges decision on what they are going to do to me.

Tl;dr Got into argument with douchebag dad during Halloween in my dorm. People complained about it and now I’m awaiting college decision on what my punishment is.




Update: Just gonna clarify some stuff 

Yes it was October 27th my dorm allowed kids to come in to trick or treat despite it not being October 31st idk why.

Yes random people are allowed in as long as they have a kid I think.

I didn’t say anything racial or hateful to the guy when we were screaming. 

I 100% agree on I should of put a note, I should not have tried to discipline a child or let it get to me and I should not have engaged in a screaming match of a father.  (Corrected my use of shouldn’t of and should have 😎)

I feel a lot of people agree with my actions because they were shitty people, but aren’t focusing on how the university is going to see everything that happened. I took candy from a child and made an aggressive presence in the dorm by arguing with the dad. 

While I stand by my actions I know they were not something to do in a college dorm when I am representing them. However, I will not apologize for my actions when it comes to the father, I felt threatened in my own dorm by some asshole. 

I plan on accepting whatever consequence comes from this after I explain my side of the story and just hope it does not affect my sport scholarship or my college life.

Will update one last time Monday after the meeting with the dean"
9,"TIFU by getting my haircut by my barber while he was high on crack.


TIFU :This was not today but actually 2 days ago.

So a little back story. I have been going to this particular barber shop for the past 5 years and have been having my hair cut by the same guy named Jason. He has always given me a decent haircut and for a decent price. Never have had a problem with him and is usually a good guy. This barber shop is not in the best part of town, and it's a kinda run down shop.

So I walk into the shop and everything seems normal and I sit down and await my turn as Jason is the only barber, and he is cutting someone's hair. As I wait longer things just seem a little off. The tv was playing static and he had a t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants and he had glasses on. Seems normal but that's not what Jason usually wears and I've never seen him with glasses before. 

Anyway the guy in front of me was finally getting done with his haircut after about 35min. On his way out he tells me good luck. Now I was just thinking he was joking with me and I just shrugged it off.

So I sit in the chair and he just starts to trim my beard, which once again, seems normal. But, he has never touched my beard and he didn't even ask what I wanted to be done with my hair. 

 I  end up shrugging it off and I just sit there while he is cutting my hair. As he is cutting my hair he keeps moving really fast like he is in a rush and has more customers to get to. But, I am the only one in the shop. Ok, now things are starting to creep me out a bit. But I think that it could also just be me working myself up over nothing.

Jason is about 5min into my cut and out of no where he just says, ""He is trying to get him to rape her!"" I reply by asking where he heard that from. Jason then goes on to tell me that it was on tv and then proceeds to point at the television that is only playing static.

At this point I start to get weirded out but I don't want to leave because, to be honest, I didn't know if he was fucking with me. But things just get weirder and weirder. So, I start to record on my phone and place my phone in my lap and record what he is saying. He then proceeds to make very weird comments about things that make zero sense.

Anyway, 25 minutes have past and I just felt him go over the back of my head with the trimmers for the 30th time and I have yet to see my ""in process"" haircut because the mirror is behind me. I tell Jason to stop and I act like I have to sneeze and I turn around and look at my hair...

I'll leave the photos on here so you can judge for yourself.

TL:DR
Went to barber of 5 years, turns out he was high on crack and gave me the worst haircut I've ever seen on anyone.

10,"TIFU by forgetting to finish the back side of a questionnaire and losing what could've been my life long job.


Just got back from a short but very awkward, disappointing, and extremely embarrassing meeting with what was going to be my trainer for one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. I was so looking forward to helping families with their finances and was more excited to make a lot of money at the same time. I can finally get out of this dinky apartment and live a life I wanted all these years. 

I gave him the incomplete questionnaire and he turns it over only to see blank. 

I was asked to leave immediately. 

This should not have happened. I know I have a good head on my shoulders, never committed a crime, I'm inspired to work hard, and I'm willing to lay down all of my time to work at a company I want to work for. Only to be shot down for this stupid, stupid, mistake... I'm disappointed in myself and I should be. 

Well... I'm back to the drawing board. I hit a wall but I gotta keep building momentum for the next opportunity I get.  This... won't happen again. 

' TL;DR 

I forgot to finish the backside of my work assignment and did not get hired. "
