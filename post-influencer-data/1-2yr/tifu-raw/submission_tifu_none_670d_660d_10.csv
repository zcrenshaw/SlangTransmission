0,"TIFU by running over a dead body and getting my car covered in human remains. (NSFW)


A little info, This took place yesterday on the Nevada/Arizona state line in Mesquite NV.

So yesterday morning My wife and I were driving to work at about 5:30 AM, it was pitch black outside and I was only about 5-10 minutes from my home. I was on the freeway and approaching an overpass when I saw a dead animal in the middle of the freeway (it was all in one piece before we hit it), I didn't swerve because I was going around 75 mph, I slowed down as much as possible and we drove right over the top of it. The whole left side of the car felt like it went up in the air and there was an impact like we just hit a rock or something. 

We pull over and my wife calls 911 she says something like ""We just hit a dead animal, I think it was a deer."" They said they will send highway patrol to help us and clear the animal. We are about 1.5-2 hours away from Vegas, which is where the NHP is based out of. We sit on the side of the freeway for about 40 minutes with no one showing up while the sun starts to come up. We got out of our car and could see the bloody mess smeared across the freeway about 100 yards behind us, we inspect our car and its a mess as well. There is blood and bits covering the entire bottom side of our car and it smells very strong, like a freshly butchered deer. 

While I'm inspecting the underside of my car a truck pulls over behind us and two guys get out, They both are on their phones and looking back towards the roadkill. I walked up to them an said ""Did you guys run over the deer too?"", and one of them turns to me and said ""There ain't deer in mesquite."" This freaks me out a bit, but I assume its just a large animal of some sort. Then I hear one of them say ""I think its a body, I saw shoes"".

At this point I'm freaking out and I go back to my wife and tell her that they think its a person. So we both get back out and see one of the guys from the truck walking across the overpass to the  roadkill. The other guy gets a call and answers ""Is it a person, it is? okay."" So my wife hears that and starts walking towards the body. I follow her trying to talk her out of it saying ""You don't want to see something like that babe"" But she just kept walking so I went with her. 

As we get closer to the largest mass we start seeing clothes (all black) and chunks of meat. The smell is so much stronger at this point but if it wasn't for the clothes you wouldn't even be able to tell its a person. As we get right next to the body I could see him literally smeared across the whole freeway, as cars are passing they going far to left and still running over small chunks of meat. At this point the police show up and ask us to go back to our cars. The truck and 2 guys left immediately because they weren't involved and didn't hit it, but the police asked my wife and I to stay. 

We watched as the police closed the entire northbound side of the freeway off, routing people off the off-ramp. We went back to our car but the smell was unbearable. A detective told us we could we wait at the police station but we have to leave our car on the freeway and that they might impound it. 

An officer gave us a ride to the police station and told us kind of what happened. He said that it was a male and he actually got hit (and most likely killed) by a semi right before we ran him over. They said they suspect its a man that was ""Up to no good last night, and his actions led to what happened to him."". This didn't really make us feel any better about the situation. 

So we sat at the police department for about 3 1/2 hours before they actually came to get our statement. Then an officer took us back to our car and said they don't need to impound it. I asked if they can clean it and he said there is not much they can really do because they have no way to lift it up and get underneath it, He told us our insurance would probably be able to take care of it. So we got in our car and drove home. My wife called the insurance company and since we have a 1000 dollar deductible and there is no real damage any cleaning is going to come out of pocket. 

So I decided to drive to the local car wash (the kind with the foamy brush and the pressure washer). I decided to take a better look before we cleaned it and got on the ground and saw that the entire bottom of my car was COATED in flesh and blood, I felt sick but just powered through it and started washing it off. I spent a solid hour trying to clean it all off and used all the cash I had on me. I went home and let it dry for a while, then looked back under and still saw they was hair and flesh all jammed up in my axle and various bolts, I also saw that a piece of the plastic cover under the engine can loose and there was a lot of pieces up there too. So since asking various people, I decided to get in contact with a disaster clean up service and see what they can do for me. I'm just waiting to hear back from them. 

I hope this is appropriate for this sub, it feels good to vent about this. This was one of the worst days of my life. 

I would post pics but I don't think they are appropriate for this sub. 

[Here's a news story about it](http://www.thespectrum.com/story/news/2017/11/10/man-dies-after-being-hit-semi-truck-highway-mesquite/854062001/)

TL;DR: Ran over what I thought was a deer, turned out to be a dead dude that was killed by a semi moments before and had to clean him off the bottom of my car. Still didn't quite get all of him off. 

&gt;NSFL Edit : Not that they add much to it, but for the curious, here are some pics. They aren't THAT bad, but they are chunks of person under my car: [1](https://i.imgur.com/tNaM4Eb.jpg)---- [2](https://i.imgur.com/aKQvBhW.jpg) ----[3](https://i.imgur.com/Fm4XgE9.jpg) ----[4](https://i.imgur.com/1ALfil6.jpg) The 3 of my car are after I tried to clean the underside of my car. 

&gt;Edit 2: A lot of people are asking why I called 911 if I thought it was a deer. Pretty much I thought that having a large dead thing in the middle of the freeway while it was still very dark out was dangerous.

&gt;Edit 3: I guess I could have seen it sooner if I had better headlights but I did have enough time to slow down slightly before hitting it but I'm lucky I didn't swerve to either direction because I would have ended up going flying off the overpass or into the middle of the freeway possibly into oncoming traffic. 

&gt;Edit 4: Thank you all so much for your support. Just knowing that so many of you are concerned and offering me advice makes me feel a lot better. But right now I've been getting a handful of people trolling me and just being generally annoying and disrespectful I think I'm going to step away for a while and get my mind off of things. Thanks guys I think I'll come back and answer questions later.  

&gt;Final Edit: [Here is another news story about the incident](https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2017/11/10/cgb-man-killed-on-interstate-in-mesquite-after-being-struck-by-semi/#.Wgem1miPKUn) Thanks to everyone for your support and helping me feel a little bit better about a horrible situation.

This happened last night. 

So I'm a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. The day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new LAV microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). Unfortunately, I didn't know this. See, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. The new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. I think you can kind of see where this is going. 

So anyways, there was one part where I had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. So after I get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. Once I was offstage, I began changing directly in front of the door I had just exited. This was because I had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before I returned. So this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of Thor Almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to THE ENTIRE CAST AND A GOOD 40% OF THE AUDIENCE. I freaked the fuck out and turned into [Patrick fucking Star](https://youtu.be/Kaqa2N_O-KE) as I ran to shut the door. Here's the FU. 

So here I am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, I reached out to grab the doorknob. I made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and I instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned American ""MOTHERFUCKER!"". I swear to fucking god the door stretched as I was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing I know, I was on stage, PANTS STILL DOWN, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. Turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where I was standing. So yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. On top of that, I didn't just say it, I screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. Here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:

""Say, do you like canned salmon?""
""I'm quite fond of it, yes.""
*door opens*
""Oh, there he is! This is my husb-""
*skinny Asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*
""MOTHERFUCKER^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!""
*door slams*
""....Well....how do you do Madame?""

Safe to say I'll never be in another production at my school again. 

TL;DR- I unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. 

In words of the old Western prospectors: GOLD! YEEE-HAWWW!!! Thanks, Stranger!

EDIT- ok I don't know how mics work, sorry!
ANOTHER EDIT- If you know who I am, shhhhh 
AND ANOTHER- numbers. "
2,"TIFU by mentally scarring my female co-worker NSFW


This happened last week but am still brooding over it 24/7 so hoping getting it off my chest may help...

So anyway, work in quite a large office building. One of those offices shared by multiple companies. We have normal male and females bathrooms but also one unisex bathroom which only has a single toilet and the unspoken rule is that it is female only. I believe in equality so disregard this rule regularly.

I always check to make sure the coast is clear and press my ear against the door before exiting to make sure I don't hear any footsteps in the corridor.

So one of my regular uses of this bathroom is to expel any unwanted gas. My office room is mostly women so being a gentlemen I never pass in that confined space. I go to the unisex bathroom, blow my trumpet and return with no one the wiser.

I sensed a disturbance from the depths so headed for the bathroom as usual. I was on the edge of erupting so had to sprint walk with every muscle clenched. In haste, I forgot to lock the door behind me.

Now when I expel I also like to pull down my pants and underwear because I am always mindful of the smell clinging to the fabric of my clothes and hanging around with you for most of the day. Probably paranoia but better safe than sorry. I pull down my pants and launch. Was a great one. A perfect B flat minor.

I peered over my shoulder because it felt a little harder to pass than usual. Sitting on the floor was a little poo nugget. Not too large, maybe the size of a medium strawberry.

That's when my life changed forever. I heard the door handle jiggle before it swung open.

There I was, naked from the waist down looking over my shoulder at a piece of my own shit.

It was a small Asian woman. She looked at me, then at the poo and then back at me. Pale as a ghost. She quickly shut the door as I heard her heels scurry back down the corridor.

She's not with my company but I still recognized her from the break room. For a week now I haven't left my office. I don't want to see her and feel like she's told everyone and they won't stop staring at me. I like this job but part of me wants to skip town and never return. This is what you get for being chivalrous!

TL;DR A female co-worker walked in on me in the unisex toilet just as I had accidentally pooped on the floor after trying to pass gas. "

This happened a few hours ago and I'm still dealing with the aftermath.

Typically, I'm a morning person, but I couldn't sleep last night due to stress from work, etc, so I took a few unisom to help me doze off. Fine, nothing out of the ordinary. I wake up this morning, feeling like the grouchiest asshole this side of the Atlantic. My wife and 10yo daughter are fighting about some dumb thing or another, which is an all day/every day thing as of late. All I want to do is make a cup of tea and smoke a cigarette, but everybody seems hellbent on getting in my way and stressing me out first thing in the morning. The screaming match wakes up my 2yo son, adding to the stress. He starts crying. The water in the kettle starts boiling. I'm pissed off because not  only did I wake up to a mild approximation of the Battle of Normandy after getting very little actual sleep, but we're out of tea, my mug is missing, the unisom hadn't fully worn off (that stuff makes me extremely irritable), and to top it off, I can smell shit. I was ready to flip the fuck out.

The Fuck Up:

I ask my wife if she'd mind cutting out the screaming match and just take our daughter to school, and pick up a box of Tips on the way back, but she ignores me. My daughter bolts out the front door like a horse in a thunderstorm. My son had stopped crying, but absolutely did not want to have his diaper changed. He starts running away, laughing, having a blast. I finally catch him, but getting him to lie still was all but impossible. When I finally manage to get him onto the changing mat, he starts kicking me repeatedly in the face and chest. I lose it, hold down his little legs, undo the velcro-ish straps, and...fling the shitty diaper as hard as I could across the room. It took a moment for my sleep-deprived mind to realize what I've done, and when it finally catches up, I turn around and see an arc of shit across the ceiling  (a *popcorn* ceiling, no less), ending in a Jackson Pollock of shit all over the wall and my TV. To top it off, by the time I turned back around, the poopy-butt toddler is gone. I find him sitting in his brand new car seat, eating peanut butter with his bare hands.

I ended up calling out, so I could clean up the *SHIT* and not go to prison for murdering someone at work.

Tl;dr: Couldn't sleep, took sleeping pills that make me irritable, woke up to utter chaos, lost my temper while trying to change a diaper, flung a shitty diaper across the room resulting in a disgusting modern art masterpiece across the ceiling and wall."

Many today's ago, when my wife was just my new roommate, I dropped her pyrex measuring cup and broke it.  Seeing as we were still in the getting to know you phase, and I didnt want the person sleeping in the next room to be plotting my death, I surveyed my options and went with the most respectable of the cowardly choices; I went out and bought what I thought was an exact replacement, swapped it, and never spoke of it again.  Fast forward a few years, turns out not pissing her off was a good thing.. we became friends, partners, and got married.  One morning I wake up to hear a ding, followed by a boom, followed by   screaming.  She's grabbing her face and there are glass shards everywhere, and she's screaming that she cant see.  The ER is close by, so I get her in the car and we floor it.  After a really scary intake process she's seen, treated, and things start to settle down a bit after she's given a room.  Her parents show up, right after the doctor has been in to scold her for being so careless and tell us that any damage should be temporary as long as she follows her treatment plan which includes keeping her eyes shut except to put in her medicated drops for a while.  All the while she's trying to defend herself, saying she had microwaved that cup plenty of times before, that she got it from her grandmother, that it was  borosilicate glass!  That's when the puzzle pieces fell into place for me.  I realized too late that pyrex had long ago changed their formula from the stuff that tolerated heat to the stuff that explodes into shards of painful confetti when heated.  So now I have to come clean in front of everyone that I caused all this.  Everyone is (understandably) pretty pissed.  
TL;DR:  Broke my roommates family heirloom,  replaced it so she wouldn't know, ended up making her my wife and then had to drive her to the hospital when the effects of my jerk choice blinded her."
5,"TIFU by playing Never Have I Ever


Thanks to the fuck up I’m writing this on my phone so I apologize ahead of time for any typos. 

So last night a few friends came to my place to pre-drink before going out clubbing. We were drinking vodka in glass bottles (fuck up #1) and began playing “Never Have I Ever.” Naturally, the game got pretty kinky after a bit, and it concluded with “never have I ever had sex on a table.” You see where this is going. 

So anyway, fast-forward 4 hours, post-club. I bring back one of the fine young ladies we were pre-gaming with and, given that McDanks was closed, we decided to make ramen. Classic drunk college students. So I place a pot full of water on the hot plate on my table (we don’t have an actual stove in my apartment) and wait. One thing leads to another and we start hooking up and (determined not to lose in Never Have I Ever next Tuesday) we eventually move to the table. Meanwhile the water is full on boiling, my laptop is out on the table playing music, and the vodka bottles are still out on the table. One of the legs of the table ends up SNAPPING OFF (we’re not that heavy I swear), sending everything on the table crashing to the ground, including us, as well as said boiling water, which conveniently lands all over my MacBook. 

I spent the whole morning not only chugging pedialyte to cope with the hangover, but also picking out shards of glass from our feet (couple goals) and watching the water continue to drip out of the USB port of my laptop... 12 hours later. I suppose we lucked out in terms of the water not landing on us, paying for skin grafts is definitely far worse than the price of a laptop, but it still sucks throwing $1200 down the drain. TIFU. 

TL;DR 

Played Never Have I Ever, which gave us the brilliant idea to have table sex. Said table breaks, sending boiling water straight onto my MacBook. "

I fucked up big. I should start by saying this happened today and my bathroom is perfectly clean.

At about 4 today I was dropping my kids off to the pool and around the 3rd wipe I went DEEP and was terrified to feel something down there start wiggling. At first I was like OH FUCK and started to retreat before I realized some kind of bug must have managed to get up on the toilet seat and got swiped right into my ass as I was reaching around.

Heres the fuck up. Once I realized what was going on i had the instinct reaction to push and squeeze this little fucker in as many ways as I can to guarantee once i pull out the wad of TP that hes gonna be 100% dead. Immediately regretted this 10 seconds later upon having half a centipede in the toilet and the rest of him caught in my half-wiped asshole. 

TLDR centipede managed to get in my back door and I made him leave in pieces"
7,"TIFU By Taking A $5,000 Picture


Obligatory, this didn't actually happen today, but two weeks ago.

I was working at my temp job as a front desk person at a fancy apartment complex in Chicago. The day was going extremely slow, and I was very bored, so I decided to work on my logo (for a cartoon blog I was starting). I eventually finished the and wanted to take a picture of it. Unfortunately, the lighting was terrible, so I hung it on the wall behind the front desk which had better lighting. I immediately took down the logo after taking a picture, finished my shift, and then left for work. The next morning, I came into work and there was a repairman there. I asked him if he needed help and he said, ""Yeah. I'm here to fix the wall. Some idiot temp from the temp agency hung up a picture of some shit and it tore off some of the paint."" He then showed me the spot where the tape from the picture had ripped off the paint (I kid you not. The damage was the size of a fingerprint). The repairman continued to fix the wall while simultaneously talking shit about the ""idiot temp."" When he left, he said, ""So, who are you anyway?"" I just said, ""I'm the idiot temp,"" with a straight face, and it was immediately awkward. When the manager came in, I apologized and told her it was a mistake. I also said I was prepared to pay for the expenses, thinking it’d be like $40-$50 or something. Turns out, the building had spent $5000 to make that wall, and it was painted with real gold paint. The manager then told me that you could still see the spot (which is kind of bullshit. you could see it if you really looked for it while standing at an incredibly specific angle). I apologized again and she told me to go back to work. I spent the rest of my shift in fear of having to pay $5000. When my shift ended, I went home, still without answers. That night, my temp agency called and told me their insurance would be covering the wall and that I shouldn’t come into work for the last two days of my assignment. I asked them how this would affect me at the temp agency, and they told me not to worry about it. However, I haven’t heard a word for them for two weeks now, so I’m starting to really worry.

TL;DR I hung up a picture at work and tore off some paint of what ended up being a $5,000 gold wall. Thus, I was fired."
8,"TIFU by asking an innocent question


I work in a local supermarket on the hot-food counter, I’m trained and specialise on the meat and fish counters but now and again I help out on the hot bit. Anyway, a customer over the weekend ordered over the phone 150 cooked BBQ drumsticks (we RARELY get big orders) to be picked up on the day I was working, so I helped out on the order to cook them and serve the customer. Not to blow my own trumpet but I have quality customer service and always try to make the customers day by idle chit chat. It makes my day knowing I’ve made someone smile. As I’m bagging up this big order, I politely ask ‘are these for a big party today then mate? What are we celebrating?’ really enthusiastically to which the customer responded ‘no, for a funeral buddy’. This was the most excruciating situation I’ve ever been in, and how did I cope with it? I had the biggest nervous laughter fit ever. The customer kept asking why I’m laughing so hysterically, and I apologised profusely saying it was a nervous laughter fit as his answer caught me off guard. He didn’t find it funny at all, he kept saying how his day was horrible as it’s been so stressful, making it harder to stop laughing. I kept apologising to no resolution, infact he complained to my manager at the lack of my professionalism and I’ve got a serious meeting with the store manager tomorrow. FML

TL;DR asked a customer what is he celebrating because of a big order of food, he responded ‘for a funeral’ and that sent me into a nervous laughing fit, resulting in a complaint to my manager and a meeting with the store manager.

Edit: 
I'd like to just clarify: I was not laughing *AT* the poor man, *OR* his misfortune, nor did I find any of this funny. It was the unexpected monotone answer to my enthusiastic question that threw me off guard and my coping mechanism for this was to laugh. Yes I felt terrible but in that situation I couldn't control myself.  

**Thank you for the gold kind stranger!**"

This fuck up happened not 20 minutes ago. My husband and I have a ranch and we were outside feeding horses, collecting eggs, etc. He stopped to pee by my horse trailer and I thought it would be hilarious if I ran at him and tried to shoulder check him as hard as I could whilst he was tinkling, dong in hand. I should note that he's a lot bigger than I am but somehow I thought I could catch him off guard and make him pee on himself. Here's where I fucked up: my dumb ass TOLD HIM what I was thinking. So I run at him as fast as I can and hit him with my right side/shoulder. Jesus. H. Christ. It felt like hitting a brick wall. He tensed up when I was running at him and absolutely destroyed my brilliant plan. Not only did he barely move from my attempt at being a super awesome wife who makes her husband piss himself in a moment of vulnerability, but I completely knocked the wind out of myself and thought I had broken all of my ribs and one of my boobs. My life flashed before my eyes, I crumpled to the ground like a cheap discarded hotel bathrobe, I started mentally writing my will. I caught my breath a few seconds later but still felt like I'd managed to completely shift all of my ribs to one side. I'm pretty sure nothing is broken but I'll be shocked if I don't wake up tomorrow feeling like I tried to imitate the Kool-Aid man. 

Tl;dr tried to make my husband pee on himself. Possibly dislocated some ribs instead. "
10,"TIFU by leaving wild mushrooms out on the counter


CW: total gross out


So, this actually happened yesterday, but after the events of the day I was in no position to concern myself with same-day TIFU cred. 


It all started on Sunday, my partner and I took a spirited jaunt through a nearby coastal forest, collecting interesting and delicious mushrooms along the way. We picked up a nice porcini (*boletus edulis*) that, upon returning home, was promptly added to a delightful risotto. Along with the porcini, we had also picked up two very large boletes of as-yet-unidentified provenance. 


When I say very large, I mean these things were about 9-10 inches tall and probably weighted a few pounds each. Although they had a few key differences from the porcinis that I usually collect, after researching they were identified as being most likely a local variant of *boletus edulis*.


*Nota bene: Unless you want to submit your own TIFU about shitting your pants or liver failure, you should never, ever, ever eat a wild mushroom without being 100% positive of the ID. When in doubt, throw it out!*


We had ruled out any poisonous options for the huge boletes, so the only thing left to do was a taste test. I fried up a few pieces of cap and stem in a skillet separate from our meal preparations. The taste was not bad, but not as rich and savory as the classic porcini. I will say that the boyfriend wanted nothing to do with eating these things. I should have taken note of this, as he's usually the more adventurous when it comes to strange mushrooms. I wasn't sure if I wanted to dry them out or throw them away, so I left them in the wicker collecting basket on the counter.


Monday comes, after a long day of work and hitting the gym, I want to come home and watch some dumb shows on Netflix. Not particularly keen on cutting up these mushrooms for the dehydrator. In the basket they stay.


Tuesday is a long day for me. Work, then doctor's appointment, then yoga, then meeting friends for drinks. I get home around 10:30 and the first thing I notice is the horrible, horrible smell. Like the dumpster behind a fish-processing facility. 


Now, my partner is a big fan of God's own monstrosity known as the lobster mushroom, a thing that looks and smells like a wad of rotten garbage. I knew he had been cutting up some of these vile things and thought perhaps there were some leftover bits and pieces that had gone particularly ripe. Without turning on the lights, I grabbed the cutting board from the kitchen and hustled it out the back door. That's when I noticed that my collecting basket on the counter looked almost empty. 


At first I thought that BF had stopped by and perhaps had a second thought about eating those mushrooms, but then I noticed a growing puddle of liquid seeping from underneath the basket. That was when I realized, the giant mushrooms hadn't gone anywhere, they had utterly and completely putrefied. 


Quickly I grabbed the basket and tossed the contents over the back porch railing. Even before I turned on the light, I knew it was gonna be bad, but still nothing could fully prepare me for the horror that would await. Underneath where the basket had been, soaking in a putrescent brown liquid, were THOUSANDS OF TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS. Like literally thousands. The wormy liquid had also soaked into the dishtowel where I had lain my clean dishes, and onto the dishes themselves. 


Are you ready to die yet? Because it gets worse. The whole nightmarish scene was unfolding directly above my open dishwasher. Which meant that my dishwasher, too, was now full of hundreds of maggots. As was my kitchen floor and every corner of my kitchen counter. 


I'll spare you the further details but I eventually handled it, mostly by dying inside and also burning my house down with a flamethrower. I will never feel safe again, also stay away from shrooms, kids, it's just not worth it.

EDIT: you crazy fuckers asked for pics. NSFL, obvi.
