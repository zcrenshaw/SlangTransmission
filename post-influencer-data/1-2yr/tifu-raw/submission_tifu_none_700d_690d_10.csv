0,"TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.


Our friends fighting for net neutrality contacted us to ask if we would once more make a stickied post about this topic. Since net neutrality is important for everyone who wants to keep enjoying a free internet - a group to which  most redditors belong - the mod team has decided to allow it:

---------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.

Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.

We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

Thanks."
1,"TIFU by going jogging - I'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.


Unlike most TIFU posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

I'm a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, ""Man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

I'm thinking to myself, ""What the fuck?"" So I'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I'm thinking, ""I've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don't need this shit"" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I've never trained for this.

This little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I'm trying to run backwards away from him. We've covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I'm thinking, ""How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I'm a grown ass man. This is bullshit.""

I try running again and he keeps flying after me. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don't want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?"" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

This was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

I cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

This is bullshit. I'm covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.

TL;DR I'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I'm covered in blood.

EDIT: A small amount of proof from the initial moment of not realizing what was happening: https://imgur.com/a/SxZ7Y

2,"TIFU by making a North Korea joke to pay my power bill


Today I learned that Venmo takes the subject of your payment very seriously. 

Every month when the power bill comes up, my roommate alerts us of in a comical manner. We've received the Star Wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the Stranger Things intro sequence, you get the idea. Well this time I get a link to a subtitled North Korean news broadcast, link [here.](http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/NORTH-KOREA-POWER-BILL) So naturally I send my roommate the money via Venmo with the subject ""North Korea is best Korea.""

Within seconds, I get a notification in the Venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by Venmo's compliance department per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. There is a 48hr hold on the payment and I'm required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. It's been about an hour and I've already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as ""Can you not??"" 

It would seem that [there is a list](http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on Venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. It's been a fun morning.

TL;DR: Paid power bill with subject ""North Korea is best Korea."" Got flagged per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. Still haven't been able to pay the power bill...

Edit: Here's the Stranger Things one he did for us last month: Removed as it had our actual names on it

Edit #2: And the Star Wars one: https://brorlandi.github.io/StarWarsIntroCreator/#!/AKrfBcVlS4JDf-QEeKBw

Edit #3: Despite all this annoyance, Venmo is still really useful and I'd recommend it. Just avoid funding rogue states and terrorists while you pay for mundane items. It's hard, but I'm sure you can manage. 

Edit #4: They let the payment go through. At least their CS dept is pretty quick on these things. I hope that video made someone's day at Venmo. Now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. My monthly payments to the KGB and ISIS are late...

Edit #5: Removed Stranger Things link due to personal info issues.

Edit #6: Looks like the link to the vid in question is currently kill. Not sure if hug o' death or what. Meh, just keep F5'ing. What could go wrong?

**Edit #7: Link is no longer kill. Be gentle.**

Edit #7: Obligatory ""Thanks for the gold kind stranger"" or whatever edit.

Edit #8: [Proof for the doubters.](https://imgur.com/DQuGYwr)

Edit #9: No mirror for the link available. My roommate whipped it up at his office and we don't have a local copy of it. Hopefully the reddit hug ends soon enough for people to be able to view it. Sorry :("
3,"TIFU by trusting the advice of a 15yo and ended up with a second-degree burn that covered 85% of my body


Obligatory disclaimer: this happened 20 years ago when I was still in my late teens/early 20s. (I'm a male).

Having always been a bit self-conscious about my pale skin, I had started at the time going to a tanning salon. It was always the same two ladies at the front desk and they always gave me great advice. They actually introduced me to a bed that was part water bed and part tanning machine. It soothed me and helped me deal with my crippling anxiety as well as give me a nice gentle tan.

So, one day, I enter the salon and,instead of the two ladies that usually worked there, I saw a girl who looked 15, maybe younger. I asked her where the two ladies were and she told me she was doing an internship at the salon and that the owners were gone for lunch. Well, whatever. I ask her for tokens for the waterbed thingy and that's where shit started to hit the proverbial fan. Teeny girl replied that the waterbed was under maintenance but, wouldn't you know it, they had a brand new tanning bed that I ABSOLUTELY should try. I ask her a bit more about that new bed and she tells me that it's the best they have and that it's called the PowerSun 3000, or something like that. Immediately, I ask her...""Errr, with that name, are you sure I'm going to be fine, given that I'm blonde and pale as fuck?"" ""Sure, it's extra safe!,"" she replies. ""So, should I book you for 30 minutes?""

Like an idiot, I said yes. Despite all common sense.

So, I entered the cabin and stared at the monster in front of me. It was about twice as big as my usual waterbed thing. Alarm bells immediately start ringing in my head, while the shy part of my brain tried to turn them off. I wasn't about to crawl back to the front desk and ask for a refund. I'm a man, dammit!

So, I took my clothes off. Yes, all of them.

The first ten minutes felt good. Kinda warmish.

The next ten minutes, I started noticing a mild headache.

During the final ten minutes, I was in mild pain and felt as if I had been placed in an industrial oven.

So, I left the tanning bed early. Two minutes early exactly. I had spent 28minutes in that thing.

I walked back home feeling exhausted and aching everywhere, a bit as if I had the flu or something. I went to bed and slept for a bit. When I woke up, I felt pain all over my body. I went to the bathroom and almost screamed when I looked at myself in the mirror. I was naked. While the parts that are always exposed to the sun (face,forearms,etc) looked only reddish, the rest of my body was a nasty shade of bright red. Like, red like the label on a brick of tomato soup.

I went to the doc, obviously, who diagnosed me with a second-degree burn on 85% of my body. He prescribed a cream and paracetamol (Tylenol).

Obviously, the Tylenol did nothing for the pain. Even having a single bedsheet on top of my body was excruciating. I remember once, my lovely cat decided that now was a good time to jump on my legs while I lying in bed. I think the scream that followed must have emotionally scared her for life.

Then, after a while, came the blisters. I had blisters all over my body. They were so large that sometimes they would pop during the night and completely wet the bed due to the liquid contained in them.

I spent hours and hours peeling layers of dead skin off my body. You've never truly loved until you've spent an hour trying to peel off dead skin from your still-painful balls at three in the morning.

All in all, it took me about three to four weeks to feel normal again.

My only regret is that I didn't live at the time in the kind of country where you could sue for millions for stuff like that. At least I could have consoled myself with bundles of cash...

TL/DR: went to a tanning salon and, despite having a sensitive skin, trusted the advice of a 15yo intern who wanted to make a big sale and sent me to the most powerful bed they had, which caused me a 2nd degree burn on most of my body and weeks of pain.

Edit: RIP inbox

Edit 2: yeah, I will check for skin cancer

Edit 3: I live in Belgium. It's normal here for students enrolled in technical or professional schools to alternate between inclass theory and internship at local companies"
4,"TIFU by adding 1,000,000-scoville capsaicin extract to my stovetop popcorn.


As is obligatory, this actually happend a while back. About a year, I'd guess. Fall weather makes me crave popcorn, and I'd rather eat packing kernels than microwaved (not that there's much difference). (Yes, I'm trying to make the word limit. Bear with me.) 

So anyway, I get the bright idea that super spicy popcorn would be a great invention. Hell, I thought, I've never seen it in stores, so I could probably patent it, make millions, and retire to a (brief) life of coke and hookers. (I may have been drunk at the time. It passes the law of probability. And it's probably in stores already; I just never buy pre-popped popcorn.) 

Anyway, so I have this bottle of 1 million-scoville extract, so I add a drop to the popcorn oil. Is one drop enough? Maybe two. Or three? Meh. Just pour in what looks right.

So I'm sitting back at my computer while listening to the popping start. And after a minute or two my nose starts running, my eyes start burning, my nose starts burning and my eyes start running, and breathing becomes like inhaling razor blades. Da fuq.

The only door to my apt is back through the kitchen, and the closer I get, the more intense the sensory attack. I can't hold my breath because I can't stop coughing. Somewhere during my mad dash to open the door, I realized that the capsaicin oil had been atomized by the heat and popping, creating an atmosphere of, essentially, pepper spray.

tl;dr: I popped stovetop popcorn in seriously intense capsaicin oil and fumigated myself and my apt with pepper spray.

**Edit: Holy Scheiße! Woke up to a stuffed inbox. Eh. Will do my best to respond to everybody, but...**"
5,"TIFU by accidentally selling my girlfriend's birthday present I gave her back in August


Back in February I bought a pair of tickets to Zac Brown as a future birthday present for my girlfriend. As I sat on the surprise I began to have second thoughts: was this romantic enough, does she actually like country music, will they even play Chicken Fried? (The sort of deep questions that keep a grad student up at night.) Struggling with the dilemma, I conceived a brilliant and foolproof plan. I would post the tickets on this StubHub exchange my buddies had mentioned, ask for a ridiculous 250% of face value, and if someone bought them before her birthday I could get her something even better! WCGR?

Flash forward to August and she opens her present, a non-stick frying pan with the tickets concealed inside a fried chicken birthday card (despite the gag, she's really quite fond of that pan). Needless to say she was ecstatic and has told all her friends, my parents, her parents, everyone. We've been listening to the new album ever since. Nailed it!

Yesterday in lab (2 weeks before the concert) my phone vibrates and I have an email from StubHub. Huh? ""You've sold your tickets!"". What tickets? But I took those down months ago, didn't I...nope, I did not. I'm an idiot! She's going to kill me. $500 for two concert tickets, what kind of a fool would pay that? (A fool who still has a girlfriend to take out)

After 30hrs of anxiety, I realize the only solution is to tell her. I stuff the cash equivalent in an envelope, write on it: ABC^2 Investments LLC (our initials) and the memo ""Because my boyfriend is an idiot but I still love him anyways"", and head over to her place. The envelope burned a hole in my pocket the whole evening! Just before I left, I swallowed my pride and explained to her how I had accidentally sold her birthday present but as a consolation really beaten the market. Think of all the concerts, brunches, and chick flicks we can go to now, eh!? She looked at me half amused, half perplexed and simply asked ""How can you be so smart and yet such an idiot?"".

I must have had the same look of shame, guilt, and embarrassment that her dog used too make when it had failed to meet expectations because she burst out laughing and we fell on the floor. Despite the smile and gaze that let me know she still loved me, her words made it clear ""I was definitely in the dog house"".

TL;DR: Bought concerts tickets months ago for my girlfriend's birthday, put them on StubHub during the interim at 250% in case I came up with a better idea, forgot about that, gave them to her, she was super excited, and just found out they've sold (two months after her birthday/two weeks to concert)."
6,"TIFU by eating dinner, getting stabbed &amp; making medical insurance think I was suicidal


Obligatory: Didn't happen today, happened around 8 years ago

When I was around 13 or 14 I was at a buddies place, we were just hanging out having a good time when dinner rolled around. We ate dinner in relative peace while watching a movie, his family like to keep the lights off when watching a movie (this is important).

So movie ends and being a good guest I take my plate to the kitchen and have a quick chat with his mom. Afterwards I decide to go back and just relax for a little while back on my seat, now at this point I should stop and mention 2 things.

* 1 The lights were off and it was night
* 2 I hadn't used my knife throughout dinner

So as I approach the couch my teenage brain goes ""slide into your seat, you'll look so cool"" it was not cool.
The moment I hit the cushion on the other side I knew something was wrong. I didn't feel any pain just a strange discomfort coming from the left thigh. I shift a little and still see nothing. I ask my friend to turn on the light as I need to see what is ""poking into my leg"" light comes on, I look down, lo and behold there's my knife from dinner. At least the handle portion of the steak knife any way, sticking straight out of my thigh.

Panic ensues and my friends begin to freak out, the host of the evening offers to pull the knife out. I promptly shut that shit down. So we decide to test whether I can stand, the fire like pain darting through me said I couldn't.

We eventually resort to calling my dad to come through and take me to the hospital. He arrives but we realize that we're sitting in the same problem as before in that I can't walk to the car. ~~Un~~fortunately for me the host of the evening was really into lifting weights at the time and decided the best course of action would be to carry me like a child to my fathers car. The ride to the hospital was a very silent, very uncomfortable and very shameful trip.

When we did arrive we immediately asked for a wheelchair, the nurse guy brings it out and stands in front of the car waiting. I communicate to him that I can't even step out of the car or move the leg without feeling like literal hell fire is coursing through my body. To this guy's credit he definitely showed his willingness to help but unfortunately effort and capability are 2 completely separate things. As soon as he picked me up (from the left, I live in a non-american country) the knife handle squirmed against his stomach. I've never wanted to punch a nurse as badly as I did that night.

Eventually he gets me into the chair and off we go into the ER, go through the door and get admitted. Another nurse comes through and says she's going to have to cut me out of my pants to apply the anesthetic (to remove the knife). Now you need to understand that these jeans were the most expensive pair I had ever and still have ever owned and they were brand spanking new. So being the brave 14 year old dumb shit I was told her to ""just pull it, I can take it"" 2nd nurse I've ever wanted to punch in the face.
Eventually the pain subsides and I manage to pull my pants off to apply the anesthetic. 

New problem arises, before they give me anesthetic the doctor arrives and asks me some questions about how this happened, I explain it to him but conveniently forgot to mention I didn't actually use the knife for dinner. He understands it that I did use it for dinner and therefore must have food particles/segments on it. Immediately he reaches for a MASSIVE syringe with some rubber tubing on the end. He fills the syringe with water or some disinfectant and threads the tube through my wound (all live by the way) then takes a ""punch you in the dick"" stance and bashes the plunger on the syringe to flush anything out. Straight up black out pain but somehow I stay conscious through it.

Afterwards he hits me with that sweet sweet anesthetic and stitches me up. All goes good. About 4 months later my mother gets some calls from the medical insurance, querying why her 14 year old son has a self inflicted stab wound. It took almost 2 months to convince them and their lawyers that I wasn't suicidal and didn't need therapy or be taken from my parents. 

We all laugh about it today as the whole string of events was very funny.

TL;DR Ate dinner at a friends house, sat on an unused knife and went through a night of goofy chaos and horrible pain, nearly got sent to therapy/taken away from my parents"
7,"TIFU by pepper spraying my entire apartment


Short background: So the roommates and I are fans of an interview show that involves eating hot wings of increasing heat. We love hot food and thought it would be fun to have some people over and do our own version after buying most of the hot sauces from the show. My first fuck up came when I bought a 3x more concentrated version of the hottest sauce. It can't be used without dilution or it could hospitalize you... Needless to say, we didn't try it, but we did set out a small dish for everyone to see.

Cut to the next day when we are cleaning the dishes. My roommates and I put all of the dishes from the wings in the dishwasher, sans scrubbing. BAD IDEA. Not even five minutes later, the three of us start having little coughs. No problem, it's cold in Wisconsin and we all had been a little under the weather recently. Then the coughs become more violent. I'm talking full breathed, loud, ending with a gag kind of violent. We look at each other through teary eyes to realize the heat from the dishwasher had vaporized that Satan's splooge of a hot sauce, and our entire apartment was filling up with it. We rush to turn off the dishwasher and open as many windows as possible, but it is too late. By the time we make it into the hallway, we're crying, slobbering, and gagging like the shit you find at the end of your porn blackout rabbit hole.

Our neighbor across the hall hears us dying in the hall and opens her door to ask if we are ok. Before she can finish her sentence, she begins gagging and coughing. Through the coughs we try to explain what happened. Rather than hang around, we ditch the apartment and head to the bar down the street to order beer and milk. Now we look like some creepy ass McPoyle brothers drinking milk in a bar. After over two hours in the pub, our slightly altered judgement convinced us to head back and see if the coast was clear. Thankfully it was, but we learned a solid lesson that day. Scrub your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.

TL;DR We put a dish of 1,000,000 Scoville hot sauce in the dishwasher and fumigated our apartment complex with pepper spray."
8,"TIFU by burning the goddamn fucking popcorn


Edit: by coaching I mean my fiancé coached me by shouting instructions from the other room because she figured I was a competent adult who could figure out how to not almost set our apartment on fire making popcorn, so it's not her fault 

edit edit edit: ok so she didn't explicitly say to use olive oil.  That was a choice my dumbass made independently.  She said ""use oil"" and I chose to use it. Still not her fault. 

We don't have a microwave because im a fucking dumbshit millennial pseudo environmentalist who up until this point thought I was saving myself from cancer by not owning one but after last night I'd rather voluntarily stitch two lab grown tumors to  my nutsack than deal with this terrible shit again. 

Never made stovetop popcorn before. Fiancé is coaching me. Little bit of olive oil in the pot, heat it up, put the kernels in, shake them real good wait until they're done popping and there ya go.

Step one. Heat up oil. Fiancé gives me pro tip: put one kernel in. When that kernel pops, the oil is hot enough. The sole kernel pops. Success. I start to pour more of the kernels in. 

I swear to fucking god it was like Kim Jong Un decided to rain fucking nuclear popcorn kernels down on my apartment. No sooner did they hit the oil did those tiny projectile corn shoot up out of the pan and fucking deck me in the arms, face, and hair. I screamed like a little girl and slammed down the lid, listening to those fuckers pop and thinking about how all the shitty choices in my life led up to being pelted by scalding hot kernels. 

Instructions at this point were to shake the pan back and forth until the popping slowed down, then put it back on the heat for a few seconds until it started again. I'm shaking the goddamn pot like a tambourine. The hellfire ceases for a moment and I, as instructed, turn the heat down and put it back on, keeping it on for a few seconds.

No popping. Is it done? Do I need to hold it for a few more seconds to pop the rest? 

This five second internal dialogue apparently granted those tiny corns the time gap needed to perform the satanic murder ritual  required to open a goddamn direct portal to hell in the pot. Smell burning, take it off the heat, open the lid, and literal hellsmoke billows out of the pot. This is thick, oily smoke, and I know that every time I drunkenly put popcorn in for twenty minutes instead of two was a cute preschool recess compared to this literal hell.

I frantically shift through our dishes for a bowl. I can't find one. I end up pouring the utterly fucking decimated kernels into a colander before I tear off my shirt and barrel ass to the windows, opening them, fanning the smoke detector in a last ditch effort to save our neighbors from evacuation. 

The house is still tainted by the evil that took place last night. My clothes still reel of burnt popcorn. My colander is burnt from the oil. And I'm buying a fucking microwave.  

TL:DR burnt the fucking popcorn 

Edit: 

So I've learned 

1. Microwaves don't give you cancer 
2. Microwaves don't give you cancer 
3. Microwaves don't give you cancer
And, finally, Microwaves don't give you cancer "
9,"TIFU by being forced to buy $80 of crack


So, last night around 1 AM I was taking a walk cause I felt like shit about screwing up my band's performance earlier. I was less than three minutes into said walk when some fat chick comes up and asks me for ten bucks with which to buy gas from her neighbor. Feeling a need to be a good person and help out where I can, I begrudgingly agreed to accompany her to the house since all I had on me was a pair of 20s. Idiot move number one. We get there, and I'm pretty keen on getting my $10 in change and getting the fuck out. And then I see the two big guys milling about.

She says the guy who was selling the gas also sold weed, and basically I got the vibe that things would go a lot better for me if I just bought what they were selling at this point (like I'd fucking smoke weed from these people) based on the shady guys milling about. I'm already aware I'm in over my head, but it really hits me when instead of coming back out with $10 change and a small bag of weed they usher me into the house and say I need to talk to the dealer guy face to face.

At this point I think it's safe to say there wasn't any car. 

So they bring me inside, and I know instantly, as if I needed confirmation, that this place was a crackhouse by the looks of it. Trash everywhere, dingy, dim lighting, about a dozen or so sketchballs milling about with crazy eyes. I'm herded into one of the bedrooms, where this guy is sitting on his bed asking me what's going on. I explain how I got here, and he gets real confused and it comes out that this stupid bitch has been feeding everyone a different story and has basically personally robbed me of 20 dollars. Her dad, who vouched for me saying I'm a frequent customer at his deli (I've been there like five times ever and I didn't even know he worked there, but I certainly wasn't about to say that) yelled at her for robbing me for a little while then when back to milling around. He was basically the only person there I wasn't at least a little bit afraid of. 

The big guy whose room I was brought to said he was getting weed or something and basically the weed guy was coming and I should wait for him in the living room. Fine, OK, I'll just get this shit and get out of there and toss it when I'm out of sight and mind. Well, after a long and terrifying hell of a time in this filthy shithole with an oddly pristine kitchen floor, the weed guy shows up (I was repeatedly offered crack by the stupid asshole who brought me here) and it turns out he was expecting me to pay him.

 As this series of misunderstandings escalated, this middle aged guy pulls me aside and says my money is gone and we need to go. As he's walking me out of the neighborhood he tells me this is a serious crack house and they were gathering in the kitchen because they were getting ready to kill me and sell all my stuff. The reason they don't fuck with him is that he's a Blood from the '90s and he usually carries a pistol with him. He says I remind him of his little brother (a statement definitely more relating to my being naïve and leagues out of my element than any visual resemblance, me being a pasty Italian who looks like Steven Hyde with mascara) and he doesn't wanna see me get hurt, so we need to find an ATM to pay off the weed guy so he doesn't get violent. Once at said ATM I realize he means MY money, and I'm too terrified and not thinking straight when he tells me to withdraw 40 (I had exactly 49 in the vault). He has me give him my number and asks for my address, which I don't give and instead tell him I'll be outside the popular local restaurant where I work. He says he'll be back to make sure I get my money's worth in weed so I'm not walking away totally ripped off.

As I'm sitting at my job, one of my coworkers came out and I stopped him and told him what's going on. He asked me why, if the guys don't know where I live, I didn't just go home and call the cops. Somehow it never occurred to me. He drove me home, even though I live a 15 minute walk away, and when I got home the Blood called. I told him to just keep the money, that I wanted to wash my hands of this whole mess and be done with it for good. I haven't dealt with anything since then, but I still am on edge. Hopefully this is the end of it. Some friends and my little brother keep insisting I should call the cops since I remember where they live, but I have strong doubts that an experienced crack house wouldn't be prepared to deal with cops on a moment's notice and am afraid they might prowl the neighborhood (the place is only 20 minutes or so away walking) looking to hurt me if I say anything. So, yeah.

**TL;DR** I tried to help some lady buy gas from her neighbor, ended up in a crackhouse buying an overall total of $80 in crack for them and only escaped because some old gangbanger took pity on me."
