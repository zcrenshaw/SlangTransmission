0,"TIFU by cleaning my ass with a comb.


This happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.

To start, some context. I always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.

Another thing to note is that I always take a comb with me to the shower as I find it helps ""rub in"" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new [comb](https://i.imgur.com/MdY4S21.jpg) that I hadn't seen before. 

Now that that is out of the way, let's get into the Fuck-Up. My shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. After about five or so minutes of soaping, I moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. This is where I dun goofed. Upon seeing this new comb, I decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. After using said comb, I realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. 

&gt;The following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is NSFW. Proceed with caution.

When I saw the handle, for some unknown reason, I built the thought process of ""This handle is so thin, I bed I'd be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it."" Was it sensible? No. Was there reasoning behind it? Nada. Was it a good idea? Absolutely not.

That thought was immediately followed up with ""Why the hell not,"" which was then followed by a comb, of which I had never seen before, going into my ass. Now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, I got the god awful idea that I should clean the inside of my ass. How, you ask? Stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. 

With the handle now soapy, I returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. ""Whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,"" I thought. I. Was. Wrong. The stinging only got worse once I pulled the comb out. I then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.

Fast forward to nearly an hour later and I am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.

Over all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.

&gt;TLDR: I stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. Not a good idea.

&gt;Edit: Too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!

&gt;Edit #2: My ass feels fine now. I've eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.

&gt;Edit #3: A lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since I forgot to specify that I had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. No, thankfully, it was no one else's hair product that became my booty stabber. 

&gt;Edit #4: #Alright, who did it? Who guilded the booty stabber?

&gt;Edit #5: It was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. The *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!

&gt;**Also, the comb was mine, don't worry. I had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.

&gt;Edit #6: Yes, I have ADHD, and yes, it is treated. I am a happy, yet easily distracted curious Charlie!"

2,"TIFU by using a Pokémon Go Plus as a vibrator at the mall.


Throwaway account for obvious reasons, and on mobile so forgive the bad incoming auto-correct.

So a little background. I had been visiting family out of state for Christmas. I was there for two weeks, and it was a great time. The thing is though that in order to save money I stayed with them at their house, rather than at a hotel. It was a great financial help, but the thing is (and I’m sorry for the upcoming descriptiveness, per say) I’m used to “self completing” every couple days or so. And I really am not comfortable masturbating in somebody else’s house.

Soooo over the last couple days I was feeling more and more...in the mood, lol. Going two full weeks without getting off basically made every little thing trigger my brain to full-horny mode. I still didn’t feel comfortable taking care of business in my sister and brother-in-law’s home though (although I did consider it). My flight back home was earlier today, and I was sorry to be leaving but was quite excited (no pun intended) to get home and go to town tonight.

After landing and getting my bag from baggage claim, I did have a stop to make. My work secret Santa took place while I was out of town. They knew I’d be late, but I still hadn’t picked up the gift to give so I went to the mall on the way home. This was my first mistake, lol. 

I should mention that I am a pretty avid Pokémon Go player (level 36, team Mystic if you’re wondering). As I was walking around the mall, I remembered that this particular mall has lots of pokestops. I opened the game up and started playing. During this entire time, I still had masturbating in the back of my mind and was kind of trying to hurry up in the mall so I could go home.

Then I got an idea. Pokémon Go Plus is an accessory for Pokémon Go. It is basically a button that you press to catch Pokémon or spin pokestops for items without actually opening the game. When there is a Pokémon or pokestop in range...the Go Plus vibrates repeatedly. I went to every single pokestop in the mall and placed a lure module (increases Pokémon spawns at the pokestops) and also dropped an incense (increases Pokémon spawns around the player’s avatar). So I maxed out the amount of spawns in this mall. Stuff was spawning like crazy...then I went into the ladies room and into the first stall.

I unzipped my pants, took my Go Plus, clipped it to the inside of the fly of my jeans in *just* the right spot, and zipped back up. I’m also wearing tight skinny jeans and going commando (I always do when I fly...not a fan of getting a wedgie while stuck in an airplane seat next to a stranger so I can’t fix it), so at this point I basically have my Go Plus pressed directly against me pretty snugly.

And this, my friends, is your brain on hormones: I start walking around the mall, focusing on where I knew pokestops were located. This thing was vibrating non stop. It’s not the strongest vibration in the world, this obviously isn’t it’s intended purpose, but when you were in my...err...state of mind, it was driving me up the wall.

I basically couldn’t take it anymore, I ran into a foot locker and bought a team-branded shirt for my secret Santa gift, paid quickly and decided I need to go home and take care of business *now*. I’m basically race-walking through the parking lot my Go Plus is still vibrating repeatedly. Did I mention it’s icy out? And that this parking lot hasn’t been salted?

With my mind focusing on other things...I slipped. I tried catching myself with a Sears cart-corral, but all that did was cause me to flip around as I kept slipping while grabbing on to it. I slammed into the ground face-first. It hurt. Bad. Especially my arm and my crotch. I got to my car as quickly as I could.

I dislocated my arm while hanging on to the cart corral trying not to fall, and when I slammed onto the ground...I broke my Go Plus in my pants in the process. Remember how I said I had it in just the right spot? Now there was a shard of plastic sticking out of what can only be described as just the wrong spot. I pulled it out and the bleeding ensued. Not gushing, but bloody and painful. I keep a first aid kit in my trunk so I got it out and put some neosporin and a band-aid basically on my clit. Then, I went to the hospital and had to get my arm re-located.

So now I have no Pokémon Go Plus, a still-sore arm in a sling, and it’s gonna be a few more days before I can actually take care of business while I wait for my business to heal. When it comes to putting a Pokémon Go plus in your pants, 0/10 would not recommend.

TL;DR was horny, put a Pokémon Go plus in my pants for the vibration, got distracted in the mall, left the mall, slipped on ice, dislocated my arm and stabbed my crotch in broken Pokémon plastic."
3,"TIFU by listening to Tenacious D around my 2yr old daughter.


Yesterday afternoon, I was cleaning the house while my 2yr old was at her kiddy table coloring and I was in the living room with her, cleaning, and had my earbuds in while I was listening to my playlist (which includes all the Tenacious D albums). I should mention that I have a soundbar stereo system that also has Bluetooth connectivity.

If you're familiar with the works of Kage and Jables, you'll know of a song called, ""Double Team"". It was at the end of this song that my earbuds caught around the vacuum I was using and yanked them out of my phone, prompting the phone to connect to my sound system automatically. Over the speakers comes the ending of the track, which is Kage and Jables saying, ""Hail Satan!"" back and forth.

After reconnecting my earbuds, I looked at my daughter, still coloring, apparently oblivious to what just happened, and continued cleaning. About 10 minutes later, I'm in the kitchen to grab my daughter a snack, when my sweet, innocent, 2yr old baby girl in the room over starts saying, ""Hail Satan"" while continuing to scribble happily in her Frozen coloring book.

Being the poor father that I am, I began to laugh like a madman at the image of a 2yr old saying those words. That was a bad idea, because now, whenever my daughter wants to get a reaction out of me, she screams, ""HAIL SATAN!"" at the top of her lungs.

My wife is still pissed at me and doesn't want to take her to daycare next week...

TL;DR I accidentally let my daughter listen to Tenacious D and now she shouts ""Hail Satan!"" at the top of her lungs to get my attention. Now my wife and I aren't sure if we can take her to daycare next week."
4,"TIFU by Ripping Apart my Xbox One


As a frequent reader of this subreddit I dreaded the day in which I’d have a story worthy of being posted here, but alas, here I am. This event took place three days ago. I am on winter break and have tons of free time, and with that time I have been playing tons of Madden 18 on my Xbox One console. That day I asked my brother if he wanted to play, he agreed, but left the room to go to the bathroom. I used this time to turn on the Xbox and grab the Madden 18 box from the cabinet. The Xbox is taking a bit to load so I quickly check my twitter in the meantime. It finally loads and I select Madden 18, however when I do so an error message pops up saying that I do not own the game and need to either insert disk or buy it. I get slightly irritated as my Xbox has had issues with the disk drive for a while now, including sometimes having problems reading the disk. So I press the eject button and it makes a “reject” sound effect. Hmmm. I press it again. No luck, it beeps it’s reject noise again. Great, my disk is jammed in there. 

My brother comes back and I explain the problem. We google the issue and Microsoft’s solution is to stick a paper clip through a hole on the side and manually eject the disk. Cool. We search the house and finally find a paper clip. We stick it in, but find no luck in ejecting the disk. We watch Microsoft’s video on how to properly do it. This video is very slow paced, annoying, and didn’t provide any help to us. 

Next we schedule an appointment with Best Buy to see if they can help. We have to wait until my Mom is back from work in order for us to get a ride (as my sister was using our other car) An hour later my Mom and I drive to Best Buy where we await our appointment. We end up waiting a while as no one is at the desk, eventually a man arrives. He ends up being helpless as he apparently needs a receipt and we are unable to remember the phone number or email the Xbox might have been bought under all those years ago. We leave in anger after half an hour. 

Back at the house my Mom googles more videos on how to manually eject, those don’t work either. More irritation. Finally we look up other local places that could possibly help retrieve my entombed disk. We find a place online that says they can do the repair for $130. We decide that is essentially the same price as buying another Xbox One, and hopefully this new Xbox won’t have a faulty disk drive, but first however, we must bust into the broke Xbox to save the Madden disk (so that we don’t have to waste another chunk of money replacing the game).  

We google how to manually break into the console. We use a screwdriver to snap open the side. Next we have to snap apart some hooks. Now we reach an inner metal box. There are several metal screws holding in place a plastic compartment which holds the disk drive. Bingo. However the screws are some weird shape and none of our screwdrivers work. Next we take our drill and attempt to destroy the top of the screw in order to lift the top metal plate off to reach the plastic that holds the disk drive in place. The screw survives our attack. At this point my Dad has also joined and we are on a mission as a family to get this disk. We take a wrench and grab ahold of the edge of the metal top and begin to peel back the metal. Eventually we pull it back enough to reveal the plastic holders. My brother then snaps the plastic with a screwdriver and at last the disc drive is free. From there, there are 4 tiny screws holding us back from entering the disk drive to retrieve our disk. 3 come off easily, of course the 4th one doesn’t. So we just rip it open like a sardine can. We take a look inside.... and there appears to be no disk. Huh. My brother walks back to the other room for a minute. That’s when I hear the Seinfeld theme start playing. Oh no. My stomach drops. My brother walks in holding the Madden 18 box in one hand and his phone playing the theme in his other. He opens the box on the table for all to see. The disk was in the box the whole time. I had apparently got distracted and had a brain fart because I had never actually put in the disk, so of course it couldn’t read the disk. We had just ripped apart an Xbox One for no reason and wasted hours. Not only that, but of course my whole family is part of this fuck up, so I’m going to be hearing this story for years to come. Great. 

TL;DR: Thought my game disk was jammed in my Xbox, so after troubleshooting, we decided to rip it open to salvage the disk (as repairs would cost roughly the same as buying another Xbox). Spend hours ripping into the Xbox., only to find out in the end that the game disk had never been put in the disk drive to begin with. Now we broke our Xbox, wasted time and money, and I will have to hear this story for years to come from my family.

Edit 1: Paragraphs, Christ. 

Edit 2: i apparently didn’t make this clear, my bad: we had been planning on getting a new Xbox for a while, so there was no intention on repairing the Xbox, just get the game and finally get a new one"
5,"TIFU by masturbating so hard my lung collapsed.


So a bit of background, this was over a year ago and at the time I'd already suffered my lung collapsing once or twice before. I'm a smoker but apparently it can ""just happen"". But anyway, one night around 4am I was preparing to go to bed, and so did what any man would do once he remembered it was an option and rubbed one out. Now I'm gonna try and not get too specific here but essentially I enjoy certain breath play techniques while I'm at it and I guess I didn't fully consider the fact that my lung had recently collapsed already. Before I could finish I felt the *ping* feeling in my chest and felt a small but painful bubble of air form at the top of my lung. I was pissed. It was 4am, and nobody was up to take me to hospital and regardless I was ready to go to bed so I thought fuck it. I'm not going to let some minor serious medical emergency get in the way of that. So like a true champion, I powered through in some amount of pain until I finished and went to bed. I do remember vaguely panicking as I lay in the dark wondering how big of a risk it was to fall asleep with a respiratory issue but I'm no stranger to stressing out in my bed at night so I shrugged it off and fell asleep.

 I woke up the next day in less pain. I got up, sat on my computer for a while trying to pull myself together (I'm not a morning person and while this was easily afternoon I had just woken up). Eventually I went through to my kitchen where my parents were sitting and said ""my lung collapsed again"" in what I can only describe as a bored and unenthused tone of voice . ""We should probably go to the hospital but I need to shower and I'm hungry so I'm gonna do that first"". My mum looked slightly concerned but at this point we knew the drill. So I showered, cooked myself a pizza and once I'd somewhat digested it we left to go to the hospital.

The overview of what happened while I was there is basically once I finally saw a doctor, they x-rayed my chest to find only a tiny pocket of air and told me it's possible for small collapses to repair themselves and that's what's happened so just go home and chill

tl;dr - had a history of lung collapses, lung collapsed while holding my breath then found out later I slept it off

Edit: yes, I should stop smoking but I don't really want to so I haven't. No, it'a not a great idea but it's my choice

Edit 2: I don't really understand why many people have reacted negatively to this, it was just meant to be a funny story. If you don't think it's funny, that's fine. If you think I'm childish, that's fine. I'm not looking for advice or help right now but thanks for your concerns 

Edit fucking 3: I've had a lot of nice messages from people but I gotta say the highlight was getting a message from someone saying they hope I die in pain because I haven't quit smoking. All I can say is hahahaha holy shit reddit never change "

7,"TIFU by inviting friends over for NYE and falling asleep before they arrived.


So I have issues with sleep. I can never seem to fall into it at the correct time. 

After a nice Christmas trip visiting my family, during which I slept very poorly, I got back home and decided to have a couple friends for New Year's Eve. Like me, they didn't have any plans so it seemed like an ideal situation for a small get-together. I bought champagne and snacks in preparation for being a good host.

One of my friends didn't get off work until 8 and they live about a half-hour away. Adding that to traffic I figured they'd get to me at around 9pm. I had a few drinks. At about 7pm I laid down for a power-nap as I was running on about 3 hours of sleep from the night before. I set an alarm on my phone for 7:30.

Fast-forward to 5:00 am. I wake up, get my bearings, and go ""Oh no...""

They showed up, didn't have a place to park (I would have moved my car into the garage had I been, you know, awake and not a stupid dick) and tried calling me a total of ten times.

Not a peep from me as I was apparently dead to the world during all of this. 

Still don't know what they ended up doing. I have a lot of apologizing to do as they drove 45+ minutes to come out to see me planning to spend the night. I feel fucking terrible. 

TL;DR- I left my friends high and dry on New Year's Eve because I wanted a nap.

**UPDATE: They aren't mad, just happy that I'm okay. I'm hauling my champagne over to them for mimosas over brunch.**

**UPDATE: We had a great New Year's day drinking and couch-sitting. Thanks to all who wished us well, it turned into one of my favorite New Year's ever.**"
8,"TIFU by teaching my cat to pee whenever I whistle ""Country Roads"" by John Denver


Earlier this year I decided to start whistling to my cat every time I fed him, just just on a lark to see if I could ""program"" him to respond to the song. John Denver's ""Country Roads"" happened to be stuck in my head at the time, so that became the song I whistled whenever I got the cat food out. It worked by the way; my cat makes a beeline for the kitchen every time I whistle it, but he added a step that I hadn't planned on.

A couple months ago, my cat started having urinary tract issues. Basically, his little cat-schlong was getting clogged because cats have this really stupid biological quirk that causes them to pee solids. The solids would get stuck in his urethra, he would have a really hard time peeing, and his bladder would swell up like a balloon. It's a terrible problem for cats, painful and hard to prevent, and much to my dismay he began peeing all over my apartment. It was also very stressful for my cat, because he didn't want to have to pee all the time and he basically couldn't control it.

Another strange side effect of his problems was that he started spraying, even though he had been neutered. Every time I would come home he'd get really excited, and if it got to be too much for him he'd run over to the nearest wall and pee on it. I work long hours, and while I'd usually leave out plenty of dry food for him while I was gone, when he was sick I had to give him small portions of wet food to keep his pee clear. All of this meant that he would be pretty hungry by the time I got home most evenings. So of course, the first thing I would do when I walked through the door was feed him. Still whistling ""Country Roads"". Which would make him more excited. Which would make him pee. Maybe you see where I'm going with this. Unbeknownst to me, I was teaching my cat to urinate on command. Of course, he would pee whether I whistled the song or not, but I was whistling every time just out of habit. Luckily, because of his blockage issues, he'd only be able to squeeze out a few drops, so it wasn't that hard to clean up and I didn't think too much about it.

Well, my cat finally had to have surgery where they basically turned him into a female. I'll spare you the gory details, but suffice to say his twig is now keeping his berries company on a shelf at the vet. This has cleared up all of his peeing problems, and he's made a full recovery, much to my relief (and his). Also, while he was recuperating from the surgery he had a big cone on his head that made normal eating difficult, so I had to either feed him by hand or hold the food bowl up to his mouth, and I was usually too distracted to whistle.

Which brings us to today. He's finally got the cone off and has been eating normally for a couple days. Since the surgery he hasn't peed outside of the box one time. So, I wake up and head over to the kitchen to give him some breakfast, and I start whistling ""Country Roads"" for the first time since he's recovered. And my cat immediately runs over to the nearest wall and lets a glorious stream of piss out of his new and improved genitals. So much for my grand experiment.

Tl;Dr: I tried to get Pavlovian on my kitty, ended up with more than I'd bargained for.

P.S., for those who are wondering, he eats prescription wet food, and I actually mix water into the bowl so that I can be sure he's staying hydrated. I started that after he got blocked the first time, but by then it was too late. Water your kitties, people! They don't always do it on their own!"
9,"TIFU by trying to claw my eyeball out


This happened just this morning. I'm visiting my parents  with my wife and son, and I got up to put in my contacts like I do every morning. 

I put in the first lens and my eye starts burning like all hell. It dawns on me that I had forgotten contact lens solution and used some spare solution I found in the cupboard before I went to bed. Except it wasn't the right kind of contact solution for my lenses. It was the type you use for hard lenses that is essentially hydrogen peroxide. 

This is when I start to panic. My eye is burning worse and I can't get the lens out. It's stuck to my eye. No matter how hard I pull on the lens, it just won't come out. I can feel it between my nails on my finger and it won't come off. It's at this point I scream and my mother comes into the bathroom. 

I tell her I can't get the contact lens out of my eye no matter how hard I pull. She looks in my eye and says she can't see a contact in my eye. She then points to the countertop and there's the contact. 

The contact was never stuck to my eye and that wasn't the contact I was pulling on. I realize I have been pinching my eyeball between my fingernails thinking it's my contact and pulling as hard as I could in a desperate attempt to get something out of my eye that was never there. 

Now I have a bunch of broken blood vessels in my eye and I feel like a complete idiot. 

Tl;dr - I thought I was pinching my contact lens to pull it out of my eye, but it  was my eyeball and now I broke all the blood vessels in my eye. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! And yes, I did flush my eye out for about 10 minutes. This all happened within about 30 seconds, even though it felt like an eternity. And I've got some antibiotic eyedrops just in case. "
10,"TIFU by being the worst teacher ever


Obligatory this didn’t happen today. I’m a high school science teacher now contemplating taking a break to go to vet school but I love my job. But I almost gave up on it because of how humiliating this experience was. Probably something like ten years ago, I used to teach kids as a summer job. Easy shit like beginners chess, rollerblading and programming. Mostly classes for the older kids. It was a plush summer gig for a college student, I got paid something like $12 an hour for 6 hours a day, Monday through Thursday for six weeks of the summer. I was always out by 5pm and had a three day weekend. 


Anyways one year I got asked to fill in for a last minute vacancy in a teaching a class for the kindergarten-1st grade kids. I didn’t have much experience with kids that young but the class was just basically babysitting 12 toddlers and teach them how to play board games for two weeks so I figured it’d be a breeze. On the first day this little boy with mounds of curly blond hair shows up and immediately starts getting on my nerves. Doesn’t respond to his name at roll call so I had to go off their name tags, keeps almost walking off, he refused to clean up after himself or follow simple instructions and would only finally listen to me after I repeated myself for the third time right in his face. (By which time I’d progressed from “Okay Damian, please go pick up the pieces now” to “Damian, I told you to go clean up” to “DAMIAN! WHAT DID I JUST TELL YOU?!”) The whole time he refused to speak to me or make eye contact and had this tic of like patting the side of his head. I honestly couldn’t figure out why the child refused to talk to me, and just chalked it up to him being autistic or something.


After an hour of this shit I hold his hand and personally walk this kid to his waiting mom thinking that I’m gonna get this little shit grounded or moved into another class. His mom sees me and immediately asks ""Oh Damien! How was his behavior?""


Me: ""Honestly, not great ma'am, Damien has a bit of a problem following instructions."" And riiight here I was ready to elaborate on how exactly he was being a pain but before I could say anything more she interrupted me.


Her: ""Oh was he patting his head? His batteries must be dead."" And starts signing to him. He signs back and my stomach drops like a stone.


She then pushes aside a mound of curly hair to reveal a cochlear implant. And it all hits me in a wave of horrible realization. 


Without his implant working the kid was stone deaf and was only following instructions when I was almost yelling in his face because then he could read my lips. He was trying to tell me the whole time he couldn't hear me and I ignored him then tried to get him chewed out by his mom.


I wanted to fucking die on the spot.

Edit: Protocol guidelines says I was supposed to be informed of any kid’s med issues ahead of time but I can’t honestly recall if there was a warning I neglected or I didn’t get one at all because of first day disorganization. That is certainly what I blamed it on in hindsight, but it’s way more likely that the child totally had a special treatment/medical alert star next to his name and I ignored it thinking it was one more child with asthma or something that I could more or less safely ignore. (Edit 2: I mean the kid was five or six tops and I was showing them how to play board games for chrissakes. The medical notices 99% of the time was for the basketball or tennis coaches to know that little Timmy needs to have his inhaler or little Becky needs to go to the nurse to take her pills before lunch. 

Plus I was like 18 or 19, so poor judgement on my part.)

Edit 3: Wow. Hi front page. That’s a solid first for me. Moved my tl;dr to the end. And because people keep asking no, I was frozen in absolute mortifying embarrassment, they left too quickly for me to apologize anyways and I don’t think he held it against me. If I remember correctly he acted basically just like every other child for the rest of the two weeks.

TL;DR I treated a deaf kid like shit because I’m dumb and tried to tattle on him to his mom."
