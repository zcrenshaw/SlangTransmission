0,"TIFU by getting a sexy surprise [NSFW]


Obligatory, this happened this past Wednesday. 

So I've been out of town the past few weeks, and my girlfriend kept talking about how she was working on a sexy role-play kind of outfit for when I got back. Well, color me stoked. I get home from my work trip, and alas, no surprise. No big deal, I figure it just didn't pan out. So this is Sunday, fast forward to Wednesday. 

Wednesday, I'm back at work.  Five o'clock rolls around, I go to my car, and I drive home. I walk in, and ooohh my god. The sexy surprise. My girlfriend in a maid lingerie costume (you know the type) waiting for me in our bedroom. FANTASTIC. We start going at it, maid costume comes off, she's on top, and I go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and bend her over top of me. Well, I was a bit aggressive about it. 

I proceed to body slam her onto myself, with her shoulder coming down into my mouth with a force AT LEAST equitable to the new naval rail gun. She asks if I'm alright, it's then I realize, no, no, I'm not alright. I taste iron in my mouth, and realize that, sure enough, she's dislodged one of my teeth. It's literally lying parallel in my mouth.  Not to be outdone, I tell her sure, I'm fine, rip the tooth back into place (or as close as possible), and try to keep going. She doesn't say anything at first, then she informs me that apparently I've got blood all over my mouth. She was not really into that, apparently. 

I don't have dental insurance, so I go to the ER, and regale the staff there with my sexual misadventure. Missed work the next day, while arguing with insurance and going to the dentist. It's been quite the surprise.

tl/dr: Girlfriend's sexual surprise ends with me losing a tooth and completely blue balled. "
1,"TIFU by seeing how fast I could go before a grasshopper slid off my windshield


Today I was sitting at a local redlight I know all too well when BAM! What do I see? A poor, unsuspecting grasshopper staring back at me from the other side of the glass. I shoot him a quick flick clicking the windshield in the process but it only ends in a throbbing fingernail. Grasshopper unphased.

Time for plan B. As the light turns green, I survey the surroundings and giddily determine that the coast is clear, passionately pushing the pedal plum into the floorboard, revving my V4 for all she’s worth, VROOOM! 10mph...15mph....my new buddy isn’t budging. As several more seconds pass and 20 turns into 25..30..35..40! Oh Crap. Blue lights. I stoically pull over, glaring at the grasshopper one last time while awaiting my fate. He smirks back with those squinty little eyes.

Uh, yes sir, I do know it’s a 25 MPH school zone. Why was I speeding? Well, tbh I was seeing how fast I could go before that grasshopper would slide off. Cop follows my gaze to the grasshopper... Looks back at me. Back at the smirking grasshopper. 4 seconds of suspenseful anticipation pass and as I’m frantically trying to come up with a better excuse, the officer interrupts my thoughts by dying with laughter. I nervously chuckle back and gratefully press onward with my business.

TL;DR Got pulled over because a grasshopper made me do it. Wouldn’t leave no matter how fast I went "

In the early 1980's I was a 20 something systems engineer at a medium size Defense company. And if you wanted to get ahead, you had to work on 'cool projects'. So I got into the Research and Development department. Which was VERY cool. 
We got to work on things that blew up. That shot other things. That flew in the air, or crawled on the ground, or sailed on ships. Or went under the ocean. Hell, we even had a few things that went into space. But this isn't one of those projects. This was a project called ""GRETA"". 
Greta was a nice lady. She would crawl along on top of a sand pained slab sided M113 armored personnel carrier on the desert floor. She was a nifty little radar turret that beamed radar signals to search for airplanes. And then beamed radar signals that looked like 'lock on'. And then beamed signals for 'gun fire'.
Whose radar signals ? Well, we were still in a Cold War with those guys with the whole hammer and sickle thing. Yup, the good old Soviet Union. And this baby pretended to be the big ass gun system, the ZSU-23. If  you were flying anywhere in range, 2,000 rounds of 23mm high explosive cannon fire would ruin your whole day. 
And our customers needed to train in evading those things, with spiffy little 'threat detectors'. Just like your car's radar detector, but costing a shitload more and a hell of a lot noisier. There are a lot of 'oh fuck' alarms in a modern jet aircraft. This was a biggie.
Fast forward to a lovely summer day, and our happy band of young engineers is testing the radar system. I'm responsible for the servos that make it go back and forth and up and down, and everything is working pretty well, despite a few prototype problems that you would expect. It's research ! Shit breaks ! And yes, duct tape is used.
Our little test garage is up on a hill with a line of sight to the local airport of our major metropolitan midwest city. One of the old guys told us we had 'sort of permission' to use the radar. ""Just don't cook anyone.""... ohhh.. kay.
Everything is working great ! We're tracking and 'shooting down' tons of commercial airliners. A few smaller aircraft. A helicopter or two. So we're cocky. We're having a great time. We've 'killed' thousands of unsuspecting civilians. Aw yeah !
And then we see it. The mother lode. An Air Guard F-15 coming in pretty hot, in the landing pattern. I point. We light that sucker up and start pretending to shoot it.
Except... this pilot HAD his radar detector turned on. And all of a sudden, as he's thinking about the beer he's going to have, it tells him that there is a Russian anti aircraft system firing at him from a suburban neighborhood in an American city. WTF ? 
And he handled it flawlessly.... at 2,000 ft AGL, he went into afterburners, both jets screaming, fire a hundred feet shooting out the back. And he ducked DOWN into the weeds... suddenly flying nap of the earth to the runway.
Um... oh... SHIT. We suddenly realized we had seriously fucked up. The one old guy who was hanging around carefully got in his car and drove back to the HQ building, leaving us kids standing around wondering what was about to happen.
And perhaps 10 minutes later we were surrounded by USAF security personnel, weapons drawn, led by a VERY pissed off Lt. Colonel in a sweaty flight suit. The ass chewing we got was epic. My attempt at congratulating him on a perfect maneuver damn near got me shot, so I shut the hell up.
We promised to never, ever, ever light up a military target. Ever again. Or he would come back and kill us all. Slowly.

TL/DR: Testing a prototype anti aircraft simulator, we 'painted' an air guard F-15 on a landing approach. He evaded as trained, landed, and raised holy hell with us.

3,"TIFU by ignoring doctor's orders and nearly killing myself.


This didn't happen today, but yesterday, so the pain is still very real.

I have COPD, a very serious lung disease that eventually requires a lung transplant to fix it. I had spent the week living in a hotel room near my hospital getting evaluated, which includes a battery of tests. I was poked and prodded and jabbed and lost more blood than CM Punk in the UFC.

Two days ago (Thursday) I had a test so serious it requires a surgical team. A catheter was inserted into my wrist, up the main artery in my arm, and used to inject dye into my heart to measure it's behavior. I was *seriously* doped up for this test, so I wouldn't accidentally move and rip out the catheter and send blood hurtling towards the ceiling in a grotesque *True Blood* fountain.

After the test, I was very specifically warned not to exert myself for 48 hours, not to use my arm for anything strenuous, and to be under **constant supervision** by another person. So, of course, the next morning I got myself dropped off for another round of tests and told my caregiver to come back for me in 8 hours.

The test involved eating a very small meal (the only thing I was allowed to eat since the previous night), and having my stomach PET-scanned after 1, 2 and 4 hours. After the 2 hour check, I was incredibly bored, so I went outside and started walking around. (Full disclosure: I was hunting Pokemon. Hospitals, especially famous Children's Hospitals, are *havens* of Pokemon and Pokestops.)

After a while I sat down on a bench, in the sun, and fell asleep. Normally when I sleep I require oxygen to keep my blood O2 levels up, but this time I just feel out unexpectedly. So, I woke up already low on oxygen, and began feeling nauseous. At this point all I cared about was finishing this stupid test, and I was pretty sure puking up my breakfast would ruin it. So, I decided the right thing to do was move out of the sunlight into the shade, and start making my way back inside.

So, I stood up, and instead of heading about 6 inches to my right to the shady side of the bench, I began moving uphill towards the next bench, about 50 feet from where I was. I immediately felt light-headed, woozy, and dizzy. So, of course my immediate reaction was to ~~sit back down~~ make a run for it and hope I got to the bench before I passed out.

Spoiler: I did not.

Within about 5 steps, I suddenly felt my legs refuse to move where I told them, got them twisted around each other, and feel face first onto the ground. Thankfully, by sheer luck, I fell into the grass, and didn't hit any of the trees, rocks, or metal furniture in the immediate area. After laying there for about 2 minutes, I finally sat up and assumed the ""Triangle of Respiratory Distress"" pose, which looks roughly similar to a panicked person having a mental breakdown. A staff member came over and eventually a doctor and nurse got me wheelchaired up and back into the place.

Unfortunately, on impact I used my bandaged, off-limits arm to catch myself, which merely served to swing me sideways so my rib cage landed directly on my portal oxygen tank. Once I got back into the building, I noticed that I was having (more than usual) serious trouble breathing, and there was a nice bruise spreading quickly up my arm.

I guess if there's any place you need to fall down into a life-threatening condition, outside a hospital medical plaza isn't a bad choice. but if I had landed a few feet to the left, or fallen the other direction, or the staff member hadn't chosen that time to do some gardening, most likely I would have bled out while suffocating to death in my confusion. My chest still hurts, and I have to be on oxygen full time until the soreness dissipates and I can breathe again.

All because big bad me ""didn't really need"" constant supervision after major surgery.

TL;DR Ignored direct doctors orders, overextended myself after surgery, passed out, and only by sheer luck did not suffer and permanent harm, merely excruciating pain in my ribs and a long-term connection to my home oxygen."
4,"TIFU by accidentally stabbing my dick


I was trying to open a can of beans and I was hungry and very drunk. I couldn't find a can opener or any cutlery, for that matter; apparently my friends, who were also drunk, decided to hide all my cutlery. I opened up my kitchen drawer and found a mini screw driver.

Being very drunk, I lost patience quickly when trying to open the can of beans with the screw driver. 

I decide to hold the can between my legs and stab the can. I miss and I stab my penis.

I start screaming and friends are all confused. They run in and see me with a screwdriver through my pants with blood spreading from the points of contact. Ambulance is called, and I'm in the hospital. The doctor asked how this happened and I said it was because I was trying to open a can of beans. 

Anyway, they remove the screw driver and wrap my dick up.

Time to stop drinking.

tl;dr: I was drunk and tried to open a can of beans with a screwdriver and end up missing and stabbing my dick instead."
5,"TIFU by stopping my double jointed daughter from beating on my son


This was my one and only time I ever had to do this, or that there was ever a full blown fist fight in my house. Also, obligatory this isn’t recent. 

My oldest son, who was at the time 15, was getting his ass kicked by my oldest daughter who was at the time 17. She was absolutely beating the tar out of him. Knowing her and her level of self control, he probably was really asking for it. 

I worked security, and I’ve worked security most of my life. I’ve seen just about every type of fight you can imagine. Bar fight, gang fight, school fight...  

I assumed using some of those security skills would be put to good use. I put my daughter in a Full Nelson and rotate her away from the fight. What I didn’t do is talk, she doesn’t know if it’s me or another one of her brothers that has her in that full Nelson. 

She contorted her shoulder forward and elbow in a way where she escaped the Full Nelson and elbowed me in the nose and hit me in the solar plexus while she was at it. 

I fell back, and when she looked back she gave the “Oh shit” look. My son started cackling, and I was bleeding from the back of my nose into my throat. My nose wasn’t broken, but that in combination with the solar plexus hurt so bad, probably the top 10 pains I’ve ever felt, and occasionally still have nosebleeds since then 

Tl;dr: Don’t put your double jointed daughter in a full nelson, or you might have a bad day. "

**Part I: The Beginning** 

About three years ago, I got a message from a girl who has the same last name as me. We aren't related, and I wasn't really interested in small talk, but she insisted. Let's call her Sandy. So I responded as any un-interested guy would...with short and broad answers. She would message me daily, and conversations would always go like this:

Sandy*: Heyy! What's up? How's your day? You at work?*

*Me: Yes*

*Sandy: Hahaha so you have plans this weekend?*

*Me: Probably busy*

*Sandy: We have the same last name, we should hang out!*

*Me: Haha*

And it would go like this daily. Every. Single. Day. So eventually, I decided to do something about it. 

**Part II: The Grandmother**

One day she messaged me and told me that her grandmother passed away. Now, I may be rude, but I'm not heartless.  I expressed my condolences, we talked a bit and Sandy informs me that her grandma had actually had passed a couple years prior. I'll never understand why, on God's green Earth, she decided to tell me this. But then she broke even more jaw-dropping news: their family is going to see a medium to communicate with her! BINGO. I had my opening.

**Part III: The Mistake** 

I'll just cut to the chase: While on Facebook messenger, I told Sandy that I was a medium, and could find out about her grandmother. Am I really a medium? Of course not. Is this a horrible thing for me to do? Yeah. Why did I do this? I have no idea. But it was an adventure. 

First, I did my research and found the obituary online, so I knew the exact date of her grandmothers passing. But I couldn't just *tell* her the date, I had to beat around the bush. I said it sorta like, ""she must have passed to the other side while the leaves turn lighter shades of orange..."" Idk. I just spiced it all up.

Then, I managed to successfully guess her grandmothers favorite flower (yellow rose), the fact that her grandmother often knit her mittens for Christmas (pretty common among grandmothers), the fact that her grandmother had an assortment of flower-painted china-ware. You know, typical grandma stuff. But Sandy was actually 100&amp;#37; convinced that I knew her grandmother and could communicate with her spirit. Sandy started asking me stuff, and by golly, I somehow managed to get most of the questions right. And when I didn't, I was pretty sly and clever. Like this:

*Sandy: What did she get for me for Christmas in 2009?*

*Me: Hmm. Mittens. Hand-crafted mittens.*

*Sandy: Omg! She gave me a hand-crafted scarf! You're actually communicating with her!*

*Me: Yep* 

I had her thoroughly convinced. But then, out of nowhere, she told me that her mother was watching us talk online. And her mother was the one asking many of the questions, not Sandy. Ohhh boy. OHHH BOY. I decided now was a great time to somehow back out of this conversation and never look back. 

I made the mistake of being honest, and I was like ""haha yeah anyways I'm just joking about being a medium"" but Sandy responded ""my mom is very upset with you"" and I was like ""ok haha sorry."" 

**Part IV: The Chase at Walmart**

The good news, if anything, is that Sandy stopped messaging me. A few days past, and then a week, and still nothing. Keep in mind, I've never actually seen this chick in person, I just know shes from my town. Until I saw her in Walmart. 

I have never experienced primal fear. You know, the kind of fear where you actually pee a little and go to the bathroom to just throw a little water on it to make it look like you spilled your drink. Yeah, that happened on this day. I saw her in Walmart, and she saw me. She was actually *with* her mom. I knew they recognized me from my profile pic, and they started coming toward me. I'm not making this up--I dropped what I was carrying and ran out of Walmart. 

  
They followed.

I got in my car, put it into drive, and *floored* out of the parking lot. I saw them get into a red car and begin following. I honestly don't know this family at all. They could be complete psychos. They turned onto the road behind me, and since there's two lanes, they tried to speed up next to me. BUT THEN. BOOM. RED LIGHT. 

As I slowed, they had no other place to go than right next to me. It was a beautiful day, so I had my windows down. I was blasting some sort of rap probably and I swear I could hear them yelling into my car, trying to get my attention. I just ignored them and put on some sunglasses. 

I haven't seen or heard from them since.

*TL;DR: I convinced a mom and her daughter that I could talk to their dead grandma, made them angry once I disclosed the truth, and then saw them in Walmart....initiating an action-packed sequence that could easily be confused for a Michael Bay film*"
7,"TIFU By Hard-Boiling 5 Eggs For 2 Hours


LTL, FTP, yada yada. Let’s get down to bidness.

I work from home, and it’s awesome - especially when I get hungry, because I can just make some food in my own kitchen! Today, I was hungry - but I had already eaten lunch, so it seemed time for just a small snack to tide me over until dinner. I knew my fiancee would be home soon, so I wanted to make something we’d both enjoy. I do the cooking, she does the cleaning - it’s a great system.

As you probably surmised from the title, I decided it was appropriate to boil some eggs. I set the stove, filled a pot with water, and dropped the eggs in the pot. That’s the great thing about hard-boiled eggs - you can basically just leave them alone and go about your business until they’re done.

Well, my fiancée got home a little bit later than expected. That was fine - I went back to put finishing touches on the project I’d been working on that day. Just as I finished, the dogs perked up and met her as she opened the door. She kicked off her heels, walked into my studio, kissed me, and we talked about plans for the evening for a little while. It was an idyllic day!

Until we heard the sound of firecrackers going off.

She left my studio to investigate, and found what could only be described as the aftermath of an unnecessarily violent avian serial abortionist. I had forgotten to set a timer of any kind and lost track of time working on my project. All the water in the pot boiled off to the point where we were just cooking the surface of the egg shell.

The results were as explosive as you can imagine - the shell fragments and cooked innards of the poor embryos were not just scattered across the floor, but all over the walls, cabinets, and even stuck to the ceiling. My fiancée scanned over the crime scene, looked over at me (I had followed her out to see what had happened), shook her head while stifling her laughter, and said:

“Nope. Not this time. Your turn!”

TL;DR Eggs exploded, spent two hours cleaning the kitchen, and I'm legitimately considering veganism.

8,"TIFU by losing my virginity, breaking my penis and getting spiked with MDMA.


TL;DR included at the end. 

As per, this happened about a year ago in June last year.
You're in a for a bumpy ride boys.

As an 18 year old male, I was getting close to 19 and still a virgin. I was very conscious of this and considerably more embarrassed by it. So when this opportunity came up I didn't think twice really.

**Ep. 1: How not to lose your virginity.**
I met a girl at my best friend's work. We'd met once before and gotten pretty drunk, where we'd made out in the taxi on the way home. She asked me to come over more than once that night. I said no as I had working the next morning and I wouldn't be able to get there since my motorbike is at home.

About a week later the same group of us all arranged to go out, first to a bar then to a club.
We'll call said girl Norman. 
So as far as I could tell Norman and I had both figured something was going to go down. We'd spoken a little online between now and the last outing and I was pretty confident it was going to happen.

We all made our way to the intended pub, where after some faffing about, Norman and I ended up at a table together, separate from the group. We bought eachother a couple rounds of shots each after some polite arguing over who paid what.
So, this is where I consider the fuck up to begin. Now children, don't ever leave your drinks with someone you don't know or trust. This what I did.

We ordered some Sambuca shots which i'd never tried before. I sprinted to the toilet before we took the shots.
I returned, we took the shots and as far as I could tell all was okay. I wasn't feeling anxious anymore, which although unusual, was welcomed.

The group, including Norman and I all arrived at the club we planned. My first bad signal was that I was sweating like a fucking pig. I wasn't hot, but hell was I sweaty. I don't recall ever sweating so much. Next signal appeared as we walked through the dance floor, Norman had me in the grips of her hand as she dragged me through the croud. At some point I lost her grip and stood on some guys foot. As I recall this guy was about an inch or two above my 6'2 self. I stood on his foot and although I knew I shouldn't be doing that, I could not for the life of me figure out what I should do **about** that. So, logically, I stood on his foot for what felt like about 5 seconds just looking into his face blankly. Eventually, and understably he got angry and shoved me with some serious force into some nearby people, of whom I bounced off. At this point Norman managed to retrieve me and we carried on.

I don't remember how, but we ended up on some seats in the corner of the club. The profuse sweating was still strong. I think I had a panick attack around that moment and ran to the toilet to throw up, cleaned my face and returned to my seat to carry on my panick attack with Norman.

Next I remember we were in a taxi, alone. Just me and Norman. We started making out intensely for the entire journey home. At some point I found a pink stringy thing on the floor of the car, I decided this was a cat collar. I gifted this to Norman.

Inevitably, Norman took me into her holiday park caravan in which she resides with her mother and stepfather. We layed in our separate beds for some time. Next I was trying to undo my belt, which was a great struggle, although i knew how, I couldn't execute that move. I asked her turn the lights on, managed to wrestle it off me.

Norman and I copulated for what seemed to be quite some time. She could not get it in, and being 100% unexperienced I couldn't help that situation. I don't know whether I didn't fit or she was just shit faced or both. Either way, eventually she managed. I could not cum for the life of me. I put this down to the alcohol.

We eventually fell asleep, seemingly in separate beds judging by the morning. Her mother came in after daylight had arrived and semi-politely informed us that she could hear us throughout the night. Lovely.

Norman asked her stepfather to give me a lift home, I was too polite to decline although I desperately didn't want to do this.
I sat silently in the car aside her stepfather for the entire journey, only speaking to give directions.

**Ep. 2: The hurty dick diagnosis.**
When i got home I realised that my member was incredibly sensitive. Like, unbearably excruciatingly sensitive. Like I can't walk sensitive. After some light research I discovered that this was due to the fact that my foreskin was stuck behind the head of my penis, exposing the glans and causing the sensitivity. I tried for hours in the shower and in a hot bath to no avail. It was too painful and I couldnt get a good enough grip to move it.
I had to unfortunately break the news and explain the situation to my mother so that she could drive me to A&amp;E as I didn't dare sit on my bike.

She understood and we got to A&amp;E. After some standard waiting time and awkward explanation to the Triage nurse. I finally got seen by a doctor. I tried to explain to him what happened, he gave me a sterile numbing gel and told me to go play in the toilets. I did so, and after about 45 minutes, I seemed to have fixed myself. I couldn't find him on the way out and my member didn't feel quite right but I assumed that was due to the stretching of the foreskin.

I woke up the next morning, morning wood happened. Well, morning wood tried to happen. Instantly I got the searing pain at the end of my cock. It was definitely fucking not fixed.
I booked the day off work and got an emergency doctors appointment.
After some time I hobbled into the doctors office, for the third time explained my ridiculous issue. He requested to see. After giving me another tube of gel he told me to lather my trouser snake and wait 3 minutes. Once done he came in and tried to fix it himself.
I felt it pop back over and I have never been so relieved in my entire life.
He informed me that I have what is called ""Phimosis"". That translates to a very tight foreskin.


TL;DR: drinky spikey, peeny hurty, foreskin tighty. Doctor fixey. Nicey nicey.
