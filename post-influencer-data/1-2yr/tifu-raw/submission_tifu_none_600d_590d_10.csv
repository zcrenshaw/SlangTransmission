0,"TIFU by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy


In 5th grade, I had a black history month project where I had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. I looked up ‘important African Americans’ and found a Wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so I thought. I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South African scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

TL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn’t realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

Edit: Though Cormack was born in South Africa, he became a US citizen early in his career. That's why he was on the list of African Americans.

Edit 2: I feel like this belongs in greentext"
1,"TIFU and got my name on a suicide watch list


A few weeks ago, I was in my final class of semester, the night before the exam. 
I am a student paramedic, and the mental health of our cohort is very carefully monitored by the school, for obvious reasons. 

As the class ended, the tutor spoke to me to thank me for my effort during the semester, and to say she hoped to see my name on her class list. 
Jokingly, I responded, “They have a list for all the students that throw themselves off the church tower, right? Look for my name there!”
Most of us have a dark sense of humour in our field, and my tutor was no exception. She laughed with me, then frowned. 
“You know I have to report you for saying that..”
I thought she was joking, and laughed again.
The next day I was contacted by the university’s therapist offices to book my first mandatory session. 

TLDR: made a stupid joke, got stuck on suicide watch, required to do therapy this semester"
2,"TIFU by snorting a tonsil stone


Bodily discharges are only for the weekends, so I'm reposting from earlier this week.

Like a lot of people, I sometimes get tonsil stones. And when I get tonsil stones, I remove them. Normally, this is a very straightforward process, but luck can only take one so far.

A few days ago, I had a particularly large and nasty tonsil stone stuck in a little tunnel in the back of my throat. Normally, they pop out without a hitch, but this time, my body had other ideas. No sooner had the stone come free, then my gag reflex went full Benedict Arnold, betraying my trust and forcing me to clamp my mouth shut in an effort to keep myself from vomiting. In my panicked attempt to continue breathing, I somehow managed to snort, bringing the tonsil stone straight up into my nasal passageways.

Under normal circumstances tonsil stones smell bad. Some would say ungodly. But this.

Some say that when Hercules cleaned out Augeas' stables, the metric fuckton of rotting filth was washed back into the river. However, I can say with confidence that all of this filth was lodged in my nasal passageways. Nothing else could possibly smell this bad. Having a tonsil stone in your nose is like going on a date with every drop of vomit that the human race has collectively Ralphed. Many tears were shed.

I blew my nose. I attempted to improvise a neti pot. I came thiiiiis close to pouring Listerine into my nostrils. I didn't think I was ever going to sleep again. Fortunately, it evacuated my sinuses one tiny, godforsaken chunk at a time over the course of about 3 hours, but the trauma had already been suffered.

TL;DR - I accidentally snorted a tonsil stone while trying to remove it, and all I could smell was the abyss of ass-rot.

Edit: Why did you spend money on this

Edit 2: How about you use that cash to pay off my student loans"
3,"TIFU by trying to prank my mom


I was only 13 years old on summer vacation at the beach. Every summer my whole extended family rents a vacation house and we all just ignore the actual beach and stroll the boardwalk shops the whole time. A lot of the shops on boardwalks sell stuff you can't expect to find in major retail chains. My cousin and I arrive at one particular store and find our way to looking at prank items. I wasn't interested in most of them that I had seen before like electric shocking gum and the like but at the counter of the store behind a display I see novelty scratch off lotteries. I'd never seen that before. My parents love scratch offs and my dad just buys them for people for all the holidays and to reward my sisters and I sometimes. Basically, giving scratch offs to people in my family is a totally normal thing. Although, as a 14 year old I'd never bought one for them before and I didn't consider that they'd wonder how I bought it.

Anyways, I was so excited to buy the lottery ticket I saw in the display. It was scratched off already as an example of what to expect. It appeared as if you're a $1000 winner and I knew that would be a good prank even before my cousin confirmed my choice to buy it. 

We get back to the beach house and low and behold my mom is the first person we walk into. I was probably going to give it to the first adult I saw. It occurs to me now that my mom may have been suspicious but she didn't say anything. She just took the prank scratch off from me and scratched it off right away. I was holding back a huge grin waiting for the moment she thought she won money so I could laugh at her.

I could see the scratch off as she was scrapping it away. It only had the three words ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" in all caps, large font where I thought a fake winning lottery ticket was going to be. I don't prank mom anymore.

TL;DR A novelty scratch off made me curse my mom because there were apparently different versions of the fake winning lottery.
"
4,"TIFU by not asking ""new phone who dis?"" and am now obligated to go to a concert with a stranger.


It all started last weekend.

I woke up to a text Saturday morning (1-20-18) from an unsaved number that read, ""Let's go to Riff Raff in April."" *This is the part where I fuck up. Instead of being normal and saying ""new phone who dis?"", I chose to assume that it was either a acquaintance/coworkers number I didn't save or someones number I deleted (imrl people know I like RiFF RAFF or more of the idea/icon of the artist).

So to be [stupidly] polite, I tell this person ""heck yes, that would be sick!"" and after we had a few back and forth texts about his music. I honestly didn't think much of the interaction.
Figured I would ask a coworker/friend if they had that number during the weekend/week out of curiosity, but didn't feel as if I made a verbal contract with someone.

Turns out, NOBODY I KNOW HAS THAT NUMBER.

Whoops, so to not have an awkward convo I just let the whole thing go and let that person figure out they contacted the wrong number by trial and error (they would probably see their intended contact at some point and mention the concert convo, the other person would have no clue, then they would deduce what happened..).

Well the week has been going by and tbh I kinda forgot about the interaction, but I got woken up by a phone call from the same number at 2am (Friday).
SHIT (and hell no I didn't answer).
After ignoring the call, I realize I have 4 new notifications from that number from minutes earlier. (a link, text, a picture, and a short text.)

The link is some random rap video, paired with a text ""This homie starts the video smackin some hyna and goes in.lol""

The picture (I kinda feel bad still), it is a screenshot of a ticket purchased to the riff riff concert, paired with a short text saying ""your ticket""

/var/folders/c7/yswf5t9n7ql4fvmy54s0fwpc0000gn/T/com.apple.iChat/Messages/Transfers/IMG_1410.jpeg

The image says ""Congratulations Chad"" for purchasing the ticket, and I know no fucking Chads. lol.

At this point I decide I better at least help this dude out and explain the garfunkled situation to him, that way he can at least sort things out by April and have a dope time at the concert. this is what I literally text him.. 

""Good news: there is plenty of time until April and that concert is going to be lit.
Bad news: when you text last i assumed you were my coworker (i don't save numbers that often, i should of said ""new phone who dis"" my bad) but i don't know any Chad's.
Truly sorry.""

I was embarrassed but thought I at least sorta righted my wrong by giving the dude a heads up.

The dude literally sent back ""Lol cuh I swooped you a ticket.You are goin.""

TL;DR I didn't ask an unsaved number who they were, had a conversation and then the person purchased me a concert ticket thinking I was somebody else. After I explained the miscommunication, the person still expects me to go to the concert.

UPDATE:

i think he thought i was messing with him. When i ask who he was he said Chad such and such, Frank blah blahs brother. I told him my full name to reciprocate, and he has not responded since.

The concert is in Colorado but about a 2 1/2 hour drive from where i live and work.

After work today i will reattempt to post a screenshot of the ticket purchase he sent me and the convo, i am not the most tech/reddit savvy dude. My bad ya'll, but thank you for all the tech support.

You peps are right about it being more of a lucked out situation rather than a fucked up. I'll tell him that i'm just a regular non threatening dude that also happens to be a hiphop head. Keep yaa updated if he responds! Let's hope that he isn't the Chad that got away.. bahaha.

UPDATE #2: screenshots/convo
(p.s. let me know if I revealed to much personal info for sub, I blocked out the info I thought was important, i.e. confirm code and last names.)

Everyone keeps asking if I've google the number or looked it up on facebook. I did google the number but got no hits; however I do not have a facebook account so that is not really an option. I tried a general search of his full name after he sent that to me but to no avail. Never heard of the guy tbh.
Still no response from homie, might send him this tifu link lol.

UPDATE #3: talked to the dude and if his homie he intended to take doesn't want to go he will lmk, I offered to pay for the ticket and roll with the vibes.

5,"TIFU by mistaking the family cat for a feral one and chasing him off the yard. We're no longer on speaking terms.


Background: We have a family cat who's kind of chubby and has typical grey-striped fur. Our neighborhood has a bunch of feral cats that roam around so we try to chase them off the backyard as much as possible because they keep marking up the patio. Well, I came home yesterday evening in that semi-visible time period after the sun sets. I saw a cat in our yard and mistakenly thought it was one of the feral cats. It didn't really respond and I remember thinking to myself ""These motherfuckers have gotten bolder. Got to send a 'stronger' message"", so I picked up some pebbles and chucked it vaguely in the cat's direction. They were very tiny pebbles so they wouldn't have harmed the cat and I aimed to avoid contact (the goal was more to make them bounce off the wooden fence near the cat and make noise). I also pretended to aggressively run towards the cat while shouting angrily at the top of my lungs.

The cat was successfully spooked and ran at high speed towards the patio door, where the indoor light revealed that it was... our cat. I instantly realized I had fucked up and tried to come over, but he hissed at me and still seems pissed and wary today.

Normally I can pet him and we'll snuggle together on the couch, but he's not having any of that anymore. If I get too close he'll hiss at me. He basically ignores me when we're in the same room now, whereas before he'd come up to me if I was sitting down to rest in my lap.

This probably would not be as big of a deal if he were not an adopted cat with a previous history of poor treatment. It took my family forever to get him comfortable around people, comfortable with being petted, and so on and so forth. Now I feel like I ruined all that progress so I consider this quite the fuck up. Now I'm searching up how to ""repair the trust I had with my cat"".

FYI the primary caretaker of the cat is my sister, so I did not have much experience prior in getting the cat to feel more comfortable or trusting. No idea where to begin since the cat is avoiding me but is still affectionate to everyone else in my family as he normally is.

TL;DR Thought the cat was a feral cat and tried to chase him off but it turned out to be our family cat. He distrusts me now and won't have anything to do with me. "
6,"TIFU by storing my plastic Tupperware in my oven.


A little backstory first: I don't bake. I have about as much culinary knowledge as a chimpanzee with a spatula. Since I don't bake, I use my oven as storage for all my Tupperware. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Tupperware in the oven? Isn't that a fire hazard?"" To which I say: ""Naaaaaahhhh, it's fiiiiiiiiine.""

Well, several months back, my sister visited with my niece and nephew. My niece, being a curious toddler, turned the knob on the oven without us realizing and cranked that sucker up to the hottest temperature she could, melting all of my Tupperware. My apartment filled with smoke, I felt like an idiot, we laughed about it, and I learned a valuable lesson. After that, I continued life as a wiser, more responsible adult.

SIKE!

I bought new Tupperware and slapped them puppies right back in the oven with the ashy remains of their predecessors. Why am I like this? I don't know. I've lived with myself for 26 years and I still don't understand half the crap I do.

Flash forward to this morning: I wake up to Alfonso (my cat) frantically pawing at my face. That's normal; it was just breakfast time. Then he started gently biting my nose. Weird....he must have been REALLY hungry. However, when my fire alarm started blaring a few seconds later, I finally smelled the burning plastic. I woke up instantly and realized that my studio apartment was filled with smoke. I threw Alfonso off me and turned around to see that it was billowing from my oven. I screamed some words I'm not proud of and ran over to turn it off. I'm assuming Alfonso jumped up and turned it on by accident (or turned it on ""by accident"" *wink, wink*). When I opened up the oven to assess the damage, all hell broke loose.

As soon as I opened the oven door a crack, an enormous, ominous cloud of foul-smelling smoke flew up into my face and filled my apartment to the point where I couldn't even see the wall on the other side of the room. The only thing I could see was a giant flame burning bright at the bottom of my oven. Luckily, I'm the epitome of calm, cool, and collected.

SIKE!

I started panicking instantly. There was so much smoke that my eyes were watering and I was choking on it, so I got down on all fours and hunted down Alfonso in the smoke. As soon as I had him, my keys, and my cell phone, I sprinted out the front door and straight for my car.

Here's the thing........I sleep in my underwear. So there I was, outside in my chonies, sprinting barefoot to my car, and hacking up a lung. Luckily, no one was outside except for my next door neighbor and her dog, the group of Mexican kids that play soccer in the street every weekend, the nice old couple that lives across the street, and several cars that drove past.

With everyone staring at me, I threw Alfonso into my car and locked it. Just in time too, because I was coughing so much that I started throwing up. So there I was, outside in my chonies, on my hands and knees on the sidewalk, throwing up everywhere.

While I was throwing up, the little old lady that lives across the street shuffled over to me: ""Are you okay?! Do I need to call 911?!""

""No! It's fine. My Tupperware's just on fire! I can handle it!""

That was the last thing I needed: the firefighters showing up so I can explain to them that I caught my apartment on fire because I stored Tupperware in my oven. So when I was done throwing up everywhere I sprinted back into my apartment to put out the fire.

When I got back in, the fire was still going strong and the smoke was even worse. The smell was horrible. It was so bad that I crawled to my bathroom just to throw up one more time. When I was done vomiting, I crawled around to every one of my windows and opened them as wide as I could. When I was done with that I filled a salad bowl with as much water as I could.

Guys and gals, a little advice, if your Tupperware's ever on fire because you store it in your oven, don't just throw water at it. When I did, flames shot up and nearly singed my eyebrows off, shattering my glass Tupperware in the process. Fortunately, enough water seeped down to the base of the flame to weaken it a little bit. After a couple more attempts at a few more strategic water tosses I quenched the Great Tupperware Inferno of 2018. I'm basically a firefighter.

The morning wasn't all bad. Me and Alfonso went for a Starbucks run and then went to hang out in my classroom for a couple of hours while I got some work done (that's right, folks, I'm teaching future generations). He had a blast exploring my classroom, and I got to make some quality memes to show my students on Monday when I tell them all about this. As for right now, my apartment still reeks of burnt plastic, but the smoke is gone and the worst is over. And now I have a funny story to tell!

And I've certainly learned my lesson. From now on, I'll store my Tupperware up higher in my oven so it doesn't catch on fire as quickly. Here's to moving forward as a wiser, more responsible adult.

TL;DR - TIFU by storing my plastic Tupperware in my oven. My cat accidentally turned it on and the plastic caught on fire!"
7,"TIFU trying to shape my eyebrows


So I recently got my hair done after letting it get away from me for the past 3 years. I felt amazing and sexy and the compliments from my husband was the cherry on top. Feeling all the excitement and the new found self esteem, I figured why not get my caterpillar eyebrows up to speed!

I always use my little hair trimmer when shaping my brows, but it seems to have disappeared in the recent move. Then I get the brilliant idea to use my husbands beard trimmer. I put the smallest attachment on and run it over one eyebrow.... looks perfect. I move onto the next eyebrow and the attachment falls off as I am running it through. No biggie. I put it back on and return to the eyebrow, only to find my poor eyebrow is gone. Just like that. That little second of trimming took it away in one sweep. 

Mortified, I panic. I quickly attempt to draw it back on. The difference is undeniable. I begin to freak even more. What if I trim my existent eyebrow with scissors? Nope. Looks even worse. With my anxiety and mind running rapidly, I give in and just shave the other off. I stare back at my now less expressioned face. 

Realizing I can't hide in the bathroom forever, I accept defeat. The damage is done.  I hang my head low as I walk down the stairs and into the living room to show my husband. I sit down across from him on the couch. I stare at him, waiting for a response. He looks away from the television and stares back. Then he smiles at me. I laugh and his smile widens. He says,"" damn babe, I don't know what you are doing, but you are looking freakin hot!"" 

At this point, I can't contain myself and burst out laughing more. I point very directly at the place my eyebrows use to be and ask, ""Are you sure about that?"" Looking momentarily puzzled, his expression quickly changed from clueless to hysterics. We giggled back and forth until the tears came. We kissed and spent the rest of the night drawing different expressions on me and snapping pictures. I love this man! Thank gawd eyebrows grow back.  

TL;DR- beard trimmers are for beards

8,"TIFU by running my robot vacuum cleaner while at work.


Well fuck, This just happened about 2 hours ago and rightfully so because I been fucking cleaning for the last 2 hours. Well, I have one of those robot vacuum cleaners for the lazy single male life that I live because aye why the hell not, it makes my life easy. Anyway, to the point, I normally don't run this vacuum cleaner because my dog Luna has like a 5% chance of shitting in the house while I'm at work and I don't like those chances. I ran the vacuum cleaner in my bedroom and shut the door, or so I thought. I come home to shit everywhere smeared into the wood floors, in the kitchen, and thank the fucking lord not in back in my bedroom with newer carpet that I put in a few years ago. The vacuum itself was caked and I nearly threw it away but I'm not throwing $230 away, so I cleaned the hell out of it. Anyway, I just spent 2 hours cleaning this house and the stench is still lingering throughout the house. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

9,"TIFU Ruining $600 worth of cheese at work


I'll keep this short and simple and this happened about 3 weeks ago. So I'm 18 fairly new at my job and I work in a Deli in a leading supermarket. 

I was working late and closing, pretty normal procedure and I've done it plenty of times before. Something was different this night though as there was a box sitting on the side bench. I thought nothing of it, must of been a box of containers or paper rolls. Left it where it was thinking it was nothing to do with me and finish the close and leave. 

Fast forward to the next morning... I get a really passive aggressive text from my boss. She asked what I had done with the box sitting on the counter and if I saw the delivery dude. I just said it was on the side when I arrived so I left it. She then explains it was a box of the stores most expensive cheese at $300 a kilogram. Well great I have just left out $600 worth of cheese, she's threatening to fire me and I'm in high school so I can't afford to pay it back. The problems gets to the store manager and he casually explained that it wasn't a problem and my boss and I don't have to worry about it (thank god). Still got the probably illegal punishment of not getting any work for the next month for what I did. I feel really bad about it but really it wasn't my fault. She was probably still angry as a work mate forgot to close the cool room door a week before and wasted $400 of chicken.

TL;DR Got to work, saw a box, thought nothing of it, wasted $600 worth of stock and almost lost my job

Edit: People don't believe me about the cheese price. I'm pretty sure it was a 2kg box but I could be wrong all I was told is it was a $600 sell price"
