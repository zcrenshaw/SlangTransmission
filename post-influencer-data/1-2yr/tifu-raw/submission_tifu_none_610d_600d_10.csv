0,"TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.


Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents."
1,"TIFU by trying to Dutch oven my wife.


Not even gonna use a throwaway because this is so funny I’m probably going to end up telling everybody I know anyway. After the embarrassment wears off a bit anyway.

The wife and I were laying in bed chatting, I was laying on my back and she was laying facing me with her head on my stomach, marveling occasionally at my grumbling guts. We were just kind of goofing around, and she made a comment about keeping things exciting. 

So...this is where the fuck up starts. I decided to Dutch oven her, in an attempt to be funny. So...I grabbed the blankets, maneuvered a leg over her to pin her down as I tossed the covers over her and gave her hell...and then I sharted. Like...big time. With her head basically between my legs. 

Bless her heart...my special lady just laughed with me while I cleaned up the mess and took a shower, and brought me some clean clothes. I picked a keeper...but talk about instant karma.

TLDR; tried to Dutch oven my wife and almost shat on her face."
2,"TIFU by having a seizure and going full MMA on the six cops trying to help get me in the ambulance


Checking my email is the last normal thing I remember before waking up in the hospital, except for a few scary-as-fuck bits here and there. Hence, this comes from my own direct recollection, with the gaps filled in by my wife and other witnesses.

I had a full tonic-clonic seizure, right at my desk. Details are mostly irrelevant, here, but I've never had a seizure before. (And initial assessment is that it was probably a ""perfect storm"" situation with a new prescription I was on that will (hopefully) never happen again.)

My wife was in the next room and of course called 911, and the ambulance showed up. Problem is, I was [postictal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postictal_state?oldformat=true), which is a post-seizure state where you're essentially not in your right mind. But when two big dudes came into my house unannounced and in a big hurry to move towards me, I went into home-defense mode. The fact that they were clearly in EMT uniforms and there to help me was lost in the scrambled mess my brain was in, but my more basic instincts were working fine. I don't think I actually assaulted the EMTs, as they just kept their distance and radioed for police backup when I started yelling at them telling them (apparently) ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE. I DON'T WANNA FIGHT YOU.""

And so the police sent one guy.

Now I remember feeling extremely protective of my wife and convinced that this home invasion was serious business now that this 3rd guy was coming towards me and attempting to physically restrain me. I don't remember, but I'd bet you dollars to donuts that the millisecond he rolled his shoulders forward and widened his stance is the second that I went from uncooperative to full apeshit; it's just what you do when you're trained to fight and there doesn't seem to be another option, as when you are protecting your family like I thought I was about to have to do.

That's when things started getting ugly. I was an amateur MMA fighter about fifteen years ago with a local dojo, and while I haven't practiced for a long time, I can tell you those instincts never fully leave you. I know how to reverse any submission hold a local cop is likely to be able to proficiently attempt on me, apparently even whilst postictal. Before backup arrived, I had swept the leg of the officer and had him in an armbar. Thank fuck I didn't go for a blood choke whilst my brain was short-circuiting. I was also screaming (roaring, apparently) at my wife to call the police. The irony of my request was lost on me at the time. That primal roar was the scariest sound she's ever heard come out of my body, so she tells me, and I didn't stop roaring. Luckily (for him and me), cop #1 didn't put up any further resistance until his backup arrived.

Five more big dudes showed up (now 6 cops + 2 EMTs + my wife). No weapons drawn, no tasers. Fortunately they knew they were walking into a medical call, and boy they should get a medal for how well they handled it.

I wasn't going down without a fight, and 1v1 was no contest even though they were way above my weight class. But with sheer overwhelming force they pretty much wore me out and then dogpiled me to the ground, cuffed me in the back, and then stood me up to walk me to the ambulance. Big mistake. I easily spun my way out of the officer's control grip (hand on handcuff chain, other hand on my shoulder), and gave him a front kick to the breadbasket he probably won't forget anytime soon. ""Bring it, fuckers,"" I remember thinking (or saying? who knows). I also remember being this weird mix of scared, emboldened by my recent ""escape"", and pissed *right* the fuck off, all at the same time.

Still cuffed, front kicks were the new order of the day. I was like the goddamn free sample guy at the supermarket, giving them out to anyone who came near me. Details are loose on what happened next, but I guess they did some kind of brute force team tackle again and got me to the ground, and from the cuts on my wrists, they may have used some kind of pain compliance technique with the cuffs. It didn't work, as I was able to shrimp my way out from underneath the guy(s) on top of me and throw a nasty double heel kick from lying down. Fortunately it just grazed the guy on the shoulder rather than the neck/head, which is where I would certainly have been aiming.

Next thing I remember vividly is being face down on my living room carpet barely able to breathe (thanks to being out of shape these days, with at least one big guy on my back), and thinking this was the end for me, then they'd rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night.

They weren't screwing around at this point. Apparently judging it worth the risk, while I was pinned the EMTs shot me in the ass with some kind of chemical restraint, and the cops just sort of sat on me and let my wife try to calm me down until it had taken full effect and I was strapped to the gurney in soft restraints.

When I woke up (over a full day later--combination of insomnia + seizure + downers + 1v6 cage match really wore me out, I guess), I was bruised to shit, but aside from some minor cuts on my wrists from the cuffs and a nasty hole in my bottom lip from me biting it during the seizure, I'm a lot better off than I could have been. I have some nasty pins and needles in my hands so those cuffs must have been torqued fairly hard (by me or the cops, who knows), but I'm told by my attending doctor that should go away in about six months(!).

When got home I called the police to apologize and thank them for getting my combative ass to the ambulance. Thanks to them for being incredibly good sports about the whole thing. (And not pressing charges, especially given my level of...enthusiasm.)

I'm still trying to wrap my head around just how badly this *could* have gone. Yeesh. The unpredictable seizure alone is bad enough without nearly suiciding-by-cop had there been a weapon within reach. Scares the bejesus out of me just knowing how absolutely out of control I was.

tl;dr: I learned exactly how many big dudes with at least basic hand-to-hand training it takes to drag me from my home against my will. (Six, plus a syringe of something in the ass.)"
3,"TIFU By accidentally paying for a very unwanted happy ending


Bit of backstory: I (21 M) got money for Christmas from my parents with the expectation it would be for experiences (concerts, trips, parks, etc) rather than material things. I'm an incredibly non-confrontational and generally awkward guy. I know the story sounds kind of unlikely and all I can do is promise it's true and hopefully looking at it through that lens might make it a bit more believable. Also this happened within the last 24 hours but not technically today.

So I decide to use a portion of the money to go and get a massage. I'm looking at the prices and most of them fall around $80-$100/hour, but in my cities Chinatown the rates are much lower, many offering $50/hour. In the back of my head a flittering of ""happy endings"" appears but I figure I don't care if that's how they get a good portion of their money, I'm just in it for a massage. Plus that's probably just locker room talk and doesn't happen much in real life. So I pick a place in Chinatown pretty much by chance, just wherever opened earliest as I had plans to go after I got off from work (night shift).

I take the subway down and get off to walk the 5ish blocks to the place. It's raining pretty decently and it's unseasonably warm, feels like spring despite being mid January which puts me in a great mood. Great way to go into this. I reach a certain street and realize I've gone too far. Weird I didn't see the sign, whatever I'll just double back. Get back to the street I originally turned off of onto this street and realize I must have missed it again. A quick google later and I got the exact address, it's about a block from me. Finally find the place and realize why I missed it, there's no sign stating it's a massage place and no distinctive feature that would even prompt you to think it was open to the public. Just a slate grey wall with a metal door and a small sign, about the size of my hand with the address on it. This is the first time I question whether I should just go to some other place, but the rain is starting to get through my light jacket and soak my clothes so whatever I go in. I land in a tiny little landing with a sign telling me to press the buzzer on the wall. I do and after a few seconds an elderly lady opens the door and motions me in. She speaks very little english but mentions how wet I am. I fumble through a quick introduction and she grabs a towel and hands it to me. I thank her and begin drying off, apparently not to her satisfaction as she takes the towel and begins to dry me off - a pretty uncomfortable experience. I look young for my age and she asks me how old I am. I say 21 and I can see the disbelief and note her drying me off is pretty belittling but I'm used to that kind of stuff so I brush it off. 

She leads me back to the massage room and I ask if I can use the restroom before it starts. She points me to a small restroom at the end of the hall. I'll spare that part but I notice there's listerine, tooth brushes, vaseline, etc. in the bathroom. By now I'm positive this place does happy ending type stuff but mostly unperturbed as I'm just looking for a massage. So I finish up and go back to the room and the elderly lady brings in my masseuse, a mid 30s lady wearing this horrendous lingerie. She speaks even less english than the elderly lady, like none at all. The elderly lady is talking to me but I can't figure out what she's trying to say. Finally I realize she's asking for the money. I hand her $50 (the price she had mentioned when I called earlier) and she says ""plus tip one hundred"". I'm sort of taken aback like how are you gonna ask for a tip double the original price. I tell her I was told 50 over the phone, she is very insistent on the 100 tip. By this point I understand what's going down more or less and I just come out with it. I say ""I'm just looking for a massage, right, no"" and do the handjob motion. She makes no motion that she acknowledged me so I repeat the statement. She keeps pressuring me ""don't you think she deserve tip? Why don't you want to give tip?"". Being a pushover I cave and say ""I've got $100"" and offer that. After a little more arguing she agrees to that. At this point I figure $100 still isn't an absurd price for an hour massage. 

With the payment out of the way, they leave the room and tell me to strip. Now I had gotten a massage once before and they had told me to strip and I did, only for her to return and tell me she didn't mean my underwear too so she left while I sheepishly put my underwear back on. This time I wasn't going to do the same thing. Plus if there was any doubt, I hoped me keeping my underwear on would clarify I was just here for the massage. The masseuse comes back in and I'm laying on the bed with the towel over my back (what I had done last time I got a massage). She motions for me to stand back up so I do and she gives me a questioning look and motions pulling off my underwear. I, for the third time do the ""no handjob"" bit but she mentions a shower so I think maybe for hygiene reasons/ relaxation they expect you to shower first, hence the two towels so I wrap the one around me and follow her to the shower. I go in and to my (minor at this point) surprise she follows me in. Pretty much before I can do anything she begins washing me and I'll admit it wasn't any more sexual than say a nurse washing someone and was pretty relaxing being showered so I just went with it and tried to get back into the mindset of relaxing. That finishes up and I follow her back into the original room. She motions for me to lie down and places the towel over my still naked back. Finally the massage begins and it's actually pretty decent. This goes on for in what were for sure the best 10 minutes I spent there.

At one point the massage stops and I hear some ruffling so I open my eyes and turn my head to her taking her top off. I figure this is where I draw the line so I tell her ""no no no put your shirt back on I'm just here for the massage"" but she doesn't understand. I motion to pull her shirt back up and she seems completely unfazed. She goes over to a bottle of listerine and gargles it in her mouth. It is just about the most bizarre experience I've ever had so I'm going between just shock in watching it and panic of like ""i'm about to get arrested for soliciting a prostitute I didn't even want"". She literally comes over and pulls the towel up which at this point was just covering my junk and spits the listerine into her hands and begins to give me a handjob. At this point I'm at a crossroads, like I can either just let this happen or tell her to stop, but she doesn't seem to understand or care what I'm saying and I gently move to get up and she shushes me and like gently pushes me back down and starts making ridiculous, porn-level fake moaning noises. I come up with my brilliant escape plan. From her first touching my junk to now, only like 15 seconds had elapsed but in my mind it felt like a lot more had. I fake an orgasm which she entirely doesn't buy and I hardly even try to sell. She looks at me quizically and says ""OK...?"" and I say ""Ok ok ok yes"" and finally am able to shoo her out. I wipe myself down with the towels to get the Listerine off me, rush to get dressed and walk out of there. 

TL;DR: My parents give me money to go and get an accidental and entirely unwanted handjob in Chinatown"
4,"TIFU by accidentally ordering enough pizza to feed a small village in Uganda


So I woke up at 10:20pm after celebrating a friends birthday all night till morning. I was hungry, tired, hungover and maybe a little horny. I thought pizza was the perfect answer to fill all my needs, who am I kidding, I knew it was the answer. Plus in the back of my mind as a single guy, I knew all I had was cans of coke zero and ketchup in my fridge. 


Time was ticking and I needed to order from Domino's and I needed to do it FAST otherwise I would starve with nothing to eat until morning because most delivery places close at 11:00pm in Australia. I quickly grabbed my laptop while still in bed and placed an order for a family combo with much anticipation and the deed was done. I knew I could reheat and eat the leftovers for the next day. But inside I felt guilty and disgusted with myself because one of my new years resolution was to lose 5kg.


Soon after I placed that order, I blacked out and accidentally fell back to sleep and woke up again at 10:50pm. When I saw the time I panicked because it was 10 minutes from closing time and quickly decided to place an order for ANOTHER family combo except with Pizza Hut this time. I somehow completely forgot I had ordered pizza from Dominos 30 minutes ago...


The delivery from Domino's arrived and while I was in the middle of eating, I thought to myself ""wow the delivery was crazy fast... but didnt I order from Pizza Hut?? wtf??"". I was so confused and that's when I slowly realised my fuck up. 15 minutes later the delivery for Pizza Hut arrived.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm standing in front of my kitchen counter FULL of pizza wearing nothing but my briefs on because its hot as balls in Australia. :(

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** Woke up, ordered pizza, fell asleep, woke up, ordered pizza again...

[Obligatory proof shot of the pizzas lol \(there was also another pizza, 3 bottles of drinks and a garlic bread that I forgot to include in the photo...\)](https://imgur.com/gallery/OFBhbzb)

5,"TIFU by eating what I thought was a pop-tart.


I have to start by saying this didn’t happen today, but about 2 years ago.  I was a senior in high-school. Care free. Looking forward to college. Enjoying my free time as I ignored my responsibilities.

 I was watching TV in my room one night and decided to get up to grab a late-night snack. I walk downstairs and begin rummaging through the pantry. 

BINGO!

A brand new box of Oreo pop-tarts; my favorite flavor. I grab a pack and head back upstairs. I set the unopened package on my bed while I grab my controller to start the show up again. Without giving it a second thought, I absentmindedly tear a corner of the package to get to my delicious snack. As it opened, I felt a corner of one of the succulent tarts break and fall onto my lap. Naturally I wasn’t going to let a perfectly good corner go to waste. Without looking I reach down to retrieve the piece and pop it in my mouth. Joyfully, I bite down to an unexpected crunch and undesirable flavor. I thought maybe my tastebuds were off so I chew again.

I begin to smell something putrid. I then feel the writhing of multiple little legs and a taste that can only be described as a mix between a chemical waste bucket and the inside of a women’s outhouse.

Oh fuck. I just ate a stink-bug.

 I went into full-on freak out mode and ran to the bathroom as fast as my little legs would move. I spit the half dead stink-bug into the sink and begin washing out my mouth for what felt like an hour. I tried to gargle mouth-wash to help with both the taste and the smell, but to no avail. After about an hour and a half, my nostrils finally stopped burning and my taste buds began to return to a neutral state. I started eating my pop-tarts again, watching every bite with a steady eye. 

TL;DR: I went for a late night snack, grabbed a pop-tart, broke off a corner into my lap, grabbed what I thought was the corner and popped it into my mouth, quickly realized I bit into a stink bug."
6,"TIFU by putting on a show NSFW


So for context, I'm a freshman in college and there's this girl (we'll call her Jane) who I met through a friend before winter break who I was super into. She seemed to be into me as well, so score! Unfortunately we met pretty soon before finals so we really couldn't get into anything before leaving for break. We still stayed in contact every once in a while over break and we were super excited to see each other agin after coming back.

Fast forward to last night. I'm at a party where I planned to meet up with Jane. Awesome reunion! We talked a ton, danced up a storm, had an overall great time. At one point we started making out and after a while she asked me if I wanted to ""get out of there."" I was fucking elated. Little virgin me was about to rip off that bandaid with this beautiful, kind, smart, hilarious girl!

As we leave, she asked if we could go to my place because she hadn't finished unpacking yet and her room was a mess. I was all for it, but I wasn't sure if my roommate was around so I texted him letting him know about the situation.

Fast forward again. We get back to my dorm and I seemed to be in the clear. No sign to my roommate to be found, so I'm sure he saw my text and was gonna take one for the boys and stay with the guys next door. I said we had to be a bit quiet because I live wall to wall with my RA, and I didn't want him to get a full audio porno.

The fuckup:

We go to my bed and Jane starts giving me the best head I've ever gotten (I was no virgin to oral, at least). As she's giving me head though, I glanced over at my roommate's bed and my heart sank to my fucking stomach. In a beautiful moment of drunken realization, I remembered that that my roommate often sleeps entirely under his covers (like so that his head is not visible) to block out any light. I immediately think to myself, ""Holy shit **roommate** might be asleep in here..."" Jane noticed slight panic on my face, but I said it was nothing (made it this far, was drunk, did not want to end it because of the stupid horny boy I am) and she thought nothing of it.

We finally get to the fun part, but after a few minutes, all of my worst fears were realized. Even though we were trying to be quiet, we apparently made enough of a racket to wake my roommate up. He pulls the covers off his face and catches a full view of me and Jane bum ass on my bed and in shock just exclaims ""What the fuck!""

I hoped I could finesse my way out of the situation by saying it was a clear misunderstanding, but Jane put 2 and 2 together and realized that I must have had a weird expression earlier because I realized my roommate might have been there, and didn't say anything. She threw on her clothes and ran out in tears (understandably). 

I texted her roommate (the friend I met her through) this morning and she said that Jane was crying all night because of how humiliated she was.

So in the end, I lost my virginity, but also lost Jane and scarred her for life in the process. I now feel like a total asshole, and my roommate laughing his ass off at my all morning isn't helping...I'm just pissed he wasn't awake when I texted him last night.

TL;DR Lost my virginity...in front of an audience."

8,"TIFU by letting a stranger into my car, drove him around the bad part of town, lost $40, and was hit on by him.


Today, I was watching a movie, The Girl on the Train, with my friend Sarah. After it was done, I decided to head down to another friend’s room, Patty, to chat and hangout, since the next day was a snow day and she and I hadn’t seen each other in a while. We hungout for a little over an hour, I left about 11:15pm. I was parked in the north lot, north of the building. As I left the gate, I saw a man walking by. He saw me too and stopped and turned around. He asked if I could do him a favor, in which I replied, of course. He asked me to take him to the gas station nearby, which was no problem, because I pass it on my way home. We start walking the 100 yards to my car when he compliments my jeans, I thank him and comment how they are ripped, so I am mad because I like them a lot too! 


*Please note that my jeans are ripped in the “gooch” area. *


He immediately starts investigating where my jeans are ripped, at which point I get a little confused due to the proximity of where the hole was. He then realized the awkwardness of the situation and stopped. This should’ve been enough of a warning sign to not let him in my car, but again, my compassion took over. Thinking of potential issues that could arise from a stranger getting into my car, I put my backpack in the trunk, in make it a bit more secure due to both my personal and work computer being in there. Going to a Jesuit Catholic school, I am taught to have compassion for all and to be Men and Women, For and With Others. I think of this as a great opportunity to help someone out who clearly needs it. We start driving and I asked what gas station he prefers, as there are multiple in the area. He asked if I could actually drop him off at his buddy’s townhouse on 104th St. I was happy to do that, because I thought I knew where he was referring to, I can tell you now, I had no idea and that was my second mistake. We struck up conversation where he told me his friend and he broke up after 17 years (Randy is confirmed gay at this point, which is crucial later in the story), and that he just got through cancer. He tells me he works as a maintenance guy for one of the academic buildings at the university, which makes me feel more comfortable, as they are all pretty nice people. I felt badly for him at this point, but in hindsight, I think that was part of his plan. Randy asks to use my phone, which is Bluetooth connected to my car, and there is a number pad on the console, so I told him he can dial there and the call will go through. He calls his buddy that is supposed to live at the townhouse. The following is the conversation that entailed:

Randy: “Ay man, can you give me a ride to my car” 
Buddy: “Brotha, I am on my couch and I ain’t gettin’ up for nothin’” Hangs up phone 
Me: “So…what now”

Randy asked me to drive him to another friend’s house who he said would for sure be able to give him a ride. I was relieved at this idea, because I was getting a little uncomfortable now. We get to his other friend’s house and Randy informs me that his friend has kids and that he might be asleep, but he will go knock. He gets out of the car and goes up to the door for about 1 minute, enough time for me to call Patty and inform her of my situation, and so she can be on alert in case anything happens. He comes back to the car after there was no answer, at which point a white pickup truck shows up to the same house. Randy asks me to wait and see if they can wake his buddy up, so we wait. He asks if they know where he is and they don’t answer. Randy rolls up the window and looks at me and says, “I don’t know these guys, start driving, get out of here.” I floor it as I have no idea what the sudden change in tone means, but I didn’t want to find out. Then the question that I knew would come, came, Randy asked if I had any money. I told him that I had no cash on me (which was not true, but I had been driving him around for the last 30 minutes, so I thought it was ok to not give money). 

He starts giving me directions to another place, but I was unclear on where. We eventually show up to a parking lot with a food mart and a liquor store. I asked if this is where he buddy works, hoping I can drop him off and be on my way. He replies with, “No, there is an ATM in there for you to go in and get me money.” Please remember, it is now 11:50pm, in the bad side of town, at a 24-Hour Liquor store, and I’m white. There is NO WAY IN HELL I am going in that liquor store. So, I ask him how much he needs, hoping it’d be a few bucks, but he asks for $40. Now I am in a situation that I either need to cough up that cash, which I have in my wallet, or go into this liquor store. I give him the $40 and hope that suffices, because I have very little cash at this point and there is no ATM I will be using in that area at this time. We start driving again and he brings me to a gas station. This seemed to be a very popular gas station as there were many people loitering around. He begs me not to leave when he gets out of the car, but he thinks his buddy might be here. I promise him that I won’t leave and he gets out and talks with the people around the gas station for about 3 minutes. At this point I am getting a lot of looks and I am getting very uncomfortable. I send Patty my location and tell her to stay on alert in case I need her to call the cops. 

Randy gets back into my car and says he found his buddy and we need to follow his SUV to his buddy’s house. I do this with the hope this is the last stop and that I can get out of this situation. His buddy is going about 40-45mph (Speed Limit is 25-30mph) through neighborhoods, and I know I need to keep up, but I could barely do so as I am very unfamiliar with the area. After about 4 minutes, we finally arrive at a house. Randy gets out of the car and goes up to talk with this guy. They talk on the porch for a brief time, then the buddy goes inside and Randy stays on the porch. This made me feel a bit better that I could keep eyes on Randy the whole time, because I didn’t know if this was an elaborate scheme to rob, kidnap, or kill me. After they talk for about 7 minutes, Randy comes up to my window and says that his buddy needs $10 for him to give him a ride to his car, I tell him that I don’t have that and I’m sorry. Randy then asks if I can just take him to South Street and his buddy will pick him up there. Following the pattern of the night, I oblige. Randy gets into the car and continues to thank me for my help. The following is snippets of what I could understand Randy to be saying, as he mumbled and had a strong accent.

Randy: “Man, you know I am 50 years old. (I thought he looked more like 30) Let me prove it. Where is your light, turn on a light? (At which point I expect to see an ID. No, he pulls up his shirt and shows me his abs, I make some sort of comment to try to neutralize the situation) Man, you dating anyone? 

Me: “No, I was just hanging out with me ex” (Which was anything but true, but I thought this was neutralize the situation further, let me tell you, it didn’t) 

Randy: “Guy or girl” 

Me: “Girl” 

Randy: “You know I’m gay, but we all want the same thing. Women and men just want orgasms. You can call people and hookup on the phone now, ya know, phone sex. My buddies are doing it. I like when they talk dirty to me, yea yea.”

So now my comfort level is lower than the depths of hell and I would rather him grope the hole in my jeans than continue on this conversation. He apologizes for coming onto me, which was a warranted apology as I am 22 and he is 50, as his abs prove. I fly down the streets to get to South Street as fast as humanly possible. We finally arrive and he thanks me for me time. Hugs me and kisses me on the neck. Before he shuts the door, he pulls up his shirt one more time and says, “This is a 50 year old’s body” and shuts the door.

TL;DR I let a stranger into my car, drove him around the bad side of town for an hour, which caused me to lose $40, be hit on, and almost get mugged. I learned not to let the Jesuit Catholic Values completely guide your decisions."
9,"TIFU By pour smelling salts in my mouth, not being able to eat solid food for two weeks and becoming a cautionary tale.


So this happened when I was a kid and consequently rather dumb. I was a curious kid and liked to explore, take things apart and figure out how stuff worked.

So one day I am in the first aid kit in my house getting a bandaid and find this white paper thing which felt like it had something in it. It looked like [this](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/images/Salts-top.jpg) but all the text was worn off.

So being curious, I start to fiddle around with it to figure out what it is. I tear it open and find a glass vial with some sort of liquid inside. I carry this thing around with me for most the day. Later on I am lying down in front of the TV zoning out to some cartoon when for some reason I decide to hold this things in my teeth.

It instantly broke and coated my mouth and tongue with some sort of corrosive concoction (years later I learned an ammonia salt). I immediately jump and start screaming and running around the house like mad men. My mom is freaking out because she has no idea what is going. In all my blubbering and screaming I am trying to tell her that I ate something from the first aid kit.

She calls 911 and poison control. The fire department shows up as does an ambulance. The house is full of fire fighters and EMTs all asking me what happened and asking why I would put something that I didn’t know what it was in my mouth.

I then have to go the the hospital and explain it all over again. They too were incredulous and asked why I would do such a thing. They ultimately gave me a clean bill of health as I did not swallow anything but my moth as toast but not before reminding me it is pretty dumb to eat something out of the first aid kit (I didn’t eat it, I was just playing with it but that was the narrative from then on).

For the next two or so weeks I could only eat soup and cereal I’d leave in milk until you it got mushy.

To top it off this happened right before school started. I as forced to relive it for every class as the teacher made tell the kids what happened (I guess my mom said something?) as a cautionary tale of what not to do. Of course every kid said I was stupid and they would never eat something out of the first aid kit or put something in their mouth that they didn’t know what it was.

I should mention I was 12 and going into 6th grade, so yeah I should have known better.

TL;DR: Played with smelling salts, broken the vial in my mouth, burnt the crap out of my mouth and forced to relive the story over and over so other kids wouldn’t be idiots (except they all agreed no one could be that stupid)."
10,"TIFU by hooking my neighbor up with a con and causing his wife to kick him out


The fuckup happened a couple weeks ago, but I saw the result of that fuck up today.

A bit of backstory: I live in a predominantly Mormon area and I am not mormon. I receive quite a bit of criticism from my across the street neighbor. He currently has ten children. About a month ago, on trash day, he told one of his kids to kick my trash can over into the street. The kid did it, and I witnessed everything. This is not the first time he has kicked my trash over, and I figured it was a lost cause to go over there and ask them for some decency more than I already have.

That same day, I was reminded by a friend about how I used to have a pen pal when I was younger before I moved. Later that night, I was browsing the web looking for a pen pal when I stumbled across a cool sounding site: prisonpelpals.com. I visited the site and, after clicking through a few dodgy links, was brought to an array of different prisoners who were looking for a pen pal. After doing a bit of browsing from there, I stumbled across a fellow who was on death row for 1st degree murder. Feeling bad for this guy, but not wanting to give my address out (you send an email, the guards print it out and give it to the prisoner, who then write you a letter and delivers it to your physical address), I remembered the asshole across the street. More out of curiosity than malice, I proceeded to write a very detailed letter about how I am a trapped, secretly gay Mormon man with ten kids who is looking to start an extramarital affair with a prisoner. I put in his address and SEND! I had my hilarious, petty satisfaction.

I expected nothing to come out of this. I though he would be going through his mail, see the letter, not open it, toss it and think nothing of it after that. But boy, was I wrong.

Of course, with it being a small town, this guy does run a small business here where one of my acquaintances works. I went in just earlier today and chatted with my acquaintance before he told me “Oh my god, did you hear about (neighbor)?” I said no because I hadn’t and he filled me in on all of the details. 

Apparently one of the neighbor’s kids had brought in the mail, only for HIS WIFE to find it and read the letter from this prisoner responding to the joke letter that I wrote. I don’t know the specifics of the letter, but I do know that his wife threw a fucking FIT when he arrived home and made him pack his bags. My acquaintance informed me that this was not the first time Neighbor had started or tried to start an affair with another man, and apparently this was the last straw for her. I am still shocked, horrified, and extremely amused by this predicament.

TL;DR: I sent a prisoner looking for a pen pal a letter under my neighbor’s first name and address. When the letter came back, his wife found it and accused him of cheating on her with a man, as he had apparently done before, and kicked him out."
