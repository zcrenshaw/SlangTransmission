0,"TIFU by sending my husband to Korea


My husband got invited to be a speaker in a conference, but it’ll be in Seoul. He didn’t feel like attending since he finds conferences annoying &amp; hates long flights. But I wanted to go to Korea, and with hotel rooms and his flight paid for, it’ll be a cheaper trip for me. 

Loads of whining and food bribes later, he accepted with the condition that I go to every event with him to keep him company. 

...and then I realised the conference was happening too soon for me to get a visa. I’m Indonesian, and Indonesia’s not only a 3rd world country, it’s the world’s largest Muslim country....which means I’m always fucked traveling-wise and need a month to apply for visas to travel to most places. 

So yeah. My husband is now on a flight to Korea, alone and miserable. 

**TL;DR:** sent my husband on a trip he didn’t want to go to so I can tag along. And I can’t make it. 

**UPDATE:** My husband’s [reaction](https://imgur.com/a/6XHY0) when I told him another redditor is attending the same conference &amp; offered to hang out with him. "
1,"TIFU by looking at my uncle's face at his funeral


So this happened when I was about 13. It was 2am in October when my mom got a call that my uncle had passed away. When I awoke the next morning to my very concerned looking parents sitting on the edge of my bed, I knew someone had died. My mom broke down and told me it was my uncle. I cried but I wasn't terribly close to him although we were far from strangers. I packed my things and we flew to California and for the next 2 weeks we remained by my distressed grandmother's side. 

When Andy died (name change for obvious reasons) everyone was alerted but many weren't told how he died until the whole family was together, I was one of those who was left in the dark. When we arrived in California that day we drove to my great grandmothers house and everyone had gathered and there was hushed conversations and hugging and crying. I was very confused because it had now been hours and no one had told me how Andy had passed. My mom and grandma, after much pestering, brought me out back and told me the news. Andy had shot himself out in the bay and his body was discovered in a boat when his truck was reported for over night parking in a public space (I believe that's how they found him, I'm still a little fuzzy on the details). I didn't really process this until much later and soon you'll know why. 

While attending Andy's funeral only immediate family were allowed to see his body, due to the shape he was in and his sustained injuries. That included my Grandmother, Mom, Grandfather, and Me. I think maybe one other person was allowed in but he was kept in a separate room from the rest of the family and covered in sheet. You could only see his arms and hands which were crossed over his chest. Everyone took their time with him and finally we all went to the service. I heard my mother saying she wanted to see what his face looked like after the gunshot but the funeral director told her something along the lines of ""I can't stop you but I truly and honestly hope you don't look. You want to remember him how he was"". I was in complete shock and I distinctly remember wanting to see him. As a child I needed to see my uncle Andy again and I wanted to see his face. 

I had not processed this or thought it through whatsoever so by the time I had excused myself from the service to go to the bathroom and while I was sneaking into the back room I just wanted to see my uncle.

I'm not gonna draw this out. You don't need to know what was under that sheet. Andy wasn't there. Just burnt cheeks and a hole on the top of his head. I remember being very calm and putting the sheet back and going to sit back with my mom. I didn't cry until about a month later in class when someone was joking about suicide for a class project and continued to laugh while saying ""There are many ways to commit suicide. There's hanging, slitting your wrists, shooting yourself"" etc. It hit me like a ton of bricks and I lost it. I've since seen a therapist for this and I'm a healthy a well adapted adult but this is a tale of caution for everyone out there. When someone you love kills themselves and a funeral director tells you it's better you remember them the way they are, fucking listen to them. It's not worth it, trust me.

**TL;DR While attending my uncle's funeral I looked at his face (it was a closed casket situation/he shot himself). Fucked me up for years.**

**Edit:** poorly worded TL;DR

**Update:** Wow! I can't believe how much traction this gained. Thank you so much everyone for all your kind words and I'm sorry for everyone who has lost someone and I hope you are all finding comfort in knowing that you're not alone. Big thank you to whoever gave me gold! I want my story to be a cautionary tale and I'll try to get through all the comments if I can. "
2,"TIFU by listening to my brain fart and not cutting an apple like normal people do


Yesterday I was prepping some snacks into a container for placement. I know apples don't usually need a container but, as a student on a hospital placement, my bag is probably full of germs. To fit the apple I had to cut in half. This should been a simple knife-on-the-chopping-board cut but ""Fruit Ninja!"" popped into my head. 

You're now probably thinking I threw the apple, swung the knife and injured myself. But no. I didn't. Not because I thought it's dangerous, but because I doubted my samurai skills would produce two halves rather than an off-centre quarter slice. 

Unfortunately, I didn't give up. Instead I thought steadying the apple in the air with one hand was a brilliant solution [no. It was very dumb](#spoiler). I do so with my left hand and swipe at the apple with the blade in my right. I can't exactly remember what happened other than the apple hit the floor and I saw what looked like half my thumb missing. I quickly grabbed some kitchen paper and was rushed to Accident and Emergency by my pals.

After they controlled the bleeding the damage became clear. I sliced the tip of my thumb off and lacerated the three neighbouring fingers and broke the index nail vertically. Fortunately the cuts were clean and no tendons or bones were nicked. I do however have to avoid using my hand to help it heal and because it hurts like a bitch. At least I made it to the hospital still I guess. Funniest moment was returning home to find the apple survived the ordeal more than me. Also my finger tip unlocks my phone which is great because I can stitch it to my gloves now.

Tl;dr: I couldn't open my apple. I was just holding it wrong and didn't lose all my digits.


Edit: reworded the last line of the second paragraph. (was: rather than a quarter and two thirds)

Edit 2: for those curious here's [the knife.](https://i.imgur.com/NVNk1Db.jpg) I think it's a santoku knife. Maybe ceramic."
3,"TIFU by letting my daughter stay up past her bedtime, holiday tradition ruined


This happened over the weekend, and that this is my third year celebrating holiday and not too knowledgeable or accustomed to traditions. (reason, am an exJW) This was the second year doing the Elf on the Shelf, last year i forgot to move it several nights; my daughter would wake up and say if she did something wrong or what happened because it didn't move. So this year i came up with the ingenious solution of setting up an alarm for everyday til Christmas, great idea right? She goes to bed at 8pm and my alarm would go off at 12am, i would move it every night and no disappointment! WRONG! After an introductory marathon of Jackie Chan movies that extended past, you guessed it, midnight! My daughter was lying down next to my phone and it went off with the captions MOVE ELF, she saw it and i reached and got the phone, tried to get up and grabbed a SHELF that was by my bedroom door and moved it. She stared at me and said, ""Daddy, why did your phone said move elf?"" I tried to tell her it said move shelf, not elf. (She is 8, reads extremely well) After many attempts of trying to convince her, i had to come clean. She cried for what felt an eternity and was sad for longer. The upside is that she is a very cool kid and now she says she is glad she knows the truth, because now she can play with her elf ""Daisy"" and have fun with it, rather than just sitting on there still.

TL;DR Allowed my daughter to stay up past her bedtime after an introductory marathon of Jackie Chan movies and saw my alarm to move her elf on the shelf, she was crushed. But now says she is glad and plays with it, named her ""Daisy""

Edit: Rush Hour marathon
Edit2: thanks for all the love and for MY FIRST GOLD in the comments! "
4,"TIFU By losing my mothers corpse.


Okay so I have been lurking here on reddit for quite a while now and I haven't even bothered making an account but after reading some of the stories here I think that I might have a good one for you. This happened a while ago.

I have been working a at a company producing steel basically since I graduated and I have rather quickly moved up the ranks that now in fact I sometimes get to make deals with our clients abroad.

Some months ago I got a call from my boss saying that they are about to make a deal with a large Polish company and they want me down there do seal the deal so to speak. I see this as a huge opportunity and I decide to go. 

As I'm planning my trip I realise that my mother who is very sickly and will most likely not survive another year have talked visiting Warzaw to see some famous buildings (I honestly can't remember the names of those buildings). I decide that now when I have the chance I should bring my mother with me so I call her and she sounds very excited about the trip with her son. 

Fast forward a week and I meet my mother at the airport and after waiting another hour because a delayed flight we are of to Warzaw. The trip goes great and when we arrive I have to rush to the meeting, barely having time to check in on the hotel to leave my luggage.

The meeting itself goes fantastic and my boss is so pleased that when I ask if I could stay another couple days with my mom he has nothing against it. My mom however did not really find those buildings that interesting so we decide to rent a car and go on a bit of a road trip. We set of and after driving for an entire day we end up at this little motel in the middle of nowhere and decide to spend the night there.

When I wake up, my mom is dead and even if I knew that her heart would fail her any day now I still have never been so shocked in my entire life. After trying to comprehend what just happened and calling my siblings I get informed from my siblings that mom have said that she wanted to be buried next to my father. This is not a request I can ignore so I make a call to the Swedish Ambassador in Warzaw explaining my situation and they say that if I can get my mother to Warzaw they would fix a plane that could take her home.

Now as you might have already realised I'm about a days trip from Warzaw so how on earth am I going to get my mothers corpse that is starting to smell a bit to that plane. After putting all my braincells to good use I come up with the perfect plan, I will put her in the roofbox ontop the car and drive her back. I know that his might seem morbid but I didn't feel like I had any choice.

After getting some help from the very confused and disgusted personel at the motel I'm finally able to start my drive back to Warzaw with my mother.  

After driving for about 4 hours I get hungry so I decide to stay at gas station for something to eat. I go inside and order some hotdog and a coke and while I sit there eating I can see something very strange, my car is moving. It dawns upon me that because the lack of sleep and the habit of not having to lock my car where I live in Sweden I left the care unlocked with the keys. I rush out just to be able to see the back of some polish thugs shaved head as he drives of with my car and as I'm running after him cursing him for stealing my rental car I remember the bigger issue. I let someone steal my mothers corpse and I will have to explain that to my siblings. 

TL;DR Went on a trip to Poland with my mother and lost her corpse.

Edit: Made clear that this happened a while ago also it has been clear that this is a urban legend. Will try to provide evidence within the upcoming days.

Edit nr 2: There might be an article about this is a small polish magazine. If I could get any help from Polish redditors to find this then I would be very thankfull! "
5,"TIFU by keeping a journal about a roadkill squirrel


(oblig: not ""today"")   
  
When I was in middle school, we were supposed to write a journal about something that we thought would change as the school year progressed.  I think what they had in mind was stuff like family life, our bodies, relationships, etc.  
  
But there was this squirrel that had just been run over at the end of my street.  
  
So I documented the slow decay and dissolution of that squirrel for the rest of the first half of the year, describing it in detail, with sketches, poems, my thoughts on life and death, pressed leaves from the ""scene of the crime"" and even bits of fur and a teensie little claw I ripped from it.  Over time, the body just sort of flattened out and dried up, eventually getting shredded into insignificant bits by repeated squashings from passing cars.  The end came with the first significant snowfall, when the plows mashed the body up into the tiny ice mountain lining the street.  I could never find it again even after the Indian Summer thaw that melted the snow mounds the next week.  
  
In my mind, the dead squirrel was a sort of metaphor for my life.  I had just found out that I was adopted.  My parents were on the verge of divorce.  My body was doing some pretty weird shit.  I'd been crushed by that initial revelation, and *EVERYTHING* was slowly falling apart and disintegrating.  It was an art piece.  It felt important at the time.  
  
So it came time to turn in my project before leaving for the winter break (and a trip to Disney which was a blatant thrashing attempt by my parents to make up for the shitty year they'd put me through so far).  I sat there while my classmates took their turns at presenting to the class.  There was some introspective stuff, but mostly it was about things like how the school lunches had changed or what was going on with some issue in the press.  
  
And then it was my turn.  I started with my initial photograph of the dead squirrel, on its back, staring wordlessly up into an uncaring sky, and to be frank- more than a little bloated (I'd started the project several days after its demise).  That got mixed reviews.  Sketches of maggots, the fur samples, some of the more ""meaningful"" (author's pick!) poetry, and a sort of cobbled-together chart of the progression of the body's decay were received with interest.  I think some of the kids ""got it.""  Others, not so much.  Nobody barfed, but there were more than a few sincere sounding retches from the audience.  
  
Stunned silence followed by tentatively uncertain applause.      
  
I remember Disney being really nice.  My parents were getting back together, or at least putting on a unified front for my sake.  We did all the rides, ate all the food, watched the parades and fireworks.  But there was always a sense of something being a little ""off.""  They occasionally held sidebar conversations just out of my range of hearing, glancing back at me with concerned looks on their faces.  
  
The day that everyone came back from break, my parents went with me to school.  That was weird, but when you're a kid you just go with things.  Instead of going to home room, we sat in the little waiting area in the school's front office.  And then the receptionist showed us into the office of the school counselor, who had my project prominently displayed on his desk.  
  
I spent the next hour explaining that: No, I was not suicidal.  No, I was not depressed.  Yes, I had friends- lots of them!  No, I was not upset about my parents' situation.  No, there was nobody picking on me at school.  No, nothing particular was wrong.  No, there was nobody named ""Gerald"" (my picked-at-random name for the dead squirrel).  No the squirrel didn't represent anyone in particular.  No, I wasn't responsible for the death of the squirrel.  No, I had not kept notes on any other dead bodies, squirrel, human, or other species, nor did I have plans to do this on a regular basis in the future.   (They never asked me the last couple directly, but you KNOW they were nibbling around the edges of that line of questioning).  
  
And no, I didn't think it was weird for a middle school student to document the slow decay and eventual disappearance of a dead squirrel in excruciating detail.  You asked for a journal about ""something we knew would change.""  Did this not fit the bill?  Did that squirrel's body not CHANGE?  
  
I remember my parent's reactions.  They were aghast.  I found out later that they'd heard about the journal but hadn't actually seen it before the meeting with the counselor.  (I played my cards pretty close to my chest as a kid, and they hadn't had a lot of time for me that year anyway).  I'm sure seeing your child's notebook with entries like ""Not many maggots today"" in it could take you by surprise.  
  
After a very uncomfortable interrogation and a forced promise to ""come by and see you if I ever have these feelings again,"" I was released into the wild.  As a kid, you're used to adults wasting your time on useless shit like this, so I don't think it really bothered me at the time.  
  
The rest of the school year was a mixed bag.  I had become ""that weird kid"" and received a TON of teasing about it.  Someone decided I was ""squirrel girl"" (before the comic made that a *good* thing) or sometimes ""dead squirrel girl"" which was worse.  There was a horrible week where my official nickname was ""Road Kill Jill.""  People thought I was Goth for some reason.  I wasn't, and didn't get into that scene later either.  But somehow I was ""that Goth girl who did experiments on dead animals.""  The occasional requirement to ""check in"" with the school counselor didn't help, since it was obviously some sort of mandatory therapy for my incipient transformation into a serial killer.  
  
But on the flip side, there were lots of kids who thought it was cool.  And my friends had known that I was ""a little weird"" for a long time.  So like most of us who make a cringeworthy faux pas, I muddled through it long enough for the next kid to become the focus of negative attention.  
  
My one regret from all this is that I never insisted on getting my notebook or supporting materials back from the school counselor.  It wasn't a bad project, and it did have some pretty decent and insightful stuff.  I'd love to be able to look back into the brain of middle-school-me and see what was going on in there.  Unfortunately, it's probably in a box somewhere in the basement of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit, waiting to match me to one of their UnSubs' profiles.  I can only hope that they give me a cool name, like ""The Squirrial Killer.""    
  
tl;dr: got a school journal assignment.  Chose to document the decay of a roadkill squirrel in morbid detail.  Freaked out school, kids, parents.  Got teased unmercifully.  Got over it."
6,"TIFU by drinking a glass full of ants


I got home later than normal and wanted to fit some downtime in before I had to study for exams, so I decided to make myself some coffee and catch the new Brooklyn 99 before buckling down. I turn off most of the lights in the entertainment room and turn the TV on, and leave to make the coffee.


I ended up making it in the espresso machine, and fill a small glass with the night prolonging caffeine. Deciding to get a little creative, I dump a hot chocolate mix pouch into a pint glass and give it a glance in case there's anything in the drink mix. Looks fine.

This is where it would be appropriate to mention that with the coming of winter, the ants have decided to move into the kitchen and have learned how to eat into cereal bags, granola bars, you name it. In order for the dry goods to survive while the baits do their work, most of them were moved into various airtight containers last week, including the hot cocoa mix. 

That being said, I dump the hot espresso over the drink mix, give it a stir and add some milk for volume, and proceed to watch the entirety of the TV show. Literally as the credits were rolling, I pick at something between my teeth, only to realize its a crushed cluster of sugar ants. Realizing immediately what happened, I turn on the overhead lights and look into the mostly emptied glass, and notice a *disturbing* number of ants strewn across the sides of the glass and littered about the bottom. Gargling with water confirms just how many of the buggers ended up in my teeth (at least 2 dozen) with many more undoubtedly in my gut. 

The ants most likely were actively raiding the drink mix baggy when they got packed into the ""ant proof"" containers and died inside, only to become protein mix a week later.

tl;dr Ants that ate their way into a baggy of hot cocoa mix a week ago ended up in my pre-exam mocha which I unsuspectingly drank in the dark while watching Brooklyn 99. 

edit: Hey sorry for the comments getting locked? Maybe because its a throwaway?
Anyways, to answer some comments: yes they taste funny, I noticed after the fact that there was a pretty bad artificial sweetener/horseradish-y aftertaste, and yes, Protein. "
7,"TIFU by killing a spider at the drive-thru and causing a 4 day quarantine.


This is far recent, 3 weeks ago tuesday.

I currently work at a chicken place (dont wanna say name for obvious reasons) and im usually the opening manager. Duties go on as usual as far as getting the store ready to open at 11am. It starts with my 930 cashier... 

She's at the drive-thru area prepping small condiments like BBQ sauce and hot sauce for individual plates, when i hear a blerting scream! I run foward to see her running towards me screaming spider... I giggle and chuckle. ""Oh its just a daddy long legs it ain't gonna hurt ya."". It wasnt even inaide it was at the top of the glass where the window doesnt even open. 

This is where everything went wrong...... I decide ill squeeze in a cigarette, sweep the parking lot, and end the spider. Now, where the resturant is located is inside of a cut. Theres a lot of woods and a huge dip that holds a creek right next to the drive-thru and fenced off. Well it's getting cold and spiders come out. Sure thats common, they love wooded areas and sitting brush. 

Moving on, i finish my cigarette and approach the window. I noticed 3 or 4 more spiders so i try to move them together with a broom stick and throw them over the fence. All of a sudden i see 5,6,10 scrambling in straight lines. I jump in complete spite and the top of the broom smacks right into the rain guard (basically a roof over the window) and several daddy long legs rain down on me. I start slapping myself all over and ditch the broom and dust pan.

I run to the front door with my keys out (front door has to stay locked until 1050) and im met by my other 2 co workers, screaming bloody murder. I look up and to the back of house and the daddy long legs are running by the hundreds through the kitchen, the food, all up the walls. It was the definition of a horror movie. 

Turns out i disrupted several beds of the suckers who had claimed parts of the hollow roof home. We ended up having to wait outside until the district manager showed up with a can of raid and who swore we were ridiculous and over reacting. When he showed up he was in complete awe and refused to step inside the store. 

He called an emergency exterminator, guy came out and pretry much noped it. Waited for back up and they ended up having to close the store, shut off electric and gas, all utilities and had to tear up the roof. 

Edit: Wow this post really blew up for one thing. My first big post. So ive learned a lot about daddy long legs and now know they are NOT spiders. Thank you reddit community! Also to clarify i have no access to the DVR in-store. Only the general manager and assistant manager have the access key for it. Also i use a flip phone. My co-workers did take pictures but you can hardly see anything between the sun glare on the glass and that theyre so skinny you can hardly see, they look like faint clusters of shadows. Also our district manager instructed us not to post any images to social media or else it will result in termination and i kind of need my job right now. 

tl;dr: Disrupted a bed of daddy long legs and caused my entire store to be quarantined for 4 days while thousands of the spiders were removed. "
