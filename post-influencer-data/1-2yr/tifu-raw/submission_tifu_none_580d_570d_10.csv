0,"TIFU by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.


So this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. Now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. And just before Sillybands took over as chief Tween Pimp Currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". Basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. We would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and Paper Hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

Eventually, things got out of hand. It became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. Heists were performed on teacher's desks. Books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. Students presented welts from Paper Hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. Rubber bands were contraband. It was a full-on Mad Max Magic School Bus adventure.

Here's where the fuckup started. One night, I was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: The secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. Spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. I needed something aerodynamic. So, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""I'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" I thought to myself.

Let me tell you.

The next day, I created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. With the inkwell loaded, I felt like a small, sexually frustrated MacGyver with intent to kill. On the bus, my friend (let's call him Neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. I obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. Neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). I aimed, pulled back and fired. All I saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before I heard an extremely sudden *crack*. I looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from Neo's head.

My parents had to pay for the window. Neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until Senior Year. The principal cracked down on Locker Artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

But I still won that arms race.

TL;DR: Sixth Grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. I upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. I was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

EDIT: RIP Inbox. Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!

EDIT 2: Okay, since it seems to be a popular request, I will make a video tutorial on this device. It will be posted here over the weekend (since I work). I am not responsible for what you do with it."
1,"TIFU looking after a drunk friend (NSFW)


So this actually happened today. Well, tonight, I mean. I've just gotten out of scrubbing myself in the shower and am ready to talk about tonight's efforts.

So I went out for dinner alone tonight. I figured that I could go catch a set of my friend's band playing and have dinner and a few quiet drinks. Once out, I run into two female friends who were on the sauce. I had a few mojitos, they had a good dozen shots each. We're having a good night, I decide to head further uptown with them as they're keen for the dancing and my buddy DJs at the club they were wanting to go to.

Once we start walking though, things change. All of a sudden, one of the girls - let's call her Amy - has all the alcohol hit her. She's barely able to stand, I end up giving her a piggyback ride the three or so blocks to the cab rank. You'd think her friend she went out with - we'll call her Mary - would see this and want to put her in a cab, right? Nope, she's been getting more and more pissed that I've been paying attention just to Amy and wants Amy to just go to the clubs with her. Straight away. Not after she's had a few minutes rest. Right now.

Luckily, we're at the cab rank at this point, Mary storms off to go clubbing by herself, leaving me with an Amy that can't even stand up straight. I get her in the cab and get in after her, ignoring all the glares and catcalls I'm getting from everyone around that think I'm going to take her home and molest her (welcome to Australia, where if you're an ugly guy with a drunk girl, everyone immediately assumes you're about to take advantage of her).

As soon as the cab takes off, she falls asleep on my shoulder. 'Excellent' I think, 'this should be easy, I'll get her to her house, then her boyfriend can look after her and I'll head back out'. Within thirty seconds, she starts throwing up in her sleep. All over the cab, all over me, in my hair, in my mouth. The cabbie is justifiably furious. I hand him the cleaning fee of $150 he is demanding in order to keep driving, then when we finally get to her house he kicks us out, not before demanding another $50 for the fare (even though the meter said it was a $12.70 fare).

Amy jumps out and flops face-down into the dirt before I can even get out of my side of the car. Then she starts puking again. As I'm desperately trying to get her onto her side and keep her airways clear, she starts yelling at me to get her shoes off because she can't walk with them on.

Which is when her boyfriend (that I've never met) opens the door and comes downstairs to see me hunched over his paralytic girlfriend, trying to take her shoes off while she's kicking and screaming to get them off so she can go inside.

Luckily this guy takes a few seconds, realises what's going on and understands I'm not trying to assault his girlfriend and gets me to help carry her inside and get her into the bathtub. At this point I'm still wearing his girlfriend's vomit like the world's shittiest brand of beard oil, but once she's in the bathroom, I'm out on the street. Dude does not want me around, which I suppose is fair enough. I mean, if a strange man showed up on the doorstep with my drunk girlfriend I'd be pretty pissed about the situation too.

But either way, I'm now out on the street, covered in vomit and in a strange part of town that I don't know. After wandering around lost for twenty minutes, I finally found a lift home and got a well-deserved shower. And now I'm finishing typing this story up for all you fine folks.

TL;DR - helped a drunk friend, got treated like a date-rapist, had to pay cleaning fees after she vomited all over the cab and myself, got turfed out in the middle of the night in a strange part of town still covered in said vomit.

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this. I'm at work at the moment, but I'll read what everyone has said when I get home tonight. 

But if I could ask everyone to do one small favour for me, it's go and do something nice for someone today please. Betting nice feels good.  :)

2nd edit: Thank you for the gold, kind strangers!"
2,"TIFU by being alone on Valentine's Day


At the checkout area of my University's cafeteria, I noticed an assortment of couples gifts and other Valentine's Day treats near the counter. Being the depressed recently single man that I am, I purchased one of the romantically decorated bottles of sparkling cider to drink alone.

Fast forward three hours, I had returned from class, and decided that now was a better time than ever to crack that bad boy open and chug some bubbly goodness. I quickly realized that my ex took the bottle opener when she left, so I dug out a belt I owned with a bottle opener attached to the buckle.
In the kitchen, I began prying at the lid with the belt, and after a good half a minute of struggling, it finally popped off.

My moment of victory was short lived, as I immediately noticed something was very, very wrong. My hand was very warm. I look down to see blood gushing out of my thumb, squirting onto the counter, flowing across my hand and down my wrist.

Apparently when popping the bottle cap off of the bottle, I managed to take a chunk of the rim of the bottle with it, which had sliced through my thumb about half way up.

I immediately panicked, clasping my other hand over the thumb, and after realizing that all I was accomplishing was spreading blood around to other parts of my body, I grabbed the nearby roll of paper towels and clenched it as hard as I could to absorb as much blood as possible. It was at this point I was able to grab my phone and make a call to my buddy to take me to the hospital.

**TLDR: Tried to be sad alone, ended up being sad in the hospital**

3,"TIFU by knocking out my date


So yesterday was Valentine's day and I've been seeing a girl who used to wrestle when she was younger. I was a wrestler for 10 years and we both knew this. So we get drunk last night and start messing around on the couch. We're just using moves on each other and I'm winning with ease. 

We do this for a while and it's all fun and games until she says ""I bet I can beat you from the standing position."" We are both pretty trashed at this point so we stand up in her living room and start facing off. We tie up with each other and instinct kicks in so I sprawl and slam her head into the hardwood floor. I spin around behind her and then I realize she isn't moving.

At this point I realize that I fucked up badly. She was out for like 10 seconds. She comes to and she has a huge black and blue knot over her eye brow. I'm feeling like a gigantic piece of shit and after a couple of seconds she laughs and says it's okay. 

So the TL;DR here is that I got trashed on wine with a girl. We wrestled. I knocked her TF out on a hardwood floor. Now she has a lump like a pachycephalosaurus on her head."
4,"TIFU by washing my car


This happened aver the course of this afternoon. My apartment block has a shared carpark with no assigned lots so everyone just parks where there is space. So its a sunny day and I decide to go down to wash my very filthy car. I've got two pails of water which I have to lug down from my unit, my wax, chamois cloth etc etc. I walk up to my car and start soaping it up then I rinse and wipe off the water.  I apply a nice layer of wax and then work on the rims. After a good hour or so of detailing the car I realise my neighbor is standing behind me. I look up at him and smile saying ""what a good job eh?"" and he goes ""yeah it is great job. Thanks. What do I owe u for it"" as he unlocks the door. It takes me a good moment before I realise I've spent the good part of the afternoon cleaning my neighbor's identical car... I had thought it was that dirty but hadn't realized anything else was amiss as we have the same interior and same rims.... And now I've got a super burn and a still filthy car. 

TL;DR washed my neighbors identical car by accident....

EDIT: WOAH SHIT this blew up while I was asleep. Thank you kind stranger for POPPING MY REDDIT GOLD CHERRY!

Edit 2: okay, so yes a major part of the f up is that I did not check either the license plate or unlock the car doors. I have two toddlers. Cleaning up the interior is a challenge in its own right. A man has a right to clean rims even if the car is filled with peanuts.

Edit 3: didn't take the payment. I know the guy. We know we have the same car. We joke about it and the wives are annoyed as heck lol.

Edit 4: I clean the car interior and exterior separately, so no I don't open the doors. I hand wash to save water and money . I use a pressurized watering can to lather the soap on, then rise off with water and sponge. Toothbrush for rims, Squiddgie for windows.

Edit 5: so finally figured out the FU with the wife. I parked in my usual lot over night. Wife took it out the next day then parked it elsewhere coz my neighbor shifted to my lot. I come out from a nap a bit dazed and just get to work. A TIFU is born. "
5,"TIFU by getting my wife pregnant therefore getting her fired before she started her new job.


Me and my wife have been living in Canada and I have been going to school. We decide that once I am done in a year we will move near her family in the USA. We also decide to have an inexpensive baby while still in Canada. We had no luck getting pregnant for one year.

Fast forward until End of January 2018. I graduate and she finds a job at a hospital in the USA near her family and it offers good medical, and a moving bonus. We pack up everything, hire movers with the promised bonus and move across country. Wife still testing negative on the pregnancy test. 

The first week of February we drive across the country, to a city 3 hours from her parents and stay in an air-bnb for 2 weeks in preparation, to find an apartment. My wife goes to HR, they say she needs to get a physical to work in the hospital. She is supposed to start the second week. The tests all go fine, she is drug free, the only thing is the doctor finds that she is partially susceptible to Chicken Pox. That is fine she just needs to get the vaccine morning she starts. One caveat to this test is the vaccine actually giving the person chicken pox, so it could potentially mess up the baby. So we take another pregnancy test the day before just to make sure she still is not pregnant. She tested positive, which is awesome for 1 year we have been trying, but this means she cannot get the vaccine. Then she cannot pass the physical, and therefore the hospital told my wife that they cannot hire her. 

We now have no health insurance. The hospital told us they will not reimburse us the $4000 moving costs since my wife did not pass the physical. 

I need to hurry up and find a job so we can go to the doctor. I hear doctors visits are important in pregnancy. I had not started to apply for a job because I was taking a break after all the school and am working as a consultant with no health insurance.

TLDR; Me and my wife have been trying to have a baby for 1 year. The week before she starts a new job she gets pregnant cannot get vaccinated to work in a hospital and loses her job before she starts.

edit: Wow this got a lot bigger a lot faster than I expected. I was driving back to my in-laws house 3 hours. I will try to respond to everyone. I am pm'ing /u/Icecityx1221 my resume.

edit2: We paid 6 years into Canadian health care, so inexpensive pregnancy, yet we realize raising a respectable human being will cost money. We had a plan with a couple months savings (that was supposed to buy us a house), we both had a full time job before we moved. I expected to have some time before getting a job.

edit3: I am off to bed. Thank you reddit for all of your comments. I have a grad degree in software engineering and do not think I should have a problem getting a job, it is just taking longer than I want. I have 4 years full stack experience, and 6 year data science experience. "

7,"TIFU by leaving a can of Pepsi in my car and letting curiosity get the best of me


Summer time in the upper Midwest, I'm chilling at home when I get a call from some friends that they don't have a way home from some event in the cities, and I'm their only way back. Sure, I'll come grab you guys I guess. Gotta clean out my car though so everyone can fit. Garbage bag full of crap, last thing is two 24 packs of pop, Mountain Dew and Pepsi that are variably full. 

I think to myself that the warm temperatures probably aren't good, and I reach in and grab a can of Pepsi. I notice the bottom of the can is not concave...but instead convex, bulging outward. Woah, never seen something like that. I'm curious as to how much pressure it is under, and want to see Pepsi shoot outward. So standing at about the drivers side back door facing away from the front of the car, I hold the can horizontal and go to open it. I slowly start pulling the tab back, and the very next instant, I am coated with a fine mist of Pepsi and the can is no longer in my hand. I look behind me, the whole side of my car and my drivers side inside window is coated in a fine mist (as I had that door open not thinking it would be affected). I see about twenty feet behind me a torn open can, like someone cut it nearly in half with a knife, literally bone dry on the inside. The pressure was so high that literally every single last particle of Pepsi vacated the can. 

Not fun trying to wipe down smearing Pepsi mist on windows while it's closing in on 100F while I've gotta hurry to meet friend people (who ended up not even being grateful). 

TL;DR: Opened a highly pressurized can of Pepsi just to have it shoot out of my hand and coat everything in the near vicinity in a fine sticky mist. "
8,"TIFU by turning my girlfriend into a freaking orange (update)


https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7tch5e/tifu_by_turning_my_girlfriend_into_a_freaking

So I showed my girlfriend the post and she had a good laugh at all the creative ways you people (deservedly) ripped me a new asshole. We then agreed we should update y'all.

SHE GOT THE JOB! Unsurprisingly as she is one of the smartest and most capable people I know. 

I've replaced the moisturizer and sincerely apologized for my stupidity in forgetting the interview date due to my own stress and being a general cretin, as well as lying about it. I am generally forgiven, but on probation - and you can bet I will never fuck up like that again.

My girlfriend wishes me to let you guys know her moisturizer was from Tatcha. She also says she is a bit mad so many people assumed she wasn't saying the truth when she said she wasn't mad about the prank, only about forgetting the interview and lying. ""I always mean exactly what I say thank you very much."" That said, I'll take your comments to heart and never, ever mess with anyone's skincare or make up again. 

Finally, there was one UNEXPECTED development. Apparently my mom, a sweet retired nurse who by her own admission struggles to navigate her own inbox, is a redditor. A friend from her FB knitting group helped her set up an account cause apparently reddit knitting community is really great? Anyway, Mom says reddit's easy to use except search is ""a bit wonky."" Lol.

My mom saw the post as it hit the first page and quickly pieced together it was from me (thank god I used a throwaway). Then in Mom logic, she actually didn't call me but my girlfriend, completely mortified, and they spent half an hour discussing what a freaking idiot I was. Gf said it was a very bonding experience. 

Mom also says she left a comment on the original, but I don't really want to search for it lol. But if you see this, hi mom! 

Tl;dr: my girlfriend got the job, I was forgiven, my mom is a redditor apparently? Cheers"
9,"TIFU by waiting 15 years to let a doctor touch my balls


As I am now laying in the hospital bed, I guess this still counts as TIFU ...
15 years ago I was a young and adventurous boy, playing around with everything attached to me. So one day I noticed some kind of hard-ish pea sized ball on my balls. I kept an eye on it, but since I was too embarrassed at my tender age of 14 to talk to anyone about it I never knew what to do. So after it grew to about cherry size it stopped growing and I had my little mate on my most intimate location for the next 15 years where he enjoyed my best and my worst experiences thus far. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago: I finally went to an urologist and he said don't worry, easy surgery to remove. We made an appointment and that was that. A week ago my little companion decided now is a good time to suddenly grow to golf ball size nearly over night. Apparently getting infected was also part of his plan...so I thought I can muscle through it until I got my already scheduled surgery. That's where the fuck up got worst, because yesterday the pain got so intense, I had to leave work (on a mountain on skis) and go straight to the hospital. After several ""oooooh yeah""s and ""aaaah"" s from doctors and nurses I got to surgery immediately. So just know my doctor told me it was a last minute effort because some of the infected tissue already broke inside but luckily they could remove everything bad in time.
So now I'm lying in a hospital bed post surgery and wondering what could've gone wrong in the last 15 years...

TL;DR: was too shy to show my balls to a doc for 15 years, after I did it got infected and nearly lost all of it...

Edit: no matter what, if something is only slightly odd show it to a doctor! 
Get over it, it's just your balls, not your bank account you're showing (at least that would be the more embarrassing thing for me 🙈)

Edit #2: to clarify for anyone who doesn't want to dig through the comments: mine was on the scrotum, just under the skin. It wasn't attached to any of my balls, I just described it like this because I didn't know better...
And I can only repeat after countless PM's and comments: get yourself checked! I was lucky. 1. It wasn't cancer and 2. I treated it just at the last second. I don't recommend this! Get some professional eyes on and just get it over with, if you're scared/embarrassed/shy. 
If anyone has questions or just wants to talk about, I'm happy to answer but I am not a doctor and my opinion is in no way professional or even slightly educated.

I hope all of you are well, I am home now and just have to check in at the hospital every 2 days for cleaning and inspection so hopefully this will soon be over! Thanks for the kind words and don't stop touching your balls/breasts people! If something's odd show it the doc"
10,"TIFU by photoshopping my school reports


This actually happened a few years ago during my high school years.

As an Asian, my parents expect a lot from me, especially from my school grades. However, I was basically failing school as I was getting a consistent 20-50% in all my subjects. I was ashamed of my low marks so I didn't tell anyone and I usually avoided talking about tests and school about my friends. During the final days of the first semester, I get my school report and, as expected, it was all bad really mean teacher comments. Usually, I would show my parents but I was scared about the ass- whooping I was going to get, so I had the bright idea of photoshopping it.

I get home 2-3 hours before my parents do on a school day so I had plenty of time. I scanned the pages to my computer and I photoshopped it. It was pretty easy and I wrote glowing teacher comments and amazing test results on the photoshopped report. When my parents came home, I gave them the photoshopped report and they seemed to be pretty happy. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and it turns out that there's a parent- teacher conference. They attended it and when they got home they were pissed. In there hand was a copy of my original school report. They ended up taking away my phone and my laptop, only allowing me supervised desktop sessions for schoolwork. They also made me study in dining room while they watched me and made me attend 11 hours of tutoring every weekend. They also took all the money from my wallet and savings account.

My teachers also found out I photoshopped my school reports so they called a whole school assembly about being true to yourself and others.

Tldr; photoshopped my school report and then my parents and school found out, and I got humiliated.

11,"TIFU by taking a bath in a freshly scrubbed tub


Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. As is not tradition, this just happened, and the pain is oh so fresh.

After a nice dinner with my boyfriend tonight following a long day of work, we were hanging out at his place watching the Olympics, when I decided to take a bath. You see, my back had been extremely achy all day, and he has a fantastic bathtub, so I figured I'd take advantage of it while there.

As I lowered myself into the warm water, my muscles instantly relaxed, but then, that relaxation was followed a few minutes later by an intense burning in my vagina. It felt like a UTI, but there was more..a deeper pain that made me want to scream out. 

I lept out of the tub and upon drying off quickly realized I smelled like bleach. My boyfriend's housecleaners had come earlier that day, and used bleach to clean the tub, unbeknownst to me. I am extremely sensitive to any kind of chlorine, bleach, etc..and it seems this is no exception.

So now, I'm trying everything I can to get this burning sensation to go away as I curse the fire that has inhabited my red, swollen groin, and don't see myself getting much sleep tonight. 

TL;DR I took a bath in a tub that had a lot of bleach residue and now my vagina feels like Hades.

Edit: Had no idea this would blow up so much...My top post ever is apparently about my vagina. Too bad I won't get that sweet, sweet karma on my main /s. To those wondering why I didn't just post on my main, call me old-fashioned, but some acquaintances know my main account username, and I'd rather they didn't have intimate knowledge of my vaginal issues.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the home remedies, but for now I'm just flushing it with water and seeing what happens. If it's still painful tomorrow I'll go to the doctor. Sure I'll be fine, just irritation.

Edit 3: To those sending me rude messages telling me this is fake, my vagina begs to differ. "
