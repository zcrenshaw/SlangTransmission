0,"TIFU by chuckling away being overpaid.


Obligatory ""this concluded today"" - I've been working for Uncle Sam for about 7 years now. I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.

Silly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

Laughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

Now I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job."" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

This was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.

Two weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

I'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y'know sir?""

""Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.

Apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

Until tonight, I've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.

Thank you Army. I will never forget you.

TlDr; Army overpaid me 2 cents, I paid them back three and had to mop floors for their fuckup because feds have sticks up their asses by birth."
1,"TIFU by introducing my pitbull to my kitten


So, a little bit of backstory: 

My mom used to work in a barn caring for horses. One day somebody came with a dog. It was emaciated looking, and had scars on its face. My mom felt bad for it and brought it home. We found that it was abused as a puppy and abandoned. It's now five years later and she's healthy and resilient. She's scared of anybody raising objects around her or making loud noises due to her past, but she's protective of her family and a lovely dog for the house. She's been a bit overprotective recently, growling and sometimes lunging at passersby on walks, and it's something we're working on. Being that she's a muscular, intimidating looking dog, people tend to stay away anyway. Other than that, she's a perfect pitbull.

We also just adopted a kitten (8 weeks old) and it's the tiniest, most adorable animal I've ever owned. After around a week we decided to introduce the dog to the kitten, with strict supervision. We brought them both into the kitchen and put them on the ground. Surprisingly, they sniffed each other and walked away with little interest. Oh, whatever. 

So me and my gf have to run to Walmart so we leave the two of them together, knowing they weren't really interested in one another. We leave for around half an hour, and are shocked when we walk in.

Our pitbull is in the corner of the living room, SHAKING, with her eyes open wide as the kitten pounces and chases after her tail. She's yipping and crying in fear of this baby kitten that weighs less than a pound. We separate them into different rooms while in tears laughing and make a note not to let them in the same room together for a while.

TLDR: Left aggressive pitbull with tiny kitten, pitbull ends up cowering in the corner while kitten wails at it

2,"TIFU By Asking My Wife to Initiate Sex


This just happened a few days ago. I've told my wife that I wished she would initiate sex more often, and last Thursday she decided to oblige. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when she came out of the bedroom looking sexy the way she does. She grabbed my hands and pulled me up and started kissing me, taking a few steps back towards the doorway to go to the bedroom. We stopped a little and started undressing each other, and when it was my turn to get her pants off I dropped down real quick to get them off asap.

The next thing I felt wasn't joy in getting my wife naked, but searing pain! It turns out that I was too close to the corner of an endtable. I immediately stood up and clenched my cheeks while my wife, God bless her soul, was laughing hysterically trying to squeeze out the words, ""You took off part of your butt!""  

I ended up leaving a nice sized chunk of skin on the corner of the table. Fortunately it missed my poop chute, but I have a nice inch or so long gouge near my butt bone. That hurts, in addition to the bruising of the buttocks from hitting the table so hard. My wife continued to be double\-over laughing while I was trying to stick Kleenex in my crack to stop the bleeding. 4 days later and showers still suck, and I need to be careful when I'm sitting down.

Tl;Dr Asked my wife to initiate sex, ended up taking off part of my butt on a table"

4,"TIFU- by falling asleep in the park


So about a year ago it was a really beautiful day and I \[F18\] decided to walk to the park that was just outside of my neighborhood. There was a playground and right next to/attached to it was a large baseball field and there were a bunch of kids playing on the playground and I wanted some peace so I went to sit in the field. I was laying in the sun and I was uncomfortable so I laid on my stomach with my headphones in and I fell asleep. I don't know how long I was asleep but I awoke to two police officers standing above me, and my first thought was ""oh no It must be after hours and I'm trespassing"" but I asked them if I wasn't allowed to be there and they looked at me a little incredulously and said no I could be there. At this point I'm confused but I notice their police cruisers and I hear the distant sound of sirens and then it clicks, someone called the cops because they thought I was dead. When I asked them they started laughing and said that a woman called about a person face down in a field assuming it was a drug related incident and I was incredibly embarrassed and they were still laughing about how mortified I was that they had to come all this way just because I fell asleep. They said it would make for a good story at the station, and they went on their way.

TL;DR: Fell asleep in the park, someone called the police because they thought I was dead, they thought it was hilarious."
5,"TIFU - By swatting what felt like a fly on my neck.


Possibly the most traumatizing experience of my entire life just occurred. Maybe you will agree. Maybe this is a “first world problems” moment and think that I haven’t seen real trauma. I think you will soon realize the latter is not the case and I am lucky to be alive; if the following does not deeply disturb you, you’re probably dead emotionally. 

Exactly 15 minutes ago the following occurred. My heart is still beating rather rapidly. It's the time of year where the weather is balmy at night, and we keep our windows open for that light spring breeze.

I was watching Netflix on my computer on one monitor and reading news on other monitor. I feel something crawling on my neck. I quickly swat it with my right hand. Something is NOT right. This is a small creature. This is not a fly. Something is seriously wrong. Something smells terrible. What was that? I turn on the light waking my sleeping wife as I scream like a school girl. My fears are realized. I have narrowly avoided death. I need to move and sell my apartment immediately. I think only holy water and a fire can cleanse my abode. I have washed my hands 6 times. There is a terrible smell on my hand I cannot wash out. I don’t understand, I used a napkin. I have dry heaved a dozen times and am barely holding it in. I need someone to suffer in empathy. I have woken my wife. I have shown her the remains of my vanquished foe, she is now equally traumatized. This somehow makes me feel better. We are now afraid to move. Where is this evil spawns' family? Does anyone know where I can obtain some military grade napalm!?

I have included a picture. Bottle cap for scale...

TL;DR - I was violently attacked by a mutant spawn of satan. I cannot be convinced otherwise.

6,"TIFU by not paying attention, and now I am grossed out.


This is literally making me gag as I type it, as it just happened a few hours ago and is still painfully fresh in my mind. 

Backstory: I had a vasectomy a while back, and last week I finally got around to setting up the appointment to give a ""sample"" for testing. Today was the day that I had to submit. 

As I was groggily getting ready for work this morning, I remembered that I had to collect a sample. Cool, a legit reason to rub one out before work. I grabbed the lil cup that they give you and plodded into the bathroom. I fired up the ol' naked lady machine to get myself in the mood, did my thing, collected the sample in the cup, set it on the counter, and went into my usual morning routine of shower/shave/brush teeth/mouthwash/floss. Yes, I floss. (Get the little pick thingies, way easier than regular string floss!)

Anyway, I got out of the shower, got dressed, and prepared to brush my teeth. I poured a little mouthwash into one of those little Dixie bathroom cups like I always do, brushed my teeth, spit/rinsed, and grabbed the cup &amp; tossed 'er back like a shot of whiskey. Guess which cup I grabbed, Reddit.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I grabbed the ""sample"" cup. The instant I threw it back, the smell hit me and I realized I fucked up by not immediately capping the sample after I collected it. Do you know what happens to jizz if it sits in a cup for a little while? It turns runny, like the consistency of whole milk or something. And since I knew *last week* that this appointment was going to be happening, I had been ""saving up""  so that I could provide a nice sample size. Not all of it made it into my mouth, but infinitely more than I would have liked did. I simultaneously gagged and gained a completely new respect for what my wife does for me sometimes. I spit and hocked and horked and gagged for about 30 seconds, before I finally had the sense to put the actual mouthwash in my mouth. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or if it's real, but I swear I can still taste it 3 hours later. I can *definitely* still smell it, so much so that I have checked my shirt and pants twice to see if I somehow spilled it on myself (I don't think I did).  Ugh, I feel sick.

**tl;dr - gargled my own jizz.**"
7,"TIFU by getting a sad bj on the street corner.


Two nights ago (I just got internet access again), I was getting shit faced in a resort town in Vietnam. I've been in Vietnam for 2.5 months and while I knew I needed to be careful, literally everyone I've met has been so kinda that my guard has started to slip into a false sense of comfort and security. 

After like 3 bars, we end up at a club, I blacked out most of my time there but upon leaving I lost my friends and was instantly approached by an older lady who grabbed my junk and told me to follow her. I know, I'm an idiot. It didn't even process as something sketchy and I thought I was about to have an easy hook up with a horny courage. She drives me out to a random street corner and begins to go to down. But it's like she has no idea what she's doing. This is when I take a double take, and realize that she's like 70 and definitely not a random Chinese tourist. Her technique was to go like a jack hammer with teeth on 
 just the tip. I tried to like slow her down but she took offence, got up and rode away. Before I could process what happened, she was gone and was I left standing with my dingle pointing the way to the banh mi stand across the road. Dumbfounded, I pulled my pants up to find my phone was gone. So now I'm complete lost and confused. 

Luckily, I flagged down a Russian couple who helped my find my hostel and for cab to get me home. Faith in humanity resorted lol.

TL;DR. 30ish Chinese cougar turned out be a elderly Vietnamese Venus fly trap. "
8,"TIFU by adding a new notch to my belt while wearing it


I had a dentist appointment this morning, and I was running late because I slept through my alam. Took a shower and started dressing up. As I was putting my pants on I noticed that it was falling off quite easily as I've lost quite a bit of weight. I grabbed a belt I haven't used in quite a while and decided to use it. I realized that it didn't fit me well as it was still making my pants fall off. I was running out of time so I had to make a new one immediately. I grabbed a phillips screwdriver in my toolbox and started drilling, as hard as I can, on the belt I was still wearing. My dumbass didn't think to do it facing away from me, so as it finished tearing a new hole on my belt it also tore a new hole on my belly. I had to drive 20 mins to the hospital bleeding and in agonizing pain. Doctor said no vital organs were seriously injured. I am now scheduled for next month with my dentist.

TL;DR I drilled a new notch on my belt, stabbed myself."
