0,"TIFU by fingering a girl


Obligatory this happened yesterday. This girl and I had a fun filled day out on the town. Afterwards we got a hotel. Things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. One thing led to another and I started fingering her. She was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that I was doing a decent job. A good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. I'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. I call her name and start panicingly shaking her. She's not responsive and I slap her face. As soon as I did this she starts having a seizure. Now I'm freaking the out. I jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. I'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. She's giving me this wtf just happened look and I tell her what happened. At first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. She said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. I just sat there in that ""thank god I didn't finger a girl to death"" state. Needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

TLDR: I fingered a girl into a seizure. She stops and says it happens sometimes."
1,"TIFU By Looking to Make My Job Easier and Getting 3/4 of my Department Laid-Off Instead


This just happened last week and I am still very upset. I work for a medium sized drilling company with about 200 employees. I am in Accounts Payable \(AP\). My job is laymen terms was to take all the invoices, organize them, archive them, and then pay them. Usually we would process about 1000/month and they would range from 1 page to 50 sometimes. The scanning was the worst part though. We would print every single invoice, then scan it, then archive it. With our copier, I had to scan each invoice separately, then rename it on the shared folder to the date and then put it in the corresponding company folder. We had 4 people doing this.

A new hire came on about 3 months prior and told us about at her old company, they would just put a separator sheet with a barcode between each invoice and be able to scan a stack of invoices and it will auto separate the invoices into separate files which we can then go and manually rename and organize into the right folder. That sounded amazing to me. That would save a lot of time and reduce the most tedious part of my job.

Here is the fuck up. I tell my boss about this technology and they call the copier company to inquire about it. A meeting is set up with myself, my boss, our IT manager and their sales rep and software specialist. They ask a lot of questions about the process we currently have and what we want. I answer all of it and explain exactly what we need. They tried to pitch the idea of a more integrated system, but we told them that's not what we are looking for and they seemed to accept it. I come out of the meeting excited because they tell me they can do exactly that.

About 2 months go by and I haven't heard from any higher\-ups what is going on with the new software until one day I get called into my bosses office. I come to find out that the software company took the information I gave them and went to our CFO about integrating a new system to essentially automate 90&amp;#37; of the AP process. I am also told that I'm being laid off due to this and I find out later they laid off 2 of my coworkers as well. So essentially this company that was suppose to help me ended up seeing a much bigger opportunity to sell a much more expensive software that screwed me but saves them 150k a year in salaries. Fuck.

**TLDR: I had my bosses reach out to a software company to look into simplifying one part of my job, but they used the information to sell another software that put me and 2 others out of a job.**


Edit: Wow! Didn't expect this to get so popular. Yes I should have kept my mouth shut, but at the same time the system we had in place was very inefficient and was bound to change. Like I would start my morning taking the batch of signed documents from the day prior, grabbing the largest ones and scanning them while grabbing coffee or browsing reddit. It was a joke and also very very verrrrry boring. I'm mostly pissed at the IT manager who I thought was a friend but I didn't even realize the project he was working on the last month was to have me out of a job.

Also I don't hate my boss. His hands were tied by upper management. He also offered to get each of us an interview at our parent company and I have an interview next week. It might even pay more! This experience has definitely made me a little more aware of how easily replaceable you can be, and I think im going to take the advice of other commenters and be a bit more diligent about being irreplaceable in my next job."
2,"TIFU because of my boyfriend's butt. NSFW


So if you can't tell from my username, I am a huge fan of the booty. Specifically, I am a fan of the male buttox. Always have been. Always will be. And it just so happens my bf has a rocking badonkadonk.

Any we're cuddling on Saturday morning like couples do, and I get around to groping his butt. Poking, squeezing, light slapping, you get the picture. Anyway eventually I get the bright idea to faceplant into his left butt cheek.

Unfortunately in my ass molestation induced horniness, I miscalculated his cushion for the pushin relative to my velocity.

I smacked nose first into his butt so hard I went straight through to his hip bone. Cue me running to the bathroom with an epic ass induced nosebleed. My boyfriend at this point, sighing at my perpetual clumsiness, decided to call it a morning to get tea. Thus ended our cuddle session for the day.

TLDR: Gave myself a nosebleed by faceplanting into my boyfriend's butt."
3,"TIFU by not realizing triple sec had alcohol in it.


Obligatory this happened years ago and not today.

I was 18 and up late, prime time for raiding my dad's alcohol. My mom let me have some of her margaritas when we went out to eat together, so I knew I liked them, and I knew my dad had tequila and triple sec. So I got some limes on the way home from work, looked up a quick recipe, and tried to make one myself.

I didn't know what the fuck I was doing, and filled the glass halfway with tequila, a little triple sec, and a little lime. Being 18 and not used to drinking, it was strong as fuck. Like, unbearably strong. This is where the very simple fuck up starts.

I had no idea triple sec had alcohol in it. I thought it was similar to simple syrup, and just used to flavor drinks a certain way. I took a couple swigs and put in more triple sec and lime. Still strong. Few more swigs, more triple sec and lime. *Still* strong. I was out of limes at this point, so I just kept pouring in more and more triple sec, dying to make the alcohol taste go away. And it did.

After the first few pours, I quit tasting the alcohol. Success! I still hadn't finished even half of the drink, but I went to sit down, content that I'd finally made a margarita. I started feeling a little *too* drunk. I decided it would be best to have a lie down, so I poured the rest of the drink out so no one would know what I was up to, and tried to sleep. I felt so dizzy, and the world kept spinning, and my stomach felt funny. Before I could register what was happening, I projectile vomited all over my bedroom floor. Shit.

I wobbled to the bathroom, feeling another vomiting spell coming on, but it wasn't coming right away so I laid down on the floor. Big mistake. After a couple minutes, the waves of nausea grew and grew, until it was time for upchuck #2. Except I was so drunk I couldn't hoist myself up off the floor. I did a half push up and puked again, this time all over the tile, and registered that I was feeling so *cold*. Like, chilled to my bones. So I did the only logical thing and laid in my own warm, wet vomit.

Several more minutes passed and I still wasn't feeling better. In fact, I was feeling *worse*. I was in and out of consciousness and was having trouble breathing. It was like I had to focus on each breath to make sure I didn't stop. I was confident I was at death's door. In my tshirt and underwear, I grabbed my cell phone and called 911 *on myself*. I ran out into the front lawn, still barely clothed, so that whoever was coming wouldn't have to knock on the door and wake my dad up. I remember I felt *so* guilty, and was crying on the phone with the 911 operator. It was about 4am at this point.

A cop car showed up with the fire department paramedics. I was sitting cross legged in the middle of the walkway leading up to the front door, and a policeman walked over and asked me what my name was, and how old I was. The conversation went something like this.

""Hi, how are you doing?""
""Not very good officer, I'm sorry you had to come out here, but thank you for asking.""
""Oh, it's ok. How old are you? What's your name?""
""I'm ______, and I'm 18.""
""Ok, are your parents home?""
""My dad is. He's asleep right now and I didn't want to wake him up. I know I'm a mess, I'm so sorry.""

At this point one of the paramedics helped me into the back of the ambulance. My mascara was smudged all over my face, I had tear streaks on my cheeks, and overall I looked like a hot mess. The paramedic was doing his best not to laugh.

""I'm sorry for laughing ma'am, it's just that I've been there a few times myself.""
""Oh no it's totally fine, if I were you I'd probably be laughing too, I know I'm messed up.""

My dad was woken up at 4am to see his 18 year old daughter drunk off her ass in the back of an ambulance. They sent me back inside and told me to get some sleep. My dad wasn't mad, he was more amused than anything, but I know my step mom stormed out declaring she didn't want to be associated with me anymore.

Believe it or not, tequila is my favorite alcohol of choice now. Except now I know triple sec isn't just a mixer.

Tl;Dr: didn't know triple sec was alcoholic and poured a shit ton into my drink, thinking it would help dilute it down. Got drunk and laid in my own vomit, then called the cops on myself.

4,"TIFU by mixing up what Memorial Day and a memorial service are.


This happened at work a few hours ago and I cannot get it off my mind. 

I walked into the break room to grab some coffee. There was a platter with small rolls with chicken and cheese in them. So I asked my co worker in there (she’s probably in her 50s-60s) if they were for everyone. She told me they were and she brought them from her husbands memorial service. 

It for some reason didn’t click in my head. I thought “Oh cool they had a party for Memorial Day and had left over food so she brought some in. that’s sweet of them.” So I said the dumbest thing I’ve said in a long time. I looked her straight in the face and asked “Was it fun? Did you have a good time?” While I’m munching on the food she brought. 

She just starred at me and asked “Was it fun?” It still hasn’t clicked in my head so I said “Yeah, Was it fun?” She didn’t say anything for a second, set down her plate and said “No, the memorial service for my dead husband was not fun.” 

I stopped chewing and just looked off into the wall realizing how fucking stupid I was. This whole time I thought she meant a Memorial day party and she definitely meant a service for her deceased husband. I have never wanted to die more in my life. I apologized over and over and told her it was very rude of me and was an honest mistake. She half smiled and walked out. 

I didn’t finish eating. Or get my coffee. This will be the longest shift of my life. 




TLDR Confused Memorial Day with a memorial service. Asked my co worker if the service for her dead husband was fun. "
5,"TIFU by Giving my Daughter a Golden Shower


In rare form, this happened today...about 90 minutes ago. My wife got up early to run a few errands and left me to tend the children when they awoke. They both (4.5-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl) bounced into our bedroom a bit before 7 in their typical energetic and get up and go attitude. We recently opened a coffee shop, and along with our other business, I have been especially tired in the mornings lately. I used our Google Home to turn a Netflix show on the downstairs TV and sent the kiddos down while I got dressed and turned off lights, sound machines, etc. The boy went down, but our girl, who has been incredibly needy for the past month or so since we opened the shop, wanted to wait with me. I started taking care of things and getting her ready to go down as well, and she was hanging on my legs for almost the whole process. Before we descended, I needed to relieve the nighttime bladder buildup...and the FU commences.

We go into the bathroom and she is still hanging on me. She does this occasionally, so no worries. With my super-dad skills of multitasking (lies), I pull out my phone to browse reddit for a few seconds while I go, because heaven forbid I just stand there for a few seconds doing nothing like a sucker. A few seconds later, it dawns on me that I am not hearing the splash of liquid any more. I look down to see that my daughter had exercised her keen curiosity by leaning over the toilet bowl to look inside...and I was peeing directly on her head.

Her head...her hair...her dress...completely drenched in 4-5 seconds of full-force morning urine. I freak out and quickly get her in the tub where I put he directly beneath the faucet to wash her off. She is bawling her eyes out the whole time. I rinse her off for a few seconds and then pick her up to hold her because she is begging ""hold me hold me"" and I am not a monster. I am not sure whether or not I got the pee all off of her by the time I picked her up. There's a pretty good chance I have my own urine on my skin. Good times.

TL;DR Browsed reddit while peeing because I am an ADD media addict, and I ended up peeing all over my daughter."
6,"TIFU by getting a phone-full of ketchup in my bra.


Today I went out to eat after a show. (I'm a teacher and we just had our big end of year performance with the little kids) I poured out a big pile of ketchup onto a plate for everyone to dip their fries. 
My first mistake was to use my phone at the table. 

My second mistake was to drop my phone into the pile of ketchup. It did make a nice glerping noise when it landed, though!
Dropping a phone in ketchup would have been enough for a TIFU. 

So I pondered the error of my ways as I wiped off the phone and put it away.  That was my third mistake. Here I should mention that because women's clothing never has pockets, ""away"" means I typically slip my phone into my bra. The phone was fully stowed before my brain registered the icky feeling. It was chilly and squelchy and wet. If only the story ended there! 

The third time is supposed to be the charm, but I had one more mistake left to make - I tried to fix it. My fourth mistake was to clean up ketchup from inside my bra at a table full of kids. 

TL;DR  I dropped my phone in ketchup, didn't clean it all off, slipped the phone into my bra, and then practically groped myself in front of students whilst trying to clean ketchup out of my cleavage."
7,"TIFU by moving in with an Australian girl I met online


This actually happened last summer but I’m still bitter. Sorry in advance for the novel, TL;DR at the end.

So I’m in my fourth year of university and live about ten minutes from downtown. I’ve always lived on campus but my ignorant ass has always wanted to live in a downtown apartment. Turns out one\-bedroom/studio city apartments here start at about $1k \- not that much in retrospect, but definitely more expensive than campus accommodation. So I start considering splitting a two\-bedroom with a roommate.

Fast forward a month and 99&amp;#37; of my friends have already figured out summer accommodations \(the other 1&amp;#37; didn’t seem like roommate material\) and I was desperate. Decided to sign up for an online roommate matcher and see what happened. Two days later I got matched up with a girl moving from Australia on a visa. We email for a bit, decide we’re a decent fit, and she flies into town. Problem was, we hadn’t found an apartment yet, so she stayed with me and my boyfriend while we looked for places. \(He had his own place, but he was stuck in a one year lease with a landlord who wasn’t cool with couples.\) After about a week we were all starting to feel cramped and uncomfortable so after ten thousand failed applications we picked the first apartment who accepted us, which was in a pretty rough area but I figured I could deal for six months.

Within two weeks of living in this hood ass apartment, we learned that our street was a favorite for heroin addicts who regularly waited outside the building \(we were told by a neighbor they slept in the stairwells\) and I learned that my roommate had a strong affinity for drugs. It’s something we talked about briefly before we moved in, and our agreement was basically that partying was cool as long as we were discrete and kept hard stuff out of the apartment. This was my first in a long series of mistakes.

She got a job at a bar and started staying for the afterparties, coming home at around 4\-5am, lots of times with strangers – not guys, but whole parties of people. My makeup and toiletries started disappearing from the bathroom, so I moved them to my bedroom. They kept disappearing, and I still can’t find some of the clothes I kept in my closet. She started going on three or four day benders and coming back with stories about hooking up with gang members. She started up a thing with a dealer and was fucked off her face on molly and xans for about two weeks, even falling asleep in the shower for two and a half hours at one point \(we split utilities\).  Woke up daily to coke spread across the kitchen counter, lines on the coffee table. \(Something I failed to mention is I have two cats, so this was a bigger issue than tidiness.\) I told her June 1st was my anniversary weeks in advance and politely asked for the apartment to myself for a couple hours so I could make a nice dinner \(we had a much better kitchen\), etc. She “forgot” and partied all day, had so many people over my social anxiety forced me to leave my own apartment with my cats and spend the night at my boyfriend’s \(which was a pretty regular occurrence\). She had the nerve to text me the next day asking for the day to herself and her new boyfriend – I learned later that they were making meth. I came by that night to grab my stuff and dip while I figured out what to do about the six month lease we weren’t even two months into.

My final mistake was calling my tiny Korean landlord and explaining the entire situation to her with every detail I could think of in the hopes of getting a break just out of sympathy. She told me she was too scared and weak \(her exact words\) to deal with it and I should get my boyfriend to ask her to leave, then hung up, called my roommate, and told her *everything* I’d just confided with exaggeration for emphasis. My roommate claimed I was making everything up and that I was addicted to prescription drugs \(another mistake was confiding to her early on that I take wellbutrin for legit reasons\) so I didn’t know what I was talking about. Landlord called me back and chewed me out for telling lies, started calling my emergency family contacts to tell them about my addiction, and pushed me out of my lease anyway. The whole process took about two and a half weeks and the damage control on my end took months.

I’ve been living on campus ever since.

TL;DR: I moved in with a girl who turned our apartment into a drug den, my landlord blamed me for wanting to move out, and I’m never living downtown again."
8,"TIFU By Powerbombing A Girl


Obligatory this happened Saturday and not today.

So a girl I've been dating and I went back to my place to hang out, and while there things got a bit hot and heavy. We started making out and I had this bright idea to pick her up and push her against a wall. So I grab her under her thighs and she holds onto my shoulders and lean her up against a wall.

All was going great until the stars aligned and we both decided to become assertive at the same time. I backed us away from the wall so we could drop back down onto my bed, while at the same time \(according to her\) she decides to let go of me so she could push me onto the bed herself. What transpired was that I backed her away from the wall while only supporting her by her thighs, and she lets go of me and expects to use the wall for support as she gets down. So unfortunately I end up dropping her on her back and head from standing height onto my concrete floors.

I apologized profusely and was extremely embarassed, but luckily she couldnt stop laughing while only having a minor headache and theorizing how bad my anxiety would be if I had to call an ambulance over because some girl in only her underwear was passed out bleeding from the back of her head.

tl;dr tried to be sexy, instead almost knocked a girl out cold."
9,"TIFU by taking acid and calling 911


This happened two days ago. Me and two of my friends decided to drop acid and have a good ol time tripping out asses off. I took three tabs my other friend who we'll call Fred did two and my other friend whom is no longer my friend did just one. We had a trip sitter who we'll call Jessica who was dating my no longer friend who we'll call Carl. It started off fine until I started getting extremely anxious even though it was at Jessica's house in a familiar environment. I then locked myself in Jessica's room but all I could hear was yelling outside the room causing me to panic, apparently Carl had gotten violent and threw a dumbell at Fred's head and was attempting to touch Jessica without her consent. After Jessica and her brother forcefully got Carl out of the house he started screaming Jessicas name and thowing himself full force at the window most likely hurting himself in the process. Fred started hitting his own head on the table yelling ""get it out of me"" and I genuinely thought I was in hell at that point and Carl was the devil or some sort. At that point it seemed Carl was very close to getting in so I made the decision to call 911, after the cops arrived everything is kinda a blur I remember them pinning Carl to the lawn and taking him away in a cop car, I remember them taking me and Fred away in ambulances to the er. The only point in which I returned to reality is when I saw my dad whom had been called. Now I probably am going to receive a felony charge so don't do psychedelics kids. Or at least don't be a dumbass like me.

TL;DR Took acid, things got outta hand now I'll probably get a felony charge."
10,"TIFU by mangling myself on my first day at work


Mandatory this didn't happen today...this happened shortly after I turned 16, I'm now 21.

As I had just turned 16, I got the ""you're old enough to get a job"" talk from my mom. I figured why not look for a job and applied to all the basic stereotypical first job fast food locations. None really piqued my sophisticated 16 year old interests, so I started to apply to local mom and pop shops. I ended up finding work as an assistant florist for a small family owned business. 

Now I love flowers and figured this was a pretty sweet gig. No difficult customer interactions, no heavy labor, no nonsense. I show up to my first day at work with great enthusiasm and eagerly began completing the tasks assigned to me...wash the vases.

The vases were clear and about 2 ft tall. The sink I was to wash them in was a standard kitchen sink. A little tricky to maneuver but nonetheless I felt confident in my abilities to wash dishes of any size and began washing the vases with gusto. 

This is where I fuck up...in my excitement to be a first rate employee and work efficiently, I was moving far too fast for someone as accident prone as myself. I dropped the vase. But I couldn't just let it fall. Oh no, I had to try to catch it. On the rebound. 
With both hands. I reflexively reach out to save the already shattered vase, grasping broken shards of glass with both hands. It took me a second to realize the massive fuckup I've just made. 

My boss, hearing the sound of glass breaking rushes in. In a very pitiful attempt to hide the evidence of my stupidity, I shove both of my hands under the stream of water, but this just adds to the horror as the water runs red. My boss runs over to see my hands. I nearly severed my ring finger. It's bleeding pretty heavily. My coworker (also a classmate) runs in and sees that I'm covered in blood and begins to hyperventilate. ""I faint at the sight of blood! I faint at the sight of blood! Oh God!""

I'm thoroughly embarrassed that when tasked with doing the dishes I manage to maim myself. I also feel really guilty that I broke a vase on my first day and now am now bleeding all over my boss' towels. My coworker's screams of terror weren't really helping me feel any better. I flush red out of embarrassment and suddenly my boss is screaming too. ""Oh she's gone red! She's gonna faint! Quick blow on her!"" So now my boss and his wife are fanning me frantically with their hands and blowing into my face. I start crying because what the actual fuck is going on...didn't really prepare for this. My boss has me sit down and calls my mom. My mom shows up minutes later, camera in tow, prepared to record my humiliation. I'm sitting down bloodstained, with tears rolling down my cheeks and my mom comes in with a big ole grin on her face. She is unsurprised I managed to bloody myself on my first day. She is very aware of my over inflated sense of self and debilitating clumsiness.

She drives me to the hospital where I'm told I need stitches for my ring finger. I also have a very unfortunately placed horizontal cut on my wrist from the vase that raises a few eyebrows from nurses who try to gently ask if that was there before the incident. The doc comes in to patch me up and fills my finger up with some nice numbing juice (can't be bothered to try to remember the correct word for numbing juice). Numbing juice works a charm and suddenly I'm not in pain anymore, but I'm still jacked on adrenaline and jittery from my massive screw up. For some reason this combination of adrenaline, embarrassment and jitters causes me to act insanely stupid. Impressed that I can no longer feel my finger I turn to my mother and bend my partially severed finger as far back as possible. ""Look ma! I bet I could rip my finger off!""

The doc is floored. He's giving me and my mom a ""wtf is this devil child doing?"" and says he's never had to tell a patient not to rip off their own finger and reminds me I haven't been medicated, just numbed. All this stupid is me. It's all me. He tells me to sit still, stop ripping off my finger and stop playing with my finger because we need a sterile environment. He sews me up, chuckling to himself.

I leave the hospital feeling ashamed of myself and vow to never return, so a few weeks later I take out my stitches myself too early. I just stick a bandaid on my finger and call it a day. No infection and only a faint scar.

TL;DR My first day at work I overestimate my dish washing abilities and drop a large vase. I try to save the falling vase, but only manage to grab it on the rebound...with both hands. I slice up both of my hands pretty badly on the vase and further embarrassment ensues at work and at the hospital."
