"TIFU by masturbating in front of my entire family


This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still strong as ever. 

Stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times only 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

So, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). 

Not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

And so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.

I was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

Somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

I don’t really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

I snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. 

I’m not going to talk about what happened next, as I don’t want to relive the next few moments.

My father is just disappointed. He hasn’t talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

My mother believes that we should “embrace my sexuality”, and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. 

And I'm just studying my ass off, pouring through books, it’s a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. 

But it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

TL:DR Returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, I now live in shame."
"TIFU by getting way too distracted at the gas station by a smokin' hottie


This was actually several years ago, back when I was a young lad with my super sweet Mitsubishi Galant, a fuck off attitude, and a penchant for the opposite sex (so, in other words, your standard dingbat teenager). 

I was heading to a friend's house to dink around, when I had to stop into a gas station to fill up on the way. This station was right on the side of the road, in a smaller residential type area, so it was really easy to pull in, fill up, and get right back out and on your merry way. Just after I pulled up in my stock cherry red Mitsubishi Galant (really can't emphasize enough how normal and unimpressive my car was, even though I thought it was awesome), a stunning blond girl pulled up into the stall opposite mine, and proceeded to start to fill up her gas tank.

Being the ultra cool, super suave teenager that I was, I winked at her, waved a sly little wave and gave her my signature smile. Much to my chagrin, she just chuckled to herself and looked away, obviously not interested. 

So I thought, well-she's going to see exactly what she's missing after I peel out of the gas station, right onto the road, to show her that I am a total badass and someone who, in my stock 4 cylinder Mitsubishi Galant, obviously rides the line between civility and chaos (I know I've heard a comedian comment on this but seriously, I wasn't sure what I expected-that she would run towards my car, waving her hands, asking me to stop because she was so impressed? I dunno, teenage me was really dumb you guys). I hopped into my car, turned on the gas, and high tailed it outta there-and when I got almost to the curb, I heard a loud ""WHOMP"" followed by a ""clang clang clang slap slap"" on the right side of my car.

Perplexed, I looked into my right side rear view mirror, to see the pump and most of the hose flapping merrily in the breeze. I stopped immediately, turned around, and drove back into the parking lot, all the while the blond haired goddess was in absolute hysterics, leaning on her car and, I thought I saw, tears rolling down her cheeks.

I took the pump and the hose into the gas station attendant, said ""uh... I think this belongs to you guys,"" and then walked out back to my car (the attendant looked absolutely dumbfounded, like he had just been slapped with a fish). The girl by this time had gotten control of herself, and I winked again as I passed by, as if to say ""see the kind of guy you could have had? THIS kind of a guy, who is an obvious idiot!""

To this day, I can't recall a more embarrassing single incident in my life. Thankfully, it was in front of strangers and I of course never went back to that gas station again-but still, I hope you can all feel just a little bit better about yourselves, knowing that (likely) you have never been so brash as to try and destroy a gas pump trying to impress a member of the opposite gender.

TL:DR- my teenage, hormone addled brain forgot to take out the gas pump as I tried to impress an attractive blonde girl by speeding out of the gas station onto the road. She laughed so hard she cried as I took the dangling pump back into the attendant, and shockingly, she STILL wasn't interested in my scrawny, red-galant-driving self!"
"TIFU by shooting an arrow into the sky



When I was around 17/18 my friend and I were bored and decided to explore his shed for cool stuff to find. After navigating through the tons of garbage and old pool supplies, I stumbled upon a large bag. Inside was a sick hunting bow and a bunch of ferocious looking arrows, not those field arrows your drunk gym teacher would let you shoot out back at some styrofoam targets. These were broadhead arrows meant for hunting or fishing. The reel deal (ha), some would say.

Once shooting a bunch of arrows into the shed became boring, I wanted to try something more exciting. So I yanked one of the arrows out of the shed, placed it on the string, aimed directly up into the sky and let it rip. Sweet Christ on a gas-powered unicycle, if Robin Hood or Legolas were in attendance they would have congratulated me on shooting the arrow up that high and out of sight...and how stupid I was. So, like normal, we ran back inside the house and prayed no one would get killed. I ,for the life of me, don't know why I would do something so stupid but the consequences of my actions came to an actualization a mere seconds after hightailing it inside.

We heard the screeching brakes of a car a street behind my buddy's house. 

""Shit...did I kill someone? A child? Someone's pet?"", I though to myself. 

A million different scenarios and thoughts were going through my mind before going out back to see the issue. We walked through the backyard of my buddy's neighbor's house to see this bald guy wearing a cargo shorts, a pepsi shirt and sunglasses that Neo (The Matrix) would wear to dodge bullets (obviously not arrows, as you will soon find out) in the middle of the street cussing and questioning what happened. We looked closer to see that the arrow I shot had stuck right into the roof of his pick up truck. It was only that one guy and he wasn't injured; a relief no one was seriously hurt or killed.

Looking at the guy getting mad and questioning where and how the hell an arrow perfectly pierced the roof of his truck was enough to make me giggle which caught his attention.

After a few minutes of denying, arguing and me finally explaining that I was target practicing and ""slipped"", I agreed to pay him I think $100 (which was a lot for me at the time) and the neighbors who saw the whole commotion hated my buddy and I even more. The only reason the guy didn't call the cops was because I paid him cash right there and then. After he left, my friend tried to cheer me up by saying,

""Well, that obviously wouldn't have happened to that guy if he was wearing a Coke shirt. Who the fuck like Pepsi?""


**TL;DR: Shot an arrow directly into the sky without know where it would land. Ended up sticking directly into the roof of some bald guys truck. Paid him $100 (very broke at the time), to not call the cops.** "
"TIFU by cussing at an old lady in the women’s locker room at my now former gym.


I’ll try to keep this as short as possible while also providing enough background information. This also happened yesterday, not today. 

I have chronic pain and I swim in the pool at the gym for about an hour and a half every day. It’s like a spiritual experience for me. I’m in significantly less pain and I can just exist and be calm. 

An older woman at the gym has been a pain in my ass since I started swimming there. She has complained to staff that I take too many towels (even though there is a literal wall of towels, hand towels, and wash cloths by the locker rooms), has accused me of stealing her flip flops (we have a similar pair and she forgot she didn’t wear that pair that day), has talked to staff about me not putting my flip flops completely under the bleacher (they stuck out about two inches) which obviously is a tripping hazard, and has confronted me about being young and disrespectful (I’m 30) and about how I dress indecently (I have large breasts and I always make sure my bathing suits have full coverage so I don’t know what the fuck she’s talking about.) The list just goes on and on. 

From my first encounter with her I realized she wasn’t completely mentally sound and so I’ve always tried to be very polite to her and non-confrontational. I stopped being polite when I noticed it agitated her and I didn’t want her to think I was mocking her so I started ignoring her completely. I even started swimming in the early afternoon instead of morning so I could avoid her and then she started coming in the afternoons. I’ve talked to one of the managers and they said they haven’t had any other complaints about her and she isn’t “technically” doing anything wrong. I said I feel like I’m being harassed and they basically just repeated that she isn’t technically doing anything wrong. Other people have witnessed her actions towards me, but that doesn’t seem to matter. I looked into going to a different gym but price and location wise, this gym is perfect for me. 

So I’ve been having a rough few weeks pain wise which has led to me being irritable. Haven’t been able to sleep much which obviously adds to my irritability. I went to the gym yesterday afternoon and sure enough, the pool nazi came in about halfway through my swim and started giving me the stink eye. I ignored her, finished my swim, and made my way into the locker room. She followed and came in as I was getting my shower caddy out of my locker. She gasps and says, “You can’t have that in here! That’s disgusting!” I was confused as hell and looked at my caddy and back to her. She then informed me that she is going to go tell management that I brought a “marital aid” to the gym and that I obviously planned on using it in the shower. 

[This](https://imgur.com/a/lX8nYGG) is what she saw. My hairbrush was upside down in my caddy so the handle was sticking up and she thought it was a dildo/vibrator. I laughed and pulled it out of the caddy and told her it was my hairbrush and she said, “I bet you think you’re funny, huh, Missy?”  I’ve never done anything to this woman and I’d just fucking had enough. I said “Why don’t you go fuck yourself while I’m fucking myself in the shower?” She gasped one of this overdramatic self-entitled gasps and I said “That’s right, you fucking crazy bitch.”

Everything happened pretty quickly after that. One of the staff was giving a tour on the other side of the locker room and heard everything. The pool nazi started crying and people were coming to comfort her. I ended up in an office, being informed that my kind of behavior isn’t appropriate for their business and that I’m not longer allowed back at that gym or at their facility across town. But hey you guys, they were nice enough to not charge me for breaking my contract. Even though I didn’t break it. 

Was it trashy to cuss at an old woman? Yep. I don’t cuss in public even if I think I’m alone. I’d just had enough of her shit. Now I can’t go to my favorite gym and I made a complete ass out of myself (totally my own fault, I know.) When I left, the pool nazi was sitting in a chair with her towels wrapped around her, talking to two staff members and 4 other people I regularly see working out there. She was still crying. 

TL;DR
An old woman at my gym has been giving me shit for months now. I finally told her to fuck off and now I’m banned from my favorite gym.

"TIFU by blowing up my pupils before an exam.


I was doing my pre-test ritual of packing everything (panadol for back pain, a light lunch, pencils, etc.). I'm feeling that my eyes are kinda dry when I remember that there are several eyedrop bottles in the medicine cabinet. I sort through them and throw out a few expired ones, then grab one with the latest expiry date. I can't read the label because it's in Chinese but I assume it's one of those vitamin B-12 ones or just saline solution. So I put a couple drops in each eye and then catch the bus to go to the testing centre. 

As I'm walking from the bus stop (which happens to be near a lake), I'm squinting and finding it very hard to see from the light reflecting off the water. I can't even look at the road because of puddles and even the painted white lines were too bright. At first I thought it was just my eyes not being used to the sun, but when I finally got to the exam centre, I found I couldn't even read words properly. They were all blurry and my eyes couldn't focus. 

That's when I noticed something was wrong and finally looked up the one English word on the eyedrop bottle -- ""Picon"". Basically they're eyedrops used to dilate the pupils before an eye exam or surgery and this allowed way too much light to enter my eye. As a result, everything was so bright it was physically painful to look at things. 

It would've been fine any other day -- I'd wait for it to wear off and laugh at myself, but it had to be right before my 3 hour exam. Yeah, it's not fun trying to speed read a lot of content when your eyes have trouble focusing. 

TLDR: wrong eyedrops --&gt; dilated pupils --&gt; painfully bright/blurry --&gt; can't focus during exam"
"TIFU by following orders without thinking


This actually happened yesterday evening but I only realized it today. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I work part time at Subway in Germany. I've been doing this for almost 3 years now, so I can say with confidence, that I know pretty much everything there is to know at least in the day to day procedures.

The bread is freshly baked multiple times a day (at least two, sometimes three times). We get the deep frozen dough delivered, have it thaw over night so we can prepare it first thing in the morning.
I usually work the late shift so I'm the one putting them out of the freezer and into the fridge.

We have 3 stores and I usually work in two of them, very rarely in the third. Yesterday I was assigned there because we had a trainee that needed to be shown around and overseen working the late shift. I hadn't worked in that store for over 2 months and while the basic procedure are roughly the same, stuff is still done differently, things stored in different places etc. On top of that we had some changes to our cash register and added some new vegetables AND I had to explain all that to a new person.

So our manager wrote a list with things I had to  remember and that had to be done, which also included the number of breads we should put in the fridge for the next day. There's two kinds of bread ""bases"" so to speak: whole grain bread and white bread. We always prepare twice as much white bread than whole grain because they sell better.

In the other stores we usually prepare around 120 breads (80 white, 40 dark). Sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on how busy the next day is estimated to be. The most bread I ever prepared was 150.
Now keep in mind, that this store has generally low business for various reasons, so 60 to 90 breads is usually enough.

Okay now the day was quite stressful, there were far too many things I didn't know, stuff I had to call the manager about and things I had to explain to the new colleague. At the end of our shift it was time to prepare the bread. I take a look at the list and see that our manager wrote ""60 white 130 whole grain"".  Okay, a bit odd, I think, but whatever it's late I want to go home, I'll just do what I'm told.

The next day (the day I'm writing this) I come in and my coworker (who worked the morning shift) greeted me with a smile and said ""Hey there, why the fuck did you prepare ONEHUNDREDNINETY BREADS?!?""

""I know, kind of much right? It was on the list, the manager wrote for me""

""The list is right here! It says: 60 white / 30 whole grain!""

My eyes widened. I misinterpreted the slash for a one. God I'm stupid. Fortunately, one of the other stores baked too few breads, so we could give them some of ours so nothing went to waste.

Tl;dr My manager wrote 60/30 and I read the slash as a one so instead of 90 I prepared 190 breads for the next day."
"TIFU When I locked my keys in the laundry room and nearly froze.


The best time to do laundry in college is during your extended breaks. There is hardly a soul in your building as most went home to see their family, so you don’t have to risk having unwanted contact with another human being.




On this particular cold, blizzardy night, I decided it was about time to stop laying in my own filth and get my laundry done. I throw all my dirties into my laundry basket, grab my keys, and head down to the laundry room. I unlock the laundry door with my key fob as it makes a familiar *beep*, throw my clothes into the two washers, and took a seat.




25 minutes later the laundry buzzed, and I put the wets into the dryer, and put my last load (mostly towels) into the washer. Again I sit for the 25 minutes until the machines buzz again. 




I open the dryer and am met with a welcoming warmth that you can only get from dry, warm clothes right out of the dryer. I buried my face into the warm shirts, then put my last load into the dryer. 




Then I make the decision that would eventually lead me to my demise, I decided to bring my warm, heated laundry back to my room so I could change into my now heated cuddly pajamas (my trusty maroon shorts, and black t-shirt) I leave my last load to dry, and head back to my room with my keys, hearing the familiar *beep* as the doors lock.



I get to the door, unlock it, and change into my temporary heating clothes, and then head black. Now the problem with my trusty maroon shorts, is that they do not have pockets, I decided to leave my phone in my room since the laundry was almost done, and it would just be a hassle carrying it. This also meant I had to hold onto my keys the entire way down. I made a personal note in my head right then and there to not forget them since I can’t keep them safe in my pockets.



I head down, swipe the key fob, *beep*, and enter the laundry room. I then throw my keys near my laundry pods, knowing I wouldn’t forget them there. The dryer buzzes and I am welcomed with warm delicate towels that I happily push against my face. I throw my tide pods into the basket, and then walk out of the room.




As soon as I heard the familiar *beep* of the laundry room locking, I knew. My heart instantly filled with dread as a slowly turned around and saw through the window, my keys sitting on the washer. I could feel them laughing at my very certain demise as I realized how much I had just fucked up. 



I begin having a mini panic attack in the hallway, and freakishly walked/sprinted back to my room. I almost thought if I just went back my room the door would just magically open. 




I enter my hallway, and drop my laundry basket at my door, holding back tears. I stand there for maybe 5 minutes trying to figure out what to do. I finally manned up and decided to knock on some doors. I am an intense introvert, so talking to others can cause me a similar panic attack as the one I had in the hallway, but I knew I didn’t have any choice.




I knock on one door, then two, three, four, five, and eventually all the doors on my floor. Empty, a complete ghost town.  My warm pajamas now felt a little too warm as I wiped my brow. Sweaty from the sheer terror of being locked out for the night. 




I then came to my second fuck up. In my hasty, fear filled mind, I decided to walk to the help desk. A near three quarters of a mile walk, in a blizzard, at 11 pm, and on break. I thought maybe, just maybe there was a janitor or something there that could save me. So with my trusty maroon shorts, black t-shirt, and a warm towel that I wrapped around myself, I began the treacherous walk to the help desk. 



I was hopeful that I could maybe find another student in the parking lot, but no luck. There was maybe five or six empty cars at best outside.




As I walked there the first time, I actually didn’t get very cold. The towel did it’s job at protecting me from the terrible chill. I reached the help desk with my hairs sticking straight out, and was welcomed by a dark, empty building. 



Maybe it was because I completely deflated after realizing that I had walked all that way for nothing, but it was at that moment the cold hit me. No longer was my comfy pajamas and furry towel filled with the heat from the dryer. The Ravaging winds had complete stolen that from them. 




My low cut socks and converse like shoes were now starting to get soaked as I began the trek back to my dorm. After 10ish minutes of freezing cold and debating if I was going to sleep on the couches in the lobby, or wait outside the door for someone to maybe enter the building, I turn to corner to see a pair of headlights turning into my dorms parking lot.



I just fucking book it toward the car. I run through the snow to catch them faster as guy 1, girl 1, and girl 2 pile out of the vehicle. 




So here are these thee college kids watching as some random, mildly overweight, red faced kid wearing nothing but pajamas and a towel flopping around at his back run toward them at breakneck speeds.



I looked like a church friendly Captain Underpants.



As I reach them my antisocial, introverted mind decides to just scream


“THIS ISN’T WEIRD, I JUST NEED YOUR HELP!”



They no doubtingly thought I was either insane, or on crack.



After catching my breathe I explain to them to the best of my ability the predicament I had gotten myself into. I’m almost in tears as I have to blubber my way though my shitty night.



They gave me blank faces as I explained, when girl 1 said


“You know they keep the laundry doors unlocked during break right?”



All I could get out was a small “huh” as the cold finally gripped my heart and shattered it into a million pieces. I legit almost fell over we’re I stood when she said that. I HAD NEVER ACTUALLY CHECKED THE DOOR!



They kind of walked away after she said that and I thanked them. We split ways as I went to the laundry room. I walked up to the laundry door, my keys still grinning at me from the inside, and simply pushed the door open.



After that I just went to my room, took a hot shower, cried a little, and went to bed.



So ya, that’s how I locked myself out, nearly froze to death, and committed a social execution on myself all in one night.




TL;DR I locked my keys in the dorms laundry room on break so everyone else had left for home. I walk to the help center in a blizzard to try and find someone, but on one was there. Ended up making a fool of myself when people finally do show up to help me.

"TIFU by chemically burning myself with garlic


Yesterday I tried to apply a garlic poultice to get rid of a skin tag, leaving it overnight, for 6 hours. Painfully woke up this morning to a terrible burning sensation, quickly removed the large band-aid -which teared some skin away and instantly realized how f\*cked I was when I saw the dark red-brown slime of a wound that was my skin...

  
Back from the hospital, turns out that's a third degree chemical burn on my belly and this friggin' skin tag is still alive. Most of the surrounding skin isn't. 

Aftermath: 4+ weeks with occlusive dressings, and apparently a skin graft if it's still bad after a few weeks, plus a shitload of shame and this precious life lesson: ***garlic is freaking dangerous*** and home remedies mostly don't worth the risk,  health professionals mostly know what they're doing  
\-An absolute dumbass  
TL;DR Tried to remove a skin tag and ended up with a third degree chemical burn from garlic"
"TIFU by going to Canada without a birth certificate for an infant


TL;DR at end

A few of my friends and I were up at Niagara Falls in Buffalo. Everyone had told us that the Canadian side is better than the US side, so we all had brought our passports. We had also booked an AirBNB in Toronto for the last stop of our trip.

There's this bridge that connects the US to Canada. At the US side is a pay toll to cross the bridge, and at the other side is the Canadian Border Patrol (CBP) check point.

As we're in line for the pay toll, there's a sign that says you can turn around if you don't want to cross. I ask everyone in the vehicle to hand me your passports to make sure we have them so I can hand them to the CBP. Everyone hands me their passports; all seems good, and we proceed through the pay toll.

We are now crossing the bridge, and that's when it dawned on us. We don't have paperwork for the infant with us. We had left it in another vehicle back in the US. We thought, no problem, we'll just turn around when we reach the other side of the bridge. The only problem is we can't turn around anymore, we have to enter into Canada at this point.

When we reached the CBP post, we explained the situation and thought he'd let us turn around. Nope, he told us we must go to Immigration and they'll settle it there.

Fine. It shouldn't be a problem right? We go into the immigration office and hand them all our passports along with a note from the CBP saying we didn't have paper for the infant. The CBP told us to have a seat and we'll get to you.

There were about 15 other people there waiting for various reasons, and 4 or 5 CBP agents working behind the counter. We figured, ok, maybe an hour wait.

The CBP processes the people waiting one by one, more people show up, and they get processed too.

After about an hour, we inquired about what's taking so long, and that we would like to return to the US instead of enter Canada. They informed us that we're still being processed and to wait a little longer. We thought okay, maybe they have some longer process when an undocumented child comes the border.

Two more hours go by, and we've been asking for an update and keep getting the same response, to keep waiting. During this time we were able to reach someone that had stayed on the US side, who happened to have access to the birth certificate of the infant. This person provided a photo of the certificate. We tried to explain this to CBP, but they kept telling us to wait.

Finally, after another hour, we told the CBP that we were running low on food/diapers for the baby, explained again that we had the birth certificate and would like to be processed. The CBP finally agrees to look at what is the hold up. They took a closer look at birth certificate, then looked at the passports and pointed to us and said we're free to go.

Great! After almost 4 hours we can go home! We all walked out to the car and prepared to leave. I start handing out the passports to everyone and realized that we were missing one of my friend's passport.

He goes inside to retrieve it, and that's when we found out that he wasn't allowed to leave!

We found out that the CBP wasn't too concerned about the baby after we had shown them the birth certificate a few hours prior. Apparently, when they ran a background check they were concerned about one of my friends who had a DUI years ago. CBP told us to leave and let them process our friend as it could take a while.

Yes, we left our friend in Canada and went back to the States. He told us that he will walk across the bridge (there's a sidewalk that tourists use to cross) and we'll meet him at a restaurant nearby when he gets released.

So we learned that Canada does not let people with DUIs in. There's a 5 or 10 year ban if you have one. Sure enough, my friend isnt allowed in Canada any more. My friend had been to Vancouver a few times recently with no problems (my guess is that the CBP checkpoint doesn't do a background check, just a passport check, and that's why it was never flagged until they ran an extensive background check at immigration). 

We also didn't make it to Toronto.

TL;DR - Went to Canada without infant's birth certificate. Get sent to Immigration for four hours. Extensive background check reveals friend with a DUI and he gets 10 year ban."
