0,"The store could explode at any second and you want to try on a dress?


This story takes place about 14 years ago when I was working at a medium sized clothing store in a small outlet mall. One of the stores connected to ours was undergoing renovations when a gas line was somehow broken by construction workers forcing the entire complex to evacuate.

I was in the back sorting through piles of new stock when an announcement came over the intercom ""Code Red. There has been a gas leak and we need all associates and customers to leave the building immediatly through the front doors or nearest emergency exit."" along with the fire alarm being pulled. I started heading towards the front exit when I saw a lady standing at the fitting rooms looking impatient. I assumed she somehow had missed the anouncement and walked over to tell her she needed to get out. Before I got a word out she turned to me glaring.

Lady: Why isn't there anyone here to open the changing room doors!

Me: Sorry Ma'am there's been a gas leak we need to evacuate the store immediately. They already evacuated.

Lady: Can you open a door for me?

Me: No ma'am, we need to leave now! 

Lady: Why not?

Me: Ma'am did you hear me!? There's a gas leak, the store could blow up. We need to leave. 

Lady: I just want to try this on. Open a door!

Me: Ma'am. The store could explode at any second and you want to try on a dress?

Lady: Yes. Open a door for me and leave if you want!

Me: Ma'am I'm not going to risk my life going to find keys to open a changing room for you. We both need to get out of here!

She just glared at me so I just left her and exited the store. The fire department showed up a few minutes later and I got to watch them kick her out from the safety of the parking lot. "
1,"“I’ll come back when it’s full price then”


I used to work in a well known health food shop that always has some sort of sale or deals since it is wildly overpriced and they have to bring in customers somehow (those of you in the uk will know). In the weeks prior to this interaction we had been giving out £1 off vouchers for a specific coconut oil brand that had now been included in a special offer.
I was standing by the tills when a lady came in and I greeted her and asked her if she needed any help


Lady: I am looking for this particular brand, could you point me in the right direction?

Me: Of course! They are right here, and they’re actually on a better than half price offer.

Lady: Oh amazing, I’ve got this voucher for a pound off as well.

Me: I’m afraid that since they’re already reduced to less than half price the voucher won’t work

Lady: I see. I’ll come back when they offer is over then, thanks! 

And she just walked out. I was so confused my brain had to reboot and all I could do was mumble “okay?”.  Not sure if she realised the absurdity of the situation but if she did, it’s probably gonna haunt her "
