0,"Boy you really are useless you know that!


This tale is from my first day on the job when I was 16 and 1 day. Green as grass.


My first customer ever comes up to me.


&gt; $customer: ""Do you know where the garbage bags are?""

&gt; $me: ""No, sorry it's my first day.""

&gt; $customer: ""But you do know what garbage bags are right?""

&gt; $me: ""... yes""

&gt; $customer: ""Then why don't you know where they are?""

&gt; $me: ""um... I'll help you look""

*The store had 100 aisles so it was pretty big. I make an educated guess and lead him to the proper aisle on the first try*

&gt; $me: *picks up a box of regular black garbage bags*, ""here you go, Sir""

&gt; $customer: ""No, I need gaaaaaarbage baaaaags"", *he picks up a box of compost garbage bags right next to it*, ""I can't believe you have never seen these before"", *starts laughing*

&gt; $me: *blank stare*, ""I have""

&gt; $customer: *now dying of laughter*, ""Boy you really are useless you know that!""

&gt; $me: ""haha, yeah"", *what the hell is happening*

&gt; $customer: ""Now you know!"", *walks away*

&gt; $me: *I guess this is my life now*


Sidenote: in Toronto, you have to separate your garbage into compost (food, tissues, paper towels) and regular garbage. You must throw away compost in compost garbage bags.

First time posting to this sub and know that I know this exists, it will be my home.

One morning at my bulk store while i was helping customers, a kid about 9 comes up with a 20 dollar bill and orders 2 bags of chips that together cost $1.78. He hands me the 20 and as I'm gathering his change, he walks away. I try to call him back but he keeps walking and it seems he doesn't hear me. I see him walk to his mom, who's in line to pay for the other items she got from the rest of the store. They're too far to hear me call after them and I couldn't leave the other people I was serving so I set his change and receipt under the register because I thought ""his mom would make him come back and if not I'll catch them before they leave"" (my section was right next to the exit). 10 minutes later I was right, he comes back and I give him his change and receipt. 15 minutes after that, my manager pulls me away and tells me that woman complained that I refused to give her son his change and told her son that he doesn't get any change. I explained my side but my managers have to review the security tapes anyway. They see I was telling the truth. Next day the woman comes back threatening to sue but we offer to show her the tapes to prove her son left his change and at that point she drops her accusation and leaves.

Moral of the story: please stay with your child when ordering items."
2,"'I want my money back NOW!'


Good evening TFR, it's me again.

Just a little story for you about a ""situation"" I had with a customer(sort of) you will understand as you read on.

For the purpose of this, I will be 'Me' and Customer will be 'RD'
I work in a well known Tile Shop for those who don't know.

So, closing time is approaching and I'm just casual cleaning up to counter and getting ready to close up when RD enters and our conversation is as follows-

Me- 'How are you? Is there anything I can help you with?

RD- 'Yes, I want to return this and get a refund'

RD holds up a curtain rail.

Me- 'I'm sorry but I cannot do anything for you as it was not purchased here'

RD- 'How do you know it wasn't purchased here? You haven't even seen my receipt'

Me- 'It is not a product we have ever sold since I have worked here'

RD- 'You must be new then because I only bought this last week'

Me- 'I'm sorry sir but I have worked here for 6 years and you didn't purchase that here'

As I was about to tell him that the Homeware and Upholstery shop next door was where he more than likely purchased it he interrupts....

RD- 'Listen to me, I am telling you I bought this here last week and I want my money back NOW'

Me- 'Sir as I have explained you didn't purchase it here you probably bought it nex...'

He interrupts again...

RD- 'Listen you moron, you must be deaf or something, I bought it here, I bought it off him *points to other colleague* give me my money before I jump over the counter, slap some sense into you and take my money'

At this point I had enough.

Me- 'Right, listen very carefully and do not interrupt me, you didn't purchase that here, if you had stopped interrupting me, I would have been able to tell you that there is a -insert store name here- next door and that is where you most likely bought it. Now take your item and get out because none of the staff here are going to deal with someone so rude and obnoxious, please leave.'



RD went bright red and left without a single word to say.

The ironic thing is that he said he bought the item from my colleague who is male, the shop that he purchased it in only has female staff.

I just wish they would listen and not interrupt when you try to explain stuff to them. They would look a hell of a lot less foolish."
