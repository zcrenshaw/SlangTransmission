0,"Grown woman doesn't understand why cutting in line is rude.


This happened a while ago and for some reason popped back into my head today.

So I worked as a cashier for a drugstore last year. Over the summer we sold beach chairs and the like.

I'm ringing out this middle aged woman who seems a little stuck up and but generally isn't being rude or anything... yet. She's buying a lot of stuff. The store is very busy and there's a long line at each register.

Her: ""How much are those chairs over there?"" *points across the store at a display*

Me: ""Hm, I'm honestly not sure, we just put those up and haven't made sale signs yet. Do you want to grab one so I can check?""

Her: ""Nah, it's fine. I don't need it. Have a good one."" 

And she leaves.

I ring out a few more people and ten minutes have gone by. The woman strolls back into the store, walks up to my line with the chair she said she didn't want, and cuts a little old lady in line who had just put her stuff on the counter almost pushing her out of the way.

Me: ""Um, I'm really sorry but this woman is next in line.""

Rude Lady: ""Excuse me?! I was JUST here. I need the price on this.""

Me: ""I understand but this woman was just about to cash out and you've already left the store, you'll need to get back in line.""

RL: ""Are you f***ing serious?! What's the big deal?""

Me: *fed up with people cutting others in line constantly* ""Because you just cut her in line and she's been waiting..""

Old lady: ""It's okay dear, obviously she must REALLY need that chair. You can check it for her."" 

Me: *scans the chair* it's $20.

RL: ""Was that so hard? Thanks."" Drops the chair to the floor in front of the counter and takes off muttering under her breath.

Me: ""Thank you, ma'am. Sorry about that.""

Old lady: ""Oh sweetheart, it's okay. You handled that very well. People these days! Don't you worry, she was just rude.""

The next day, my manager called me into her office and condescendingly asked what I could or shoud have done differently about the situation and told I was in the wrong for not letting her cut. I guess the shift supervisor saw the whole thing happen and as she usually did with her coworkers, she bad mouthed me to the manager.

I do not miss that job!"
1,"Lady complains she can't carry all the items she just bought


I used to work in a cosmetics and toiletries chain store as a Christmas temp, and whilst it was mostly a lovely experience, given that it was Christmas time we did get a few crazies. This was my favourite one because I was so close to losing it and laughing when it happened.

So it's the Saturday before Christmas, pretty much the busiest and most hectic time you could decide to do all your Christmas shopping in one go. Not that it stopped this lady from attempting it. I'm on the tills, and she comes up with about 6 huge boxes, that were toiletries giftsets. Each one was the size of like a small suitcase, and contained a number of full-size toiletries in it. So they were huge, and weighed quite a lot. But they were half price so people were buying lots of them, I didn't think anything of it and just assumed she was shopping with someone who could help her carry them all. So I finish ringing her up, and wish her a Merry Christmas and go to serve the next customer. I'm M and the lady is L:

&gt;L: (huffs) these are so heavy! 

&gt;M: haha yeah, you're getting full-size products for such a great price but they are quite bulky! 

&gt;L: how do you expect me to carry all this home? 

&gt;M: (trying to think why on earth that's my problem) would you like some extra carrier bags to help distribute the weight a bit? 

&gt;L: (huffs again) how would that help? I'm going on the bus too, this is going to be a nightmare. I can't even carry them to the bus stop myself. I need another person to help.

At this point she's eyeballing me, and I swear I think she was trying to get me to say I'd walk her to the bus stop. Bear in mind the closest bus stop to this shop was a good 10 minute walk, on a good day. With how crowded it was outside, it would have taken 15 minutes easily. And besides, I'm obviously at work??? I decide to pretend I have no clue what she's hinting at and hope she leaves.

&gt;M: Christmas shopping eh, such a stress! Have a nice rest of your day!

I then very clearly turn to the next customer and start serving them before she can directly ask me to leave work and help her. She just stares at me a bit longer then walks away muttering to herself about how ""this is ridiculous"" and ""how can anyone carry this much"". 

The insanity of the whole thing was just too much, who buys a metric fuckton of heavy giftsets then complains they can't carry them? Don't fucking buy them then?"
2,"You're an idiot. Yes sir, it's totally my fault


Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time posting. On mobile, sorry for edit. English not first language,sorry for syntax. 


This happened a few years ago. I was 18 and it was my first job, working over the phone customer service for a major cell phone company. We'll say M is me and C is customer 


M: “Hi, thank you for calling X, how can I help you today?” 


C: “Yes, I'd like to check my account.”


M: “Sure thing. What's your cell phone number?”


His cell phone didn't bring up an account, which was weird (since we're a cell phone company), but we had other ways of pulling up an account. 


M: “I'm sorry, that didn't pull up anything. May I have your social?”


He gave me that, but still didn't bring up anything. 


M: “I'm so sorry, I still can't find your account. Let's try address.”


Still nothing


M: “I'm sorry, still having difficulty. Let's try address.”


Nothing. 


M: “So sorry, let's try first and last name.”


I could tell every single time I asked for more info, he was getting more and more frustrated. 


I finally said, “I'm so sorry I can't seem to find your account, you are calling X mobile right?” 


C: “No. I'm calling Bank of America.” 


Mind you,he sat through our automated system which greets you ‘Thank you for calling X”, which mentions the name of the company while you're waiting on hold, which I also mentioned when he and I connected. 


M: “Oh. I'm sorry. This is X for the cell phone company.”


C: “You are a fucking idiot. You should be fired.”


Then dramatically hung up at that point. 


Oh yes sir, it is my fault our company name got mentioned at least 3 times to you, and you never noticed. But I'm the idiot. Idiot. 


BTW, back then, aside from dialing *2 from your actual cell phone, it was very difficult to get an 800 number. 


So so so so so glad I don't deal with customers anymore. This happened in 2006 and it's the story I'll always tell of those days.




Update: I just logged into Reddit today to find unread messages, which is strange since I mostly lurk. I apparently posted this drunk and have no recollection of it whatsoever. I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed with this being coherent at all. Thanks for all the replies and listening to my drunken rant from 2006."
