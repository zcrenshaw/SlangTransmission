0,"The customer's wife came in specifically to find me


So this happened a long time ago in my old job at a high street jewelers in the UK but I think about the interaction a lot so wanted to share!  I was working on the shop floor and an elderly gentleman and his daughter came in and started looking at the bracelets and bangles. To give some perspective this isn’t a prestige jewelers; unless something had a diamond in it, the most you could look to spend was £300-£400. 

After giving them a few minutes to look I went over and asked if they need any help. The gentleman said he was looking for a bangle for his wife for their anniversary but he wasn’t sure what to go for. I brought them over to the table and chairs and let him have a sit while I took ten or so bangles and bracelets out of the display for him to have a look at. I brought them over and explained the difference between the metals, the clasps etc, let him hold them, try them on his daughter to see how they looked on the wrist. That sort of thing. I probably spent about 40 minutes with them helping them choose something.   

He landed on something he liked and left happy with a new bangle for his wife. Such a nice man and it was a pleasure to see him off with something he liked.  

Skip to the following Saturday and I was on the shop floor again. A lady comes in looking around for something so I head over and ask if she needs anything. She clocks my name badge and says “ahh, are you chap that helped my husband pick out this bangle?” It was the wife of the gentleman I helped and she had come into town to find me specially to say thank you for “spending so much time with him to pick out such a lovely present” and how much she loved it. Apparently it had meant so much to the old timer he told her all about the experience in store. He had no idea really what he was looking for and I was just pleased to help guide him through the minefield that can be women’s jewelry!  

I’d never had such warm fuzzies working in that shop and still I think about it a lot!"
1,"You’re Too Young to Know What that Is


This happened last week. I was co-manager with my peer (we will call him Buddy) and we start to do a lap around the store to make sure the team is doing alright and see what needs to get done before we leave. As we start our walk, this older lady is about to pass so I ask her:

Me: Hello, are you finding everything okay?

Lady: (Angrily) No, I’m not.

Me; Okay what are you looking for so we can help you find it?

Lady: You can’t help me, I’ve already checked and you don’t have it.

Me: What is the item?

Buddy: If you tell us what item it is we can see if maybe it’s in the back room since you didn’t see it on the floor.

Lady: Don’t bother, I know you don’t have it cause I checked, I went to the aisle your employee told me to go and it was not there.

Me: What’s the item?

Lady: Waxed Paper

Me: Wax Paper?

Lady: Wax-ED PAPER

Buddy: Right, Wax Paper

Lady: WAXED PAPER. You use it to wrap food like sandwiches. NOT parchment paper. WAXED PAPER. You’re too young to know what it is.

Me: (*Vgkjfdyhcfhnbg* searching in our store device, typed in wax paper, says we have 29 on the floor in the aisle) Okay it says we have some so if you want to follow me we can go and look for it together. (I have been smiling and have been super nice through this whole interaction) 

Lady: No, I already looked and you don’t have it so feel free to go check out what I already know for yourself and I’ll be in the ice cream if you need me. (she proceeds to walk away)

I look at buddy and smile we walk over to the aisle where it said they would be and I kid you not, right NEXT to the parchment paper.... on the TOP shelf are at least 20 containers on WAX paper.

Me: Hmmm how many do you think she needs????

Buddy: One, just grab one..

Me: I think she needs all 20 of them!!! What do you think?

Buddy: (laughs) oh god no just get one 

Me: (grabs 3 of them and finds lady) Hello, I wasn’t sure how many you needed so I grabbed three just in case (I’m smiling from ear to ear)

Lady: (looks up from her phone and see’s the wax paper in my hands) oh my goodness where did you find those???! 

Me: In the aisle. They were on the top shelf next to the parchment paper so that could have been why you missed them (cause you didn’t f’n look above your eye line)

Lady: oh gosh you must be feeling pretty good right now, making me eat my words.

She takes two of the wax paper containers and I end up accidentally running into her a couple more times throughout the night. Each time her face got super red. It was a good night."
2,"Lady tries to steal, and throws a tantrum when confronted, making things worse, ending up in a police car


On mobile, sorry for formatting errors

I work as a cashier/shift manager in a grocery store. In our store, people need to bring produce to the register, where we will weigh and price it for them, or just scan the item when it is individually priced. One of these items is lettuce, which comes in opaque bags with an open top. A middle aged lady, we'll call her LL for lettuce lady, loads all of her groceries on the belt, and I start to scan. When I reach for the lettuce, I feel something strange, it turns out lettuce lady had stacked 3 lettuces inside this bag. When I confronted her, she said she just grabbed the bag from the shelf. So I called in our produce clerk (PC).
 
The conversation went like this:

Me to PC: this lady said she found a bag with 3 lettuces stuffed inside, isn't that strange?

PC: Yes it is, as lettuces are only sold individually (LL starts to turn red)

LL: (classic incoming) I want to speak to your manager immediately.

I proudly introduce myself as manager to LL, which made matters even worse because she just threw a tantrum a 3 year old would be jealous of. The tantrum started with tearing off the bag with her teeth, and throwing the lettuces to the floor, smashing them with her feet, I tell her to calm down, which only works as fuel on her already raging fire.

She then starts to throw things from the belt into the store. This was the point where I called in security, and told PC to phone the police. This makes her more angry, so when security arrives, she f*cking spits all over our security guard and my register, and tries to punch both me and the guard in the face. The guard eventually manages to tackle LL and keep her immobile until police arrived.

She then was arrested. When she was dragged out of the store, she starts to scream things about out customer service all over the place. She ended up in the back of a police cat, because 
1. She was too cheap to pay the extra 75 cents for the lettuces, which were on sale anyways

2. She was too stubborn and self-proud to admit her lame try to steal one of the cheapest items in our store like any sane adult would do. 


Tl;dr woman tries to steal freaking lettuce, and makes such a big fuss, we had police come over to arrest her."
