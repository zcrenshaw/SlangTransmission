0,"A customer comes in 5 minutes before closing...


As I'm sure you guys are familiar with some customers like to come in right before closing and buy a huge cart of shopping. These people are generally oblivious to the fact they're keeping staff past closing.

So this women runs up to my checkout with a small basket of items and begins apologising for coming in so late. I assure her it's ok. I learn that she used to work retail too and understands the blight of this.

She was incredibly nice the entire time and it only took a minute or two to ring up her stuff. We shared a few laughs about oblivious customers and she again apologised for keeping me.

I looked at the clock and it was only a minute after closing. I wish more customers were this considerate."
1,"Someone called corporate about me and a coworker.


Sorry for the delay! I don't think Reddit likes it if you post stories you typed up in Notes lol. 


Anyway, some background information; one of my coworkers (C) and I get along *super* well. Like, we're the same person with similar senses of humor so when we work together the atmosphere is friendly and light. My manager tries to schedule us together because there's a legitimate rise in sales when me and C are together lol. 


Like I said in my previous post my store is basically dead between holidays so I'm able to follow customers and help them one-on-one without having to worry about a line. 


One day this lady (N for nice) came in and you could tell she had money. She held herself confidently, smelled like leather and flowers, and had designer clothes, and she was *beautiful*. So I greet her and ask her if she needs any help. She says yes and me and C walk over to help her. 


We learned she's buying for a retirement party and a work anniversary party so we help her pick stuff out based upon her color scheme. I make small talk and learn her son is learning about noble gasses and his favorite gas is sulfur hexafluoride (makes your voice deeper. Opposite of helium) and I reply, ""my least favorite gas is my dads."" I know, it's a dumb joke but everyone loved it. 


N was fairly short so she thanked us for helping her (I'm 6'0 he's 6'4) and asked where the retirement and gag stuff is. I point it out and offer to keep her two carts of stuff in the front which she thanks me for. 


I stay up at the registers now because somehow a small line formed and I heard more chatting and laughing coming from C and N. 


N comes up and cashes out. Nearly $450 worth of stuff! Our average purchase is around $30 so this was a godsend. I get to the end and scan a coupon (25% off entire purchase) and brings her total down about $120 and she almost hugs me she's so happy (she would have but she couldn't reach me lol). 


I offer to help her take everything to her car and C holds open the doors for us and she talks the whole time about how she's doing all the errands today so she's sorry if the truck is a little messy. I say it's fine with a little laugh. 


Guys, I'm not a car person but this thing was huge. It was the same size as a pickup truck with a cool hatchback trunk! AND IT WAS SOOOOO CLEAN. I climbed in and played Tetris around dry cleaning and groceries. Like, I legitimately climbed in at least 4 feet into the trunk. 


She kept thanking me and complimenting me and C and asked for the number to corporate so she could compliment us. Unfortunately it's not on the receipts and I don't know it off the top of my head. 


She ended up googling it herself and my district manager came in a few days later to thank us because the lady left a stunning compliment about us! 

TL;DR: I made a fart joke, customer spent over $300, I climbed in a trunk, and got a compliment from corporate!

2,"""But is says 50% off!!!""


LTLFTP you know the drill. 

So this happened today. A lady came up to my register to ring up some garden decorations and told me she saw it was 50% off. 

Lady: This said 50% off on the shelf is that right?

Me: If it is, it doesn't ring up immediately it will when I press total. 

I finish ringing it up. 

Me: Okay, your total is $Tot.al. 

Lady: But nothing rang up half off!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but it seems that it is not 50% off. 

Lady: But it said so on the shelf!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am maybe it was in the wrong place?

Lady: But it said 50% off! You can't ring that up for me?

At this point, there were a few people in line behind her. Since it's a small store, we only have one cashier at once. I apologize to the other people in line. 

Me: Can you show me where you found it?

I follow her to the shelf. 

Lady: (pointing at the markdown sticker) Here is says 50%... oh. 

Me: Oh it seems that the sale ended yesterday. I'm sorry ma'am. 

Lady: That's alright. I should've looked at it. 

We proceed back to the register, she has me cancel the not-on-sale items and give her the rest. 

Lady: (to the people behind her) Sorry about that folks!

She then leaves and I continue with the rest of the customers. Thought I'd share a more positively ending story to give a relief from all the negative ones here. Moral of the story: Not every customer sucks. Some are actually reasonable. :)

Edit: I get it guys, I should've honored it. I'm fairly new and still learning my way around handling customers. Just didn't want to get on my boss' bad side."
