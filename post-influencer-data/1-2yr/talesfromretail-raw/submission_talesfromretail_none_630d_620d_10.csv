My wife and I are visiting my parents for the holidays, and somehow we got on the topic of women's underwear, which reminded my parents (and myself) of an incident at a job I had back in high school.

It was at a big-name clothing store, just after the holidays, and we were marking down the leftover Christmas items. I, a male, was currently working on some women's underwear, scanning, printing, and moving to the next while lost in my own little world and thinking nothing of it. At the time, I was using one of the smaller hand-scanners that looked a bit like the (then modern-day) digital cameras looked like.

All of a sudden, I hear some stifled laughter, and my manager's voice assuring an elderly woman that I was *not* taking pictures of the underwear.

I turn around to see the store manager, several assistant managers, our LP guy, and two of the big guys on our truck crew standing there looking both relieved and amused.

Once they explained to her what I was doing and why (and after they pulled me off that job and had a female co-worker take over), the manager explained to me that the woman had come to them in a panic, claiming that I was taking pictures of women's underwear. 

The manager thought she meant upskirt or similar shots, and rallied a few people as support for safety, only for her to point me out as I was scanning the barcodes and putting the new price stickers over the old.

Our LP guy did check our cameras for safety reasons, but we all had a bit of a chuckle about it after.

**Edit ::** I just got back from dinner with the family, and realize that there's a bit of confusion due to me not putting in a timeframe. This story happened close to 20 years ago, when dial-up was the only option, and still somewhat uncommon. Sorry for the confusion!"
1,"When people don't hear the closing announcement.


Like many retail establishments my old job used to make the ""We will be closing in X minutes"" announcements. I always liked doing this as it gave me a chance to ham out and say it in different tones of voice. 

This night, like all the others, I get on the PA and announce ""Attention shoppers we will be closing in 30 minutes"", then I give the same type of warning for 15, 10, and 5 minutes. At closing time I would hop on the PA and say something like ""attention all, we're closed, get out, get out, get out, we all want to go home"". 

At shutdown time I lock the front door. As I turn around I come face to face with a huge burly guy who is just staring intensely at me. I go into a full on karate pose (not knowing karate) and say ""dude, I made announcements that we were closing, you need to drop your stuff and leave"". He looks at me strangely, raises his hands, looks at them and then holds up one finger. 

I'm expecting to be beaten and robbed, and my mind goes into full panic mode.  

He turns around and starts checking the aisles, then jogs down one. He comes back with a lady and they both approach me. As they walk up he begins signing to her and she looks at me and mouths ""sorry"". The gentleman (in the very recognizable tone of someone who cannot hear to modulate their voice)  explained they're both deaf and they couldn't hear the announcements. 

I had seen them in the store weekly and had never realized they were hearing impaired. Super nice couple but that dude was scary looking. "
