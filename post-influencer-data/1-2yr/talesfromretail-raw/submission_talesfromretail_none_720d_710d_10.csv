0,"Every angry customer's worst nightmare: total indifference


I watch over the self-checkouts at my store. 

For a bit of background, my store has two sets of circulars with coupons people can get. One you have to sign up for and it gets mailed to your house. The other we have stacks of in our store that anyone can take. The one you get in the mail often has a coupon to get you two times as many rewards points which can be used to save on gas.

So on this day a woman came through self-checkout and at the end of her order she brought her mail flier up to me and asked me to scan her double points coupon. So I scan it and start tearing it out when she asks me to give it back to her so she could use it another time.

I told her I can't do that and have to take it from her after it's been used, even pointing out the text saying ""LIMIT 1 PER HOUSEHOLD"" on the coupon. But she starts arguing with me saying I *can* do it and that she does it all the time. I happen to see our store manager walking by so I flag him down to come help me out.

As I expected he tells her pretty much the exact same thing. I don't remember everything that was said but this is pretty much how it went:

&gt;Store manager (to me): What seems to be the issue?

&gt; Lady: I just asked him to-

&gt; SM: Hold on let me hear his side first. What's going on?

&gt; Me: She wants me to give back her double points coupon after I already scanned it for her. It says limit one per household on it though.

&gt; SM: It does say limit one per household. He has to keep it and be accountable for all his coupons.

&gt; L: But I do it all the time at [other location]! They even hand them out at the registers!

&gt; SM: Well they're not supposed to be doing that. 

&gt; Me: Yeah it's just company policy, we have to go by what the coupon says.

She argues some more, and the store manager says he'll go check the fliers we have stacked by the door to see if there's one in there she can have. We all know there won't be but he'll check anyway.

So at this point she's still with me while I'm trying to help people at self-checkout.

&gt; L: You know, the whole reason I shop at [store] is for the savings I get on gas.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: I mean, really, I just spent $150 here.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: But honestly after this I don't think I'm going to shop here anymore. 

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: \*looks at nametag\* No, *[MY NAME]*, don't just stand there and say okay!

&gt; Me: ...ok

&gt; L: Can't you just give my coupon back?! They really let me do this all the time

&gt; Me: no, sorry

I crumple up the coupon to hopefully make it more clear to her that it isn't going to happen. Store manager comes back and of course there wasn't another coupon in the circulars by the door. He asks her to come to the service desk with him and they'll see if there's anything we can do.

I thought that would be the last of it but I work in retail so of course it's not.

About 10 minutes later she comes back to me with one of the circulars from the door and shoves it in front of the screen I'm trying to do my job with. 

&gt; L: I just want you to know that all of these coupons in here say one per household too.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: Yeah but I bet you just zap them with your gun all the time and let people keep them!

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: You know what? Where's the boss? Call him over again!

So I pick up the phone to call him and as I'm talking to him she just walks away. Store manager comes down a few seconds later asking where she is and I shrug telling him she walked away. I tell him the general direction she went and he goes to look for her. He didn't find her.

I heard from one of my coworkers that the next day a woman matching her description came in asking cashiers at the registers if they had any double points coupons in their drawer.

1,"Buying Alcohol in School Uniform.


This is probably my favourite all-time story from retail.

I was working an early morning shift (6-4) as a Team Leader in a Supermarket, for context here in the UK you have to be 18 to buy Alcohol or Tobacoo.

I was looking after the Self Service Checkouts (as it was around 7.40 and the next person was in at 8) and a group of school kids come in and proceed to get what they want (Sweets, Fizzy Drinks etc) and they all wait at the end for each other.

One kid comes up and use the till closest to me and proceeds to scan a bottle of Vodka, I realise (and the Till Prompts) and I go over and tell him he cant have it. The conversation was something like this Me+Me, K=Kid, DM=Duty Manager.

&gt;M: Sorry, I'm afraid you cant purchase this as you are underage.

&gt;K: Nah I'm not

&gt;M: Sorry you're in school uniform, which means at the most you are 16 years old.

&gt;K: and what

&gt;M: You are not allowed to buy this, and im not legally allowed to sell it to you.

&gt;K: Im 18

&gt;M: You are in School Uniform, I don't believe your 18.

&gt;K: I am

&gt;M: I'm sorry I don't believe you.

&gt;K: You never asked for ID.

&gt;M: Correct, I would ask for ID had you not been in school uniform, however I know the school you goto (previously went there) and I know that you only go there until your 16. You are not allowed this alcohol, I suggest you either pick something else or you leave.

&gt;K: Yeah I will leave with this bottle.

&gt;M: That's not going to happen, I'm afraid.

&gt;K: I also want a pack of baccy, and some papers.

&gt;M: Again, you are not overage and you are in school uniform, you are not having any Alcohol, or Tobacco, you can purchase anything else that you are allowed like your friends have or you can leave.

&gt;K: You cant make me leave.

&gt;M: Yes we can, its your choice what happens, however, if you continue to argue here, I will call for the Duty Manager and you will be escorted out of the store.

&gt;K: Your a f***ing tosser, just f**k off.

&gt;M: You need to leave now.

The Kid then proceeds to leave with his bunch of mates, i think nothing much of it and report it in our ""Incident"" book and inform the Security Guard when he arrives.

Later that day the Duty Manager comes up to me.

&gt;DM: I have just had an angry woman phone the store, and they have put a formal complaint in about you.

&gt;M: Really, What was it regarding, I have not had any issues today that would cause a complaint.

&gt;DM: She says her son was in here earlier trying to buy a couple of drinks with his friends before school, and you were abusive and aggressive towards him, then proceeded to start singling him out and begin verbally assaulting him, and refusing to serve him.

&gt;M: *Sighs*, well he was bout 14-15 in full School Uniform from (Local School) and was trying to buy a bottle of Vodak, his mates were at the end of the Tills waiting for him, he did not like the fact that he could not buy it, and tried to claim he was 18. After trying that he also asked for some Tobacco, which was also declined, when told he was not getting he then proceeded to be abusive towards me.

&gt;DM: When did it happen, so we can check CCTV as his mother claims something completely different.

Duty Manager, checks CCTV which backs up the story, proceeds to call the Mother back, who insisted we were covering up, and that he (precious little) son would never try and buy alcohol or tobacco and that she was going to phone Customer Services to report us both.


Nothing ever came of it after that, but it never amazes me the Cheek of some people and how far some are willing to go.
