0,"Worth The Retail Horrors


Heyo. Normal apologies since I'm on mobile blah blah.

I'm currently a Cashier at a big brand grocery store that also sells toys, makeup, etc. But this story takes place back when I was still a Parcel and Bagger. So around March I believe.

I was bagging as per usual and had just finished up my current customer and spewed out the normal retail spiel about having a good day. Our store chain puts a huge emphasis on interacting with customers and making it a good experience so they'll come back.

So, I looked to see what would come down the belt next when I saw one tiny Transformers toy. It's one of the mystery packet ones where you don't know what you're getting til you open it.

I'm a giant transformers nerd so immediately I looked up to see this mom and her kid. The little boy had, what I now know is called, a Prolouge to Go. Bee is for the boy and M will be me.

M: You like Transformers?

Bee: *presses yes*

M: That's awesome! Who's your favorite?

Bee:*presses Bumblebee and then presses the Autobot sigil button to say Autobots*

Now, I will admit I've got a few tattoos. Coincidentally I had just gotten one done three days prior to this and taken the special wrap off as instructed. It's hidden by my uniform sleeve though. Without going into too much detail, it has the Autobot sigil in it among other things.

I heard what Bee said and then bent down to his level and lifted up my sleeve to show him the sigil.

M: I'm an Autobot too.

Y'all the smile that erupted on Bee's face. He got so excited he actually hugged me. That kid and his excitement made my entire face light up. The mom thanked me for speaking to her son instead of ignoring him and making his day, and I ended up with a huge goofy smile on my face for the rest of the day myself. It's moments like that that make working in retail worth it.

1,"You all NEVER have any information on your seafood.


Place:  seafood department of grocery store.  I was there but working meat at the time; my seafood guy was behind seafood counter.  Lady comes up, irate.  I didn't hear the first part of the convo, but when I started paying attention here's how it went:

Irate Customer:  ""you never have any information on your shrimp""

Coworker:  ""what exactly did you want to know?""

Lady:  ""Well, where they're from, what the difference is, which is better?""

Coworker:  ""These are from Key West, they're medium, about 41 to 50 per pound.  These over here are from Southern Georgia, they're jumbo, about 21 - 25 per pound.  As for which is better, that is a matter of taste, they're both good....the Key West tend to be a bit sweeter.""

Lady:  ""That's it?   I told you, you people don't know your product.  That's all the information you can give me?  Ridiculous!""

Coworker:  (looks at me, like wtf else does she want to know?)  Turns to her and says ""These Key West pink shrimp...they grew up in the lap of luxury.  Two parents, only swam in the best schools.  Easy life, they knew they were gonna turn out just fine without even trying.  Kinda spoiled, they lived in the ritzy part of the ocean, had everything handed to them.""

""Now these big guys, these are the Georgia boys.  Single shrimp mom, did the best she could.  They had to scrap and fight for every meal they got.  They live in the rougher part of the sea...nothing handed to them, they had to work for everything they got.  But some damn fine shrimp, I tell ya...look at the size of these suckers.  You don't get that big by lounging about...these shrimp have nothing to be ashamed of.  They may not be pretty and pink, but they are some damn good eating.  And look at all they went through to land on someone's dinner plate.""

I almost died laughing at the expression on this bitch's face.  I mean really...besides size, where they're from, whether they've been frozen or not, and nutrional info, wtf was she expecting?  I thought it was perfect.  She did not, and stomped off."
