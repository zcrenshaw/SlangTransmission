0,"Never be rude to people in small retail shops.


When I was 16, I worked for my uncle. He was a tailor, but also had a clothes store next door to his main shop. He let me run the clothes store, which basically involved keeping it clean, serving customers and displaying stock. He ran the business side of it, I was paid to essentially sit there all day. It was a pretty quiet store in a quiet area so it was a pretty cruisy job, great for school holidays. 

Whenever we got new stock in, I would have to put the price tags on myself. Most of the clothes we sold were men's office work wear - suits, shirts, trousers and the like. Average price for a suit was around $150-$200.

One day, I had a belligerent customer come in. He saw that I was quite young, so he took to bullying me around. He would swear and act very impatient, and would call me slow and stupid. I'd dealt with rude customers before, but this guy was far too much. To the best of my knowledge, I hadn't done anything wrong. He may have been having a bad day, but to me that doesn't excuse the insults.

He had come in quite early; usually we opened at 9, but didn't get any customers until much later. It was rare to get any customers before 11. That morning I had gotten a load of new stock in, and hadn't finished putting on the price tags as it was a huge amount of new stock in.

So, because of his rudeness, I decided that i would charge him much, much more. Either he would decide it was too expensive, or we would make a lot more money. He selected three suits, and I told him they were $500 for the first two, with the third being $700. They were actually around $200. We haggled a bit and I sold them for around $350 for this first two, and $600 for the third. He was quite happy with what he saw as a major victory. I was quite happy I made an extra $700. I told my uncle what happened, and he let me keep a percentage of the money as a bonus. My uncle knew that particular customer and had had issues with him before. 

Perhaps it wasn't the morally correct thing to do, but it serves to show you shouldn't be rude.

Tl;dr - guy is rude to retail worker who sets the prices in the shop, ends up getting ripped off a few hundred dollars. "
1,"I knew you'd say that


I used to work in store where we would ask customers if they had an account number at the check out. The number would be put in manually before putting the shopping through and the customer would get back one penny on every pound they spent.

One day a family who I hadn't seen before came in and while the mum and kids wandered off to start shopping. The dad came over to the side of my till while I was serving customers, announced his account number and then ran off to join his family without saying anything else. OK, that was weird, I went on serving. 

About 10 minutes later the family are queued for my till. When it comes to the point where I should ask for their number the dad grins at me and I realise what's going on. Fortunately, I have a bizarrely good memory for numbers and, without skipping a beat, I reel off the one he gave me when he came in the store. The kids both gasp and their eyes go wide. They look at their dad in awe. 

As I'm putting through the shopping, I hear the dad say:

&gt;See? I told you they were psychic.
