0,"""What does the six stand for?""


Hello!  This is my first post on talesfromretail and also my first reddit post in general, so bear with me for what is hopefully an uplifting tidbit.  

I do a lot of cashiering, and while customers watch me ring they frequently ask about my tattoos, specifically several low-quality stick n pokes on my left arm that I did myself.  They are all very personal and I did them all very drunk with the exception of a tattoo of six tally marks.  

Today I was ringing out a middle aged couple when the man asked me what the six stood for.  I don't always tell customers what my tats mean because too often they think I'm looking for a rude opinion but this guy had been polite so far, so I said, &gt; ""I did it on my sixth day sober.  It helped me get to seven.""  

Immediately the guy lifted his left arm to show me a tattoo of roman numerals and said, &gt; ""This was for four years sober.""  

It really took me surprise as the coolest part of my day.  As yall can probably relate to I go into a lot of interactions with customers dreading what they're going to say to me so it's awesome to have a moment like this instead."
1,"""...okay.""


I worked at a convenience store. Someone wanted to buy cigarettes, didn't have an ID and looked younger than our age policy of 35. PC will be persistent customer and I will be me.

PC: X brand of cigarettes.

Me: Do you have your ID?

PC: No. (She said this completely neutrally, without a hint of annoyance, which had never happened before so naturally a red flag went up in my head)

Me: Okay, well, I'm sorry but I won't be able to sell these to you.

PC: Okay. (Again, completely neutral tone of voice, like it didn't bother her at all. She didn't leave to look around, or leave the store. She just kept staring at me with a poker face. Not knowing what to expect, but not sure where to go from here, I choose the best course of action to my mind.)

Me: ...okay.

*Close to an entire minute of silence commences of us just staring at each other. I don't look away because I expect she will grab something and leave while my back is turned. The tension and awkwardness become palpable, but I'm determined to play her game and make her speak first. Finally after about a minute, and showing her first sign of frustration...*

PC: Well, what are we doing then?!

Now, I rarely slip into sarcasm, it takes a lot, but this woman pushed just the right buttons.

Me: *faking acting surprised* Oh! I thought we were just going to stare at each other for a while. Is there anything else I can help you with?

She blinked rapidly a few times, opened her mouth to utter a response, and calmly left without saying anything.

One of my prouder moments."
