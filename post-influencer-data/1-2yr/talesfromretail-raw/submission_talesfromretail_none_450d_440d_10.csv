0,"""This says 30% off, so it's 30% off, right?"" ""Actually, it's 50%-"" ""No 'actually!' It says 30% off so it's 30% off!"" ""...""


Another tale from the game store. We've had a Clearance Sale for quite a while now with clearance collectible items (plushies, action figures, small toys, etc.) at 30% off, with signs posted as such. My boss made a small sign for a particular item, a big NERF gun, highlighting the deal. It's normally $100, the sign said, ""$70 after discount!""

This happened on the day the sale changed to 50% off. I didn't get around to changing the signs, but I let people know if they appeared interested in the clearance items.

In comes a woman with her child. She walks around the store for a bit and notices the NERF gun. It piques her interest. I'm helping another customer as I see her study the sign my boss made (which is inaccurate at this point). I finish with my customer and go up to her, and before I can get a word out she says, ""This is 30% off, right? This sign says so.""
I should have chosen my words better when I responded to her (but that still doesn't excuse her from lashing out).

""Oh, actually, it's not *30*% off, it's-""

She cuts me off. ""What do you mean?! It says right here! $70! You have to honor that!""

It's really annoying when people misuse ""honor"" when it comes to retail, but it didn't really matter, as I still hadn't properly explained the change in the deal.

""I'm sorry ma'am, let me explain-""

""No, there's no explanation needed. The sign says it's 30% off so you have to sell it to me for 30% off.""

Now, I know what most of you are thinking. I should just placate her and ring it up, and manually increase the price in the computer by $20. But I didn't think she deserved that. Rather, she did deserve it, but I wasn't going to be the one to cheat her out of twenty bucks.

""Ma'am, I'm trying to explain something, can you please let me explain?""

""Fine, but I still want it for 30% off.""

""Okay. So the 30% off deal changed to-""

""But it says right here!""

""MA'AM. Please. Let me finish.""

She crosses her arms and stays silent, like whatever I'm going to say isn't going to change anything.

""The deal is now 50% off instead of 30% off. So it costs less than what is listed.""
The look on her face was one of supreme embarrassment. She still ended up buying it, but was so embarrassed that she didn't say anything else. Didn't even respond when I asked if she had a rewards cards (which she did, since I was the one who actually set her up).

I wish people weren't so impatient."
1,"Sorry, come back in two hours.


I used to live in a small town (population +/- 2500).  We had 1 grocery store and 6 mini-mart/gas stations.  I worked at one of these stations.  This is in Nevada, so we all sold liquor,  we can sell hard liquor 24/7, if we're open.  I was working closing shift,  we closed at 10pm. About 9:45 a Sweet Kid came in wanting to buy some liquor.   

SK: Hi, can I get a bottle of *hard stuff*?   

Me:  Sure,  I just need to see your ID.  

*hands me his ID.  He turns 21 tomorrow, like 2 hours away.  

Me:  Nice try, but nope.  

SK:  Oh come on, it's only 2 hrs!  

Me:  Well, come back in 2 hours.  

SK:  But you close in like five minutes.  

Me:  Oops.  Sorry.  

He  tried a couple more times, finally just smiled, said ok and left.  

I was informed a couple days later that out of the 7 places in town, I was the only one who didn't give in and sell to him, he was working with the sheriff's office,  they all got huge fines, I got a $.50/hr raise."
