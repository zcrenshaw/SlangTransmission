0,"""I'm 10 minutes away, can't you just stay open until I get there?""


This has happened a few times and I hate it everytime. We close at 5:00pm sharp. Doors locked, lights off, I'm in my car and down the road by 5:02. I get a call at 4:58pm, customer wants to come in to pick up product but are still ""10 minutes"" away and they want us to stay here past close for them. I've done it a couple times for people who are a couple minutes away, like they're up the road at the stop light and will actually be here within a minute or two. Those who say they are still on the freeway and 10 minutes away is almost always going to be longer than that. Not only that, but once you wait past close for them to get here, then you have to wait for them to finish their business and leave and who knows how long that will take. First of all I don't get paid past 5:00pm and second of all, I do have my own life and schedule and would like to get home to my own family. I just don't get these people who can't get here before close and think we should just wait around for them at risk of being late for own activities. We are open for 8 hours every day and I am here for 9 hours. I want to go home!"
1,"The lady who learned (but probably didn’t) why sometimes the answer is no


Yesterday, our custodian went home early and didn’t clean the customer bathroom. There was no soap, no toilet paper, and it was a mess. We don’t have the keys to open the toilet paper holder or soap, so we just closed the bathroom until she could come in again. Most people just went to the store next door to use their bathroom, but this one woman wasn’t having it.

After our fitting room attendant first told her the bathroom was closed, she decided to go around the store and ask four different people if she could use the bathroom until one of the cashiers, who didn’t know that we had closed it, let her use it.

She took a step inside, then actually came back out to complain to the manager that the bathroom was “unacceptable” and that “somebody needed to attend to it before they let people use it”

The manager explained to her that the reason we kept saying no to her initially was because we didn’t have the means to clean it, but rather than listen she just stormed out to the store next door.

Interestingly enough, in the time it took her to ask everyone if she could use ours, then complain, she could have walked over to the other store and use theirs."
2,"“He purposefully stepped on my sunglasses”


Okay so I’m at work and im walking behind this guy with his kid in his shoulders, kid knocks off the guys sunglasses, they slide under my foot and I crush them. 

Obviously this is an accident and I pick them up and apologize a million times. The whole time he just stares at the glasses, I hand them back and continue doing my job.

He asks for my manager and tells him that I purposefully broke his glasses. My manager puts him in his place. “Listen, I know my employee, he would not, for any reason, do something like that. Now we can check security footage or you can tell me how you think this happened.”
The upset sunglasses man admitted he dropped them. 

They weren’t even nice sunglasses. "
