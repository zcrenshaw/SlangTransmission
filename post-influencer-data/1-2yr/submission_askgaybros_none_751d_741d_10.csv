"Important reminder to all about the eclipse


Don't stare at the sun without eye protection.


Also, your straight crush becomes bicurious under the darkness of a eclipse."
"Why I like topping. (How about you?)


So there's been a bunch of posts about how awesome bottoming is over topping.  So this is why I like topping so much.  For me, topping isn't about the orgasm or my dick primarily.  It's three major things:

The athletic aspect.  Once I get into a rhythm, it's a runner's high.  Combined with the sex, it's like when you meditate or when you dance.  There's nothing but the rhythm and instinct.

The pleasure-giving aspect.  Putting a guy who really likes getting fucked into that howling grunting totally losing his shit state is hella fun to do and hella fun to watch.  

The psychological aspect.  I'm inside him.  Literally.  *My cock is inside his body*.  I'm owning that ass.  It's mine.  I'm violating him.  Gonna shoot my jizz right inside him right where it belongs.  Fuck.  Words fail for this one probably... you've either felt that and know what I mean or you haven't.

I'm curious... do you bottom-only guys not get any of those?  "
"First time hitting on someone in real life and he's my teacher


For my background, I'm currently working in Montreal. Since my French level is quite limited, I've been taking French classes after work during the week. However, this semester, because of my late registration, the only time slot available was Saturday morning which was such a bummer. Who would want to wake up early to go to class at weekend ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

However, my mind changed completely the moment I saw my teacher. He is a gorgeous dude with insanely beautiful smile. I was stunned and totally lost my concentration in my first class lol. Never before i had been remotely attracted to any of my teachers. Every class after that has become a lot more enjoyable.

It was the first time that i decided to hit on someone in real life( just started opened up myself to gay stuff not long ago). In order to test the water, i dropped a hint in an essay for him about how great it is to be gay in Montreal. He put a smiley face at that paragraph. Not much to deduce from that but i guessed it was not a bad sign :p.

So today on my final exam, i put up the courage and slipped him a note when submitting my paper saying that I find him very cute, invite him for a coffee with my phone number on it. It was nerve-wracking as hell and i just went straight home after that (⇀‸↼‶)

While i was on the bus, he texted me saying he was happy to receive my note, and he also find me attractive as well. The problem is that he's out of town till next week and then he'll be traveling to another country (not US)to work for a whole year.   (￣ ³￣) So he told me our coffee session will have to wait a year unless i visit that country. 

Oh well i didn't expect my first experience to be a success anyway, at least i got a new friend on Facebook, it's better than regretting not making my move at all.

Tl;dr I hit on my French teacher, it wasn't a success but not a failure either lol.

 Update 1: saw some kinda intimate photos of him with a guy on Facebook. So i ditched the guessing game and asked him last night whether if he has a boyfriend (2 birds 1 stone i know :D). Turned out they were together, but not anymore. Oh boy dis gunna be gud :)

"PSA: Open Relationships aren't the go to solution when you're having issues in your relationship


I noticed whenever a gay couple is having issues in their relationship. The first thing they want to do is have an Open Relationship or ""take a break"" (aka fuck other people.) NEWSFLASH. that's not going to fix your dying relationship."
"Let's talk about blow jobs. Why do guys you meet off grindr basically attack your dick like a pissed off horny vacuum cleaner?


Ok so I've noticed this a few times now. A lot of guys I've been with who are really into giving head just can't give a blow job. They'll make these intense sucking and slurping noises and bob their head up and down like a piston at 8000 rpms. Why? Why? Why are you being so goddamn aggressive? 

Its not enjoyable my fellow gays. When you attack the penis with your mouth and make these slurping noises like a methed out gorilla eating soup, you end up just hitting the dick with your teeth repeatedly. You gotta be tender and gentle, sensual.

I just don't get it guys? They have penises too like would you want your dick just ambushed like that? This aggressive blowjob thing needs to stop among gays. "

"I stared at the solar eclipse today with no eye protection...


Should I get tested?"
"Is being ok with a simple non ambitious life ok?


Me and my bf both want simple lives with a non ambitious lifestyle. We are passionate about doing good so we want to be teachers. We are both ok being average to overweight  in shape, and try to get 2hrs of excercise a week. We don't care about fancy cars or looking too good , etc. is this ok?

Should add : my parents are disappointed that I'm not ambitious but idk I've never been ambitious I enjoy being kinda lazy except when it comes to helping people, then I can work hard "
"Does anyone else find women's bodies to be aesthetically pleasing, even if there is no sexual attraction?


I don't think I am sexually attracted to girls, since nearly every time I hooked up with one I had trouble getting an erection. However I still will check out girls in public and really appreciate a good looking girl or woman. Not in the ""I wanna fuck her..."" way but more in like an artistic way. I guess the word is that I am PHYSICALLY attracted to women even if not sexually attracted to them."
"What's the stupidest questions a straight person has ever asked you about being gay?


For me it was, ""do bottoms fart near tops to let them know that they're ready for sex? Like a gay pheromone?"" 

I'm 99% sure he was joking. As stupid as that question was, kudos on originality."
"Complete bottom switches to dominant top when stoned


Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I invited a guy over from grindr, who's profile said he's a complete bottom. I fucked him, and he had the feminine moan, everything. We get stoned, and after a while, we're horny again and he asks to top me. I agree, and he got pretty dominant, saying stuff like ""Good boy... you like having me in you, don't you?""

I'm not complaining at all (I'm a switch) but I just found it interesting that he could switch so much after smoking some weed."
