"I'm The Kid Who Drew Dicks in Superbad - AMA


Hey,
My name's Casey Margolis and I was in a few movies that you might've heard of such as Superbad and The Hangover. I've been able to meet and work with people like Samuel L. Jackson, Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Bradley Cooper, Ariel Winter, Jonah Hill, the director of Space Jam, and some other cool people.

Ask me anything.

Stepping away for the night, feel free to keep asking questions, I’ll be back to finish up tomorrow!

**UPDATE NEXT MORNING**
Alright guys, it’s been fun! I’m gonna actually step back from this AMA now. Feel free to reach out on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/caseymargolis or Instagram: @caseymargolis

Thanks for the time, y’all!"

"I’m a 24 year old girl. Last year, my 10 year old brother moved in with me. Ask me anything.


I’m a 24 year old girl, in graduate school, living in the same city in the Pacific Northwest where I’ve lived my whole life. Last year, my parents made the decision, for various reasons, to move across the country. Rather than uproot him and drag him along, everyone agreed it made more sense for my brother to come live with me. It’s been a year now and so far it’s been awesome. Ask me anything about me, him, us, our living situation, etc!"
"I am a Puerto Rican that just went 82 days without power!! AMA!


My suburbs lost electrical power on September 6, with hurricane Irma.  Just got power back today, still pretty surreal."

"I (unlike the recent BS ""Yufi"" post) have Schizoaffective Disorder. AMA


I am a long-time lover/lurker of Reddit, but after reading a recent AMA about a person who is making a mockery of mental illness, I decided to answer any questions Reddit has for someone that has actually been clinically diagnosed with this Schizoaffective Disorder, and has dealt with some of the symptoms. Post in question: [Bullshyt Story 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/7e53lg/i_am_a_person_with_schizoaffective_disorder_my/) 

Also I drew some cool [shyt](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuaqGIcWAAEuZHl.jpg:large) when I was having psychosis

"I am mute. AMA!


Edit: It's close to Midnight here, and I've got work in the morning. Goodnight, everybody! I will return after work tomorrow and answer any additional questions you may have. Please check to see if I've already answered it before you post it, that would be a very nice thing to do. Thank you again, Reddit!"
