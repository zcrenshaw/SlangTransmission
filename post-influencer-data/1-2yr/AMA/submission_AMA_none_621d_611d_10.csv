"AMA Former Phone Sex Operator


This topic came up on r/politics of all places. The demand lead me to believe an AMA was in order. I worked there for about 7 months before I just couldn't take it anymore. My non-disclosure agreement has timed out so I can freely answer questions.

Edit: I'll put one more weird story here. One of my most heart breaking regulars was a man who was severely intellectually disabled. (Thank you, u/thelurkingcat for the phrasing tip. They're cool, guys. I used the word ""ignorance"" first.) You could tell he was just very very lonely. Tearing up thinking about him...but then I remember I also had to end every call with him talking about how I love to be fucked by horses and a lot of extremely detailed talk about the logistics of it. (..a lot of amateurs don't realize you have to get their cock inside of you *before* it's completely hard.  Once it starts to flare out at the end at fully erect you're not getting it in there...) I hate horses and no - never done that.

Edit 2: Hoo boy this is fun and sad at the same time. I need to go to bed. I hadn't thought that much about Pink Sparkle Pony in years. It's very...bittersweet is a good word. You know how it physically feels when you know someone hurts and you really want to give them a hug? Your elbows get tense and you feel your biceps wishing they could will your arms open. That's how I feel about Pink Sparkle Pony. I have trouble explaining my emotions, sometimes. This is my main, keep asking questions. I hate getting to a sweet comment/post party only to find out OP was a throwaway and I'm too late. I have a lot of fun stories from that job, it was a strange world and it turned out to be nothing like I expected with one or two exceptions. "
