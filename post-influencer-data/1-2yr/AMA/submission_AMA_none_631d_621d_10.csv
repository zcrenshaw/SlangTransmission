"I live in Puerto Rico, and I've been 116 days without power, AMA.


Lost power a day before hurricane Irma passed  us by. Most of the sectors around my area have been reestablished, but apparently there is now talks about ""pockets"", within the communities,  who might have to wait until February (minimum),  to see any hint of power restoration."

"I’m an investor in Litecoin and have made $8 after having one for a couple hours and am unqualified to offer financial advice. AMA!


I don’t know anything about investing but I did get like $8 within the past few hours so I’m pretty much an expert. I will give enthusiastic but completely ignorant answers to any and all investment questions.

Update: just checked and it’s actually gone down to $7.50... I blame millennials

Update 2: so Litecoin went down a bit. I’m now out $16. It’s millennials again."
"I had to testify in court against a 40 year old woman and close family friend who turned out to be a pedophile. AMA!


When I was 17 I started spending more time with a family friend we had known for a while but never been particularly close to, an early 40s woman who had a 10 year old son and a husband. She was incredibly charismatic and kind, and she was very generous to me during a difficult period in my adolescence. My parents were grateful for the help and happily sent me over to spend the night there and do things with her frequently. She had a friend who had a teenage son, age 16. She was kind of a mentor/mother figure towards him and she wanted me to be his friend as well. I became very close with them both, and things got super weird. Soon enough she was having the three of us all sleep in the same bed together. When I turned 18 she took me to a strip club and had me dance at an amateur night. 

Eventually she revealed to me that she had been having sex with the teenage boy since he was 15 and made me promise not to tell anyone. Things got rapidly stranger at scarier at that point. She told me she felt like she was a 17 year old girl trapped in an aging body and performed strip routines for both of us. Here's the catch; the boy had a big crush on me, and we started dating a bit later. She was so jealous that she became incredibly scary and manipulative and tried to turn my own family and all my friends against me by convincing everyone that I was a compulsive liar with a personality disorder, possibly to discredit me in case I decided to turn on her. Eventually I came clean about what had been going on, and an adult in my life made a legal report. A few months later I came to terms with the fact that she had been grooming me and was clearly a predator and later had to testify about my experiences in court. 

It was an incredibly bizarre experience with all sorts of twists and turns that gave me a close look at how even seemingly great people can be predators and pedophiles come in all sorts of surprising forms. AMA! "
