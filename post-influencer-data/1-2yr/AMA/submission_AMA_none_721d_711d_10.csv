"I own a legitimate copy of WinRAR: AMA.


Hey all!

I've owned a legit copy of WinRAR for a few years now, and it has had nothing but a positive impact on my life. I'll be answering as many questions as I can. Please don't be discouraged if I'm unable to get to yours.

UPDATE:

I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this AMA. It's getting late, but I'll try to be back answering questions in the morning. 

Don't forget to check out my new Netflix special on HBO. Available in bookstores now!"
"Potential AMA. My great grandmother is 97 and enjoys telling stories. Any interest?


As the title said my great grandmother is 97 years old and loves to talk to anyone that will listen. Would there be any interest in an AMA where I ask here your questions and type it all out? She's lived her whole life in Texas if any of that matters."
"I worked in a brothel and as a high class escort for 5 years. AMA


I'm a 28 year old who is now training to be a lawyer. I was a straight A student who studied classical piano and came from a good, supportive family. For 5 years I was working first in a brothel, then for a high class escort agency, offering incall and outcall services. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. "
