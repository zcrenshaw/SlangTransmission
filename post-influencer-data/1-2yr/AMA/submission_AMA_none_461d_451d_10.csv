I’m not a doctor so I can’t really answer any “medical questions” so to speak. I can’t diagnose anyone so if you do ask me something along those lines I’ll suggest you call your MD. And if I don’t know the answer I’m not gonna billshit you. I’ll tell you I don’t know. If it’s simple enough I’ll look it up and explain it, but if it’s more complicated then I may tell you to ask your MD. "

"I spent a year in a Bangkok prison. AMA!


Hello fellow redditors. 

I am doing this AMA because every time I mention it I get bombarded with questions and requests to do an AMA or TIFU. People always tell me I should write about it in some form or other. But it’s only fairly recently that I’ve been okay to talk about this openly. I mean I was pretty fucked up for a good 6 months after getting home, mentally and physically. Also I don’t know where to start with it and I struggle to put it in any kind of context and timeframe because I was completely fucked up on Valium for years. I’ve been doing really well recently and I can pretty much just look back on it and laugh about it now. But also remind myself of the shocking lesson it really did teach me. What an absolute debacle. The ultimate debacle and hopefully my last. Plus it’s pretty unique story I guess. I mean how many people do you know that have let 3 ladyboys wash their body in a shower in a prison in Bangkok? Go on... I’ll wait. 

Seeing as today is the 1 year anniversary of my release I guess it’s time to write this story out. 

I’ll give you the TIFU and then I’ll answer any question you have in the comments. That’s the easiest way to get it out of me I guess. 

**TIFU by being a reprobate in Thailand and getting sent to prison for a year.**

The story really started a few years prior. I won’t bore you with that but it was a bad breakup which led me down the road to a nasty benzo addiction (with a cocktail of the a-z of drugs). It was pretty dark and to those unfortunate people that know what that’s like you know how depraved it can get. I was ruining my life day after day and getting arrested for to stupidest shit. One year I was in court 24 separate times that year. Totally out of character behaviour which I brought on myself. There’s at least one news article about me out there...

Eventually my brother dragged me up to London to live with him. He kept a keen eye on me and eventually I got a job at a wood yard. It was doing kind of alright for a while. I was clean and earning money. Then I got told I need to take my 12 days holiday before June or I’d lose it. Well it was my birthday at the end of May so I though ‘well fuck spending a shitty expensive night in London with none of my friends, imma go to Thailand for 2 weeks’. 

I’ve been to Thailand a few times, It’s a very familiar place to me. Particularly Koh Samui, so I booked a ticket and off I went! 

I had a blast. A really good time, rented a nice Suzuki csr250 and just cruised around a tropical island all days . Volunteered at a monkey sanctuary and every morning I would drive there and [feed 13 baby monkeys.](https://imgur.com/gallery/UQ31m9v) Then spend the morning grooming and socialising with them. I mean you can’t really get better than that?

I also took 10 tabs of acid and 3 grams of coke with me but that’s a story for another day. I will say tripping balls on the side of a mountain with fireworks is pretty sick. 

So the time came to go home. I had the coach booked, at this point I couldn’t afford a plane ticket from Koh Samui to Bangkok airport (oh yeah I also got robbed by a bunch of drug dealers). So I got a coach which was cheap and also pretty empty. I claimed the entire back row. I should mention at this point that because I’m a fucking madman I had booked my return flight to land at Heathrow at 6am... I had work that day at 8am. So I was determined to just sleep sleep sleep. 

On the coach I met a Kiwi dude. We got chatting and at one point he said “dude I’ve got a bunch of Valium if that will help?”. I just though ‘perfect! That’s exactly what I need!’. I bought a strip off him (10 pills) and took a few. 

I slept the entire 14hr journey and the kiwi guy woke me up saying “man you slept to whole way!”. I think it was then that I bought a few more strips off him, you know, because of that addictive personality thing. When I got to the airport I realised I was 14hrs early. Damn, no idea how I fucked that up but shit, I gotta sleep!

I tried to find somewhere suitable to sleep, I wondered around for ages while popping more Valium. I think I passed out for a bit but eventually I was hungry. I had a tiny bit of Thai baht on me and nothing else. I got lunch and here’s their kicker: I had a few Changs (Thai beer). Now alcohol and Valium = blackout. That’s when I would wake up in police cells, or in hospital, or in a hospital handcuffed to the bed with 2 police officers in the room, or maybe even in your own bed with a broken nose covered in dried blood and your own shit. 

Yeah... it ain’t a good combo. Would not recommend. At this point I’ve taken about 14 10mg pills. So I’m pretty out of it, I check in and entered the departure lounge and just basically wondered around. Tried blagging my way into all the VIP lounges, you know standard debauchery. 

I don’t really remember the event honestly but went into a duty free and walked out with a basket of cigarettes, whiskey and aftershave as you do. I mean I didn’t even know where I was and probably couldn’t tell you my name in that state. 90 minutes to my flight....

I walked away Scott free and I remembered realising what I’d done. I sat on a seat and shoved the 2 cartons of cigarettes,2 bottles of aftershave and bottle of whiskey in my bag. I was kind of worried at that point and starting looking for a place to hide. I wandered around looking for somewhere to chill and I ended up lost. I approached female member of staff and asked her when x was. She got straight on her Walkie talkie and told me to wait there. Oh no, I’ve been rumbled. 

This wasn’t my first rodeo, in England I’ve got away with all sorts by blagging my way out of it. Plus in England I’d just be given a fine or a night in a cell. And because I was fucking high on Valium I didn’t give a shit. Before I knew it there were 3 police officers (2 on segways) surrounding me. All armed with big shiny revolvers. 

Now I’m describing this situation as an outsider. It’s really hazy this whole point. But they searched my bag after a bit of reluctance on my part and low and behold: a bunch of cigarettes and aftershave with KING POWER stickers on them (the king part will be relevant later). 

I got straight on the phone to the embassy. They called my mother and we were going to arrange getting the money sent to pay for the goods. That’s all they wanted and I could leave and go home. Thy wanted Western Union payment. Okay, that’s weird but we’ll do it that way. Oh what’s this? The western Union shop is closed now??! Well that’s not an option then (My only one). 

So they gave me 20 minutes to pay or be arrested. 20 minutes came around and that was it. Handcuffs on and off we go. Remember this whole time I didn’t a give a single fuck about what was going on. Still smiling, still happy. I was expecting a stern warning or a fine or whatever. I’ve talked myself out of worse. 

I couldn’t have been more wrong. I was put in a holding cell at the airport. Had a nice meal, the nicest one I would have for the next year. Then I was transferred to a police cell. [Here are some pictures of my arrest,](https://imgur.com/gallery/jKIQ3yB) and some pictures on the cell. I was shitposting on reddit the whole time. People were offering to bail me out. A guy actually sent me a WesternUnion payment for the money but I couldn’t retrieve it. He wanted dick pics in return, I shit you not. If you’re reading this dude... thank you and holy shit I owe you some dick pics! I only just remembered this as I’m typing it. Shows how much I’d blocked out of just plain forgot! 

Some people reading this will know who I am. A bunch of people from a certain subreddit actually found out who I was somehow and were in contact with the embassy. They were trying to get me a lawyer or bail or whatever. The embassy wouldn’t allow contact without my explicit permission. But I didn’t know any of this until I got home. Proper /r/humansbeingbros shit. But I digress...

Off I went the next morning to Samut Prakan prison. They can hold you for 84 days without charging you (which the will do unless you post bail). And you go to court every 12 days. They put you in heavy chains *literally 12mm thick steel shackles **hammered** onto your ankles which you wear for an entire day* and you wait all day in a disgusting waiting room that hasn’t been clean, ever. I thought I was honestly going to die on one of those journeys. They crammed us back on the bus after spending an entire day in a shit infested room full of recently arrested (tweaking) cretins. In 35 degree heat they just left us crammed into a bus while they watched a soap opera on tv right in front of us. People were passing out around me and I’ve never excreted that much sweat in my entire life. We had to fucking scream at the guards to just come and turn the fucking engine on so we can have air con and not die. 

Fortunately (?) the embassy got me a good lawyer but they’re not able to bail you out unless you have a shit ton of money. In my case about £7500. The embassy said if you can get bail... just leave the fucking country and don’t ever come back. I had a really hot translator who was a young intern/student who was rooting for me like mad. She turned to me once and said “I steal all the time!”. She cried when I was sentenced, it was well emotional actually now that I think about it. 

Anyway I’m rambling on, this is my problem about telling this story...

My sentence was 2 years, which is cut in half to 1 if you accept your sentence. Appeals take 9 months minimum (usually over a year) so your best bet is to just accept your fate and get on with it. 

That’s the TIFU. I’ll leave the rest of the questions up to you. 

You can ask me about the conditions, the legal system, the corruption, the people I met, the food, the sleeping arrangements or those prison-hardened ladyboys. 

I’ll do my best to answer all your questions. Unfortunately today is also my grandfathers wake. It’s a big family gathering so I’m probably going to be telling this story irl all day too. Bare with me.

"My ""Pack of Dogs"" playing cards went viral on reddit a year ago today. I'm here to say ""thanks"". AMA


I'm an artist living in California. I woke up on a Sunday last year and after checking my email, thought I'd been hacked. Every one of them was an order for my deck of cards ([https://www.artiphany.com/products/pack\-of\-dogs\-playing\-cards](https://www.artiphany.com/products/pack-of-dogs-playing-cards)) and it all started in some tiny corner of the reddit universe, spreading over time to 60 different countries.. From a spark to an inferno and it just kept going. It's been a life transforming event for me and allowed me to grow my business beyond the small operation it had been.  I wanted to drop in and thank anyone out there who was part of it.  best, john"
