"I have Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder)


In addition to having Dissociative Identity Disorder, I also have Bachelors in Psychology and I am a handful of credits short of my Masters in Counseling Psychology. (As it turns out, having a severe mental illness makes it a bit difficult to succeed academically at the masters level.)

I'd be happy to answer questions about my personal experiences living with DID as well as answer questions about the psychology, myths, and misconceptions of DID. "
