"I am Youtuber Boogie2988. 10 year Youtube entertainer. I recently received gastric bypass surgery to save my life. Ask me anything!


EDIT:  Okay, looks like posts are starting to slow down and my fingers are tired so I'll take a quick break.  Thanks for all of the questions.  I'll try to check back later to see if I missed any questions and try to answer a few more.  Thanks again for caring!  While I have your attention, let me say one thing I have learned.  Take care of your health.  Without it you have nothing.  I can speak from experience!

Many of you may know me better as my lisping, raging character francis.  You've probably seen my table flip gif or one of my facebook or youtube videos that went viral.

I have had a youtube channel for about a decade and you can find it here.  I talk about video games, I do rants and rages as my character francis, and I've talked quite a lot about my physical and mental health problems over the years as well.

"My mom died when I was 20, so I adopted my two teenage siblings. It's been the most intense, emotional, and fulfilling decision of my life. AMA!


I went looking a lot for information on this particular family dynamic when my brothers (14 and 15 at the time) moved in with me, and I couldn't find anyone talking about being in this situation. Plus people always seem to have a lot of questions when I mention my story. So I figured I would do this, if not to at least let one other person know they aren't alone. "
