"I’m a 21 yo Male who had a roommate who tried murdering me and my friend one night, AMA!


A little backstory. I go to Ohio State university. When I was 19 I moved to Columbus with a friend and a person I met from my first year of classes. One night after a little smoke session (no nothing was laced we all were drug tested afterwards) my roommate was acting weird. He said he was “going towards the light” and that either “he was going to kill us or we were going to kill him” then he said yeah sorry I’m tripping and said he was going to bed. A minute passed and we started playing fifa and were talking about what happened when the guy sprints downstairs, jumps on us with a knife in his hand, and stabbed me friend in the head. After I first fought him off of my friend and wrestling the knife away from him the cops showed up. I do have proof if needed (a few pictures of my friends head, also caught the whole thing on video which helped the judge give him a more harsh sentence) thanks!

EDIT: until I find out if I can get into any trouble for posting the video, here is a copy of the court record https://imgur.com/6rDpDOn"
"Two guys ""revenge porn""-ed me when I was 16. AMA!


So when I was 16 I got wrecked and had a 3some with two guys. Unbeknownst to me the rear end of the spit roast was filming it on his phone. 

When I let them know I wasn't up for round 2 they told me they had it on tape and they would show everyone. I was about 90% confident they were all talk.

Couple of weeks later everyone in my friendship circle had revenge porn of me on their phone.


I'm now 27.
Ask me anything!

**Edit to add:**I didn't go to the police. I didn't want my mom to find out, on top of which I would have felt far too embarrassed to go to the police and talk to adults about some stupid situation I'd got myself into, especially as it involved sex. 

I saw the guys a couple of times a few years afterwards and they always seemed pretty sheepish, which felt pretty satisfying! But just shows why minors are classed as vulnerable... I didn't really have the wherewithal to stand up to myself and get justice."
