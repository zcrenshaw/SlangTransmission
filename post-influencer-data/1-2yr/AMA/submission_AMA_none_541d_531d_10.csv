"Anyone else randomly get hit with very strong feelings of depression every once and a while?


Today has been very bad for me. Anger, feeling very very low, thoughts of suicide, 0 energy and lack of interest. Hasn't been this bad in a long time. It'll pribably go away by tomorrow but i was just curious if this happened to anyone else."

"I was given a single letter first name 'U'. AMA


Life is hard for people with single letter first names. We get insulted by online forms on a daily basis, calling our names invalid.

I can only fly on select airlines cuz some airlines *cough*British airways*cough* don't allow me to check in online.

I had to get credit agencies to link U&lt;space&gt;, U., U-, UU, UUU to my file cuz that's how I usually handle online applications for credit"

"I’m a 17 year old girl. Me and my 11 year old brother live alone due to strange parental circumstances. Ask me anything!


Hey! I’m Jen. My little brother and I have lived on our own for the past year. Our parents are divorced and for the past few years I’d been living with our mom and he’d been living with our dad. Our dad is out of the picture now for a variety of reasons. When all that transpired, my brother moved in with my mom and me. But our mom’s job has taken her overseas - she’s almost always abroad. So for the past year, it’s basically been just the two of us. Ask me anything about me, him, us, our living situation, etc! "
