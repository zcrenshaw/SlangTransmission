"6 months ago I was consuming a gram of meth a day intravenously, today I am 6 months clean and sober and life has never looked better. AMA


Posting this for those who are struggling and want to stop. Maybe my story can help.

I got into drugs and alcohol at 18, I was hopelessly insecure, and it gave me connection and escape that I desperately wanted. Party drugs and the party scene were my weekends and I kept it together just enough to maintain a career in finance. Things got steadily worse to the point I was pretty lost at 29, and going nowhere.

I got a woman pregnant, it scared the shit out of me. Enough to get clean and sober, that was hard, but I got through. 9 months into my sons life I didn’t have my medicine, and my crippling self doubt and spiritual sickness was still there. My sons Mum is an addict, I’m battling for custody, my Mum takes her life, I’m not coping, but I have a son.

I turned to Valium and became addicted to that. Outwardly things got better, I had a great relationship with my son, was a pretty good dad, career started going well, but inwardly I was fragile, insecure, and full of resentment and fear.

Fast forward to 38, I have money, a 6 figure salary, I’m fit, beautiful new girlfriend, my drug problem was a thing of my 20’s, I’ll just keep taking Valium and these demons and existential dread will go away eventually.

I get a call from my ex-girlfriend telling me she’s pregnant, I crack. I start doing cocaine as a rebellion, just on weekends. That’s ok for a few weeks, but then it creeps into my work week. A friend re-introduces me to meth, that’s once a fortnight when I don’t have my son. Then it’s during the week. 6 months later, I’ve lost my career, I’m $50k in debt, I’ve pushed away my family and friends, turned my back on my son who I loved more than anything (at least I thought).  I’m dealing meth to strangers to support my habit, I’m 15 kgs under weight, known to police, no money for rent, regular panic attacks thinking about my son. I don’t care if I die, and I almost did several times

Today I have both my kids back in my life 4 days a week, I have a new found self esteem, I’m working, and I feel genuine hope that my life can be filled with connection and purpose. It’s all because I have found recovery rather than sobriety. I’m so grateful, but I 100% know it’s for anything who wants it

"My girlfriend of 5 years just found out she is pregnant. Too bad it isnt mine. AMA

"I introduced an ex to gaming to spend more time with her, she dumped me for a guy she met online on a game.


So due to my previous gaming addiction, I \(26M at the time\) used to spend most of my free time playing online. I started feeling bad that my GF \(28F, lived together for 5 yrs\) and I weren't spending enough time together, so I convinced her to game with me. Well, she met a guy gaming that flirted with her and made her a member of his gaming team and sent her gift points and ended up chatting with her late into the night about gaming strategies. eventually she fell for his incessant flirting and he convinced her to dump me and move in with him. Apparently there are lots of very desperate single guys online who won't think twice ruining someone else's relationship that's been worked on for years, just to hook up with a cute girl. And cute she was.

And she broke up with me. When I asked her why, she casually told me she met someone on the game i introduced her to. I think I was more disgusted than I was angry . She then hooked up with him on a summer\-long fling while I spent the most miserable couple of months I had spent in my life so far. He ended up dumping her after using her for sex and realizing he didn't want her as a GF. She moved in with her parents and she's back to being single. Just a word of warning to other gamers out there starting to date."
