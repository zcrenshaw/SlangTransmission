"Left an abusive engagement 1 month before the wedding. ~3 years later, I have my first ever apartment on my own, financially independent, confident and happier than ever. AMA!


Throwaway for privacy reasons, and I apologize for the formatting. 

I got engaged at 19 years old to, who I then believed, was the love of my life. He and I had been friends since we were about 15 and were in love all the while. 

It wasn’t until I was 19 that we moved in together, started dating and dived (regrettably) immediately into our engagement. We knew we were in love, what could go wrong? 

We began exploring Christianity together. He and I were both non religious people, but felt spiritually unsatisfied and started with what we felt like would be the easiest religion to explore. We read the Bible, went to a Pentecostal church weekly (sometimes twice a week) and for a while, things were nice. We took a lot of positivity from the Bible and used it’s teachings to become kinder, more patient and giving people. Well, I did at least. 

My fiancé became warped. He started using Christianity against me saying the man was the head of the household and the woman was there to support his decisions. I went with it. Foolishly, I believed him. Moving forward, he became jealous and started using this mindset to force me into containment. 

We lived with his mother &amp; stepdad, sister and her girlfriend. His jealousy was subtle at first. He would ask why I lingered around his sisters girlfriend so long chatting (as he knew I used to be interested in women briefly in my even younger years), and why I would hang out with his stepdad while we were both in the house. Little things like that. Truly, I never did anything inappropriate. It was mostly me existing in communal areas with other household members that stirred him. 

Then it grew. Eventually, he’d become upset if I asked someone where something was in the grocery store. He would think I was interested in them and ask if I thought they were attractive. Then it further grew to his friends. He’d ask why I spoke to them while they were at the house or why I’d look at them. After time, I’d just lock myself in the room if anyone was home. Sometimes, if he left the room and didn’t close the door, he’d get angry and ask why I didn’t close it. He thought I purposefully left it open to make eye contact with other people. 

Of course these fights were more than just verbal. It was small stuff at first there too. The fights got mean, he’d call me crazy, slutty, other degrading things. Then, he would slam doors, push me out of the way, throw things. Finally, it got violent. He’s slammed my fingers in doors, torn art pieces from my favorite artists, destroyed my journals, smacked me, tackled me, pushed my head into a wall (and it went through the wall). But stupidly, I didn’t leave. 

Things got worse. He began to suspect I was romantically interested in my cousin because he sat by me at a funeral, and that I was interested in my sisters boyfriend because I complimented his tattoo. 

I didn’t have a job most of the relationship. I started working at Target, but when I didn’t reply to his texts while working, he showed up and made a scene about me being a whore and I was fired. I never tried getting another job after that. I had no friends. I had no phone or social media. I couldn’t even speak to my family without interrogation. Eventually his mom moved out, and his sisters friend moved in which only caused more problems for me because of his jealous and paranoia. 

During all of this, his interest in Christianity warped into something truly disgusting. He would incorporate religion into conspiracy theories. He’d stay up on my laptop all night researching different species of aliens and watching YouTube and learning about the Illuminati and the US government. He wouldn’t sleep for days it seemed. 

The day I left, I was sitting in bed texting my sister using a Texting App hooked up to our WiFi. She was sick and my fiancé was suspecting things. He thought it wasn’t really my sister and I was texting a lover. Mind you, I was never out of my fiancé’s sight. For some reason, THAT is what made me quit. I couldn’t even speak to my sister without trouble. He went on a walk and I quickly called my sister to have her come get me. He caught me packing my things and kicked my ass. He broke a lot of my things and at one point threw me against an opened closet door so hard that I had a bruised, long rectangle down my back for three weeks. 

I was picked up and I never looked back. The day I left his house, I was 103 lbs (5’2” btw). I hadn’t eaten often due to the lack of a job and ate other people’s leftovers when they didn’t want them or scrounged up change for fruit and veggies at a produce stand nearby. 

Fast forward to now: 

I’m 23. I’ve been at my job for a little over 2 years and I love it. I’m in a leadership position and make good money. I have my own apartment and 2 fat cats. I have a boyfriend now who I truly love, who is kind and fun and everything I’ve never had. 

Ultimately, I am happier than I ever have been in my life. Right now, I’m sitting in a rocking chair I bought today on the porch, late at night and enjoying the sound of the creaking wood and crickets. 

For those of you who stuck through this mess of a story, thank you. I think I’m ready to truly drop that part of my life and never look back. I’m confident, happy and unweighted by this. I was thinking an AMA might be a great way for me to go out with a bang. Thank you all so much. 

TL;DR- My fiancé lost his mind. Became abusive, physically and mentally. I had no life beyond him, and managed to escape it, this creating a better life for myself.
