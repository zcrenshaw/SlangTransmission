0,"Unpopular Opinion: The smell of weed ruins everything :/


Let me just preface to say that I'm in the legalize camp, but DAMN. 

Enjoying a gorgeous day on a park bench? Sorry, won't last long. The smell of rotting skunk is happy to end that nice moment.

Just moved into a beautiful apartment on the UWS.  Sorry, you can't enjoy it! Why? Because someone doesn't give a shit about anyone else and is fine with stinking the entire place up and making sure you can't sleep! Lol, nice try! 

Walking 5 feet in any direction in this city without walking into a skunk's nest?  Lol, sorry. Can't. 

Look, I know this is very unpopular because people on this site are obsessed with pot, but the smell is killing me.  And now it's almost summer.....

Anyway, what do you think?

1,"What are some video game style ""achievements"" that New Yorkers can unlock?


Some of my ideas:

*All the Live Long Day* Ride every subway line 

*Coast Coasting* Drive across a suspension bridge without using the breaks (only available from 5:30 am to 10:00 pm) 

*Busy Bee* Visit every borough within a 24 hour period

*Air Support* Fly into or out of LGA, JFK, and EWR

*Island Hopping* Visit Roosevelt Island, City Island, Coney Island, Governer's Island, Ward's/Randall's Island, Ellis Island, and Liberty Island

*All the Live Long Day II* Use Metro North, Amtrak, PATH, SIR, LIRR, and NJT 

*The Tunnels of not-quite-that-much-love* Drive or ride through the Holland, Lincoln, Brooklyn Battery, and Midtown Tunnels

*We Should Be Moving Shortly* spend at least 10 minutes underground between stations without moving

*Just the Tops* Visit the Top of the Rock, Top of the World, Empire State Building Observatory, 30 Hudson Yards Observatory (when it opens) and Queens Pavillion

*New New York* Ride the second Avenue Subway, visit 34th St Hudson Yards, WTC PATH Terminal, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Hudson Yards, Hudson River Greenway, Long Island City Waterfront, and Barclays Center. 

*Big 4* Attend at least one NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB game. 

*Warm Welcome* Get scammed out of at least $20. 

How many have you gotten? What are some others you can think of?

2,"How to make a positive ""complaint"" about a bus driver who stood up to a gay badger?


EDIT: GAY BASHER, not badger. Autocorrect is awful and I ou can't edit titles. Fml.

My partner and I (both women) were on a bus and the guy in front of us looked over his shoulder and gave us a weird look while we were talking about something lgbtq and Passover related. He starts talking about how homosexuality is a sin and ""taken care of"" in his county to the woman next to him and his young grandson in front of him. He gets louder and louder and more and more graphic about the ""abominable"" things men and women do to each other and how these ""sick"" people talk about God with the same mouths they use to lick cunts.

He was getting louder and louder until the bus driver told him to stop talking or get off the bus.

Of course the dude keeps shouting and starts verbally attacking the driver accusing him of being a ""faggot"" and telling him that he should ""go to prison to get pregnant"" (male driver, so assume reference to prison rape). And it got uglier.

I really appreciated the driver intervening because I was too scared to say anything (it's NYC, you don't look crazy in the eye; also the guy had been bragging about how he evaded ACS to smack around his kids when he was younger, and I'm no about to get popped in the face).

So, like, is there any way to call somewhere and be like ""this driver is a good driver, please give him a raise or a paid day off or an employee of the month certificate or something""?"
