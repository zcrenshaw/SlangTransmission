2,"Have you ever been struck by the way the subway woman pronounces certain phrases?


I ride the f train often.


""The next stop is Jay St - Metrotech"". The way she reads ""Metrotech"" is so playful and flirty, I always feel that she means something by it.

There's also the pregnant pause between ""Delancey St"" and ""Essex St"".

Also, the way the N (etc) train reads ""NYU"" in ""8th st - NYU"". Like, you would be perceived as a strange person if you talk to an NYU person and reads it like that every time.

What boat you?
