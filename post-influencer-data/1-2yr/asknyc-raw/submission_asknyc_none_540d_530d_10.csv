1,"Newly homeless, looking for advice


Hello fellow NYers.

A little background on me.

I just turned 33 years old and have been having a rough go of things for the last few weeks.

I had been in a residential drug treatment facility in the Bronx since late October. I was due to complete the program next month, but due to a situation at the residence was forced to leave early.

While in the program I began working in the financial district for a few guys I had met in the travels doing merchant cash advances/business financing. There is money to be made when deals are closed but the salary is very small $200/week plus commission on any deals.

I started off doing well, closed a $175k loan which would have paid out $6000, however before the merchant made his first 20 payments he defaulted which had my commission called back.

I just entered the shelter system and am not having an easy time.

I've already gotten beat up for my watch and headphones.

What I really need is some advice from someone that's maybe been through this before.

While in residential treatment HRA sends the program your cash assistance and food stamps, but since I was discharged they return it to HRA, leaving me with nothing.

I am going to my job in a few hours to talk about things with my boss, but I haven't been to work in 2 weeks because I've been in the hospital. 

The new shelter they have me in isn't the worst but still not a good environment for a recovering addict trying to get back on track.

What I really need is someone to point me in the right direction for assistance.
Maybe a fellow Redditor knows of some side work or even more permanent work that could help me out, or even an alternative to this shelter life.

I do have dinner valuable skills, I've been in the tech arena for as long as I can recall, fixing and building computers. Setting up home theater systems, networking and pretty much any type of sales.

I've also worked in delis and food service since I'm 13 years old.

I'm not looking for a hand out, just some advice or possibly a little extra work to help get back on my feet. I'm willing to do anything for work that my body can tolerate (I have back and neck issues, so real hard labor may not work out well.)

It's still early and I didn't sleep well because of another resident here jumping and banging around all night.

If anyone can take a few moments of their day to even provide some words of inspiration, it may be what I need to continue on because what I'm seeing here is bleak.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

Thank god my phone bill is paid in advance and that wasn't stolen from me as well.
