0,"[Update] Safety of running in Central Park at night


I made a post yesterday asking whether it is safe to exercise at night in central park. I got some great responses, and now I would like to share my experience and offer advice to future runners/bikers that want to spend some time there after the sun goes down.

I ran at night yesterday (a Tuesday in mid-October, dark out). I went around 8pm and I had a 6 mile run (around 42 minutes long), to give you an example of the timeframe I was there. I started around 96th street and Central Park West and ran south along the main bike route around the south end of the Park and around toward the East side (ended around what is equivalent to 84th street East Side), and turned around to run back.

Overall I felt about 7/10 safe. The lights every 10-20 meters illuminate a small area of the path, but every so often one or two will be out and you'll run in darkness for a short segment. There are other people there around that time, namely runners and bikers, but you do see some homeless on the inside of the path huddled on benches. They don't seem to pay any attention to you. I did see two huge raccoons rummaging through trash cans.

The majority of other people exercising there around 8:30pm are running in the counter-clockwise direction around the bike loop. There were some women running alone, but the majority of women were either paired up or in a small-ish running group. I'd say on average, there would be a runner every 100m, essentially one within eyesight at all times. Rarely did I not have anyone else out of my field of view, but it did happen, and that's when I felt the most unsafe, especially if it was near a dark section of the loop.

I did not venture north above 96th street W side or 84th E side. It seemed more desolate, dark, and overall not somewhere I'd want to run after sunset on my own. I did not see the traverse, so I cannot speak to how safe it is currently.

There is a park officer car that circles the loop every 10-15 minutes or so, but definitely not often enough to improve safety once it passes.

As I was running back, I ran onto the reservoir just to get a quick glimpse of the situation. It is very well lit, both from lights every 10 meters to the background light from the city in every direction. The south end is slightly darker than the rest of it. That said, there were maybe 2-4 runners total in my entire view of the reservoir, so I decided it best not to run it at that hour and that the bike loop is safer.

**Concluding remarks and advice:**

-When running between 8pm and 9pm in the fall, the safest is likely the bike loop under 96th street.

-If you run with a partner or group, your feeling of safety will increase from 7 to 8/10 to 9 to 10/10.

-Wear reflective clothing, it's difficult to see at night

-Charge your phone beforehand

-Don't stop to pet the raccoons

-If you're doing a long run, &gt;6 miles, it is exactly 3.5 miles between 96th and CPW and 86th/5th ave (near the Met) along the main bike route - if you run along that and turn around at those locations, you can hit 7+ miles without going around the north end.

-PM me if you have any questions"
1,"Another year, another dumbass apple picking plan


Once again, I have an idiotic plan to take the bus from Port Authority to New Paltz (and then a cab) to pick apples. If anyone wants to join me on this absurd journey, they are welcome.  I plan the 10:30 bus. 

Disclaimer: I did this last year and it is a long and somewhat expensive trip that culminated in carrying 25 lbs of apples home (my preciousssss). If you’re not interested, you’re probably smarter than me. "
2,"Any relatively low cost restaurants in manhattan that give the illusion of being high class?


I want to take a girl out to a nice restaurant and well I'm not cheap but I also don't have the cash to take her to some Michelin star restaurant lol but I do want her to feel like she's somewhere fancy. 

Edit: thanks for all the recommendations guys! Hopefully my date goes well lol "
