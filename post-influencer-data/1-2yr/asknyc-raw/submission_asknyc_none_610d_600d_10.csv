0,"What are your favorite places in your hood to eat / drink?


Alternately - if you wanted to give someone a taste of your hood - what would you include on that list?

edit: Love all these responses - keep them coming!  Hopefully this helps us do some exploring in our own neighborhoods (or even in new ones!)"
1,"Roommates are hosting large Amway recruiting meetings in the living room. Halp?


I have 3 roommates, and 2 of them are a couple who are the main people on the lease (I and the other girl sublet). We are all around the same age, mid-late 20's.

It started early this summer with a few Amway boxes in the kitchen/living room and a 3-4 people in the living room on Sunday nights. At first I just thought they were friends.  But steadily the number of boxes grew to full on racks of Amway product and the meetings grew larger and more ""structured"".  Last night I walked out of my room to find over 30 (!) people in suits crammed in our crappy living room, spilling into the hallway near my room.  

It's been every Sunday night from 6-10 up til midnight.  They somehow draw these people in under the premise of a ""business opportunity"", do their little sales pitch, then have people sit in the living room calling friends and family to join.  It's annoying for me because I feel trapped in my room when this happens. I don't feel comfortable walking around in my pajamas, I feel weird/guilty when I walk into the apartment and everyone stares at me like I've interrupted something.  I just don't like it! And this operation is only getting bigger and more intrusive. They had their usual Sunday night meeting last night and tonight they are hosting a large potluck in the house.  

I'm just a subletter and I do like my room and am reluctant to give it up and find something else. But I'm not sure how to approach this topic with them.  I could look the other way with a handful of people but 30 people who show up in my living room under the assumption they're there for a job interview? Then I have to hear people outside my door calling family and reading from a script... it's just shitty and awkward.

The building owner/manager won't be of any use so no use in asking. This is a crappy building in the BX. "
2,"Most photogenic NYC subway stops?


I'm looking to take some photos at subway stops in NYC, and was wondering what the most photographic stops are. I imagine they're the ones that are above ground &amp; outside and have some interesting stuff in the background, but I'm not opposed to underground / inside stations if they have something that catches they eye.  I don't mind traveling a bit (I assume I can get there by subway!) 

I'll probably be looking for shots like /r/waitingforatrain, but will be looking to take more creative shots as well.

My home station is Herald Square, for an example of what I'm not looking for lol"
