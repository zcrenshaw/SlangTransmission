0,"People who attempt phone conversations on the subway: why?


"
1,"Why is the official city for Queens addresses their neighborhood name while in the other boroughs it's simply the borough/county name?


For example the city for my official address is Jamaica. Everywhere else in NYC it's the borough or county name like New York or Brooklyn. Anyone know the reason for this."
2,"Feeling like I have no time to actually make the most of living in NYC? What are little things I could do?


I think it's fair to say that to afford to live in New York you have to work, and work a lot, unless you have a special circumstance or are a student still dependent on parents or something.

I moved here with a lot of goals and have just been discouraged lately. I feel lucky to have found a job quickly (well, two jobs actually) but I work a lot of swing shifts (3 pm to midnight) and on weekends. I only have one day off a week to pursue my real passion which just feels like I'm being stagnated. I live in NYC but feel like I spend almost all of my time at my apartment and at work.

People with busy schedules, what are things you do in the little time that you have to remind yourself that you live here / take a  more advantage of it?"
3,"What aspects/features of other global cities would you like to see adopted in New York?


...or are we perfect just the way we are? "
