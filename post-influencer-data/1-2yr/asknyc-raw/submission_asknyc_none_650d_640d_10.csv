1,"Houses in Manhattan


This is very random but a couple months ago I was walking in the West Village and had my mind blown after seeing actual, normal, houses in the neighborhood (by this I mean a single unit structure with a gate and a couple floors, etc). I just assumed everything in Manhattan was either an apartment building or a townhouse. Are there other areas in Manhattan that have houses in them? Does anyone know off the top of their head some of the addresses of these houses that I saw?

Thanks!"
2,"Potentially dumb question, but is there any company that makes candles that smell like those roasted nuts from the Nuts 4 Nuts carts?
