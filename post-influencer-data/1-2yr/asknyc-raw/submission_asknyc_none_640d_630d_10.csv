2,"Make me feel less bad and tell me your ""I got hustled stories""


Background: I pride myself on knowing a hustle. (thought so) I know that the guy in Penn Station asking for money looking to buy a train ticket to Raleigh and is just $6 shot of the $68 ticket is just a homeless person trying to hustle people's good intentions. 
Present Day: 
About a year ago while giving directions to a guy he told me works in TV and my voice would be a great cartoon character and should look into doing voice-over work. (didn't look homeless, was dressed in a suit and trench coat) 
This past weekend someone asked me for directions and began to say the same thing about my voice. That he did production work in LA and was here in NYC visiting the MTV office. (again didn't look homeless) That I should do voice-over work and that he could help me with it. But I have to give him $400 for the demo. 
I ask for a card he didn't have one, said he was here for the holidays) ((RED FLAG))
He looked a generic (blurry) linkedin profile he mentioned ((RED FLAG))
He said they mostly work on email and to contact him like that. ((RED FLAG))
He said that he sensed that I was unsure and said he would front the other $200 and I would just have to put down half. 
In the end I went to the ATM and gave him $200. 
Everything in me screamed not to do it. But I blame my 3 days of sleep deprivation and hope. I (foolishly) hoped that something would come from this. 
I'm less angry now. I count the money as my holiday charity, guess he need it, and this guy was so good he got one over on me I kinda want to shake his hand. 

So any stories you have like this to make me feel less like the dumb swindled person I am? "
