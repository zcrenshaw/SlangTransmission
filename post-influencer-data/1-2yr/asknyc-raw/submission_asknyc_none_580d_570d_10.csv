Hello, I recently moved to town and noticed every other person I see is wearing the same exact coat: a dark blue parka-type jacket with a fur hood and a white and red patch on the arms. I can never tell what the patch represents. The same coat is worn by men and women of different ages. 
I spend most of my time in Midtown and live in Washington Heights - Iâ€™ve seen these coats everywhere in between. Am I crazy or has someone else noticed this?"
1,"Why is Gristedes so expensive?


If I want to go to Whole Foods I'll go to Whole Foods and pay their prices, but whenever I go to Gristedes I always feel weirded out when I grab a handful of things and it ends up being 1.5-2x as expensive as I expect. Case in point, the $2.99 pack of Kraft's Singles from Key Foods is $5.99 at Gristedes. And in my case, these two stores are *across the street from each other!* Its the exact same product!!!

How is this possible? I just don't understand how Gristedes stays in business when they sell the *exact same groceries* as key foods (its not like they're selling whole foods tier food), and charge so much more.

Is it a money laundering front or something? What gives?"
2,"How often do you run into people you know in the city?


I live in a city of 4.5 million people however it suffers badly from urban sprawl so I would say it's a similar size to Philadelphia. One week in school we did this work experience thing were we basically hung out at whatever job for 5 days. Even though we live on average about 40 minutes from the city and a lot of kids just worked at a local business, I went to a law firm near the CBD. Throughout the course of the week I probably ran into about 20 kids from school in a pretty big city.







So basically I'm wondering how often New Yorkers run into each other. Is it a daily occurrence or maybe every few weeks?"
