0,"Do you feel like you're getting out the most out of living in NYC?


My wife and I have lived in NYC (UWS) for nearly three years and I've really enjoyed it. However, I kind of feel like I'm not really taking full advantage of this cool city. I pretty much work, come home, and maybe go out to eat a few times a month â€” which I could do at a fraction of the cost somewhere else.

Does anyone else feel this way?

What kind of things have you done to feel like you're taking advantage of living here? "
1,"Best Ramen in the City? (Stickied post is 5 years old)


I know there's a post in the NYC sub, but it's 5 years old and NYC is such an ever changing beast that those threads need more current versions, so since it's winter, and my birthday is in a few days, tell me your favorite ramen picks!"
2,"My friend's (26/f) ex (28/f), who is a cop with the NYPD, can't accept that she ended the relationship and won't stop harassing her. What can she do?


Hi Everyone,

tl;dr: Friend's ex-boyfriend shows up at her house unexpected and unwanted, refuses to stop calling her and messaging her, calls her names, when he is angry, accuses her of things that aren't true, and basically is emotionally abusing her. He will not leave her alone despite her requests to, and she is afraid to report him because he is a cop. What should she do?

My friend has been seeing this guy for a little over a year. It was not serious - it started off as just someone to spend time with and occasionally go out with. They didn't start calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend until only a couple months ago. She ended the relationship with him because he tried to take the relationship to the next level (moving in together) which she was not comfortable with and also because he has a very bad temper and she just didn't see the relationship going anywhere.

Since she ended things, he does not stop calling and texting her. She blocked his number, and he has showed up at her house about 3x, all unexpectedly and unwanted, and he would not leave when she asked him to. He forces her to see him and talk to him, then gets mad at her for not wanting to hang out with him.

Yesterday her and I were out, and he found out where we were, showed up, and yelled at her in public. That was my first time meeting him, and he honestly sounded so crazy and delusional (I hope he was drunk because if he wasn't, he has a warped perception of reality and is really, really, irrational and crazy). He said a lot of weird things, like ""I'm literally just trying to talk to you. I'm not yelling at you!"" even though he was definitely yelling, he accused her of being with another guy, and then maliciously brought up the fact that she has a daughter (whom she didn't introduce him to, but he ended up meeting recently when he showed up at her house one day and invited himself in). When he is mad, he yells out anything he can - such that she is a slut, a whore, stupid, a bad mother, etc. This is definitely abusive behavior.

She is afraid to call the cops because he IS a cop. She thinks the other cops will just take his side, and then he will be even angrier and crazier with her for reporting him. She is scared of him (and I am too), so she just does nothing. What should she do? His behavior absolutely isn't okay. For reference, he is with the NYPD.

Thanks in advance to everyone.

Edit: I meant to write that my friend is (26/f) and her ex is (28/m). Oops!"
