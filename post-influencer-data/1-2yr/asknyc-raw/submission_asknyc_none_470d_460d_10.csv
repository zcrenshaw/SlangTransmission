My go to's are simple ones like you can spin the Cube in Astor Place. (Surprised at how many people I tell don't know this). Also, there's a a [contraption on the outside of the IFC Center](https://i.imgur.com/qXEAoTv.jpg) that looks like some kind of Con Ed meter, but it's actually a tower viewer type thing that you can use to watch whatever movie is currently playing in the theatre."
1,"Is the New York accent disappearing among the younger generations?


Growing up, Iâ€™ve noticed that other than adults most people I knew did not have the stereotypical New York accent. Some did have the NY Hispanic accent but I get caught off guard when I meet a younger person with the New York accent. In most cases, I find that im usually unable to tell a younger person from NYC from a younger person from California."
2,"Is Christmas in NYC worth seeing?


I will be traveling to NYC for the first time, but I don't know when yet. I was thinking the week before Christmas because hotel prices actually go down a little right before Christmas. 

Now I know some say to avoid NYC on December because of the crowds and its extremely cold weather, but others would recommend going because of the festivity. 

I'm mostly going to do the generic tourist stuff there. Go see Statue of Liberty, American Natural History Museum, The MET, Top of the Rock, Ice skating, etc. 

The thing is, I live near San Francisco and I can just go there for Christmas. I've never actually been to SF around Christmas season, but if it's the same experience as NYC then I most likely won't go to NYC on Christmas. 

What do you guys think?"
3,"Is living in Jersey City and commuting to NY worth it if it's free?


So I grew up in New Jersey, and moved to Los Angeles when I was around 15. My mother kept a condo in Jersey City because either my sibling or I were ""bound to move back and live in New York"" (She worked in Manhattan for 30+ years). She said all I have to pay is utilities if I ever moved in there. It's a studio about a ten minute walk to the PATH train.

So I'm graduating on the west coast, and my partner and I are looking around to see where to move or where good opportunities lie. He has a lot of offers in the Bronx and Manhattan (specialized healthcare/medicine), and I'm interested in applying to graduate programs in NY. He's dead set on living in the city or something, and I'm hesitant because I have an opportunity to save $$$.

Now I haven't spent too much of my adult life in NY other than visiting family. Would I want to die commuting via PATH train? I'm sick of Los Angeles commuting, and I think the train beats falling asleep at the wheel. It's theoretically one train. 

The other things are: Most of my friends live in Queens or Brooklyn.
As well, my partner and I are both pretty active in the respective art and music communities we belong to so I don't know if living in Jersey City would just be a complete detriment to that."
