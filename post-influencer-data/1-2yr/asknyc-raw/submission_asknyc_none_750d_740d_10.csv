0,"Is public access porn in Manhattan still a thing?


Before I get downvoted, I know that older Manhattanites will be able to back me up on this.

There used to be all of this softcore porn on Time Warner cable on the public access channels at least 25 years ago.  The only ""show"" I remember was the Robyn Byrd show which would feature local strippers.  Apparently there were a ton of people trying to stop it, understandably, but there was some loophole that allowed it.  As a 14 year old boy pre-internet, it was much appreciated. "
1,"Is anyone here a Tasker on Taskrabbit in NYC? How frequently do you get tasks?


I'm transitioning jobs and this seems like it would be a cool way to earn a dollar while I figure out my next big move, but I can't seem to find any metrics or info online that would give me an idea of how likely it is I can expect to actually keep busy throughout the day. I've already registered and completed their orientation, and am an ""active"" tasker since yesterday, but nothing yet.  It could be because I'm new with no reviews yet, but maybe people just aren't using the platform? 

I'm sure experiences vary like anything else, but it would be helpful to hear some first hand accounts of how being a tasker is working (or not) from some folks who do it in the city.  

Thanks!"
2,"Best spots to read in Manhattan, BK, Queens: green spaces, cafes, restaurants, museums, cozy nooks?


I just finished grad school and have a huge stack of books on my TBR shelf and will continue to do research reading on a regular basis. While the weather is still nice, I want to take my reading out into the world while I can. I'm asking for your favorite cafes, green spaces and/or work-friendly spaces with chill, subdued ambiance where I can get some serious reading done. Thanks in advance!

I don't drink right now, so places that serve non-alcoholic drinks are preferred vs. bars.

Here are some of my favorites, while I'm at it...
- Madison Square Park
- Bryant Park
- Cup &amp; Cup in Midtown East
- The back garden at Bakeri in Williamsburg
- Cafe Serai at the Rubin Museum (such an underrated museum in general!)

3,"Is it possible to report those Manhattan passenger bikes who charge riders by the minute?


They are ridiculous overpriced (obviously meant to target foreigners) and their rate is per minute, which is absolutely preposterous and even counts stop signs and red lights in their time. Some of these shmucks are false advertising by charging per person, even when the sign says ""per ride"", and they occasionally increase their prices using a marker. One guy had his thing priced at $12.99 per minute, which is the worst rate I've ever seen. Another person charged $8 per minute but used a very red piece of paper with black marker to write the price, making it extremely hard for people to see how much it costs. 

There was this incident the other day where there was a lot of traffic on the road, and the biker couldn't move very far. I was ride behind the guy in my car, and eventually the tourists (who didn't really speak good English) asked the guy if they could get off. Although the guy only transported them about one half of a mile (I was essentially following them from the moment they were picked up), he tried charging them around $380, as he charged per person. I see them complaining, and because traffic wasn't moving (apparently due to some accident), I decided to get out of my car and help the tourists out. The rider threatened to call the cops on the tourists, which almost made them pay the damn ripoff price. I knew this was basically a scam, so I actually did call the cops on the driver. The dude instantly begged me to drop the call, and I told him I'd only do so if they don't have to pay. I didn't give a fuck that he physically rode them for half a mile, as that scummy shit was absolutely cold-hearted and it wouldn't surprise me if he scammed other people before the same way (besides, it's not like he used up any gas while riding them, and he was waiting in traffic long enough for him to recover his energy from biking). He reluctantly complied, and I helped two foreigners save almost $400. They tried offering me money, but I obviously refused.

My point is, the guy knew he was in the wrong and that's why he didn't want me calling the cops, even though he was the one threatening the tourists with the cops in the first place. I feel like more people have been scammed this way, but at the very least their practices should be illegal, right? Is there any way to complain about this shit?"
