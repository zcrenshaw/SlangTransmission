"I've been working at a computer repair shop since 2013 and today I saw the worst thing I've ever seen in the business.


We're a repair shop (and refurbisher and e-waste recycler, but those don't matter here) in the Bay Area.  

Guy comes in, tells us (check-in/showroom sales folks; I'm not a tech mostly because I'm the vintage stereo/salvage guy) that he has a problem but he's not sure he has the words to describe it, and sets a tote bag on the counter.  

He pulls out an older WD external hard drive casing, sans drive, and tells us that he plugged a 12-volt AC adapter into it and it stopped working, and wants to know if we can help him recover his data. He says that his friend tried to help him out and wasn't able to do so.  

He then pulls out, in the following order:  
- Two 750GB WD Green hard drives  
- A hard drive PCB.  
- *Two hard drive platters in a paper CD sleeve*  

I shuddered and managed to keep myself from visibly grimacing (I think) and told him to be as gentle as he possibly could, and gave him a DriveSavers brochure. (They're just a few miles north of here, thankfully.) I have no goddamn clue if they can recover anything from a pair of goddamn bare platters clunking around in an envelope, but he'd better pray to whatever powers he believes in that they're recoverable.  

This has now displaced the Macbook Pro that slipped into someone's recliner and was molded into a 90-degree angle as ""most abused equipment."""
