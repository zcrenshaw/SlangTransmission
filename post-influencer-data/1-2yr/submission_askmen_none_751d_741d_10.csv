"What's one personality trait of your SO that only you get to see?


My wife, despite being pretty, is really really shy.  She has quite strong social phobia and has great trouble making new friends.  But the odd thing is, that once you get to know her, she is really fucking funny.  She makes me laugh almost constantly and her sense of humor is biting, subtle and clever...  but nobody else ever gets to see this this side of her and I doubt they'd believe me if I told them.  They think she's just quiet and it never ceases to amaze me what she hides under there when she's in public.

What's yours?"

Your wife is a perfect ten in physical form. All the other guys gawk at her. All the other guys try to get her number when you're not around. What do you have to go through? What are your feelings?"
"What do you think of a girl who has no social media?


I've been on numerous dates where the guy has thought it was weird that I don't have instagram, Facebook etc. I'm just not really into it-seems kinda like a show off/ fake world to me. Just curious what the men of Reddit think. "

"After a breakup, how does a man keep his stuff safe so his girlfriend doesn't do anything bad to it?


My friend recently broke up with his girlfriend and they both lived together. While he was at work, she was at home moving her stuff out (as heard from one of her friends). I found out just now that he lost most of his precious electronic devices (laptop, ipad, DJ mixer), guitar, lost his cat, some of his medicines, all the food from fridge, a lot of his clothes, some of his shoes, even some small furniture and God knows what else. Not only this, she damaged some of his walls, bathroom glass, knocked stuff over, poured ketchup all over the carpet and make a huge mess everywhere.

I offered him my guest room and told him I can help clean up his place. He was greatful for my offer, along with others pitching in.

Now I know she didn't do it alone. And this got me thinking, after a break up, if a man moves in with his girlfriend, how can he keep his stuff safe so his girlfriend doesn't do anything bad to it? Resort to storage space?

EDIT:

My friend is reading the comments and thanks you all for your support on this matter. 
Thank you!"

"To those who weren't head over heels for their SO at first, what changed?


So I saw this question on the AskWomen Subreddit. I was wondering the same for men. How's your relationship now with your SO?

Edit: Oh wow. This blew up pretty quickly! Some of you guys have been asking for the link from AskWomen. I've tried uploading the link but I've been rejected twice (it's not allowed on this subreddit). Sorry if I didn't respond to your comments but I am reading all of them! These love stories are wonderful, others not so much... Dating is hard work! Bravo to those couples who put in the work. One day, I hope to find a man who loves me for me and vice versa."
"New to the alcohol world, how strong is each type of alcohol


Just turned 19 (canada), I get sort of confused with this stuff but I don't wanna seem like a noob irl lol. For example, I know you can drink a few bottles of beer to get drunk and all but what about stuff like Tequilla, Whiskey, Champagne, Vodka, Wine. Also, how do you drink some of them, like on snapchat I see people at clubs drinking vodka straight from the bottle but aren't you supposed to mix it or something?

Edit: welll this blew up, thanks guys, I'll make sure to read everything"

"What's your ""right person wrong timing"" story?


So last December, I met this girl who was vacationing in my city for two weeks. We hit it off immediately, and basically started hanging out all day/night. Our whole experience together was honestly like something out of a movie, as cheesy as that sounds. 

We would have loved to be together. But only problem is, she lives 9,500 miles away and has to stay there for at least another 2 years to finish school. Still, we kept in touch on a very regular basis, and called each other every week or two. We talked alot about what other adventures we could go on, and all the cool experiences we'd have when we finally see each other again. She even told me she might be visiting my country with her family in a few months, and would make sure to spend a few days with me. 

Just a few days ago, she called me and told me she just started seeing someone in her country and things are starting to get serious. This kind of crushed me, which is weird because we were never exclusive and had both casually dated other people in the past 8 months. But still, I feel like all the stuff I had been looking forward to doing with this girl is all gone in an instant. And it sucks because the distance and timing was pretty much the only thing holding us back from being together. 

I'm going to try my best to see other girls and move on, but I know it'll be tough. Any of you have any stories where things didn't work out with someone mostly because of shitty timing? "

"Where to go with my [16 M] girlfriend [16 F] on a date?


So I got my first girlfriend around a month ago. We met at camp and hit it off and ended up making out (first kiss as well). She lives in a different state than I do, so we wanted to meet once before school starts. I see her every Sunday for orchestra, but there isn't a lot of free time. My question is where should we meet up? My first thought was a mall, but idk if that is a good idea or not. Like I said this is kinda new to me so I'm thankful for all opinions. Thanks!

Edit 1: Thanks for all the opinions everyone! I got a lot of replies so I wanted to edit the post instead of individually replying. I found a park in her state that is an hour from me. I'm going to text her today and ask her. Thanks for all the advice, it helped a lot. Btw I didn't mean anything from saying I ""got"" a girlfriend, it was just how I phrased the sentence."
