720,"[Megathread] What sexy holiday question would you like to ask Reddit? (NSFW)


Sexy Christmas, sexy Hanukkah, sexy Kwanzaa, sexy Festivus, and sexy Yam Day are all just a few days away.

With the holidays coming up, it's time for our holiday megathreads. They're a great place to discuss the holidays and they keep the sub normal for people who want to discuss things such as Newton's sexy Third Law.

All top-level comments (replies to the post rather than replies to comments) should contain a sexy holiday related question and the thread will function as a mini-subreddit. Non-question top-level comments will be removed, to keep the thread as easy to use and navigate as possible.

While this thread is up, all other holiday posts will be removed.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays!
