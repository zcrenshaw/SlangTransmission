Hello everyone!

Earlier this year we had our 10th anniversary as a community on reddit and to commemerate that day we had [a t-shirt design contest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7gurqh/announcing_a_very_special_contest) Of the many great designs we had [a vote between 7 of the best](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7nf0xk/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th) for the one you wanted to be featured on a shirt that would raise money for a charity that you later [voted on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7oyhb5/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th)

Thanks to the support of hundreds of members of the community we were able to raise **$3,621** for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International through sales and donations. We just wanted to thank everyone that either purchased a product or just donated money, you all are awesome!

By now those of you that ordered a product should have received it (if you haven't please PM me) and we wanted to make this post to say thank you and give people a chance to share pictures of what they purchased. You don't have to show your face if you don't feel comfortable, we just wanted to make a post for people to share some fun pictures. So, for this thread, *top-level comments should only consist of links to images featuring products from the fundraiser.* If your parent comment does not contain a link to a relevant picture it will be removed.

Thanks again to everyone and we hope you have a great rest of the week.

-The AskReddit Moderators"
