0,"Suicide Prevention Megathread


With the news today of the passing of the amazing Anthony Bourdain and the also the very talented Kate Spade a couple of days of ago, we decided to create a megathread about suicide prevention. So many great and talented people have left the world by way of suicide, not just those are famous, but friends and family members of everyday people.

That's why we would like to use this thread for those that have been affected by the suicide of someone to tell your story or if you yourself have almost ended your life, tell us about what changed. 

If you are currently feeling suicidal we'd like to offer some resources that might be beneficial:
