"My bf finally put his foot down with his religious mother. I cried.


I have been living with my bf for more than a year now and dating for almost two. He is lovely. But I have still not met his parents because they do not want to meet me. 

This afternoon I drove my bf two hours to his parents house for his brother's birthday party. I handed him the gift we got together, gave him a hug, watched him walk into his parents' house, and then drove back home. It felt terrible.  

It is not my place to tell him how to act around his mom and dad, and unlike them, I have never asked him to choose between the two of us.

When his brother dropped him off later this evening he told me that I am coming with him to his parents' House for Christmas. When I asked who invited me, he said it was him. He told his mother that if I was not invited that he would not be home for Christmas. Then one by one all of his brothers and their wives said that if he couldn't come with his partner that they would not come either. 

I just sat down on the floor and cried. This year I won't have to spend Christmas at home alone.

"PSA: the average gay guy will NOT have dating/sexual experience as early as their straight peers


Gay guys need to stop comparing themselves and their experiences to straight people. I'm getting really frustrated with some of the ""woe is me"" type of comments that I see on here. Stop getting so down on yourselves!

It's 100% normal for gay guys to still be virgins at 18+ years old. 

It's 100% normal to not have your first real boyfriend until you're in your 20s.

This sort of stuff is par-for-the-course. Only around 5% of guys are gay/bisexual, and most guys don't come out of the closet until college or later. This means you're not going to be able to find sex or dates as easily as your straight friends and classmates. That's just the way life works for men who want to date other men. It's a numbers game.

Instead of whining that you've never had a boyfriend at age 20, try focusing on yourself and advancing your studies/career. You'll have plenty more opportunities to date once you establish an independent life for yourself. And by that time, more gay/bi guys will be out of the closet. So not only will you be more appealing to prospective partners, but you'll have more options too."
"Stop bringing your girlfriends to the gay bars


Fair warning, I’m kind of drunk, pretty pissed and kind of ranty. I don’t know how this is going to be received by this community. 

First of all, I want to make it clear that I do want everybody of all genders and sexualities to feel generally welcome.

But a lot of you are the problem. It’s one thing for you to bring a curious co-worker or two with you when you go out. It’s another when you bring a fucking gaggle of straight girls at a 5:1 ratio. There are multiple reasons for this. First and foremost is space, physical and perceived. I know everybody hates the term, but I think it is fair to say that a gay bar is a “safe space” for the gay population. We are not a spectacle for your friends. I completely believe that 95% of the time it is not coming from a place of negativity or maliciousness, but we see when your girlfriends are there for the show. 

On the other hand is physical space. Clubs are buildings. Buildings have occupancy limits. Also included in physical space is the astonishing lack of awareness and consideration that women (and I am absolutely including the lesbians in this generalization, but that is a whole other rant) have at the gay bars. Your girlfriends are guests to our space. I am a pretty tall dude with some gangly-ass limbs, and I don’t carelessly knock into others at near the rate that these party girls do. Whenever I get bumped hard or pushed or elbowed, it is ALWAYS women. Except for the very few times when it’s men (hows that for a stat lol?). I get it, the club is packed, alcohol is flowing, it happens. But it’s like they literally don’t even realize that they just made contact with someone else, it is almost never acknowledged. 

And back to that occupancy thing for a second. Guess who all those straight women attract. I know you all are smart fellas, that’s why I love this sub, but I just don’t think it is thought about how actions have reactions. And trust me, I’m that gay guy that you all love to talk shit about because I ogle all the hot straight guys that come to our clubs searching for women (or they were dragged along with one of the girls you invited), but it is too much. I’m there to dance with friends and not necessarily to hook up, but this was the first time at the gay clubs (I haven’t been to one in about a year before two weeks ago) where I did not feel that carefree, “go hit on a dude” atmosphere. It was very likely that it was going to be a straight guy. And as more straight guys come, there is an influx of straight guys there solely to get some pussy. It’s one thing if your straight friends are actual allies and them scoring at the club is just a nice bonus. But lately there seems to be a lot more “predator” type guys there that show visible disgust and disdain for the gay activities happening and are just there to hunt for easy chicks. A very informal survey, but I took tonight to keep track of the couples that I saw and here are my results. I’m hoping to get published. There were a total of three gay or lesbian “couples” on the floor (as in they were paired off to the point of making out). There were 11 straight couples doing the same. That is bonkers to me. 

I feel bad because this post kind of sounds like I hate women or like I feel that there should be no straight people allowed at the clubs. That isn’t the case. There is just a very tangible shift in culture from being away from the bars for so long to coming back. Maybe it’s indicative of a positive change of acceptance in society and I’m just a grumpy bitch who didn’t get any dick. Who knows.

Tl;Dr: please read it I typed it all on my phone. But basically we should make all breeders wear special wristbands and they should need a gay sponsor to get into the club.

"Girlfriend likes to see me topped.


I posted ages ago about how I came out to my girlfriend as bisexual and she questioned my preference in relation to topping or bottoming. When I told her I was a bottom she seemed really happy and then suggested a threesome with another guy. 

Well recently we fulfilled this. The guy was someone we both knew from uni. Also bi. 

I was so nervous and worried that I wouldn’t enjoy being topped in front of my gf. But it was one of the hottest things I have ever done. 

Being able to show her who I am when I am being topped was so empowering and she was totally turned on. 

Just wanted to share. 

Hope no hate for not asking a question and also being more bi related. Sorry if this irritates."

"My lifechanging experience


I was born in 1975 as a man. My name was William then. When I was little I always felt more inclined towards girl things. Later on when I was about 16 I started wearing my mom's things and putting make up on when I was alone. And then one day, 2 days after my 17th birthday my dad came home sick and found me dressed like that. He went crazy, started screaming and hitting me and I just kept saying ""please dad I'm a girl"". He beat me so hard that I passed out. A few days later my mom and my dad, the people that were supposed to love me, threw me out. I haven't seen them since then, I don't know what happened to them and I honestly don't care. This is the part where the nightmare begins. I was a teenager on the street, homeless, hungry and lonely.  One thing lead to another and I became a prostitute to survive. But things got worse. My pimp was taking almost all of the money, I slept with countless men and in the end, after another horrible day I came home to my pimp, who would be drunk and high and would beat me and he and his friends would take turns on me. My life was a living hell. And then on Christmas in 1997, I was just lying alone in the coldest room you can imagine and I just decided that that's it. Life's not worth living. So I sliced my wrists. Fortunately I was saved. And the people that saved me CARED and they were good, got me help, helped me get off the street and away from my pimp. I was finally free. I started working at a hair salon and now, years later I OWN that salon and 2 others. I also went through transition and operation and now I am a real woman, and a MARRIED woman. Yes, a man that actually loves me, Sylvia, for who I am. 20 years ago I thought life was hell and I wanted to quit. I am now so happy I didn't. So please, when you are hurt or you are feeling down remember, IT GETS BETTER!"
"Best/Worst part about being gay and in a relationship


Man flus. Holy shit. Man flus.


My man is sick right now and he's super cute but very fucking annoying at the same time. 


He thinks he's going to die. Like really. Texted me when i was at work that he wanted me to know that he loved me if he happened to die. 


He clings on to me like a monkey the moment i get home and demands cuddles for the rest of the day. I literally just lie in bed all day as he wraps his arms and legs around me super tightly like a bear. Like tight enough that i can't even move or readjust my position, i just lie there like a log. 

As fast as i direct my attention elsewhere or check my phone he throws a tantrum about how i don't love him anymore.


I want to throw a fit but he didn't complain when i was sick earlier this week and did the EXACT same thing. Lmao. I guess i'll have to pull myself through. 


Is this relatable to anyone? "
"My straight friend used me as a (digital) sexual outlet. Anyone else had this happen? Should I let it continue?


My best friend (let's call him G, 28 yo) is in the military and in a long distance relationship with a woman. It's not long term (maybe 8 months) but they've been disagreeing lately due to some changes in her life. 

G talks to me ( 28 yo) about everything and I to him. Total trust. Before he joined up we worked out together, hung all the time, played video games. He gets along great with men, shy with the ladies. A sweetheart, a nerd. I miss him but we keep in touch. Today he's texting me about the troubles with his lady, intimate details of their issues. I give advice but mostly just listen. 

 Then he moves onto other stuff. He confides that he feels extremely sexual frustrated, isolated, and down on himself. This is compounded by intense boredom as he's between duties. He lacks a close friend on base. 

I jokingly tell him I'd gladly help with the frustration, what are friends for? This is a common joke and he usually calls me a thirsty homo and we banter. Today was totally different. He responds ""Haha, it's funny you say that. I took a bunch of nudes for GF but she shut me down. Feeling 50/50 on sending them to you.""

Dudes I am FLOORED. In all the years I have known him he's never expressed any gay tendencies. We've changed together probably 50 times and it's always felt like I was with my brother. 

 I was honest with him. That I want to see, shit who would not want to, but not if it'll make it weird. We basically discussed for 30 mins why he wanted this. It boiled down to him feeling neglected, needing an outlet, and wanting to be appreciated. He feels close to me, trusts me. I push back, and ask him to be sure because you cannot undo things like that. He assures me he wants it. Says maybe he as a bi streak but hasn't really thought about it that way. He's very stern that he does not want me to send photos back.

He sends 15 of the best nudes. Guys holy shit.  Tells me that sharing that got him full mast hard. Asks if I am hard, what I think of him. Tells me he appreciates the compliments. Asks what all I want to see. Takes 3 special requests. He asked if I want a vid. DUH YES and he sends the money shot about 15 mins later. 

After that we go back to our usual conversation. 

What.the.fuck do I do? Has this happened to anyone else? I feel fine about it, no baggage. But do I let this carry on? Is this healthy? I have no life experience to prepare me and frankly need some objective advice. I don't want to lose my friend.

**Edit: I simply can't share the photos. But I will describe. He's wearing his army fatigues, in a bathroom stall. Pants down. He's half Mexican so brown skin tone. 5'10 and a muscled 190 pounds.  Mildly hairy chest and pits, shaved cock and balls. Six inches long and THICK. Uncut with a short foreskin and tight balls.

"Two years ago, I suddenly broke up an unhealthy, 3yr relationship by moving out. It was the most painful thing I've ever done. I just randomly searched his FB page, &amp; he is in a new relationship, living 1,800 miles away. It appears that he is immensely happy. And I couldn't be happier for him.


So, to all of you, no matter which side of the break up you're on, if it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. Dragging it on is selfish &amp; just delays EVERYONE'S happiness. 

If it's time to make the call, it's time to make the call. You'll thank yourself later, I promise. 

Maybe someone needs to read this today. "
"do tops consider this rape?


Last night I hooked up with a guy who had a 9 inch dick. Before fucking I put on tons of lube because I can’t take dick unless I have a lot on. While we were fucking the lube dried out and I asked him like 4 times to take it out and put more lube in and he wouldn’t because he said there was already too much. 

He eventually started pounding me from behind and I asked him not put it all in, and I said if he was gonna fuck me hard not to go so deeply. He got visibly annoyed and said “If i fuck you hard it’s going to be deep” then continued fucking me at the same speed he was before 

After a while it really started to hurt and I very clearly said stop multiple times and he slowed down a little but didn’t stop fucking me at all. I kept using my arm to push him away so he couldn’t pound me too hard but he basically ignored me. I then told him he was being an asshole so got mad told me it was over and then got dressed and left.

I’m not traumatized and I’ve been actually raped multiple times but I’m wondering with all the sexual assault that has come to light recently, and the fact that a lot of times the accuser hasn’t felt like he was wrong, do tops considers this rape? "
"Did anyone ever feel lost being gay and older?


I feel so much of gay culture is based on youth and that if you're older and figuring out who you are, you have nowhere to go because our culture assumes that after a certain age, you're meant to have your life together and that's not always true.

Like I only began to accept who I was in my late 30s and I remember I had nowhere to go because the social meetings were restricted to young gays and lesbians . I wasn't comfortable going to bars. It took a long time for me to make friends in the gay community because I felt like my age was a detractor. 

Now I'm okay. I was lucky to have one acquaintance who was also gay and helped me out but I think of those gays and lesbians who come out late and are made to feel they don't belong because gay culture is so enraptured in youth and the belief the only gays who need help are in their teens or early 20s.
