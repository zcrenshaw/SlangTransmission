"Literally, my one-year-old can figure this stuff out


If this is the wrong sub, please let me know. 

I spent three shitty years working in a call center, two of which I was roped into acting as tech support, despite the fact that I'd originally been hired to sell insurance. The calls I got made me weep for humanity. After my son was born, I decided not to return from maternity leave. I just couldn't handle staying up all night with a screaming newborn, and then coming in to work and calmly asking people how the hell they can't see the huge red ""CREATE AN ACCOUNT"" button smack-dab in the middle of the page, but they can find our phone number in tiny font up in the corner to call and demand that we do it for them. 

Well, you guys, my baby is now a toddler, and I just had that misty-eyed, hand-on-heart, proud parent moment that you always hear about. My son was playing with his Brilliant Baby Laptop, which is basically a bright plastic clamshell that plays music when the baby mashes the keyboard. Suddenly, the music stopped. The baby was confused. Further button-mashing had no effect. I watched from the sofa as my son frowned, experimentally smashing the buttons harder. Then, as I looked on in amazement and pride, *he turned it off and on again.* ""Welcome!"" It announced, the screen lighting up in a joyful display. My son contentedly returned to his button-mashing, and I shed a proud tear. So what if your kid can say ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" and knows how to use a spoon? Mine can *troubleshoot!* "
