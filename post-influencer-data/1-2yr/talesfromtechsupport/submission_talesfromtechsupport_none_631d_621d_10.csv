"PEBCAK at its finest


A lady calls my help desk because she has problems with her CRT monitor (this happened years ago). Says there's lines and dots and various artifacts on the screen and it's ""frizzling"" as well. Sounds like an hardware problem, so I dispatch a tech to check it out.

He calls me back as soon as he gets there: the lady had a potted plant sitting on top of the CRT monitor and she watered it. Water had trickled inside and monitor was basically frying. Tech disconnected everything and told the lady if she was out of her mind pouring water over an electrical device. 

She was reported to the people responsible for office safety and ended up being one the first people to get a flatscreen monitor, just so that she wouldn't put any plants on it."
