"Of course I'll put you through to my ****ing manager


I was working service desk, and it was getting towards the end of the day and we were winding down before leaving at 5 when I had a call from a very angry man, who ran a small business.

He'd logged a ticket the day before for being unable to print to a specific printer, however he could walk 20 more meters and collect his documents from another perfectly fine printer. The job had been with the senior engineers for the day as obviously, this is not the highest priority issue we'd had today. Despite being polite and offering to speak with the team leader he flips out. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER, I WANT YOU TO ****ING FIX IT.

My boss is very good about us not taking abuse from customers, so I immediately flick him an I'M that it's starting to go south. I tell him I'm sorry I can't fix it, but I'll organise an engineer to give him a call tomorrow and speak with my team leader. He doesn't take this well and immediately yells ""I WANNA SPEAK WITH YOUR ****ING MANAGER""

I say of course and go to transfer the call, my boss picks up and I deadpan to him, I've got a gentleman who wants to speak with my ****ing manager. He gives me a grin and then says to put it through. He sits on the phone for 5 seconds before asking him to stop swearing, I didn't hear this part but evidently he doesn't stop. He immediately hangs up on the customer, speaks with the director and has all service for this customer cancelled. 

Manager then says you did absolutely the right thing and says if he ever calls back we're to put him straight through and never help him with anything."
