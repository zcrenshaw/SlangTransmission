"The time I accidentally allowed Marketing to spam themselves


Hello TFTS, LTL, FTP etc etc.

This is a tale of how I accidentally let Marketing send themselves over 100,000 emails in about 10 minutes.

I was developing a tool that lets them send out emails to people. Lots of emails, fairly quickly, because marketing. It was a system I was pretty proud of, because I'd built both the front end and back end from scratch.

One day I get an email from Marketing saying something like the following:

&gt;Our inbox is getting tons of the same emails from your system, plz help.

This made me scratch my head. I could understand if they'd somehow sent themselves a whole bunch of emails by putting their email address in the wrong column or something but the fact that these were the same emails time after time was puzzling.

Until I twigged to the realisation that something they'd requested recently was the ability to make an email send recur. So they could set up a bunch of emails to run on a cron job essentially. I went over and asked them how they'd set up the last job, specifically if they'd accidentally selected the recurrence option, which they swore blind they hadn't. A quick database search later confirmed that they actually had managed to select the recurrence option, and that this job was being run on a recurrence schedule of `* * * * *`. 

For those of you that can't read cron expressions, that will trigger every minute.

Turns out that in my infinite wisdom, the `div` containing the recurrence checkbox, extended the whole width of the container it was in. If someone clicked in line with the checkbox no matter how far to the right it was, would select the checkbox, and the default value for how often the emails recurred was 1 minute.

I was soon asked to hide the recurrence option and make it visible on a button press to prevent a recurrence."
