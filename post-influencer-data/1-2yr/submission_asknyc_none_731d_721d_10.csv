"Can You Teach Me How To Bodega?


Just moved up here in the spring, and one of the biggest changes to me is the bodega. As I have learned it is not a convenience store, and cash is king. When I saw a man come out a bodega with a full blown sandwich I was like I NEED to do this.

So what I'm asking is, can you teach me how to order sandwiches at a bodega? To give you background, I barely order from places like Subway, so I need to be held by the hand for this lol."
"Best place to break bacon and/or pork virginity in NYC?


Was living in an Arab country (where pork is not allowed) and under my parents strict supervision to make me stay away from pork, alcohol, and what not. Now that I'm finally free by going to college here, I'm wondering what's the most transcending piece of pork I can eat in the city. Preferably between midtown and greenwich.



Edit: Wow, looks like a have enough options that could last a few months here. Thanks everyone."
"Do u think plastic bags are so overused in NYC?


Hi everyone, It's my first time using Reddit, and I just moved to NYC for a month. As an international student, I am fascinated by this fancy city, but I'm also shocked by the overused plastic bags. For example, I remember the first time I shopped at a grocery store, the staff just gave me four plastic bags though I just bought a few things...
Since that, I started to bring my own shopping bag. 
I would like to know what you think about this issue."
