"I think my boyfriend might be gay, so I've decided to come here for advice.


I'm really not sure how to process this.

I've caught him checking out men before. He seems to make comments on other men's appearances in a way I've never seen a straight guy do, yet never seems to notice women. I hate to stereotype, but even things like some of the music he enjoys just, well...they fit the stereotype, he seems confident having those traits. I am deeply in love with him and we've been together for five years, and I know he loves me, but the thing is, and I really have to admit this to put my post in perspective...I'm a dude.

"Seeing gay couples in public makes me so happy.


So I was at the airport with my mom waiting for my aunt to arrive when I noticed two twenty-something year old guys cause they were speaking Arabic (yes I was eavesdropping) 

The older-looking guy was telling the other boy to be careful on his trip and then kissed him on the lips. IT WAS SO CUTE. seeing gay couples in public always makes me happy, but them being arab made it 1000x better. it gives me hope since i'm closeted. just thought i'd share."
"How many of you guys would actually date a bi guy?


I am 100% bi and recently confessed to my crush that I liked him. He told me he had feelings for me too - but couldn't date me because I was bi.

Major heart break right here hearing those words... 

It's not like I am going around sleeping with everyone, all the time. I have so much feelings for this guy and he just wants to toss that out because of a label :(

Edit: totally posted this before work. On lunch and have been reading amazing posts from everyone. Thank you. 

Will comment later!! Much love.

"What is your WORST Hook up Experience?


Here is mine: 


Years ago..I was living in a Midwestern state for work. I was single and looking for a regular bud for some NSA safe fun. (I am white educated professional.) At the time the best way to meet someone is through Craycraylist. I post an ad. Within a couple days a young college black man (who is also a STAR football player in college) answered. John said he was there for the summer and wanted to have some safe fun as well. We talked on the phone. He was educated and funny and and sounded easy going. We set up a time to meet at his house. I ask him if this was his home...he said it was his folks but they were out of town for a week. I agree to head over.


The door opens....John...is incredibly handsome and has THE most perfect college athletic body I have ever seen. The home was a beautiful mansion. The landscaping and interior were incredible. We head upstairs to one of the 2 master-bedrooms. John assures me his folks are away and it is safe to relax. So we spend an hour having a good safe time. After he invites me to shower with him in this massive shower built for 10. I head out of the shower to dry off...and am walking back towards the bedroom..when I hear a sound downstairs. I quietly go back to let John know. He assures me NO one could possible be home..they are 8 hours away! I tell him..he REALLY needs to check to be sure. So John wraps a towel around himself...walks to the door and peaks over the railing..and says ""HI DAD! I'm just taking a shower in YOUR bathroom...I will be down soon!"" I hear the Dad call back to him. ""We decided to come back early and have some friends over!""


I am ready to pass the ""F"" out!!! John... motions to me to GRAB all my stuff..and FOLLOW him. I tell him...can I just go out the front stairs and out? His expression changes....and he gets DEAD serious...and says ""Look man...my family has NO idea I am into dudes..and..they do NOT like white people. If you head down and they see you I will tell them YOU are an intruder and have them call the police. I have no choice. This would RUIN my life. ALSO....my Dad has a gun and would use it on you man. Just FOLLOW me and I will get you out of here man!""


What choice do I have? I follow him. He takes me down the long haul to a guest room and a small guest bath. He has me get into the Linen Closet in the bath where I dress quickly. John begs me to STAY PUT until he finds a safe moment to get me out. He says he has done this COUNTLESS times with girls...hiding them until he gets them out. (WTF!?) He tells me to keep my shoes OFF so I can leave quietly when he tells me.


3 hours pass. In that time I hear MORE people come into the house...its a DAMN PARTY! I am in this stupid linen closet fighting every instinct not to RUN...having to calm myself with the reminder that this isn't an option... TERRIFIED ANOTHER family member would come up and OPEN the door and end me. Every 30 mins John would come and open the door to assure me he was figuring it out. Each time the doors opens...my adrenaline would SPIKE.


Finally 3.5 hours in... he motions for me to follow him. Using hand signals and slow steps he guides me down the long hall..and down the massive stair case...watching for any family member that could peak around the corner from the kitchen and see me coming down the stairs. I make it to the front door...and force myself to calmly walk to my car that is parked RIGHT in front of their house and head home.


John text me and apologized..and THEN asking about meeting up again...only at my place. Seeing he was ready to do what EVER needed to protect his ""secret""... I didn't answer. I learned how to block a phone number that day. I honestly get how people can drop dead from fright.


That...was the LAST time I ever did a hook up with a total stranger.

"You know you’re gay when.......


You know you’re gay when you are watching Black Panther and when a scene comes on inside the apartment and your husband leans over and says “that bookcase in background is the same one we saw at that antique store yesterday”and you were thinking the same thing!!!"
"Grey sweatpants are a gift sent from God.


And I’m not even a believer."
"I tried to be social at a gay bar and couldn’t find the courage to start up any conversation with anyone and I’m in my car crying. What do I do?


So I have a lot on my place with school and a full time job, and I don’t get a lot of leisure time. So I decided to hit one of the big gay scenes near me and I walked into a few bars. Thing is I have a history of depression and anxiety, something I’ve been struggling with for years. I tried to look past this and take my shot at being social amongst the gays. I failed. I couldn’t do it. I walked in and they were so many people, and it just shot up my anxiety. Everyone was drinking and staring at dancers or talking amongst their clicks. I don’t drink so I tried to pass off walking around with a cup of water. The nerves hit me hard whenever I considered approaching someone. I had to leave one of the bars because I was on the verge of shaking. I’m so ashamed of myself, I’ve tried so hard to get to the point where I feel comfortable enough to walk into a gay bar and now I feel like a social failure. What can I do to improve my gay social skills? "
"Ever had those days where you have so many things to do but instead you just lay there, on your phone, doing almost nothing useful?


What do you do to get back on your feet? "
"Can we stop creating posts about wanting to stop other posts by people because it's annoying?


Just let people be gay!

EDIT: also republican gays are actual trash"
"It's been 8 whole hours without a Love, Simon post


And I'm just checking in to see if everyone still liked it."
"Just came out to my mom and everything feels surreal


I literally just got done telling my mom that I like dudes and she was really cool about it! I was hovering near her for what seemed like hours trying to muster up the courage to tell her but it was so much harder than I thought. I finally told her and the conversations went like this:

Mom: “oh okay, I don’t have a problem with that”
Me: “really? You okay with that” 
Mom : “yeah I don’t care”

Then I opened up for a hug and I didn’t think I was going to cry but I was scared for so long of possible rejection from my family and even though I knew they were okay with gay people, in the back of mind there was always a possibility of them rejecting me. While we were hugging, I cried and told her how I was scared for so long and pretty much what I already said. I also told her that I want to go to the doctor because of anxiety and all my problems (scared around people, feel like everyone judges me, I pull out my hair when I anxious, would ditch class due to fear, etc). 

Everything feels really euphoric and surreal, coming from a Hispanic catholic family, I expected the reaction from my mom to be a bit more taxing since she is really the only religious one in our immediate family but I’m pretty happy with the outcome. I always read the coming out stories here and this is where I gained the courage to tell her so thank you gay bros!"
"Does anyone else like when a guy lifts his arms and you can see a rift of pit hair? When he bends over and you can see butt cleavage? When he sweats and dark spots appear?


Like, is anyone else turned on when guys ignorantly go out in public wearing grey sweat shorts?  When they forget they’re in public and adjust themselves.

God I love men.  We’re such primal creatures.  Nothing turns me on like the way a man groans when he isn’t planning on groaning.

Yeah bro.  So hot.  No real point to this post, just looking to mine karma by reminding a bunch of gay dudes how hot dudes can be."
"Looking back, what is the weirdest thing you recall doing as a teenager?


I am beet red just remember this...but here goes: As a 14 year old gay horny teenager in the 1980s, in a SUPER religious home there was NO way to find someone to experiment with safely. (we lived in the country in Calif) When I was SURE I was totally home alone...I would get the Sunday newspaper and look up the ""Roommate Wanted"" Ads. Specifically the ""GAY Roommate Preferred"" Ads. I would call these numbers up and when a deep voice would answer I would ask, ""How big is your cock?"" Surprisingly 95% would answer! Then they would ask... ""How about you?"" From there it would launch into full on phone sex. I did this countless times. Very few hung up. When the call back technology began... the fun stopped. Amazingly it was a safe way to interact and these guys had no clue how old I was...and I felt I was still ""Good with God""...because...it wasn't in person. lol (damn mormon guilt) "

Hi

How are you?

You ok?

Handsome?

Hi!

Hi!

Hello....

Me *slits wrists* "
"I’ve realized that my girl friends and straight guy friends are great, but I wish I had a group of gay guy friends.


Mid-20s guy here. I get the sense that this would make me feel more fulfilled in some way, maybe I would feel less alone. Anyone ever feel this way? Guys with a group of gay friends, how is it? I hate to compare my life to social media, but when I see those big groups of gay friends on Instagram who live in DC or LA or NYC I think to myself “oh, that must be nice.” I want to leave the rural life once I finish grad school, and am going to try and live in LA...maybe it will be the worst decision of my life, but I think living in such a place could actually make me find something better than what my life is now.  
  
I think my problem is I’ve never fit in with gays. I love/lust over the fem gays, but I’m nothing like them. But I’m also nothing like those muscular, masculine men (whom I also lust over lol)  I see either. I don’t know how to go about this."
