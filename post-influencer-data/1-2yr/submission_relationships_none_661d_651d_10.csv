"UPDATE: Me [29M] and my best friend [26M] have a weird bromance and I don't know what to do anymore.


Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7es7ck/me_29m_and_my_best_friend_26m_have_a_weird/?st=JAHZG1SM&amp;sh=4f906bb0

Hello guys, I really want to thanks all of you who answered me and gave me the advices I needed.
I'm here to update you all, so here we go:

The day after I submitted my post I think you were right and I decided to move on and live my file. Casually I met a guy at work. We talked a lot and when it was time to say goodbye he asked me to go on a date with him on Sunday. I thought it was the right thing to do to live my life and said yes.

Meanwhile my friend was on a work trip and when he asked me how I was doing I texted him about the date. Ha just asked me who was the guy and than changed subject like he didn't care. I was fine that he didn't and never talked about it anymore.

So Saturday comes and me and my friend are hanging out as always. We are waiting ours other friends when he says he has to buy a gift and ask me if I could help him with it the next day. I reply that this is not possible cause I have the date with that guy. He says ""oh right, cool"" and then talk about something else.
About 15 minutes later he says he is feeling sick and that he needs to sit. So we find a bench where he can rest a lil and I say that if he needs to go back home I'll help him.

Things changed here. He told me that he was feeling sick cause he can't accept that there is another man in my life. That he can't deal with the idea of me spending all my free time with someone that isn't him cause he loves me. And than he cried.
We talked a lot. He said that he didn't realize it until I said about the date, that the idea of losing me drove he insane. He asked me to forgive him for rejecting me in the past cause he was blind and dumb. He kissed me and it felt right.

So I think we are a couple now, finally, lol. He is really scared about the fact that he is not ""straight"" anymore and that he needs time to deal with that. But he said that he is really happy to finally be free to love me and that he is really lucky to have found me. We just need to find our new dimension but I think we can make it work.

We broke the friendzone! 

Thank you all again guys and wish me good luck!

(I'm sorry if I made errors)

TL;DR my best straight friend, who rejected me in the past, couldn't deal with me dating another guy and finally broke the frienzone (and the straightzone). We are boyfriends now!


---


EDIT: wow, thanks guys for the kind answers!
We are aware that this is not our happy ending yet, we don't know what will happen in the future (like in every relationship) but we wanna try it.
I know he will need a really long time to figure everything out, accepting yourself is fucking hard, I've been through it too, but he says that he doesn't regret to have told me everything and that if he even is scared he is happy about us.
He is not trying to manipulate me, he was just really really idiot, he feel so guilty about the past and when he remembers something he did wrong he says he is sorry and that he is lucky I'm still here.
He even told me to go to the date if I wanted it.

I am scared too, i don't know what will be of us, I still need to understand that we are boyfriends now and not only friends anymore. I need time, we need time. I don't want to suffer, I don't want him to suffer.
I can only wish for the best for the both of us, whatever it will be..."

"My[35M] ex [35F] is dating my sister, how do I gothrough the holidays?


Hello to all of you, I have never done this so please tell me if I do things wrong.


Whe,I was 20 (in 2002) I met Nicole. Nicole and I hit it off immediately, we dated all through university, and moved in together. 5 years after we first started dating, we got married.


Nicole always got along with my family, my parents are very loving people and my older brother John and older sister Anne were always very kind to her. My youngest sister  Jeanne was not a big fan of Nicole, but she is4   years younger than me and was a bit of a rebel and a troublemaker. Despite that Jeanne and I  always got along great.

When Jeanne was 18 she came out as  a lesbian. Our parents had a hard time dealing with it and I talked a lot to them, to not be so touch and to remember that she was still their child. I had many talks to Jeanne about her feelings etc.


Jeanne developed herself, got involved in gay groups, started to dress herself very stereotypical, again, I talked to my parents. They turned around, all was great.

A few months after our marriage, Nicole became distant, would often go out with 'friends', had to work 'late'. 6 months into our marriage I confronted her: Was she unhappy? Was she seeing someone else?

She denied it. 9 months after our marriage she sat me down and told me that she had been seeing someone else and that she preferred that person over me. That I was amazing and that I would make someone very happy, but not her.

It hurt, a lot, I tried to change her mind, tried to do everything but no. In the end I told her that I only wanted her to be happy, she was my true love after all, and that if someone else made her happy. So be it.


Nicole quit off all contact with me afterwards. Only to sign divorce papers she showed up. About 1 month later I got a call from my older brother John. He basically told me how sorry he was he did not call sooner, but he thought I needed some space. And how he could not believe Jeanne did this to me.


To make a long story short: Jeanne and Nicole started an affair. After the divorce they made it public to John and they told him 'I knew'.


I talked to Jeanne once, and I asked her why, and how she could do this? She replied that she was finally happy and that I should be happy for her.



This has been 7 years ago. Jeanne and Nicole moved away to a different country. They are still together. My family was really mad at them at first but the last 2 years my parents have accepted it, and John and Ann try to.


For 7 years I have not seen them. I avoided going to my family when they visited. I lived abroad the past  2 years so never saw them.


This year we are al invited. We are all going. I am not looking forward to it at all. WHat should I do?

EDIT: I did not expect this to blow up like this, I'm at work and just checked in between breaks. Wow thank you all.

To clarify: I see that many of you are giving my family a hard time. I get that but I'm not mad at them at all. For 5 years they have really been mad at both women and they have been incredibly mad at Jeanne but I think being mad all your life does not solve anything. Please don't think think that they are happy family, there is still a distance between my parents and Jeanne, they are much more colder towards her.


EDIT2: Yes, I am dating someone, been together one year.She knows and understands the situation. I just want to state that I don't have feelings anymore for Nicole,but that does not mean I'm not hurt anymore. The wound was deep and I think I would have come to terms with it quicker if they would have owned up that it was not ok,  and that my feelings were valid.

EDIT3: Many queer people are reacting on this: please know that I have nothing against you. Funny detail, Nicole does still identify as 'straight'.

"[Update] My [24F] boyfriend [24 M] won't let go of the past


I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7d3wb6/my_24f_boyfriend_24_m_wont_let_go_of_the_past/) post last week about my relationship. I had last spoke to him on Wednesday, where I told him unless he could let go of the past and stop bringing things up, then this relationship was over. I was done being the emotional punching bag. I ended up breaking up with him on Saturday. I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but there were a couple of things that really sealed the deal for me.

When he came in the house, I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet so I went to go do that. As I'm brushing my teeth, he immediately stated that I was brushing my teeth wrong, and, ""When are you ever going to listen to me about how to brush your teeth?"" Then, when we went to my room, he asked how much I had cried since Wednesday. When he said this, he looked happy. Like it made him happy that I was so upset about this whole thing, like he took it as flattery. 

It was at that moment I knew it had to be over. I love him so much, and am pretty miserable, however I know I needed to do it. I keep thinking that if I were in his shoes, and the relationship was so rocky, I wouldn't be criticizing him on how he brushes his damn teeth. 

When I was breaking up with him, he kept saying this was the wake up call, and he was going to change. That I was giving up on him, and at least he can say he tried and I can't say that. He was relentless, but I stuck to my guns. Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help. 


It should also be noted that I am the same user who wrote a relationships advice post about having a boyfriend who wanted me to change my hair color. I'm pretty sure I deleted the post, so I cannot link it, but I honestly should have listened to you all then and not gotten so invested in someone who constantly felt the need to want to change me through controlling comments. 

EDIT: OH MY GOD! You guys are so awesome. I have been so upset, but reading these posts have further let me know I did the right thing. The hardest part is that there were great times, and even reading my posts I worry that I was too hard on him and painted him too negatively, but I'm seeing now that this is just me making excuses. I feel terribly guilty about how sad he must be, but I know this will soon fade. You are all absolutely amazing and kind.

Just to clarify, I was the girl whose boyfriend wanted her to stop bleaching her hair blonde because he couldn't date me unless he saw me ""natural"".

"I [33 M] caught my wife [30 F] of 6 years/together 11 talking to her ex bf she cheated on me with two years ago again. I'm done but should I tell HIS gf/fiancée who is 7 months pregnant?


Title says it all basically. The conversation was damning on his part and overtly flirty but she didn't stop it. I told her two years ago if she even spoke to him again I'm done. We have two small children which sucks . But apparently the guy is also in a relationship and the girl is due Feb. I took some photos of the text but my wife deleted most of it. Should I tell his girl or should I just leave it alone ?

TLDR: cheating wife with guy who also has a pregnant significant other. Should I tell her or leave it alone

"My [28M] Mother [68F] consistently gives me less than 3 hours notice for upcoming family events, how do I get it through to her that this is inconsiderate because, y'know, I have a life of my own


Just right off the bat, I do not live at home anymore so my parents communication with me is via 'e-mails' aka text messaging. My Mom consistently gives me less than 3 hours notice for upcoming family events. A prime example that's fresh in my head just happened today. My whole family was supposed to go watch a nephew play hockey and I got a text at 12pm saying 'we are all meeting up at 1pm, let me know if youre coming'


Frankly, I find this ridiculously inconsiderate but I can't be sure if I'm overreacting or if this is normal mom-stuff. Other examples include multiple family dinners where I've gotten a text in the early afternoon that there's a function only a few hours later that night. This actually caused a bit of tension in my previous relationship because my ex was insanely against last minute plans and when she would inevitably not show up my family would question why she wasn't there- that's a whole other story but highlights the fact that me getting little to no notice for things outside of major holidays where I KNOW we're meeting up (thanksgiving, christmas, easter) has been a regular thing for a while.


I've tried communicating with my Mom that it's not acceptable to me, that I find it inconsiderate and that if they want me to attend more family events they've got to let me know because I have my own life. Do I just stop showing up when she does this?
  

UPDATE: Dang, I've never had a reddit post with this many replies before, its gonna take me a bit to sort through... If I don't respond know that I appreciate all the advice I've been given! Simply knowing that there are others that are or have been in the same situation is really helpful and calming... thanks reddit u da real mvp


So the hockey game actually ended up being cancelled due to inclement weather (lol) but regardless, I decided to call my SIL and tell her I wished I could have made it out but wasn't given much notice, and to loop me in directly next time they are in town or the boys have a hockey game. I'm just going to bypass my mom from now on and pursue deeper relationships with my siblings, thanks guys!

"My boyfriend of 2 years [23M] cheated on me [19F] with my best friend [20F]


I don’t know what to do. I just want to cry and scream. I’ve never felt so much pain before. I know I sound stupid and young and most people are telling me “time will heal anything” but right now I honestly just want to die. 
It happened a couple days ago. My best friend called me crying and sobbing. I got seriously scared because she was just babbling “I’m sorry, please I’m sorry” without actually telling me the reason she was crying, then she told me. She said my boyfriend cheated on me with her a week ago and she felt guilty. I couldn’t say anything so I just hung up. 
She started sending me tons of messages about how sorry she was, asking me to forgive her, but I honestly don’t know how to feel. He was my boyfriend of almost 2 years and I really, really loved him. I still do. I can’t believe he did this. I messaged him asking if it was true and he didn’t even deny. He just said that “he’s sorry because she promised she wouldn’t tell anything to me”. I called him while I was crying and screaming and he just told me to calm down. I basically told him to go fuck himself and after tons of messages and missed calls yesterday he actually showed up at my door asking me to talk. I refused. I just couldn’t do it. 
I feel like shit. My best friend has always been prettier and smarter than me and she is just better under every aspect, but this time I actually thought I had found someone who preferred me to her. Guess I was wrong. The worst part is, I can tell she’s sorry. She keeps calling and messaging and pleading me to forgive her. But I’m not sure I can do it. But the thought of spending the rest of my life without her terrifies me. I’ve know her since we were 6. I don’t know what to do.
Sorry for this mess of a post, English is not even my first language.

**tl;dr**: boyfriend of 2 years cheated on me with my best friend who called me in tears and said she was sorry and I don’t know if I can forgive her or not.

"Me [26F] with my husband [30M] for 1 year, he gave me ""rules"" for my sister's birthday weekend


Next weekend is my sister's 30th birthday and we're celebrating with a girls' weekend out of town. It will just be me, my sister and her best friend attending. 

When I mentioned it to my husband he said I could go but also made a comment about how it was a weird way to celebrate her birthday. I thought his comment was rude but I let it go. 

Last night he said we needed to talk about the trip. He's concerned that my sister and her friend are both single- he said it doesn't look good. I asked him to elaborate and he said I don't understand, and can't understand, from his perspective. We talked for awhile but we weren't getting anywhere. So I asked what I could do to put him at ease and he came back with these ""rules"" and now I'm not sure what to think.

- He wants me to text him our plans for both days and update if anything changes

- He's going to randomly check in with me. I have to answer his calls or respond to texts within 10 minutes

- He wants to me Skype from my hotel room at midnight both of the nights

I'm kind of offended. I have never cheated or given him reason to suspect I was cheating. He's never accused me of cheating. I don't get drunk, put myself in vulnerable situations or behave irresponsibly. This is the first time I'll be traveling without him in the 4 years we've been together and I understand him having concerns but I feel he isn't handling it appropriately. It hurts my feelings that he thinks I need to be monitored like this in order to stay faithful to my husband and/or stay safe. 

How do I talk to him without sounding like I'm dismissive of his feelings? I'm afraid if I talk to him right now we'll end up fighting and I don't want that, I just want him to know I'm not going to do anything stupid and he can trust me.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My husband wants me to agree to his ""rules"" when I go out of town for my sister's birthday. I'm kind of offended by these rules and feel he's implying I'm incapable of controlling myself. I would like advice on how I can talk to him without sounding like I'm dismissing his feelings. 

Edit: thank you for all of the advice. I have a lot to think about. We'll definitely be talking about this again soon."
"My [26/M] girlfriend [23/F] of 3 years told her friends a personal kink of ours and she doesn't understand my being upset. How do I proceed?

"My (21 F) boyfriend (23M) is threatening to “rethink or relationships” if I go to a national competition I qualified for on a team for school because my partner whom I compete with is male (22M)


Throwaway because BF knows my main. I need some help knowing what to do :(

I have been on a few academic teams in college for 4 years now. This is the second year I have qualified for nationals. Last year I had a different partner (who is female), but she graduated. Jake (my current partner) has been in the team for two years and his partner from last year (they never qualified for nationals) also graduated. Jake and I are the two best scoring people on our team this year so we are partners now. And we qualified for nationals this year.

I guess I would describe Jake as a friend, but we aren’t close. The only times we have hung out outside of practice is when he came to my 21st birthday (everyone on my teams were invited), when we have gotten coffee specifically to review our content for the team, or getting drinks after practice (which everyone over 21 comes to, so it’s not us). We don’t really text or talk outside of team-related stuff though.

My boyfriend has been supportive of everything I do up until now. I’ve been with him for a year and he has come to see me compete and has met Jake and my other teammates. He has even met up with all of us for after-practice happy hour before.

When my boyfriend learned I got invited to nationals he wasn’t as excited as I thought he would be. He asked me if any other partnership from our team qualified (normally we have at least 3 pairs going) and I said unfortunately, no. It would be just me, Jake, and our two coaches (both 50s M- paid by the school). He freaked out and we got in a huge argument. He said it wasn’t appropriate of me to take a trip across the country with a bunch of men when I’m in a relationship and that I should tell me coach I can’t go and he can fill my spot with someone else (my coach would be PISSED). He said last year when I went and the other times when I have traveled with my team are different because there was a huge group of people and more women going.

I tried to explain that I will have my own hotel room, I won’t be rooming with any of them, but he didn’t care. He also said this shouldn’t be that important to me since I went last year. I tried explaining that Jake is better than my partner last year so we actually have a good chance of ranking high. He wasn’t having it.


The part that made me storm out was when he implied that my coaches were predators and that it’s “weird that they wanna travel alone with me like that” (DUH, no one else qualified to go!) and he said he doesn’t think it’s safe.

This is pretty gross to me considering i have known my coaches and been traveling with them since my freshman year of college. They are both father figures and mentors to me (they have kids my age for God’s sake). They are the ones who convinced me to apply to an elite grad program when i didn’t think i could get in and they have never ever don’t anything inappropriate that I know about with me or anyone else!

Are my boyfriend’s concerns valid? What should I do? He has never acted like this before and I really don’t want to lost him because i love him and we are comparable in every other way. I cried all last night about this. There is no history of lying or infidelity in our relationship. I always thought he liked Jake.


**tl;dr** boyfriend is threatening to rethink things if I go to a national competition across the country with my male partner whom I compete with and two male coaches. Despite the fact that I have traveled with all of them before, he says it’s different this time because no one else from my team is coming because no one else qualified to go. Im not really close to my partner and have no idea why my boyfriend would be upset. What should I do?

"My [15F] family still thinks my dad [38M] overreacted when mom [37F] hit me because he divorced her.


There's layers to this whole situation. I had a sister who died at 9 years old from cancer when I was 11. 

One day when I got home from school I wanted to go into her room to put the new flowers in her vase that she always liked. My dad even said it was OK and bought them for me. I accidentally knocked the vase over and it broke. It was a complete accident and I felt awful. My dad was on his phone talking to a client when he heard all the commotion with my mom going on upstairs. She had come in and was yelling in my face shaking me. She hit me in my face with a closed fist. My dad walked in right as she hit me. He pulled her away and was yelling at mom. He got right in her face angrier than I had ever seen him before. 

Dad kicked her out of the house and he won the divorce. Mainly because he knows some really good blood in the water type lawyers. He has sole custody of me and I haven't seen my mom in 2 years now.  

My family still has this idea that dad overreacted, and it's caused massive tension between dad and his parents. They believe he's going to start doing what he did when he was a teenager and sleep around. I know my dad is seeing a woman who's name is  Peyton but I've never met her. It's just caused a lot of tension because they still think he overreacted by divorcing mom.

"My [31F] boyfriend's [32M] brother [22M] upset me by talking about my mom's death, and my boyfriend is taking his side.


This Thanksgiving is the first time I met my boyfriend, Jake's, family. We've been together almost a year and are talking about moving in together, so it seemed like it was time.

In advance of our trip, I asked Jake to tell his family about my family. My mom was murdered when I was in my early teens. As she was a single mother, with no real family, I was bounced around to foster homes until finding a nice family to live with for the last few years of my teens. I am still in touch with that family, but not in a 'they're my family' way, just a 'send a Holiday card' kind of way. My mother's murder was obviously an extremely traumatic experience for me, and it was a somewhat notorious case in the area I grew up in, to the point where I occasionally get tracked down by the websleuths crowd or other gawkers and get harassed.

I asked my boyfriend to tell his family about this just to avoid any awkward questions about my family over dinner, because I've been put on the spot before at events and didn't really know what to say when pressed besides, 'My mom was murdered and I have no family! Pass the peas!' which makes things very awkward and makes me feel like crap. Also, my name is very similar to my mom's name, so sometimes when I meet strangers they will make a connection and be like, 'Like that lady who got murdered!' (For example, if my mom's name was Elizabeth Shoemaker, mine would be Ellie Shoemaker) not thinking I'm actually related to her.

So, the actual problem. The plan was to arrive on Thanksgiving for dinner and then stay the weekend. Jake and I got there, ate dinner with the family, helped with dishes, and were having an overall great time. His parents were lovely and didn't bring up anything awkward. I was finally getting comfortable when his parents decided to go see a movie with some friends in the evening, and Jake went with. I decided to stay behind because I had a headache. I was left alone in the house with the dogs and with his younger brother Chris, who just graduated college and moved back home.

Chris and I hadn't really interacted during dinner since we weren't sitting near each other, but he seemed like a nice enough kid. I didn't really expect to interact with him much, as I was lying on the bed in the guest room with a headache, but about five minutes after the door closed, Chris appeared in the doorway with the opener, ""Jake told me about your mom. Were you there when it happened???"" and started, believe it or not, peppering me with graphic questions about THE MURDER OF MY MOTHER. 

I was stunned and didn't know how to respond, so I repeated, ""I don't want to talk about this' and he finally said, 'Sorry' and left. I sat on the bed for awhile not really knowing how to react but feeling general unease, shock, and the mild feeling of panic I get when people mention my mom's death when I haven't mentally prepared to talk about it. About 15 minutes later, he was back, having Googled it, and excitedly started TELLING me what he read, how he found a forum where people have alternate theories, what did I think, etc. I again told him I didn't want to talk about this, and at this point closed and locked the door and stayed there until Jake got home.

When Jake got home, I was visibly extremely upset, and told him about my interaction with Chris. I told him that I'd prefer to go home; that he didn't have to come back with me, that I'd get a rental car and drive home, but that I didn't want to stay in the house with Chris. I expected some support (and genuinely didn't expect him to interrupt his holiday for me!), but he immediately told me that I was overreacting, that kids now have a morbid sense of humor, that Chris is a good kid, that it probably wasn't as creepy as I said, that he's just a kid, blah blah blah. I was shocked because I felt like Chris clearly crossed a line, and my gut was telling me that he was not a safe person for me to be around (not physically but I really did not want to spend the weekend with someone who was going to keep picking the scabs of the worst trauma of my life).

I ended up taking the car (which is actually my car) because Jake said his parents would drive him home. His parents were already in bed, so I left them a note thanking them and saying I had to leave suddenly because I wasn't feeling well. I drove four hours back home alone and stayed with a close friend all weekend. Jake's texts to me were short all weekend, and when he got back to his apartment he didn't come over or invite me over, and said that he was 'still angry' about the way I acted toward his family.

At this point I don't know what to do. I know I didn't overreact. 22 years old is young comparatively, but a 22 year old is not ACTUALLY a kid. He definitely seemed to be enjoying how uncomfortable he was making me, and I have had enough contact with 'websleuths' type people or people who are 'fans' of murders to know that he was being creepy and invasive. The fact that Jake is mad at me for all this makes me want to break up with him, and that's the part where I can't tell if I'm overreacting. Should I expect him to have my back over his creepy brother's? Should I bother trying to make him understand this? Can we have a relationship if I don't want to be around his family?

I'm sorry if this is unclear or disjointed, I am paranoid about accidentally giving identifying details so I may have messed some things up.

They have broken pipes, appliances, and have never lifted a finger for yard maintenance. Her husband is a mechanic and doesn’t wash the grease off his hands after work, so every surface is covered in black dirt and grease. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. 

They smoked in the house for years until she found out she was pregnant, so at least they stopped doing that. 

The other big element is my mom sold this house to my sister for a stupid low monthly payment and no down payment so they could own a home. This house went from a cute little tidy place in a nice neighborhood to the junkiest dump on the block. It’s falling apart, and they seem completely uninterested in maintaining their home. Her husband is a mechanic and supposed to be mr fix-it, so it especially pisses me off that he doesn’t fix stuff around the house.

I could live with all that before, but now she’s about to have a baby and raise it in that pig sty. I can’t allow my nephew to grow up in those conditions, and I’m almost scared if CPS ever came by they’d be in serious trouble.

Any time me or my mom tries to point out the unsanitary conditions, she just shuts down and ignores the conversation. It’s like she has a mental block that prevents her from seeing reality. She’s had friends straight up tell her it’s effing gross and they don’t want to come over because of it, and she tells me the story like they’re the crazy ones. 

My plan is to stay with her for awhile and do deep cleaning when the baby is born. I have to say something to her that will get her to understand that her living conditions are unacceptable to have an innocent baby in. I mean I get terrible congestion spending one night breathing the air in their house. 

Please anyone, what can I say or do to make her understand? I describe it as not having any shame. She’s in Lala land, and needs a decade-overdue talk about her cleaning habits. Thanks to anyone who read this long rant. 

TL;DR: My sister’s house is unsanitary and she’s bringing a baby into the world. How do I get her to understand that?"

"Update: Me [24 M] with abusive client [60s F]. How to cope with personal attacks from boss's friend?


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vzoz5/me_24_m_with_abusive_client_60s_f_how_to_cope). 
  
So, the original post itself did not get so much attention, but I figured I'd give you all an update if the folks who offered their advice were around.

I ended up deciding to just tighten my resolve and ignore the mean client, distancing myself from talk with and about her. I didn't want to let her drive me out of a job. And this worked until about three weeks ago.

At that time, the client herself started on a brand new string of abuse, calling our office, sending others emails about me, etc. for seemingly no reason.

A co-worker of mine got her on the phone yesterday, and through their conversation, it eventually came out my boss had been doing things to the client's accounts and services or instructing me to do things to the client's accounts and services and then pretending she had no idea about it. 

So, the grand conclusion is that, for some time now and unbeknownst to me, I had been made by my boss the scapegoat for decisions that often had *nothing* to do with me.

That perhaps explains quite a lot of the vitriol leveled in my direction, as the client wanted to know ""what gave me the right.""

So, my boss was not only not ""dealing with her"" or ""defending me"" but actively throwing me under the bus and then pretending to be on my side, showing me abusive emails as some sort of political power play or something/manipulation technique.  

I'm kind of stunned at the moment, but I guess it's a lesson learned. I've written a letter of resignation. My boss does not know I know. 

---   
  **tl;dr**: Tried to ignore abusive client. Her outbursts against me escalated a few weeks ago. It came out my boss had been using me as a scapegoat for her own decisions that angered said client.

"I (23F) received a weird break up text this morning from 25 (M) but I don't know how to interpret some of it.


Like the title states, I received two messages this morning from a man I have been seeing for a little over a month, close to two months. I had gone to his house the night before (yesterday) to make food for a gathering with friends we were supposed to have today. This morning he messages me two texts which had some confusing and also rather pointblank points to them. 

Text 1: ""[long list of my positive qualities and praising the time we have spent together], but honestly, I have only not introduced you to friends because I have standards which you fail to meet. Please don't take it the wrong way: your personality is lovely, and you are a good friend. I'm sure a man will someday be able to look past the rest and be what you need...

Text 2: Please don't let this reflect poorly on yourself. There isn't much more you can do to change your circumstances, as there is much little I can do to change my own. I do want to continue to be friends and if you are interested in FWB (even though you have voiced opposition this in the past but maybe now you will change your mind) then I'd love to meet you in bed after our long days. This would never be anything more than this dynamic as I don't want to date you. If we remain friends, I hope to hear from you soon. Have a great day..."" 

...so, what did I do wrong here? Should there even be a response or should I just let him go?

"My [F/24] current boyfriend [M/28] doesn't know his favorite Twitter comedian is my ex-boyfriend.


Reddit, this situation is messy. Before anyone asks, my current boyfriend and I have never talked about our past relationships. 

Before I met my current boyfriend I lived in a different city for college and I certainly had a type. I spent all of undergrad dating dudes in improv and comedy. As one would expect, some of my exes went on to move to LA or NYC after graduation and actually became pretty successful.

I met my ex-boyfriend ""Jonathan"" when I was a sophomore and he was a senior. We casually dated until he graduated and then remained in contact after that. After graduation Jonathan and I ended up in the same city and dated for awhile there before finally ending things. We had personality differences I couldn't reconcile. A lot of comedians are slightly narcissistic and their schedules make dating difficult. I still like and respect Jonathan but I knew it wouldn't work out for us long term as a couple.

My problem is that my current boyfriend loves Twitter and loves following ""underground"" comedians. The other day he sent me a link to a Twitter account he follows and said I should follow this guy because he's really funny. To my absolute horror, I followed the link to find the account belonged to my ex-boyfriend. 

Reddit, I'm stuck. My boyfriend brings up this Twitter account **all the time**. He tells all of our friends about it. He posts screenshots in our group chat. And most recently, he's started interacting with Jonathan on Twitter by commenting under his posts. The two of them are now having full blown conversations on Twitter. At this point it's a matter of time before something gives and my current boyfriend finds out. I need him to hear this from me first, but I don't know how to tell him any of this. 

This is such a stupid and weird problem, please help me reddit.

"Update: fiance's (27m) mother (43f) hates me (24f) after birth of our sweet baby (4mo)



https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bkokd/my_fiances_27_mom_43_decided_she_hated_me_the_day/

So, there were over 26k views and over 500 comments on my original post so I wanted to update you kind people who gave me advice. 

Story: we got engaged and planned to have our wedding a year later. We had fertility worries that were alleviated 6 months into planning so we postponed for another year so I could feel pretty in my dress and not be sick. I thought I had developed a good relationship with my fiances mother and I went very far out of my way to establish that with her. I helped take care of her mother when she was dying and all sorts of stuff. The day my baby was born, she decided I am a bitch and started making up awful stories about me. She was trying to turn the family (including my partner) against me. And things steadily got worse and worse. 

Update: I took a lot of the advice I was given and created tighter boundaries for her relating to my daughter and I chose to avoid seeing her (MIL) as much as I could. 


She continued to spread rumors and drunkenly call my fiance to tell him what a horrible bitch I was but she had very little available ammo to twist up because she hadn't seen me since I made the original post.

Then the universe smiled upon me and she moved to a different state! She drove off yesterday to live where gambling is illegal and to live in an alcohol free house! Hopes are high that she will either change or just not be around much. When we went to say goodbye, she pretended I wasn't even there and it was clear that she filled my uncle in law and cousins in laws' heads with lies about me because they were much less friendly than they used to be but, honestly, over all this was probably the best case scenario for an outcome. My baby and my partner are what matter most. 


Thank you all for your advice and perspective. We will see how things go from here but, it was nice to learn that even his mother couldn't turn my partner against me. He is happy she moved. He hopes the best for her and loves her But does not hurt over her living 1000 miles away. 

Thank you all, again. You people are what made me realize it wasn't my fault. 

**tl;dr: fiance's mother moved far away. She hated me since I gave birth to her first grandchild and I created a post looking for ways to repair it and was told that it was all on her. I began to avoid her and protect my baby from her as much as I could and now she moved and is not as much of an immediate issue.**"

"[Update] Me [21 F] with my friend/fwb/idk what [23 M] , I think we both want more but both of us are too shy to take the first step. Need advice on being the first to ask.


Original Post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/773cqa/me_21_f_with_my_friendfwbidk_what_23_m_i_think_we/

My first post didn't get much attention but I thought I'd give an update anyways.

So a few days after this post, Ben turned 24 and he essentially took me out on a date to the fanciest restaurant in our small town. He grew more...clingy? I guess that's the word I'm looking for. I didn't want to ask him on his birthday, so I gave myself a two week deadline to bring it up. At the end of the second week, I was due to go away for 4 days for a work trip. I figured if I asked by then and faced rejection, I'd have 4 days to cool down and figure out how to be okay with just friends.

So the end of the two weeks came, it was the day I was due to leave for my work trip, and I still hadn't brought it up. I know, I suck haha. Ben came over to ""help me pack"" and just spend time with me before I left. I made us dinner and brought up that he'd be meeting my brother when I picked him up in my hometown cause the bus station was in a bad part of downtown. Ben was surprised but not too phased. He helped me clean up and then we went to cuddle in my bed before I had to leave. While cuddling, he asked me what I've told my brother about him. I got all red in the face and said I was too embarrassed to say.

He brought up the fact that he's told his mom about me. So I said I would compromise and tell him what I said about him if he told me what he told his mom. He said that he's just told my mom what I was like and how close we are. And that his brother will talk about how much he liked meeting me to their mom. Then he said, ""Yeah so like my family knows your my girlfriend."" I immediately went ""oh *am* I?"" and he got all flustered and said ""well I mean if you want to be. Did you want to be?""

He then explained and apologized to me for not asking sooner. Basically he was too scared to ask me because I'm graduating in May and he's still technically a junior (after graduating high school, he went to his home country for his mandatory military service and then worked a while before going to a different university and then transferring here). I'm applying for jobs in a few different countries, including his home country, but won't know where I'll end up until the spring. Ben is scared of hurting my feelings if I get a job in a different country and we break up because of it. We had a long talk about the possibilities and decided to become official anyway. I couldn't be happier, I had the biggest smile the whole rest of the night. I honestly still can't believe this goober is mine haha

Now our biggest obstacle is me telling my mom I'm dating someone older (she's not a fan of age differences, or me dating in general) and that he's visiting in December. I'm still trying to figure out how to best phrase it and discuss it with her. I'll be telling her in person probably this Friday or Saturday. Wish me luck, any advice would be welcome for that!

"I [23M] grew up in foster care, but my sister [18F] was adopted at age of 4. We lost contact. Now we've reunited but we belong in different worlds entirely &amp; I need to keep her safe from mine.


We lost our parents when we were 8 and 3. Nobody in our family wanted us, so we were left to the system. She was adopted within months but I was left. The family that adopted her didn't want me around or in her life in any way, and soon moved and I couldn't even find them. Her adoptive parents were extremely wealthy. I didn't have the best of luck in the foster care system, several times I ended up in abusive situations and never had much stability. I was moved around a lot and always worried about my short and long term future. 

My sister and I back in contact about a year ago. She reached out to me on social media. We met and we were excited, but I also soon realized that we don't have anything in common. Her concerns are very different than mine. For example, just the clothes she was wearing was probably worth more than what I make in 3 months, probably even more. We're in entirely different worlds. I spent thanksgiving with her and her friends, and I had nothing in common with any of them.

She admits she completely forgot about me for several years. Maybe when she was 4 all the way until she was 15. Even after that she couldn't remember my face or anything about me, except my name. Obviously she was 3 when we were separated so it's not like she's at fault here, it's just natural. But the point of it is that we're effectively strangers. How can someone like that and someone like me be friends? 

I don't know what I can give her. She has many friends who have a lot more in common with her than I do. And they have a lot more life experiences with each other than we do. But I am still broken on the inside, I still have nightmares. I get anxiety attacks. I've had several concussions in my late teens and still have some struggles related to them. There are signs of abuse on my body.

I've kept that part of myself from her. But I feel like if we continue to spend time together and get closer, she'll eventually be exposed to the darker parts of my past. I fear she will blame herself for being the one who had a better life, maybe she'll blame her parents for not adopting me as well and that could hurt their relationship. She'll feel guilty and will probably want to do something about everything, but she's just 18 and even though I don't doubt her compassion, she's still a kid. This is too much for her to handle. She's happy and enjoying her life and thinks everything worked out fine in the end for us, bringing her to my world will just end all of that.

That's why I think keeping her at an arm's length might be better in the end. She wants me to go on a vacation with her during the Christmas break, just the two of us. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go and spend time with her. But I'm worried that spending full days and nights together is very different than spending hours together. I'm sure to get nightmares and anxiety attacks, and she'll know something is up. And I'll have to tell her everything.  

I'm struggling with the selfish side of me who wants to tell her everything to bring us closer and the big brother side of me who wants to protect her and keep her safe from knowing things that she can't change, to avoid her from feelings guilty or upset.

What should I do? Both about our relationship in general and about the Christmas vacation.

  **tl;dr**: We lost our parents at ages 8 and 3. Sister was adopted by a wealthy family and I grew up in the system. Now we've reunited, but we couldn't be any more different. She's interested in me and wants to rebuild our bond but I'm worried that I'm too broken to be a good brother for her, and exposing her to my issues and my history will cause her to feel guilt and sadness, and put her in a position to resent her adoptive parents, and feel helpless because there's nothing she can do to help me anyway."

Today we were having a conversation about what makes us who we are, what type of people we strive to be, etc. Somehow within the conversation he ended up saying, “Yeah, you let people’s bullshit walk all over you, that’s why I can manipulate you so easily.” 

He walked away after saying it and it hurt me quite a bit. I don’t even know how to interpret this, what should I do? Should I talk to him about it, ask him what he meant? Or is this just overthinking a simple comment? It’s very confusing and quite upsetting as we are supposed to be moving in a few weeks, this is making me rethink things.

"Wife's best friend [32/F] is asking for an honest assessment of why she's single. Should I [30/M] tell her?


My wife's best friend ""Sheila"" [32/F] has been very involved in our lives because she mostly doesn't have one of her own. She's tried dating services, online dating, matchmakers and fix-ups through friends and work. Nothing seems to stick. Usually it's a couple of dates, maybe a romp, and then she's single again. 

Sheila isn't meeting the wrong guy, Sheila's problem is that, although she really wants a partner/lover, she does everything in her power to push them away, make dating her difficult and unpleasant, and not worth the hassle. When a relationship falls apart, she spends the next week at my house making ME miserable. She's nice and I've learned to love her, but she's lived alone too long (she was an only child, so sharing is... difficult). She doesn't know how to live in a household, she doesn't know how to share her space/time with other people and is used to everything being her way. Her parents raised her to be the center of the world from a young age and as an adults, it's really an emotional handicap. 

Sheila's most recent relationship just ended before Thanksgiving and she's spent the last week with us. She's been asking ""What's wrong with me?"" and ""I'm serious, tell me what I'm doing wrong."" The thing is, when people say that, they usually want you to lie to them. The thing is, she's getting more and more desperate and she's not changing in any way that will give her better outcomes. Is it worth telling her the truth, in as gentle a way as possible?

She likes to play games; she creates improbable scenarios and then gets upset when they don't ""do it right."" She is so particular that when putting away mugs ***in my house*** they are color coordinated, by size and facing all the same direction. I put one away ***in my cupboard*** and she almost had a stroke. She's demanding, difficult and her standards are so high that no person could meet all of them. She's tempestuous and can say things without thinking - she and I work in similar fields (she's a designer and I work in corporate strategy but along side some marketers). When I got a promotion, instead of congratulating me, she tried to rationalize why I was chosen and why she isn't getting promoted. She then realizes what she said (45 minutes later) and apologies. That's poison for a relationship. I've learned to love her, but most guys aren't going to. 

Is it a mistake to talk to her? Should I say nothing? And if I say nothing, is there a classy yet effective way to get her our of my house?

"Boyfriend [26M] revealed that I [24F] was the back-burner girl when we first met. He was gunning for someone else, but settled for me. How to get past this?


I know this all sounds super immature and I'm sure lots of you will tell me to grow up, but I've been so anxious and upset in the past two days I just need some advice. 

So bf and I have been dating 1.4 years. We have amazing chemistry, perfectly matching values, strong attraction, and just everything else you want in a good partner. Oh yeah, I can definitively say we're in love. 

Two days ago he told me something that really shocked me and I don't know how to deal with it yet. When we first met he told me that he liked me immediately and I felt the same. We ""casually"" dated for maybe 2-3 weeks before becoming official. During that time, he told me he wasn't seeing anyone else. 

Well what actually happened was that while he was seeing me, he was also seeing this other girl, Alyssa. He met her first and was REALLY into her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. So, he confessed that he saw us at the same time, but what initially drove him to ask me out on a date was that his friends urged him to keep dating multiple girls to keep his mind off of Alyssa. When he met me, he said he felt some chemistry, but most of him still hoped that things with Alyssa would work out first and foremost. 

Ultimately Alyssa wasn't interested after about a month or two of casual dating, and the day she texted him that was the day he met up with me and we became ""official."" I just feel...I dunno really hurt and confused? I told a few of my girlfriends, and they told me I'm being dramatic, that if our current relationship is good then that's all that matters.  

But looking back I feel like a lot of things make sense now. I remember when we first started dating he'd tell me he was throwing these house parties on the weekend, but I was never invited. I always thought that was strange but never cared too deeply. Well, now I know that he threw those parties with the sole purpose of inviting Alyssa, so not inviting me was very strategic. Furthermore, I remember how he'd take FOREVER to get back to me about plans I suggested. It turns out he was intentionally waiting to see if Alyssa would be free first, before committing to any plans with me. The worst thing I found out was when he canceled on a carefully planned date night of mine because she asked him out to coffee last-minute. He had claimed he was sick to me. 

Now he told me all of this out of guilt because apparently she texted him out of the blue a few days ago. He said he immediately felt guilty for lying to me all those times for her, and he's blocked her number since. I know this all happened ages ago, but why do I still feel so terrible and am I being overdramatic? We have a great relationship now, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened had Alyssa decided to date my bf. I'm sure he would've chosen her. 

Anyways, what should I do now, move on or what?

"My [27F] dad [57F] is threatening to cut me off because I’m coming over for Thanksgiving breakfast instead of dinner.


Edit: Fathers gender is M not F.


I’m a daddy’s girl, an only child, to a great set of parents. They are well off and worked their asses off for it, coming from the trailer park to where they are now. (I grew up in said trailer; just trying to add relevant context.) We went from eating whatever we could get from the food bank for dinner when I was a small child to having anything we could ever dream of. I give my parents tremendous credit and they are truly my heroes. 

One catch; my dad holds everything over my head money wise. Even before I could work he would make me thank him for every meal, he consistently brings up how great of child hood was and how I’ll never be able to give my daughter the same life, how I’ll never be as successful as my parents (all true, just hurtful.)

One time in college I didn’t answer his phone call after crashing one morning pulling an all-nighter to study for midterms and he drained my account to “teach me a lesson.” I scraped together change and did odd jobs to eat the rest of the semester on short notice. Then when he was “over it” he randomly put money in my account again and called me so I could thank him, around finals time. Emotionally draining. Since then I got a consistent job so I wouldn’t be dependent on him. 

I don’t actually take money from him anymore, but money comes up. He noticed my tires were near the wear bar and took my car while I was at work (mom has spare keys for cars and apartment as a safety net, I have copies of theirs) and got me four new ones plus a full tank of gas. I was grateful but I didn’t ask for it and he kept bringing it up so I could thank him for weeks. It’s exhausting. 

I just had a child recently and my mom has been bringing over meals and groceries to help me out the first few weeks. When I was cleared to drive I went over for dinner and it was the first thing out of his mouth:

“must be nice to have the groceries we bought.” 
“who else can help you like this?” 
“Aren’t you grateful to have parents like us?”

Yes, yes and yes. I always say thank you, always give compliments, always send thank you notes when appropriate. It’s never enough. 

I have asked him to stop, told him I am old enough to be on my own, married, with a child. I pay my bills and we are buying a home. He still just “helps” whenever he feels like it. 

Today was the last straw; he called and screamed at me because I was coming over for breakfast with my daughter and having dinner with my husbands family for Thanksgiving. He called me a piece of shit and asked why I would have dinner with the people that can’t help finically vs. them. Said he’s “cutting me off” and “I’ll never see him or his money again.” My husband was in the room and went to grab the phone but my father hung up. I’m honestly embarrassed he heard it first hand and how he shamed my husbands family because they couldn’t help money wise. 

I’m honestly ready to go no contact, I just can’t take it anymore, it’s constant ass kissing, especially when I don’t ask for the things he gives. My question is how can I do this without cutting contact from my mom? And is it fair to cut off my daughter from him too? Am I being a spoiled brat? My head is spinning. 

**TL;DR** Dad is super manipulative with money and I want to go no contact. "
"Husband [28M] has been responding strangely to me [28F] over the past several months


There's not one specific thing he is doing that is unusual, so I'll have to just give several examples. Also, please keep in mind he is not acting angry. His behaviors have been reminding me of a frustrated or pouty child.


-I'll tell our toddler, ""I love you"" and he will say, ""What about me?"" Or he will pretend that I'm saying it to him and will say, ""I love you"" back, even though I might be across the room, playing with our child. (I tell him I love him all the time so I don't understand why he's doing this.)


-Our child will run up to him and give him hugs when he gets home. They'll cuddle and play for a minute. He will point out that I didn't hug him* immediately*, as if I should what? Block our kid from getting to him first?


-I'm working on my Master's degree. Whenever I mention something good about it, he will very dramatically lament about how horrible his program was, how he didn't finish it, and how stupid he is. (His words, not mine.)

-If I (always very calmly) explain to him that I don't like something he's doing or saying to me, he will sometimes say okay. But then later in the day, or even the next day, he will parrot back to me what I said to him EXACTLY word for word. I'll ask him why he's repeating what I've said and he'll claim he's not and that I'm making things up.


-He will make extremely passive aggressive remarks about my major or simply remarks meant to annoy me.  I don't want to say what my major is for the sake of anonymity, but as an example let's say I intern with special needs kids. He'll see a kid with down syndrome on tv and call them retarded, or say he wonders why the parent didn't abort. He doesn't actually feel this way, and tells me he says these things as a way of playing around with me...trying to have fun. I've explained to him that these types of comments are upsetting and to please not make them again. Yet, he will a few days later despite acknowledging that we've talked about it. The strange thing is, he seems genuinely upset that my reaction is the same. He seems...confused that it's not funny to me.


-The other day he tried to feed our kid burnt toast. Kid was upset about it and refused to eat. After a half hour of Kid complaining I asked my husband if it was cool if I fed Kid something else. He went on this big long rant about how I act like he's controlling and abusive. He went on to ask why I'm acting up and trying to ruin his day. However, if I had just given Kid more food, he would've said I was undermining his parenting. (Since he said that before in a very similar situation.)


-He always has to one-up anything I complain about. For example, if I casually mention that I've had a headache throughout the past hour, he will suddenly have had a migraine for the past three days.

-He will text me and call me repeatedly throughout the day while he's at work to tell me about everything. Every conversation he has had, every task he did no matter how small, which gas station he went to, if he peed or pooped. What snacks he ate.  Then he will tell me everything again as soon as he gets home, and if I tell him we already talked about it, he will seem hurt. If I don't mention it, he will talk for hours.

If I bring up any topic, he might fixate on it, research it, send me links, pictures, etc. Even if he's at work. It could be about a random historical fact, food item, etc. Anything. 

Once again, I'd like to emphasize during all this he seems like a upset child, and not an angry adult. I'm sure he's not doing drugs. There weren't any major life events either positive or negative in the past year.

What could be going on? How do I handle this? And yes, of course I've tried talking to him about it. He will either outright deny he said something, or tell me I've taken things out of context, or he will make up something I've said that will justify his actions. OR he will become very hyper (for the lack of a better word) about it and demand that I give **specific** examples, word for word, and have the exact date and time, or else it must not have happened.


Tl;dr: Husband has been acting strangely throughout the past several months. Talking to him about it goes nowhere. Not sure what to do."

"Boyfriend (28M) will indirectly cancel plans but frame it so I give him permission, then refuse to hear that I'm upset he's a flake


Sorry if the title isn't fitting I had a hard time summing up what I'm upset about, and also I am 23F. So basically boyfriend of 2 months has a pattern of being flakey with plans, but does it in a way where I have to either be the bad guy or accept him blowing me off. I don't go out as much as him, so it'll often be where we plan to hang out after he goes out for drinks or something with friends. The evening will go on, usually past when he said he would come over and then one of the following texts comes.

Excuse: ""we are having a really good time/I haven't seen this friend in forever/its already so late/so and so really wants me to stay out

but

Putting it on me: are you going to be mad if I don't come over/i'll come over if you want me to leave them""

This upsets me for multiple reasons
1. He's already shown he'd rather hang out with his friends, so I know he doesn't actually want to hang out
2. It puts me in the position where I have to be the bad guy and force him to leave his friends, which I don't want to do in the first place, but also because of 1
3. If I ever express being upset about him blowing me off he comes back with ""but I asked if it was ok and you said yes/I would have left if you had said so/you were just trying to trap me""

I understand where he's coming from, but the point is he consistently blows me off for his friends and thinks its ok because I'm not going to force him to hang out with me if he doesn't want to. But I feel like a crazy girlfriend coming at him with the ""I want you to WANT to hang out with me"" line. I understand how that is frustrating for him to have to read the subtext of our conversation, but I feel stuck. I can't make him prioritize our plans over his friends, I can't/won't/don't want to force him to leave doing something he already showed he would rather do than hang out with me, but him putting the burden on me to approve it makes it impossible to address the problem without looking crazy. Please help!

TL;DR: Boyfriend blows me off to hang out with his friends but asks for my permission first. I don't want to force him to hang out with me when he would rather hang out with friends so I say ok. This gives him immunity over me being upset at him blowing me off because I said it was ok"
"My [F/24] sister [F/20] is a self-described ""dead beat"" who wants to live with me


My sister is a self-described ""dead beat"" who is purposely doing nothing with her life.  Her performance academically and athletically has always been poor, and she frequently skipped school or team sports events growing up.  She dropped out of one high school and then barely graduated another.  She attended community college, but had to withdraw without finishing classes because of poor grades.  She has never lived on her own, and keeps jumping from my father's house to my mother's house to my house, usually without paying rent.  

She has worked sporadically in fast food, but currently isn't employed.  She usually stays up until 4am on tumblr or Facebook, sleeps until past noon, and has no other friends or hobbies to speak of.  She used to have a small friend group of more alternative kids, some of whom were arrested for breaking into houses, petty theft, etc. and she's done some things like this in the past too but has no criminal record. 

Now she wants to move into my apartment.  I pay for my apartment with student aid, and I'm a full time student at the university here.  She talks about going to community college here, and had an appointment with an adviser today but missed it. 

I'm not just trying to vent about my sister. I can understand what she's going through a lot, and I know I'm not perfect either.  But I do have things going on, and I'm fairly busy.  I'm terrified she'll just be a burden on me if she lives with me.  

My parents want her to live with me for free because my housing is already paid for by student aid anyway, and I have an extra room that could be used as a bedroom. Because I'm older, I think they expect me to help her and mentor her, but I've talked to her enough to know she's not interested in that at all and actually describes herself as a ""dead beat,"" almost as a source of pride.  Whenever I mention different ideas or possible programs she could apply to, she never takes my advice.  (She also had a low high school GPA and says she doesn't even know one person who could write a letter of recommendation.) She is not interested in changing. 

***TLDR: Sister is a self-described ""dead beat,"" has no job and keeps jumping from house to house in our family, usually without paying rent. She wants to live with me now and my family supports this. How can I say no and help her find something else? "

"My (23f) sister (29f) just told me that my fiance (24m) hit on her and grabbed drunkenly grabbed her butt and boobs yesterday. I'm shocked and befuddled. Is this a one off or burn it with fire territory?


I'm going to keep this short because I don't want to bore anyone with my stupid life. 

Went to dinner at my family's for thanksgiving. My fiance, who I've been with for 3 years, came with me. My brothers got him into a bottle of scotch (and eventually everything else) from the second we walked through the door and all four of them were so drunk by the time dinner rolled around that they didn't even join us for dinner. 

Everyone pretty much had the opinion of ""boys will be boys"" and no one seemed to care or think they were in the wrong. I could tell something was off with my older sister however. 

Dinner ended and we left, fiance slept it off and today seemed fine. About fifteen minutes ago my sister called me and said she had to talk. She got right into it that at some point yesterday my fiance pulled her aside and said ""you're so hot"" and very forcefully grabbed her butt and ran his hands up her side to her breasts. She says she slapped him and he said he was really sorry and she moved on. I asked why she didn't tell me yesterday and she said it was just so awkward. 

I asked my fiance what the hell was up and he has no memory of the event, or so he claims. 

I don't have any reason to think my sister would lie to me so I think this probably did happen, but at the same time my fiance has never, ever acted like this before, he's never cheated on me and he's never had any sort of wandering eye. I have no reason to think this will ever happen again but at the same time, I don't want my sister to feel uncomforable around us.

Is this a relationship ender? Because honestly I don't know. I can consider this a one off but at the same time I want to respect my sister. I don't know what the hell to do because I love my fiance but if this were anything else, I'd be livid and want him hung from the rafters.

"my (17m) mom (43f) made fun of my date (16f) for her appearance. I feel so bad for her and don't know how to make it better


I'm a junior and I've been lab partners with this girl Janine in chemistry since the beginning of the year. She is very smart and one of the funniest people I ever met. I think she is very good looking but in sort of a non traditional way. I finally got my courage up to up ask her out this last week and we decided to go see a movie on Saturday. Her dad has a rule that when she goes out she has to drive because he thinks boys are idiots when they drive so she came  to pick me up at my house. When she got there my mom basically said ""wow, you are so handsome not what we were expecting but handsome."" I could tell that Janine was kind of like taken aback because she is already self conscious about her looks and it really sucked because it just made the rest of night awkward because my moms comments were just like I would rather her not say anything or compliment Janine on her brains or what not. 

What so crazy about this is my mom is a total feminist and  I never ever thought she would say something like this. I asked her when I got home what she meant by calling Janine handsome and she said basically that she always expected me to date girls who were better looking. I said that wasn't cool mom and she said some times the truth is the truth and needs to be said. I said she really hurt Janines feelings and then my mom made a really mean joke about Janine looking like a football player. I didn't know what to say because my mom is so not this person because she's so into equal rights for women, gay and trans people and hates Trump with a passion (my mom spends like 90% of her free time on reddit to hate on Trump she's so into it). 

I didn't really talk to my mom today and I tried to text Janine a few times, hit her up on AJ and roblox and even our schools chat system and even though I can see she's on she isn't hitting me back. I feel so bad about all this. But I also feel that if the off chance she didn't understand my mom was being so horrible I can't go like ""hey sorry my mom called you an ugly lineman, here's flowers baby.""

How can I make this up to Janine? Or is this like totally blown.

"My [30F] husband [31 M] won't stop doing his mom's [52] finances and it causes us to fight.


My husband L has always been there for my mil, he grew up with an alcoholic dad and his mom didn't speak any English. So he learned from a young age (13) to help /do his mom's finances and run the house work his 7 other siblings, some older than him, but he was the oldest boy, since she always said she didn't understand and she needed help. Fast forward to now, not only does she understand a good amount of English there are plenty of resources for people who speak Spanish. She is married to a great new guy [53] who lived for years doing his own stuff financially. We are married with careers and 4 kids. We are busy and barely find time to do our finances. We've been married for 8 years and I'm tired of the same argument that I try to not bring it up. Anytime I complain or against what he wants to do with his mom he 
L gets defensive and always fights with me. We have fought in the past about :

- him getting a car and a mortgage for her in his name 

- letting her overdraft protection be from our personal accounts

- putting her bills on our credit cards because he can transfer the money later when she has it

- fixing her mess of overspending so there's no money for bills

And lots of other things through the years of our marriage. I've told him to just teach her and her husband (he used to do his stuff) to take it off his plate since he's so busy. L says he likes doing it for his mom. I've told him fine but keep our money separate before talking to me about it. Well we did our finances and I saw a few transactions of her cell phone bill and a doctor bill that turns out, ""oh she asked me to pay so I put it on our credit card."" and a fight started after. 

I've told him if his mom needs help why not some of his siblings and he always says ""they will just mess it up"". But really it's because all of them have said let her do it herself. She always overspends and gets overdraft, so L says it's because she will mess it up. I think it's more like she doesn't know how much she ever has and so she just spends and spends. Her husband can do it with her, but now he's used to L taking care of everything for the both of them, he wouldn't know what to do. There's always a reason why stopping isn't an option. 

Now I will say the I love my mother in law like my own. She's amazing, so giving, and so helpful. I know if we told her she would be fine with it, but she'll feel bad that she caused issues in our marriage. My husband is the same with his family and ours, in every other way he's an amazing husband and father. This is the one area in his life that is an automatic fight with him. He says I'm uncaring and to let him help his mom. I just think he should get help because if something happens to him her finances would be messed up, his siblings can help to reduce the stress in his life, and his mom and her husband can work together on a budget to stop the overspending together. I always feel like the bad guy, the one who is his family's enemy, the one who is mean about his mom. I've told him this for years and he said about two years ago he would stop and anytime I would ask he'd snap on me for pressuring him. I'm tired of fighting about this, should I just let it go? Am I not being understanding?

"I [22 M] think I got married a bit too soon to my [22 F] wife.


We've been married for half a year, before that, dated for a year, and known each other for 4.

I want to begin by saying that I love her, a lot. With all of my heart, and a little bit more. We were each other's crushes and it all was fantastic, she was the first lady to give me the love I needed.

We always shared and commented what we had in common; talked for hours, just hanging out. It was marvelous.

She showered me with love letters, and I gave her my attention and support. We helped each other out of the holes we were in, on our individual lives.

We both were sure we were meant for each other, and quickly agreed to marriage. Why would I not want to be with such a wonderful person all of my life?

I wanted to give her something she told me she wanted-- a home. I finished college, got a job, and moved out of my parent's, into a small rented house. But she told me her parents would not approve of her moving in unless she married. And so we did.

Living together was sweet. We had each other all the time. I learnt to cook, and started learning how to DIY; things I never wanted to do before. I wanted to ensure she had everything.

Time passes, my heart starts aching as I realize that some things are not as I expected them to be. Sure, the house is a bit messy, but I'm positive we can make it better. Okay, she doesn't quite like my cooking, and I don't quite like hers. No biggies, I can live with this.

I start realizing that there's a rift beginning to form between us-- things we had previously affirmed we could overcome together. She's a Christian, and I'm an Atheist; she got a bit upset that I didn't like going to church with her and took it personal. I try to compensate with other home tasks while she is away at church, to make up for it.

I begin to wonder -- is she the right person for me? A little bit too late. I always pictured us playing videogames together. But every time I try to get her to play one, she doesn't like it. Not even Single-Player games. I was sure she was into videogames.

We stop making love at her request -- she has issues and I respect that, I try to be supportive, but I can't help but feel rejected.  This is not what I wanted.

I ask her to do a chore for our home, and I end up being guilt-tripped into doing it, or neither of us does it at all. I feel like I do everything at home, and I can't ask her to help or she'll get upset.

I can't share my thoughts anymore; she'll probably feel offended or get upset. No matter how much I try to sugar coat something or ""pretty please"" it, I never seem to get a break.

I love her, and I want the very best for her. I know she loves me, she tells me every day, and we talk about our feelings every now and then. I keep promising that we'll be together forever, but the picture keeps getting blurrier for each day that passes

We promised we would bring out the best of each other. But I don't feel like the best version of myself.

So Reddit, I don't know what other details I can say, without revealing too much about myself. I feel bad just writing this, but I really need some advice.

TL;DR: I love her, but I don't think I like her anymore.

"I [26/F] am dating a guy [26/M] who behaves like we're in a relationship but says he doesn't want one


Hi everyone,

so I [26/F] have been dating this guy [26/M] for 5 month now, we've know each other for 8 month, and we recently had The Talk.

First of let me tell you how things are right now: We see each other at least 2-4 days a week, spend the night at each other places a lot. We sometimes meet for just 30mins if our schedules don't allow anything more. I work shifts as a nurse and he does a lot of volunteering so it takes a lot of planning to get together this often.
We text constantly, when we see each other we have great talks &amp; cuddle a lot. He has a small shelf in my wardrobe with his stuff and I have stuff at his place. We decided we were going to be exclusive about three month ago but because of things happening in my life decided not to have the relationship talk.

It's great and he's an amazing person, very understanding and supportive and loving. He even came over to take care of me while I was sick. He knows my roommate/best friends and they get along great too. When we were at a party together he would constantly hug and kiss me. And we have travel plans for May in a foreign country

So now I asked him about where he sees this going. He said he ""doesn't feel like this is a relationship"" &amp; he loves things the way they are, it's wonderful and comfortable etc. He explained that since I don't know where I'm going to go for school (probably gonna stay here but it's not clear yet) and he might go abroad for a year in a couple of years he doesn't see this going the relationship way.
Also he likes me so much he wants to be friends in ten years and he's worried that this isn't going to happen if we call it a relationship. He wants to keep this going the way it is going.

Initially I agreed because being with him makes me very happy and he's a wonderful person but in the past week I realized that this isn't good for me. I've been crying a lot &amp; obsessing over it. Also when we did hang out I felt weird and not as close to him previously. I wanted to give it a reasonable time to see how I felt about it but after last night I fear I have my answer. We were making out and i had to stop and go to the bathroom to cry because I felt horrible and lonely and the opposite of turned on. I couldn't even tell him what was going on because I didn't want to spring this on him at 2AM being a sobbing mess.

**UPDATE**: thanks for all the advices, it confirmed for me that I wasn't being unreasonable. I called my mom and explained my point of view. She was a bit disappointed, but she understood that it was important for me. I also called my sister to relay the info and we agreed to take the Christmas photos on a different day, at her place. I'll bring some BBQ chicken to make up for it. Good resolution all in all, I guess I just needed to share my point of view and stand up for it.

**ORIGINAL POST**: My sister and her husband decided to treat my parents and I to an 'escape room' activity and a restaurant, to thank us for babysitting her son a few times. I thought it was a nice idea, but while talking about possible dates, sunday the 26th came up. I warned everyone at that point that I already had some plans for the whole afternoon + part of the evening (2 pm to 7 pm). My sister said that we would talk again to figure out some date that worked for everyone.

Well yesterday I got a text from her saying that she had made the reservations for the escape room at 5 pm, and the restaurant right after, at 6:30 pm). I answered that I couldn't make it, but that I would try to come to the restaurant, maybe in time for the dessert. She argued a bit that I should move my other plans, but I just said that I would try to make the other thing start a bit early, yet I'm sure that I can't come before the restaurant.

Now for a bit of context, I would like to do those activities, but not quite as much as my other plans and, either way, I already gave my word for the first thing. I'm not mad that they planned it on the same day, I understand that it's hard to find a date that works for everyone and so I accept that I'll be left out. Yet today I received a message from my mother:

&gt; Can you please make an effort so we can have a family day? We also want to take the picture for the Christmas greetings card *(a family tradition)* and so we need you at your sister's place at 4 pm. It's really important for me...

I can't help but feel that I'm getting guilt tripped: my mother's birthday is coming up, although we will have some other occasion to celebrate it. All in all I don't feel that I have to cancel my earlier plans, since I see my parents once a week. I did manage to get my thing to start at 1 pm, but it's the kind of thing where you need to be there all the way, or not at all. And as such I would keep my original answer, and join my family only for the middle/end of dinner.

Am I being unreasonable for wanting to stick to my original plans?

**EDIT 1**: since some people asked about my relationship with my family, I believe it is good. My sister can be a bit pushy, but here it's from my mom that I feel guilty. She's usually the one that bends over when we make plans.

"How can I [28 M] get my gf [24 F] of 6mo to stop having duty sex with me?


Hey /r/relationships,


So I have an issue in my relationship that I wanted to get some input on since the situation makes little sense to me. Maybe you folks can help me figure it out?


So I've been dating this girl for 6 months now. My gf is very smart and beautiful and is usually constantly being pursued by other guys. Our relationship was good in general the first month or so but since then it has gone really downhill, especially in terms of our sex life.


My gf is currently finishing up her last year of college, and I have a full time high paying career in STEM.


In many ways our relationship is ok. My gf likes to do many things with me. She likes to go out to restaurants and events and such. Likes to do lunches and dinners and shopping and all that kind of stuff. When we do these kinds of things she likes, she is very happy, like genuinely. Since my gf is in college and I work, I usually end up having to foot the bill for all our activities, but I don't mind. 


The real problem is with our sex life. And I'm really confused. When we do our activities, my gf seems very happy and keeps telling me how she'll do all sorts of sexual things if we go out to X event or Y new restaurant. However, after we do the events and get back, she is never in the mood and there is always an excuse. I've told her many times that I don't need her to 'bribe' me with promises of sex which she has no intention of keeping, and that I'm perfectly happy just taking her to those places and spending time with her. She says she understands and apologizes for making promises she can't keep, but keeps doing it. I don't understand why.


We have sex around twice a month, and every time now its completely awkward and strange. She is never turned on, and when I try to do some foreplay with her to turn her on, she refuses to let me and just wants me to 'put it in and get it over with'. This is additionally strange since she has told me that she used to love having 'hours and hours' of foreplay with her ex. Our sex usually only lasts about 2 mins, since if I don't orgasm within that time she says she wants to stop. This is increasingly hard since she is never turned on, and so it feels terrible. 
I have told her that I'm not comfortable with this 'duty sex' arrangement, and that I would like to work on making our sex life better, but she usually either just gets upset when I say that and shuts down, or says she understands and will work with me on it, but then just doesn't do anything.


I've tried many many things to get her interested. I've wined and dined her, buy her the gifts she likes, listen to her needs, and give her support when she needs it. I've even bought outfits that she finds 'sexy' (e.g. she said she has a kink for specific 'guys in uniforms' and so I get those to try to spice up our sex life, no effect).


The only time my gf is ever 'into' sex with me is after she has spent her day with this one specific guy from her classes. She has a guy friend from school who she admits to find very sexually attractive. What I find is most of the time after she has spent a day or two with this guy, she's always super turned on and up for sex when she gets back to see me. Its the only time we ever have anything resembling 'real sex', though during the act she is usually lost in her own thoughts and I feel completely invisible to her. Its important to note this guy is nothing like me, both in looks and personality. He is one of the regular college 'frat bros'. My gf keeps insisting she thinks he is a douchebag, since he sleeps around and cheats on his gf (he apparently has 2 gfs) etc, but she keeps wanting to hang out with him. He is your classic tall, broad shoulders, college jock. Though she has admitted to me that she finds him very sexually attractive. 


I've talked to my gf about this whole 'duty sex' thing and she never explains the issue, she just either gets upset and shuts down or pretends like there is no issue. Whats more, is she is adamant that our sex life is 'great!' and it seems she has a very different view of how much sex we have (e.g. we have sex around twice a month but according to my gf we have it every other day, which makes no sense!). To me, it seems like she is in a deep state of denial about our floundering sex life. 


At this point I just don't know what to do. My gf seems 'happy' in the relationship, but only when we are out and about and doing things and going places (i.e. in public). The only thing I can think of right now is that my gf is simply trying to hold on to me since I'm giving her the lifestyle she wants (going out to expensive restaurants, events, etc) since that kind of stuff matters a lot to her and her friends. I think she wants to think that our sex life is perfect but deep down inside she knows its not working. This is stressing her out and in turn making the rest of our relationship (i.e. in private) really bad.


So what do you think /r/relationships? Is this a lost cause or am I simply destined to be in relationships where I only get 'duty sex' and no 'passion'? I'm not really a tall, good looking guy, so I already know my chances are slim, but if this is all I can expect then I will keep trying to make the relationship work. But if not, maybe I should just break it off?


Let me know your thoughts, I can answer questions if you need more details.

Thanks for your help folks. 


**TLDR: GF only has 'duty sex' with me and any attempt I make to make it better is rebuffed or ignored. Don't know what to do!**"
"My girlfriend (25) and I (21) are at a crossroad. I hold a career and house while she makes Instagram photos and is lazy. I'm unsatisfied. What should I do? (


She holds a B.A. in Business, is gorgeous and talented. There's no reason for why she can't get a job. It's been nearly a year and she says ""I'm looking"" all the while she has a ton of time to hangout with her friends, make her Instagram cooler and watch makeup tutorials all day. She says she's looking for a job, but at the same time questions why she even needs one. She's not abusive, she treats me nice when I host a party in her favor, meet her friends, our private moments together or when we're about to have sex. But, in between all that, she's defensive about pretty much anything that questions her life choices. Which mostly come from her parents and friends, but then that baggage is tossed on me unfairly, with no way to resolve it as she only wants to justify her behavior. Like, I don't even question it much, I've brought it up once or twice and she'd ignore me the whole day over that.

She had a rough relationship with her mom, and so her living with me has been a hugely positive impact on her life. We keep a lot of space so that we wouldn't become ""roommates."" And we haven't. We're still madly in love, it's been two years since we've officially been a couple, we still bond well and are satisfied. And we've been through rough roads, patches that truly tested our love and commitment for each other. But, in all this, she's more satisfied than me.

I just can't envision myself marrying someone who can't keep a job themselves and help contribute to the household. She's gained some weight and become less productive. I don't care about weight, she could gain another 100 and I'd still love her (new experiences, totally fine) but, clearly she's on a path that's getting worse. She's not living a healthy or proactive lifestyle, and that's not the person I know.

She's always upset when I talk to a girl, because the last female friend I had ended up liking me. Which was really fucking odd because that friend is madly more attractive than us combined, out of my league and was supposed to be lesbian.. But I was the one that told my GF about it the moment it happened, immediately cutting contact with the other girl. Ever since my GF ignores me a whole day if she knows I talked to another female, even a coworker, and constantly brings up how she's worried I might leave her over her laziness. Like, I may have brought up her getting a job once or twice, but I never said anything that would make her think I'd leave her over it. But she constantly pushes me away over these things nonetheless, and it starts to get me thinking. It's been over a year, she takes less care of herself and us, and is sometimes a mean poop to me. Anytime she feels insecure she's very external about it, and I end up feeling bad for her. Of course I do. I care for her. 

Wtf do I do? This is all starting to overwhelm me. I can't even talk to her about it because she ends up being defensive and I end up having to comfort her. There's no resolution to our conversations, so how else do I communicate? She's my best friend, we understand each other better than anyone else, and yet, we can't seem to figure shit out.


TLDR: I have a job, am productive and have a house. My girlfriend doesn't, spends mostly my money, isn't making an effort to find a job and is becoming lazier and unhealthier. Communication isn't working because she's sensitive over the matter. What do I do?"
"My mom's [61F] grieving for my sister [29F] makes me [25F] concerned for her


I apologize in advance if at any point I come off as selfish or cold. This has been hard to wrap my head around, and it's even harder to try and heal when my mom is just stuck in place.

My mom adopted my sister, Diana, when Diana was twelve. My mom had been struggling to have children for much of her adulthood, and the process had been so heartbreaking that she wanted to quit. Her marriage had ended because of her struggles to have kids, and when she was matched with Diana at the last minute, she saw her as a godsend. They had a really tight bond, even after my mom adopted me and my brother [22M]. It was always 'Diana and mom', never one without the other.

Diana passed away four months ago, in a rather unexpected way. I'd prefer not to go back over it, but if the details are necessary, I'll speak to them in the comments. My mother was heartbroken. She raided Diana's closet, and wrapped herself in her clothes, just sobbing on the floor. For days, she would sleep in Diana's bed, and just try to feel as close to her as she could. Now, she wears a lot of Diana's accessories (jewelry, hair ties, etc.) as a way to feel like she has her with her. It's been hard for her, but we've been slowly making it through.

Halloween was Diana's favorite holiday, so we all drove up to make sure my mom could handle it. She did surprisingly well, and enjoyed herself quite a bit. We had a lot of fun, and went home feeling like she might be recovering.

Thanksgiving is our big family holiday, which obviously caused us to worry that our mom might freak out. She usually hosts, but we wanted to alleviate stress from her, so I offered to. During Thanksgiving dinner, my uncle made a toast, and asked us to pray for Diana. He said a lot of lovely things about her, and my mom started sobbing. My brother tried to get her to walk away from the table, and when he tried to get her to stand, she just fell over and kept crying on the floor.

She was screaming that nobody would ever be as good as ""her Diana,"" and that she was lost without ""her Diana."" My uncles managed to get her up to the guest bedroom for the night, but we heard her sobbing the rest of dinner. We tried to stay with her, but she insisted she wanted to be alone. 

Normally, we do a lot of shopping on Black Friday, but my mother wouldn't let us. She said we couldn't do it without Diana. It's not even a ""we want deals"" thing, we've just done it as a family every year, and it felt wrong not to do it. If one of us tried to leave, my mom would block the door and shove us away. Eventually, we just sat around and watched TV while my mom held onto Diana's blanket from when she was a baby.

On the Saturday after Thanksgiving (aka today), we have a huge breakfast buffet before all of our relatives leave. It's basically breakfast Thanksgiving. We start cooking at around six in the morning, but this time, my mom didn't want to start. She and Diana would make the pancakes every year, and she said it was disrespectful to do it without her. I offered to make them instead, and my mom started screeching that it wasn't fair to Diana. I gave up, and we substituted with waffles. My mom pulled me aside while I was cooking, and said that I was being hurtful and rude. I asked why, and she said that it wasn't fair for me to try and bypass Diana's pancakes like that.

Because of it, she boycotted breakfast, and sat out on the porch in the cold. I invited her to come in several times, and brought her out a blanket but she asked me not to. She said that Diana would never do this to her, and I got mad and reminded her that Diana wasn't here, and we weren't going to put everything on hold so she could pretend like she was. My mom started crying, and I felt really shitty. I sat with her, apologized, and she just shoved me away and told me to go with the ""rest of them.""

My mom is staying an extra day, but I don't know if I want her to go at all. I'm worried about how she's handling this. The way that she's limited family traditions out of a feeling of respect towards Diana worries me, and I'm afraid of what else she may be preventing herself from doing. She and Diana did everything together, and it's worrying that she might not be doing everyday things because of her grief. 

She sees a counselor, but I can't be sure if it's actually doing anything for her. The bill still comes up on my bank statement, so I know she's doing something with it. I know that four months isn't all that long to begin to recover from something like this, but I'm very worried that this may spiral out of control and result in her suffering even more. Is it outrageous to try and care for her? Or should I just see if I can get her into more counseling? 

TLDR: My mom won't let us do family traditions after my sister's passing, and I'm worried she may not be doing other things. How can I get her to start feeling better and recovering?"
