"I,[23/M] never been in a relationship, followed your advice.


About 2 months ago, I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/802cdc/i_23_m_have_never_been_in_a_relationship_please/) about losing faith in finding love.


Basically you told me to just go out and talk to people. So I ditched the online dating and just...talked to lots of people. It was kinda awkward at first, but once I mustered up the balls to say hi, I found that people actually enjoyed talking to me. Even if it was cold like on the street or on the bus. I started to feel good and somehow women even started to approach *me*.


Eventually I asked women out and their responses were well, pleasant. Even if they said no, they were really flattered. Some said they *would* say yes but they have a BF ( I hope they didn't tell their BF that). We would share a laugh and we still say hi on the street. The takeaway is I spent a lot of my life waiting for the opportunity, but realized that women liked to be talked to and asked out as much as I do.


On my 4th or 5th girl, I got a yes and we had a 1st date. It was really nice and we're going on a 2nd one soon. It's really exciting for me. Even if it doesn't work out, it gives me hope for the future. 


You don't know who I am and probably don't care, but I just want people to know your advice helped me during a time I was pretty sad and butthurt. Thanks :)

**tl;dr:** Couldn't get a date, frustrated. You gave me advice. Realized women wait and like to be asked out. Now I date."
"[UPDATE] I [25F] found out 2 years ago that my husband [34M] is cheating on me. How to end it and what to say?


Old OP:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8c2l4l/i_25f_found_out_2_years_ago_that_my_husband_34m/



I wanted to make short update after a week has passed. Nothing exciting happened so save your popcorn.



After I made last post, I packed my necessities and took it at my friend's place. My husband came home on Sunday morning so I finally told him I knew about the cheating. He played dumb for an hour, but I was unfazed. When he realized I packed my bags, he said it was just short affair which meant nothing, one time thing without his better judgment. It was like some dark comedy because I didn't even know about affair he was talking about so I corrected him and after some more shouting, I left.



While on my way out, I saw my neighbour with whom I've never got along well. He said good for you. Later it hit me that he actually might be the person who sent me anonymous message about cheating long time ago.



I hired a lawyer. It is a good thing that we don't have kids or joined assets so things will be smooth after separation period is over. This weekend I moved to a new city and I will start a new job in early May. Later this week I might take short vacation to celebrate new beginning and experience some new adventures.



His friend contacted me to say my ex is not doing well. I said I'm sad to hear that, but that I'm not interested in any updates and my ex can contact my lawyer if there is some important information. Conversation was shortly over and I could hear my ex in the background saying to his friend that I'm such a bitch. That is true.


Tl;dr: I am getting a divorce. New start is going well too."
"My (24M) roommates (26M/F) have a dog together, they asked me to stop bonding with their dog because she prefers playing with me over them


Both of my roommates got a golden retriever dog last year, they're a couple and decided to get a dog and our apartment building allows us to have pets as long as you inform the landlord some time in advance. They're never home, if they're not working, they're out partying and things like that every other night. But once she grew out of the puppy stage, they didn't pay as much attention to her. They'll feed her in the morning and maybe pat her head for a bit whenever they get home. 





So I wound up being the one who walks her, makes sure she's gets her food and changes her water most of the time. I honestly don't mind, she's sweet. And they pay for her food and stuff so it's no cost to me. They've even thanked me a few times. 



The problem is that recently, they both decided they need to cut back a bit on partying. They still do it just not 6 days a week. More like 3. Now they want to spend some time with their dog and while she responds to them sometimes, most days she prefers to come near me. My roommate Carla makes some comments about me getting all the benefits with none of the work and Dave pretty much said look man, could you just not do anything with her? It's our dog and she prefers you.



Which would be fine if they were home. They've cut back on partying or started to but both of them work some hours where they just come home, shower and maybe eat something and go to sleep. I know that Dave has walked the dog in the past but Carla never even cleaned up once after her from the time she started to grow out of her 'puppy stage' as she called it. And I get that they're both exhausted but why would you deny the dog the opportunity to stretch her legs and play with someone if you won't take care of the dog you wanted?



TL;DR roommates are never home so I mostly take care of their dog, they're pissed that the dog prefers me over them because I actually spend time with her and want me to stop playing with her; but they never even make too much of an effort to do so. Carla and Dave are fake names."
"UPDATE: How should I [F22] interpret this email [M??] (accountant emailed me)


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8em5ic/how_should_i_f22_interpret_this_email_m/?st=jgi5dbrn&amp;sh=8b0294bd

As for the update... I decided to email him back my personal number and told him to reach out when he was thinking about going to the coffee shop. He ended up texting me and we are planning to meet up soon! I'm still really (pleasantly) shocked at how this all turned out and I'm glad I took the chance! Thank you guys for the coaching!! haha 

TLDR: Left him my phone number, we texted and are planning to meet up!"
"[Update] Me (23/F) and my BF (26/M). Am I wrong for wanting him to distance himself from his ""close"" female friend (24/F)?


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/882uuo/me_23f_and_my_bf_26m_am_i_wrong_for_wanting_him/

The tl;dr of the original is that I was feeling insecure/uncomfortable with the relationship between my BF ""Justin"" and his close female friend ""Olivia."" I got some really good advice from Reddit and realized that a lot of the things that made me feel uncomfortable were because of my insecurities, but that some aspects of their relationship, like the amount of physical intimacy, were too much for me personally.

I met Justin the night after I added the 'edit' to the original post, with the intentions of telling him that I was wrong for wanting him to distance himself from Olivia, but that I wanted 1) for him to ask that she tone down the physical intimacy and 2) that he disclose the extent of their relationship in the past (i.e. how far their physical relationship has gone, if either of them has confessed romantic feelings), which was something I previously wondered about but always avoided asking him.

That 'talk' didn't go as planned at all...I thought he was going to be understanding of me and honest about his feelings but he stonewalled me and was super rude and an all around asshole to me. As soon as I brought up Olivia he laughed and shook his head and asked me if I was ""really gonna do this shit again."" I tried my best not to get emotional and just explain my point of view, the whole time he was leaning his head against the wall, didn't make eye contact, and was playing with his earrings. So when I asked if he understood my feelings and was okay with what I was asking of him, he smiled sarcastically and said ""Of course honey"" with a fake tone. He was extremely angry when I asked if they have hooked up before, his exact words were ""You haven't even been my GF for a year, if you think you're entitled to know every little detail from my past, fuck yourself."" He walked out after saying that, and I cried. He'd never talked to me like that or expressed anger towards me before...I was shocked, hurt and angry. Obviously he was hiding something, I didn't know if something had happened between them or he had feelings for her or what, but I wanted to talk with him again so I messaged him telling him I wasn't trying to make him mad, but that I felt like we needed to talk again.

He didn't reply to my messages that night, and the next morning he still hadn't replied. I never thought I would do this, but I sent Olivia a message asking to meet for a coffee. Surprisingly she answered almost immediately and agreed to meet in the afternoon.

When we met I told her about my feelings about their relationship, how Justin had reacted the other night, and straight up asked her if there was any romantic feelings between them. She admitted that she has feelings for Justin, but that it was complicated. She said she loves him and hates him at the same time. She told me that I should leave him, that she wasn't just saying that because she wants to be with him instead of me, but that it was because Justin has always been a player, has been charming and leaving girls for years, that she's waited for him to change, that she knew she could never be truly happy staying by his side as a friend, that she should leave him too but couldn't. I thought she might try to BS me but she seemed very sincere when saying these things. 

I asked her what the extent of their relationship was like in the past, and she told me that basically, she was attracted to Justin at first sight when they first met in university, but that Justin had a long distance GF at the time. Justin broke up with his LDGF, they got closer, Justin had some problems (she wouldn't tell me what they were) that he counseled to her about, this led to them kissing one night and having sex. That was her first time. She confessed feelings to Justin but he said he didn't want their friendship to be effected if the relationship didn't work out. They were on and off FWBs throughout college. Justin had a handful of short-lived relationships during that time and he cheated on one of his GF's with Olivia (She claimed at this point that they haven't had sex since he's been in a relationship with me, idk what to believe). When they graduated, their friend group rented a vacation pension on an island, one night their friend Ashley walks in on them in the bathroom. Justin told Ashley that it was a ""drunk mistake,"" Olivia was extremely hurt and refused to see or speak to Justin for weeks. After being ignored, Justin apologizes to her, tells her he has feelings for her, and they go on a few secret dates but Justin never commits to a relationship and then backtracks and says he's confused about his feelings not ready for anything serious. From that point on, they went back to being FWBs until Justin met me.

I'm a little confused and skeptical as to why she's told me all this, so I ask if she has any proof. She searches chat logs and shows me multiple messages of him booty calling her. She starts getting emotional and tells me that Justin has amazing qualities but that he has some deep personal issues that he refuses to work on that prevent him from being a good partner right now. I asked her what she meant, but she wouldn't tell me. I could tell that she cares about him a lot. She's been single this whole time. There were likely many opportunities for her to end up in a happy relationship but she turned a blind eye to them all for Justin, who can't even admit that he has feelings for her. Even though I didn't like some of the things she did before, I actually sympathize with her a lot, it sounds like Justin put her through a ton of shit, given her false hope and taken it away, and she's always stayed by him for whatever reason. After, she tells me not to worry about throwing her under the bus because she was going to tell Justin herself that she told me about them. She said she wanted him to be mad at her.

Later that night Justin called me trying to explain himself to me, but I broke up with him. I was crying on the phone, I really didn't want to break up but I knew it was the right thing for me to do. Regardless of what was true or false about his past, it was just too much drama for me handle and the way he reacted to me when I had originally wanted to talk to him scared me. He didn't try to fight me or ask me to say, we just kind of sat in silence on the phone for a while before hung up.

It's been about two weeks since then...I know that Justin was probably a bad boy and it was only a matter of time before he broke my heart but I feel devastated. I'm just starting to be able to get back into my normal routines, but even then sometimes it's just so hard to get out of bed. I think about Justin every day. It's like the more I'm away from him, the more I think about the good things we had together. I miss his smell, his laugh, his touch, just being able to be with him whenever I want. Part of me hoped he would reach out to me, but he hasn't. I met Olivia last week and she told me that Justin wasn't talking to her anymore, and that it was probably a good time for her to move on from him. My ass. Last night I saw Olivia uploaded a couple-y picture of her and Justin on Instagram (they were in a nightclub or some dark place, he had his arm wrapped around her with a drink in that hand and she was sipping from the straw). I know it was a mistake not to block/unfollow Justin and his friends. After I saw that I blocked and unfollowed them all. That was kind of what inspired me to post an update. I don't know if Olivia played me or if Justin is working his magic on her again, but I just feel shitty all around. It hurts know but I know these people would have been toxic for me if I had stayed with him. It just hurts so much more than I'd imagined.

**Tl;dr** Boyfriend is a complete asshole to me when I asked him to establish some boundaries with his 'close' female friend. I meet with the female friend, she tells me that she and BF have been hooking up almost ever since they met, that she's confessed feelings to him and has been waiting this whole time for him to commit to her, which he never does. BF tried to 'fix' things, but we break up. I feel lost and devastated for the weeks following, but last night I see a couple-y Instagram post of BF and friend. It still hurts, but at least I know I made the right decision."
"UPDATE: How do I (24F) bring up to my boyfriend (25M) of 6 months that his temper scares me?


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8a9t7i/how_do_i_24f_bring_up_to_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_8

Long story short we broke up. A few days after I posted this, he did something in the bedroom that scared the crap out of me. Without going into TMI detail, he grabbed the back of my head while I was giving him a blowjob and pressed me down so I couldn't breathe. No prior negotiation, it was like he just lost control. I started freaking out because my arms were pinned under him and I thought I was going to pass out. He saw my head wiggling and the tears running down my face and pulled out but that scared the shit out of me. It really hurt because he tried to initiate again just a few minutes after and got pouty when I told him he'd killed the mood. I broke up with him a few days later over Skype because I was scared of how he'd react if I did it in person and didn't want to compromise my safety.

Tl;Dr he was an asshole in the bedroom, scared me so badly I broke up with him"
"Boundaries were crossed when my [M25] girlfriend [F26] got dropped off last night from a [M] coworker on her day off. What should I do?


TL;DR Girlfriend’s co-worker made advancements on gf a month prior, told me soon after the incident that she denied him. Boundaries set, and agreed I would be around if hanging out outside of work were to happen. Find girlfriend being dropped off by said coworker at 12:30am last night. 

Hey everyone. I’ve always found myself a lurker, and have taken a liking to this sub...never thought I’d post on it. 

Like the TL;DR says, my girlfriend had an ‘isolated’ incident with a coworker about a month back. Background info: she’s been at this place for a 3-4 months &amp; we’ve been together 6. Prior incident happened when she went to pay him back for helping her move in (he had access to a truck and I had strep throat) with going out for food/drinks and ended up back at her place to hang out. 

I felt comfortable that she disclosed this soon after, saying it was weighing on her because she ‘didn’t want to lose me’, and the appropriate boundaries were set. Case closed, and things move on. 

Flashback to yesterday, gf’s day off and our usual plan is to hang out when I’m done work. Says she had a stressful day prior/needed a ‘me day’. Cool, no worries. We then call later (9:30pm) on and she’s doing better and asks me to come over later as she implies she’d be heading home soon.

I get in around 11:00, she’s not there yet. End up waiting until 12:30 and catch her coworker dropping her off as I get out of the bathroom. 

I address it as soon as she got in the bedroom. She acknowledges it but doesn’t disclose anything else. Kicking myself for not addressing it more then and there. 

She falls asleep and receives a text from him, “Can’t get out of my head” the text reads. I normally respect phone privacy as I want to trust my partner, but something clicked/snapped. Looked at a brief convo,  her ‘me day’ was a coordinated effort between them. 

I know this conversation needs to happen, but feel I need advice on what steps to take/what to possibly say. I could be paranoid, but something doesn’t feel right. 

I appreciate any help/advice, thanks everyone. "
"My [29F] boyfriend [33M] told me he hates my dog and gave me an ultimatum


I bought Sadie when I was 15 years old for $2- some little kids were on a bridge near my house acting weird with a paper bag, and when I went up to them I saw that they had a tiny puppy, too small to be away from her mom, that they were clearly intending to throw off the bridge. I gave them the $2 I had on me and took her home and my parents let me keep her, and we've been BFF for almost 15 years.

My boyfriend, Alex, and I have been dating for 3 years. He's generally a really great, funny, warm, solid guy, but every fight we've ever had has basically been about Sadie. He'd never had a dog or lived with a dog before, so when we started dating he was often annoyed at my lack of spontaneity because I had to schedule around walking my dog, or make arrangements for someone else to walk her. Once he finally caught on that walking my dog was something that wasn't optional, Sadie started hitting that point in old age where she got a little gross.

Everyone who has had a senior dog knows that there's a point where, even with the best vet care and otherwise perfect health, they get a little smelly and a little gross and become a 'face only a mother could love' type dog. He started getting more and more frustrated that I was putting time aside to care for my dog; nothing insane, just taking her outside more because she couldn't wait as long between walks, having to clean my house more to get out 'dog smell,' having to get her groomed more, more regular vet appointments. He and I still spend a ton of time together, but he started to get mad that he had to mostly sleep at my house (I live alone and he has roommates, I live closer to his work, my house is overall 'nicer,' so I think this is just a fairness thing vs. a serious problem).

The other day, though, he gave me an ultimatum. He said that I need to see if my parents will take Sadie or otherwise 'get rid of her,' because he's tired of 'our' lives revolving around her. He said that he thinks she's gross, he doesn't want to pet her because she makes his hands smell, and he's tired of always having to go to my house instead of his. He also suggested, weirdly, that he'd move into my apartment with me (in this neighborhood he doesn't want to be in?) if Sadie was gone.

For me, this is a no brainer. I bottle fed this dog as a puppy, and to abandon her as an old lady would be cruel. I admit, she's pretty gross, but she's MY gross baby. Plus, the life span for the breeds my vet thinks she is (beagle and pekingese if you can imagine it) is around 15, and she's... around 15. She isn't going to be around much longer, and at the first sign that her quality of life has deterioriated or that she's in pain, I will let her go because I wouldn't keep her alive just for me.

Am I being unfair to choose a dog over a person? I am truly in love with my boyfriend, and really saw a future with us, and I'm devastated that he hates such a big part of my life and feels that she's an impediment to our future, but I just can't get rid of her.

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants me to choose between him and my senior dog."
"Turns out my (16F) big brother (32M) is actually my biological father. I want to live with him but my boyfriend (16M) says he's creeped out.


I learned this just two weeks ago. I was born when he was 16 and at that time I was adopted by his parents, my grandparents. I always knew I was adopted, just didn't know who my bio parents were.

My brother always paid a lot of attention to me. Doing things with me, being involved in every way. He didn't take job opportunities that would have taken him to other cities because he always wanted to be close to me. He comes to watch me play sports all the time, take me to my music classes, etc... I always loved him for all of that and thought I had the world's best brother. Turns out he's my dad actually that's why he's so devoted to me.

I love my parents (adoptive parents, grandparents, this is weird) and they've been very good to me too. After learning about this the three of them told me that I can move in with my brother (dad) and maybe develop a more father-daughter relationship while living together. I'd like that and I accepted and we'll do this next week.

Now in the middle of all of this my boyfriend says he's creeped out by this situation and thinks it's inappropriate for me to move in with him. He says having a brother-turned-dad gives the implicit vibe that he must have had sex with his own mother? He says this is what people will think of. He also thinks I've been betrayed by everyone in my family and I really should be seeking to get distance from them rather than take this news with excitement.

This is a huge moment of my life and this is a lot for me to deal with. I'm taking it very positively but my boyfriend just keeps repeating that he's so creeped out and he can't help but imagine this situation is so gross.

How do I handle my boyfriend? 

 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Turns out my brother is actually my dad and my adoptive parents are my actual grandparents. I'm taking this news positively and look forward to develop a more father-daughter relationship with him but my boyfriend is being very unwelcoming of this news and keeps repeating how creepy this situation is. I don't know what to do with him to drop this. "
"My boyfriend [35 M] and I [32 M] had an explosive argument over something completely trivial. 6-year committed relationship, told me he wants to move out


**tl;dr** My boyfriend of six years says he's breaking up after trivial, but exponentially aggressive, argument. Argument begins when he tells me not to send an email to a customer support rep about a malfunctioning product; boyfriend wants to verify I assembled the desk correctly before I send the email, blows up, he says he wants to move away and break up.

---

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years (lived together for around 5). We have a few problems, but we're working through them and communicate well, and overall we've been very happy together.

I was assembling a standing desk this Friday evening while he watched TV on the couch, not far from me, we chatted while I assembled it. After over an hour of assembly, I found that either the control board or motors didn't work, so I couldn't raise or lower the desk. I thoroughly checked everything and determined something was wrong with one of the electrical components.

I sat down next to him on the couch to email the company straight away (~10:45PM PDT), and right before I sat down he decided to go to sleep. It's somewhat rare for either of us to sleep this early on a weekend, and when I inquired about it, he said his mouth hurt (he just got braces, long story) and that it wouldn't hurt if he were sleeping. I jokingly gave him shit about the lame excuse, grabbed a beer and went to the couch.

We're living in San Francisco and the desk company is in eastern Canada. I had a separate problem with the delivery of the desk a few days ago, so I was already in an email thread with a member of their support team. They specifically told me to reach out to them directly if I had any other problems. The desk was expensive, so I was hoping they might even see my email and send the replacement components tomorrow (Saturday).

Shortly after I started composing the email, boyfriend said something like, ""hold off on sending that until I check out the desk tomorrow."" I was like, ""why? I'd like to get it sorted as quickly as possible.""

He tries to convince me that I shouldn't send the email now, that it's possible I made a mistake during assembly, that I should definitely not send the email until he has had a chance to inspect the desk tomorrow.

I don't remember exactly what we said as the argument grew, but he was getting increasingly loud and argumentative, aggressively presenting reason after reason as to why I should not send this email right now: it was better to wait until he inspects it tomorrow, and that I'm doing this in haste.

Meanwhile I was getting increasingly bewildered and frustrated that he even cared whether or not I sent the email, and that he didn't trust my judgement and ability to assemble a fucking desk. I was getting defensive, I am sure I raised my voice and spoke rapidly, but I am certain I was not being nearly as loud or aggressive as he was.

During the whole argument, I kept reiterating that he shouldn't care whether or not I sent this email, that it made no difference to him whatsoever. I pointed out that the ""worst case scenario"" means I send an email tomorrow telling them everything's great, don't send the replacement parts. Logic didn't seem to matter, as he persisted, telling me what time it was in Eastern Canada, that they won't read the email until Monday, that I probably set it up incorrectly because I was high.

Admittedly, I was somewhat high at this point in the conversation. I had eaten a small dose of marijuana edibles about 45 minutes earlier, and I was starting to feel it. But I was totally coherent and engaged in the conversation — it was a pretty small dose (15mg), and I ate it on a full stomache. I was not high while assembling the desk, because edibles take a while, and I ate them after assembly, while I was troubleshooting. He used the marijuana against me, telling me I was high when assembling it so probably something was incorrect.

The most frustrating thing to me, at this point in the argument, was that he didn't trust that I was 100% confident the desk had a malfunctioning component. He wouldn't accept that the desk had been set up correctly (it would be pretty hard to set it up incorrectly). I read the manual thoroughly, I searched online for troubleshooting advice, I quadruple-checked that all of the connections of the control box (all four of them) were securely connected and reconnected each one of them several times. I told him how convinced I was, how long I had spent troubleshooting.

The argument continues, I express that it feels like he's being controlling. We are both getting really agitated, apartment neighbors can probably hear us, I'm repeatedly defending ""my right to send an email whenever I want,"" and asking how this could possibly make him so upset. He's saying that I'm insinuating he's crazy because he's so upset over this (and admittedlty I truly am wondering if this is a mental health issue).

At some point when I ask him why he's so upset over an email, he goes on a tangent about how he doesn't like the look of the desk, that he doesn't want to ""deal with that right now,"" and I'm like, ""wait so you're actually upset because you hate the desk?"" He answers this by reiterating that I'm being unresonably stubborn about sending the email, but also that he isn't happy with the way the desk looks.

Eventually we're sitting on the bed and he's like, ""I want you to leave. Pack up some clothes and leave."" I'm like, ""...WHAT? What the fuck???"" I'm completely shocked that he's going this far.

He keeps at it. ""I'm serious, get the FUCK out. I don't want to see you."" Me: ""What the FUCK, babe???""

For context, we moved to San Francisco ~3 years ago. We had been living together in the midwest for about two years when I asked him to move to SF with me. We've been happy in SF for three years. We have some good friends here, but not super close friends, and no family. I would not feel very comfortable asking my SF friends to crash with them.

So he's asking me to pack my shit and go to a hotel, after 11PM on a Friday, and there's no fucking way I'm going to do that, so I'm like, ""what the fuck did I do?? Explain why you're so upset?"" And he acts completely flabberghasted, like I should know. We repeat this a few times with different words. I remember saying multiple times, ""this is so absurd, I should record this."" I'm repeatedly pointing out how crazy this argument is, which is probably contributing to his agitation.

At somepoint I say something like, ""are you going crazy?"" and he erupts, yelling ""I'm moving back to {home state}."" After 3 years living together in SF, both with fulltime jobs, he's leaving everything over this argument. Then he he's yelling he doesn't want to talk to me, to get out of the bedroom. All I can think to say is ""what the fuck???"" and go to the living room.

I'm so confused and upset and amazed that he is jumping to these extremes.

It really feels like he was having some intense bout of insanity... but I at least partially contributed to the argument... but I still feel like the things he said and did were completely overdramatic.

Maybe there is something else going on? Like maybe he's so unhappy in general that he's blowing up over this trivial thing. Or did I escalate this trivial disagreement into an argument? Did I somehow egg him on? I honestly don't think so, I think he's upset that I'm not doing what he thinks is best."
"Me [31 F] with my husband [36 M] cheated while recovering from surgery


I found a hidden Facebook message today from a woman I don't know, stating that she had sex with my husband in August 2017 in a certain city where he is from (not where we live). Over this past weekend he was in the same city and he texted her again.  She had sent the message earlier this week and then two days later added ""I have HPV"".  I hadn't seen it until today because I don't check the hidden messages and couldn't figure out why I had a mystery alert. I confronted him and he confessed.

In August 2017 I was recovering from reconstructive hip surgery due to a benign tumor.  For the months leading up it was very scary; they thought I had cancer, etc.  I turned out OK but had a very serious surgery that required months of rehab.

My husband was unhappy at his job so I supported him quitting and becoming independent, even while I was on disability.  He took a few weeks off and visited his best friend back at his home town. I reluctantly agreed because at that point I was basically off crutches and could take care of the basics. This woman is his best friend's SIL (wife's sister) and apparently lives next door to his best friend. It was then that he had sex with her.

The huge problem is my husband for many years has refused to have sex with me; he blamed it on PTSD from serving in Afghanistan.  I love him so I believed hi,m but apparently he was able to have sex with this woman.   His response is that it was ""a hard time.""  Yeah, but the next 40 years will have a lot of those.  I want children and I'm now worried he is not the one I can do this with.

 /r/relationships, should I forgive him or just cut my losses and separate?  I feel so bertrayed that I have stayed loyal through 4 years of (almost) sexless marriage (8 years total together - the beginning was OK, but then it faded), just to find out he had sex with someone else.

tl;dr: deadbedroom. husband who is the cause of deadbedroom cheated while I was recovering from major illness.  Just found out from the other woman via facebook. What do I do?"
"Me [26F] with my family [60/70,s M/F,s] are all angry with me for refusing to attend my aunt's 6th wedding, but I am heavily pregnant. and don't have much money


sorry for bad format I'm on phone and follow the format info but it never works.


My aunt (65f) is 5 times divorced and marrying her oqrtner (40m)for the 6th time, she's been with her current s.o for a year and a half, they announced they are going to get married in Australia on the beach on June 6th.


Now I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant, I live very close to my aunt but we don't get on all that well, we are just very different people.
My mum (62f) is furious that I don't intend to go to the wedding, most of my family are retired and can easily afford to go, I live paycheck to paycheck and my partner is self emoyed and can't afford the time off either, all that aside I'll either have a brand new baby, a toddler and a 7 year old or I'll be overdue to give birth.


My grandparents (85f)  (90m) are only half considering going due to my grandfather's health and no one seems happy wirh them either, but as me, my partner and my grandparents have said, we all attended the other 5 weddings!! 


I just can't seem to get my cousins and my mum to understand why this is impossible for us as a family, they only announced they had set a date 4 weeks ago.




 so it's incredibly short notice for us too as our savings are minimal and currently needed for car repairs.

tl;dr    aunt announced her destination wedding (6th) wedding date 4 weeks ago and it's in june, we don't have the finances to go as it's in Australia and I an also heavily pregnant and may still be pregnant, family all think I should go

edit: I forgot to mention my pregnancy is high risk and with complications, I'm frequently in hospital as my family know"
"I [28F] can’t complain about anything related to my husband [40M] without it getting turned back on me.


It seems that I can’t complain or offer any sort of constructive criticism to my husband without him turning it back on me as though I’m the problem. He is constantly asking me what’s wrong whenever I’m in a bummed mood, and I feel like I can no longer tell him my problems because of this. 

For example, we both work stressful full time jobs. When we get home, I’m the one stuck doing all the laundry for things that we both use (towels, sheets, etc), cooking, and dealing with dishes. Literally all he does is play on his phone or laptop, and watch TV for the whole evening. If I say anything about this, like how I would like help cleaning up that doesn’t involve the dishes sitting in the sink for 24 hours, he does so in an aggressive manner as though I have inconvenienced him. 

Also, we carpool to work most of the time. My alarm goes off at 6, his at 6:30, and I’m generally ready to go by 6:30-6:45 because I know he won’t get up immediately when his alarm goes off, and he snoozes his phone well past 7 when we’re supposed to already be on the road by then. This morning I said I was just going to take myself to work, because the morning traffic is always more stressful the later we leave. He proceeds to rush to get ready, and acts as though I’m holding us up once he’s ready to go, when I have been ready the whole time. He then drives aggressively to work and won’t speak to me. I asked if I upset him, and he said “I’m just trying to get you to work.” 

I don’t know how to communicate my problems with him if he is just going to treat me like this every time I have something to say. I already keep to myself a lot as it is. 

TLDR: Every time I complain about something I don’t like my husband doing, he always makes it my fault. "
"Me (44M) and my wife (37F) don't know how to deal with our incredibly religious son (16M). He is becoming increasingly judgmental of us and recently told us we are sinners and are going to hell. He found out I used to date a man and freaked out at me.


Both me and my wife are agnostic. Our son met a friend, charlie, when he was maybe 10 years old, and he was over charlies house constantly. Charlie and his parents were super religious evangelicals, and they sort of got my son to go to church with them and slowly our son got more and more religious. He started going to bible study and youth groups at the church. He stopped being friends with charlie at about 14-15 but continued with his religious studies and such. 

We were relatively okay with this at first, maybe not what we wanted for him but it was a nice surprise to see him engage in all those nice little groups and be proactive. 

As the years went by, he got more extreme with his religion. His faith turned more hostile and angry at people, including us. Especially in the last 6 months, its gotten out of hand, he labelled us sinners and nonbelievers, he shamed us for watching a horror movie about possession because it was sinful, he got into a MASSIVE argument with my wife about gay marriage... it has just gotten out of hand. His facebook and social media is literally just constant religious stuff, including conservative stuff and hated of gay people. It is really concerning. 

It got especially out of hand in two scenarios. One, my wife smokes pot, which he found out about and flipped a shit at her. Specifically, he went *searching through her things* to find 'bad' things that he could shame her for. He said he wasn't against pot very much, but the fact that we smoked it just fits the profile that we don't care about the consequences of our sins and that we are bad people and all this stuff. He really just got irrationally angry at us. 

The other big one was at a family dinner. This was bad. I am bisexual and used to date a guy for a brief amount of time, my brother often makes jokes about the guy because he was really eccentric. At the dinner he mentioned him, and my son suddenly asked about this guy and who he was, and my brother mentions to my son casually that I dated the guy in college. My son literally just got up and left and drove home. We had to tell everyone what was going on with him, there were 10+ people at the dinner table who witnessed that. Some of them knew he was religious but none of them knew just how crazy he had gotten with it. My wife burst out crying at the table when we were explaining. 

We went home and he just went ballistic on me. Absolutely crazy. Yelling at me, saying that we are like the epitome of sin and evil, that we do everything wrong, that he cant trust anything we say. He told me to get the fuck out of the house, like what? I fucking own the house. 

Its been a few days since then, he won't even look at me. My wife has been crying nonstop since that night, saying that he is a monster, and that we should have nipped this in the bud a long time ago. 

What the fuck are we supposed to do? 

TL;DR  - - son is turning into a religious zealot. He found out I dated a man and flipped out at me. "
"Everyone forgot my (23F) birthday including my fiance (30M). Is it stupid for me to be upset?


I have to admit I'm pretty hurt right now. Call me stupid, but I like being able to open at least one present on my birthday. Don't get me wrong, I'm not materialistic. All I asked my fiancé for was for a card or something even if it was handmade. He literally could have taken five minutes to scribble on a piece of paper and I would have been happy.


I'm supposed to be leaving for a business trip today before he gets home from work. Yesterday I was hinting that we should do something. I wanted to cook dinner together and have a nice meal since we're usually too busy. Instead he plopped himself down and started watching TV asking what I'm making. I tried hinting again that he should help me with dinner. Eventually he realized I wasn't cooking and grabbed take out. It took him a good 2 hours to realize that he wouldn't see me on my birthday. Afterwards he apologized and said he wanted to get me a nice present but we can't afford it right now so he decided to give me a rain check. To put it in perspective, I saved up $400 over the course of 6 months to surprise him with a penguin experience at the zoo. 

Tonight I was supposed to stop by my parents to have dinner on my way to my destination. My parents canceled yesterday because my sister wanted to go to a friend's house and they had to drive her an hour away . My dad admitted over text that they didn't remember it was my birthday until it popped up on Facebook. They decided to reschedule for my next day off (more than a month from now).

I know I probably sound really petty, but I'm just disappointed. Is this warranted or am I being ridiculous? What can I do to cheer myself up?

Tl;dr: My fiancé and parents forgot my birthday meaning I'll be spending it primarily alone. Am I wrong for being upset? How do I cheer myself up today?"
"I (18m) posted about a week ago about turning down my wrestling/academic scholarship to go to school with my GF (18f). bottom line I'm taking the scholarships but we're broken up.


Original was here, people were pretty savage with me and a few people even pm'ed me asking for an update so I figured I would. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8cf8bt/i_18m_am_not_accepting_my_wrestlingacademic/

So like I said in the original that was Saturday in the middle of the post my GF called and said she had to talk. Basically what had happened is my parents had called her parents (they are pretty close friends in their own right) and her parents sat her down and basically convinced her that my decision was not good for either of us so she was breaking up with me. She said that she could never live with the guilt of me not taking my scholarships and that I ""had"" to take them to have any chance of things working out with her. I had the worst weekend of my life because I didn't have my girlfriend anymore. 

Basically I begged her on Monday to get back together with me and she said she just needed time. I have NO idea what this means because everything was so cool with us last week but this week...broken up. Can someone please explain how this makes sense? I have no idea. I'm trying my best to leave her alone but it's so hard and I've even heard rumors that a guy she used to date before me is driving her to a party tonight. Like literally have NO idea what to make of that. This is pain almost unbearable. 

So to the part that probably everyone cares about, since I'd never notified my scholarship school that I wasn't coming, everything is still on track for me to show up in June for unofficial workouts. So I'm still going to accept my scholarship and everything will move forward as if nothing ever happened as far as that goes. 

So that's my update, thanks for every one for being so honest with me and I realize I pretty much still don't want to hear the truth that this is the best for me because I'm so hurt over not being with my girlfriend any more. 

tl;dr: I posted last week about not taking  scholarships so I could go to school with my girlfriend but she broke up with me. I'm taking the scholarships anyways.

"My (27F) MIL announced my pregnancy to everyone after I asked my husband (29M) not to share the news until the 12th week. Advice?


Backstory: Husband and I have been together for 5 years, married for 3.


So Im currently 11 weeks pregnant. A total surprise but we wanted to keep it from the get go. It's totally scary and nerve wracking but I'm so happy it's unreal. And my husband has been incredibly caring and supportive and so enthusiastic. So things were great.



I had asked him not to share this pregnancy with anyone because I wanted to wait till we hit 12 weeks. I sat him down and we had a really nice talk about it and he was in total agreement to wait until we could share it together at a big family dinner we're having at the end of this month with both sets of families there. 



A couple of days ago I got a phone call from my parents congratulating me and telling me how happy they were for my pregnancy, I also got my siblings and his family members also getting in touch with us to share their happy messages. I immediately asked my husband who very apologetically told me that he had accidentally told his mom the last time they had talked on the phone a week ago and that it was her that had told everyone. 




I remember just bursting into tears and since then, my husband is trying to apologise and make amends but frankly, being near him is making me feel so hurt and upset. I know the hormones are probably making me overreact but this is my first ever pregnancy and I wanted us to be able to tell our parents and family members together and have the opportunity to share this news ourselves. My parents were a little upset I wasn't the one to tell them and i felt so awful about that. I wanted to have that experience and it's just made me a little resentful of my husband.



My MIL has never caused any issues in our relationship so far and has always been very cordial and polite with me. My husband always has my back. Or so I thought. This is her first grandchild and I dunno if she did it maliciously or accidentally but she hasn't gotten in touch to apologise. Or to even congratulate me. So I don't know.


I don't want to host this dinner, I don't want to see my MIL, and I'm not sure how to work through this with my husband. We talked and he gets it but I can't let go of my emotions about this. Any advice would be appreciated.



TLDR: MIL announced my pregnancy to everyone even though I told my hub not to tell anyone and he told her. Advice on how to stop resenting hubby? "
"my (23f) boyfriend (24m) keeps accidentally calling me his best friends name during sex


my boyfriend (let's call him 'Will') has been best friends with 'Caleb' for about 10/11 years. me and Will have been dating for about six months now, and things have been going really well. this has only just started to become a problem. i honestly know this sounds like a joke and i've been scared to tell my friends because they'll either laugh at me or tell the story to other people which would be really embarrassing.

so he always would accidentally call me Caleb sometimes during conversation which i didn't mind at all, i get names mixed up all the time. but around last month, in early march, he called me Caleb as i was giving him head. i would've laughed it off but he said it so loudly and passionately that honestly i was so shocked that i just ignored it ? obviously i regret this now, because eventually so much time passed that i couldn't bring it up and just kind of forgot about it. in my head i thought it was sort of funny because the way he said it was honestly funny as hell from an outside perspective, but as his girlfriend it's kind of worrying.

him and Caleb are very close, they've lived together for almost two years and they know everything about each other. but i really, really doubt that they have ever been together or have had feelings for each other. Will has mentioned Caleb having an ex-girlfriend, so I'm pretty sure he's straight, and Will is definitely straight. when i ran the situation through my head i decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, it's normal to get names mixed up sometimes, especially when you see that person every single day. (i should also add that i really like Caleb and would consider him my friend.)

then, it happened again. this time it was actually DURING SEX. my name sounds nothing like Caleb! and he straight up moaned ""Caleb"". this time i stopped and started laughing awkwardly thinking that Will would also be laughing that he'd said Caleb by accident. he just looked blank and kind of confused for a second and then saw that i was nervously laughing and did this awkward fake laugh for a few seconds before kissing me again. i said ""that's the second time you've done that"" and he laughed and said ""i'm just a r-tard, sorry"". obviously i was uncomfortable, but again, i thought it was just him being clumsy.

finally, it happened a last time last night. he moaned ""Caleb"" as we were having sex. i stopped him and sort of snapped and said ""okay wtf dude?"" and he started crying and said that he gets names mixed up because he ""had a kidney stone last year"" and it was really stressful for him and Caleb was the person who helped him through it. wtf? this is total bs right? i mean i don't know much about kidney stones but i'm pretty sure that's not how it works. 

now i'm worried more about his weird lies/excuse for doing it rather than him actually doing it. should i be worried? do i need to talk to him about this or should i just end things? 

tl;dr my boyfriend calls me his best friends name during sex and blames it on a kidney stone"
"Me [26F] with my Family [27-70s M/F] ,I don't know how to break them the news about my terminal cancer diagnosis.


Throwaway because people know my actual account. Sorry if this gets long.
So, i'm not really sure where to start but a couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with a terminal form of cancer. I don't want to go into any specifics but I essentially have a few weeks left. 

My problem is that I haven't told anybody. The diagnosis happened really quickly and it actually took me a couple days to accept it myself before i went in for further appointments after the initial discovery of the tumor. At this point in time chemo/radiation or any other treatments are not an option. I'm closer to being okay with the whole situation but the one thing that scares me the most is telling my family.

I'm currently in australia visiting my parents because its their big 0th wedding anniversary. Family is really important for my family so all my brothers and their families are here too. We all basically will be here for the next week hanging out/celebrating because its a bit rare for us to get together like this. I have 3 older brothers. B1 lives down the street from my parents and B2 lives in australia but farther away. Me and B3 live in the US, albeit on opposite coasts. I arrived to Aus on Tuesday night and basically went to sleep right away because I was so exhausted . Wednesday I started thinking about telling my family about my diagnosis but I couldn't do it. I don't want to ruin this week or my parent's celebration. It also didn't help that on Wednesday B2 and my SIL announced that they were pregnant after struggling w/ infertility for 5 years. They were actually supposed to start IVF soon but by some miracle they got pregnant a bit over 3 months ago. So last night we celebrated with their friends and everyone was so happy. Yesterday was my neice's birthday so we celebrated with her, and me and my youngest brother took out all the kids to a trampoline place. It definitely did NOT seem right to tell everyone about my situation. I also did not realize how much stronger my symptoms were getting and I got really tired from the excursions. Today my brothers and dad went to his surf shop and went surfing on the beach. My mom and SILs went shopping and had some fun girls stuff planned but I opted to stay at home and watch the nieces and nephews. I lied and said that I twisted my ankle on the trampoline yesterday so here I am alone typing this. I had a really scary moment this morning where I started coughing up blood (considered a normal symptom for me) this morning and there was nothing more that I wanted to do then to call my mom home and just hug her. 

My parent's anniversary is tomorrow (Saturday) and so I want to tell them the next day but I know they will also be mad at me for holding out this info for so long. How can i tell them about the cancer as easily as possible? I don't want them to be too worried or upset at me and I definitely don't know how to say it. I mean i know what to say but i don't know how to SAY it if that makes sense? Like how do you break that sort of news? Honestly I think they suspect something is wrong because i've been a little bit more quiet than usual and i'm usually really active and not as tired out. I think right now they just assume that i'm upset after calling off my engagement because of the cancer (i never even told him and i know that probably makes me a bad person but i freaked out and broke up with him). But its just weird to me to know that I won't get to meet my future nephew/niece, or see all the kids grow up or spend time with my family in this sort of way ever again.Like yes, i'm so happy for my brothers and sisters and seeing everyone be so happy because of all the amazing things happening in their lives but its also very bittersweet. It hurts a lot to know that I won't be here for them.  

Should I tell them tonight or after their anniversary (Sunday) which is the day before i leave (Monday night)?

TL;DR : I have cancer but don't know when the right time to tell my family is."
"Parent (f50s) got married but I (20sf) was forgotten...


My father died when I was a young teenager and left my mom and I in a lot of debt. As such we became very close and a team, she worked two jobs and I had pretty much a full time job outside of school which obviously impacted on my studies. As a result of the debt situation I gave all of my money to my mother and wasn't able to take opportunities in my education, in my social life or in general. Unlike my peers I could not travel or pursue anything because my mother needed my financial assistance.

This continued until a couple of years ago when I got married. My mother was at that point financially stable thanks to my support and so was able to live a life again. At my wedding I thanked her for being a wonderful Mother, gave her a special gift and made sure I had plenty of photos with her and her partner. 

A year before I got married she had met a lovely man with three children, he really is lovely and a month ago they got married. I helped plan the wedding. At the wedding itself I was eager to celebrate my mothers new, happy life and I was delighted for her. However I felt like the odd one out.. I was included in one 'everybody' photo and then they did the grooms side of the photos so waited to the side for the brides side \(it's just me on the brides side\) whilst they had pictures with the grooms children and grandchildren. But once they were finished the photographer left without taking any photos of me with the happy couple. I was surprised and very hurt that i was not included as an 'immediate' family member. This was repeated throughout the day \- i was not mentioned in the speeches, i was not included in the receiving line \(i was a witness\), I wasn't on the top table whilst the grooms children were. 

I want to make it clear that I am very happy for her but I am finding it incredibly hard to get over this. I am an only child and was there for my mother when no one else was but on the most important day I was completely forgotten and I find that it hurts me a lot that I cannot stop thinking about it and crying. I don't want to ruin her happiness but how do i let it go?

TLDR: Only child who supported a parent when the chips were down was completely forgotten and ignored on said parents wedding day. "
"Girlfriend of 2 years (28f) replaced all my (28m) old books with new copies, angry doesn't begin to describe how I feel


I had a collection of 200 books and 80 comic books or so from when I was a child till maybe around the age of 14 or 15. I love reading so I'd get tons of books and save my pocket money to buy books. At this point most of those books would be a decade and a half to 20+ years old. Some of them were falling apart but they were my copies and for the most part kept in decent condition for books that age.




I had to go away for 1 month on back to back business trips. When I came home she told me she had a surprise for me at my home.  She showed me a brand new book shelf with new copies of all my old books and comic books. I asked her where the others were and she told me she donated some to a few libraries and the rest, she threw them out. I feel like time stopped when she said that. I asked her why she'd do that and she said most of them were old and beat up so she replaced them with new copies that would last longer. I packed up the books and told her to take it back to her place and I'd refund her all the money for the books and shelf. We argued. I yelled quite a lot. She cried. 





I'm not proud of it. But that was my collection. Gifts from friends and family members and things I saved up for. It doesn't matter that they're new copies. I loved my old ones. She comes from a very rich family in my country. Growing up, the second something got a scratch or tear, her parents would replace it immediately. Her car was damaged by some idiot in a parking lot who really shouldn't have been given a license and her parents bought her a new, very expensive car. Her old car was nowhere near the point of no return. Buying a new car was far more expensive than fixing the old one. It never bothered me before because how someone else chooses to spend their money isn't my concern. But now the replace a thing as soon as it's got a tiny dent mentality is affecting me. 




And what's worse is she literally doesn't seem to get why I'm mad. She is so used to just replacing things that she can't understand why I'm angry at the loss of my books. And I'm not sure whether it makes me angrier or feel sorry for her.




Tl;Dr gf donated/threw out my book collection and replaced it with new copies while I was away. I loved my old copies and could give less of a damn about fresh copies that will last longer  "
"Gf's [26F] new job brings in 0 income, but leaves her too tired for her regular chores/responsibilities. What to do?


We've been together for a little over 3 years and we've been living together for 8 mths. 

So gf has started her own small business selling makeup supplies. The starting costs have been extremely high (buying inventory) and she isn't that great with sales, to be honest. She needs to buy new inventory every few months, and right now she is losing far more money than she's earning. The issue is she's part of a small community of similar women who sell the same stuff and encourage her to stick with it, so she says she loves doing this and won't quit anytime soon. 

My issue: before this job, gf worked part-time in the mornings as a neighborhood dog-walker. She made a small, but decent amount of money for herself and we agreed that I would pay for rent, food, utilities, etc. if she is willing to do household chores (laundry, cooking, and cleaning once a week). It worked well for us because she didn't have to worry about bills (before she moved in with me she lived with her abusive parents) and I would come home to home cooked meals and a clean house. 

However, now that she's working this ""job,"" she is exhausted every day and has 0 time for any of her previous responsibilities. I've tried being supportive but it's been months and she has yet to bring in a single dollar. We've had fights over this because I told her if she doesn't bring in any profit soon, I don't understand why she would stay with it. She accused me of being unsupportive and that her job is just as legitimate as mine, but since it's a small business she needs more time before she can make any money. 

I'm frustrated because now I feel like I'm doing my fair share and then a whole lot more. I have to do the cooking every night now because she has sales meetings nearly every evening with her online community group. There's no cleaning either, so I've had to hire cleaners which I pay for. When I ask if she can contribute, she says she's too busy and that when she has the time she will (she doesn't). 

What can I do at this point? She's been losing a couple hundred dollars every month (I'm basically her accountant) and it's not getting any better. When I show her the numbers she ignores me. She's also not incredibly well-informed financially so she gets things like sales v. profits mixed up (she claims she's earning money but she's just counting sales without her costs taken out, so she's actually losing money). I don't know what to do and I'm getting resentful for feeling like I'm funding her hobby, not a job, but she's acting like her job is just as important/tiring as mine. What should I do?

-------

**tldr** Gf's new job is costing her more than she's earning. However, our previous split of responsibilities (I pay for bills/rent, she cleans/cooks) is nonexistent now and I do everything. I'm getting frustrated and she accuses me of being unsupportive. What can I do?"
"My mom [41F] has been unknowingly feeding me [15F] laxatives and says it was for my benefit


Throwaway because this is too embarrassing to put on my real reddit account.

My mom has always been crazy. She’s super vain and fake. She likes to pretend she’s naturally beautiful (she has so much Botox and fillers) and likes to portray our lives like we’re some perfect family when we’re not.

She’s always given me crap because I’m overweight. I know I am and it’s something I’ve tried working on, but it’s really hard to eat healthy when my parents are never around. I’m not allowed to cook by myself so I normally eat pretzels or chips or cookies until someone gets home and orders takeout. I honestly don’t believe it’s my fault that I’m overweight. I’m on the high school varsity soccer team and I take my dogs on walks every other day. So it’s not like I’m sitting down all day just wishing the weight will go away.. I honestly try my hardest! But all my parents order is fake Chinese food and pizza. My mom eats the same things as me but she is skinny because she doesn’t eat until dinner time. She doesn’t eat before work, she doesn’t eat lunch there, and the only calories she consumes is the junk food we eat around 7 pm every weekday. My dad is average but he is 6’4 and can eat way more than me. I’m 5’2 and I weigh 165 pounds.

Anyway the problem is this: I’ve been having really bad headaches lately during bed time, so I’ve been asking my mom for Advil. It started last week and she would let me take 3-4 Advil to make the pain go away. Normally the Advil takes an hour to kick in, but I would go to bed with the headache still SO strong every night and then wake up with severe stomach pains. I thought something was weird because the pills looked different. The Advil I normally take is red. The pills she has been giving me were pink. She told me they were “Advil for women” and that’s why they were pink. Well it’s been happening every single day since last week. I was getting severe diarrhea and having the worst stomach pains and headaches imaginable, she kept giving me more of these pills but it only seemed to make it worse. 

It was the worst pain of my life. But my mom refused to take me to the ER and my dad is on a business trip until next Wednesday so I wasn’t able to ask him. My mom kept saying this would pass and I probably had an upset stomach from eating MSG.

Today I decided to check the medicine cabinet after school to find another pain reliever that could work. I took some Advil out and they were red... but my mom had just told me that they didn’t make them in red anymore? Something didn’t add up. So I looked through the entire cabinet and I found out she’s been feeding me these laxatives (labeled for women) with a chemical called biscodyal. She’s been making me take 5-10 of these a day and lying to me that they were pain relievers. Because of her, I’ve missed 3 soccer practices and had to leave in the middle of my math exam because I was literally shitting liquids. One time I thought I had to fart while I was in the school bathroom, but then I ended up getting diarrhea all over my white pants. My best friend is the same size as me and covered for me, but I am so angry.

I texted her and asked her why she would do this and she said she did it for my benefit, that the quality of my life will increase if I get thinner and that she had to do it for me so I would stop being overweight?!?! I haven’t responded yet. I have no idea what to do. My mom was poisoning me with laxatives. I even googled it and everyone on the internet says laxatives don’t help you lose weight. Why would she do this to me? She constantly points out features about me that would be fixed through plastic surgery and she always calls me fat but J never knew she would intentionally poison me. Can I report her to the police? I live in Michigan. I have no other family around me, they all live in California. So it’s just me, my mom and my dad.

TL;DR: my mom poisoned me with laxatives because she thought I was too fat. "
"Mother (56F) told me (29F) why my brother (28M) isn’t close to me anymore and I’m devastated


I never met my mom’s side of the family. She later explained that they were incredibly abusive to her, her grandfather, her dad, one of her uncles and later her own brother. It was an insanely messed up environment and my mom and her sister suffered greatly. Sometime after she left home, she had it rough being on her own like that, some failed attempts at relationships before finally meeting my dad and settling down. He died 8 years ago. She hasn’t made much attempts to date afterwards; she says she gave a few guys chances but no one interested her enough to be with them. I think losing my dad devastated her in ways she barely understood. His death brought us much closer since we were the typical mom/daughter who fight like cats and dogs until my dad passed. It was probably the one silver lining of that and knowing my dad, he’d probably be muttering to himself that of course it took him kicking the bucket for us to get along.





My brother and I were super close on the other hand. We’d spent our childhood and early – mid teen years doing everything together and even when we developed our own social circles, we didn’t just drop each other. We’d see movies and walk around the mall together, go on hikes nearby and cycling around and all sorts of things. It was awesome. Most of my good friends were at the stage where they hated/didn’t want to be around their siblings so us having such a great relationship was strange and wonderful because everyone would be like how do you two not murder each other?





When I turned 18 and my brother was 17, we just stopped communicating much if at all. It was heart breaking. We’d been so close for so long and then it was like my own sibling decided I didn’t exist, he barely responded to my attempts to talk, he wouldn’t hang out with me anymore and considering that we both entered university/final year of high school around that time we drifted apart. Every year the gap felt wider. Then our dad died some years later and I hoped that maybe it might help me to bridge the gap between us but it didn’t. There seemed to be a brief period where I thought we’d at least start talking again but nothing happened. Mom and my bro were still very close but there was nothing between us. At some point I realized we hadn’t spoken in over a year and I cried. 




Recently we saw each other and decided to get some dinner and a couple drinks. It was because we both came home for mom’s birthday, well I live about half an hour away and my brother is about a 3 hour drive away. We both stayed at home for a couple days and I asked him to get something to eat with me and he agreed. It was super awkward because we were pretty much strangers at that point as in our relationship was basically a birthday text and maybe a Christmas card with a ‘Merry Christmas’ written in it. He leaves presents for my daughter with our mom and has never really bonded with her too much; she’s 5 now. I would have liked him to be godfather to her but like I said, we’re not close and it felt awkward to ask. 




When we got dinner, the awkwardness only disappeared after maybe 3 drinks and we were catching up on life. As in pretty much everything over the period of years when he said something along the lines of look at us chatting like old friends and I replied well if somebody hadn’t decided their sister was a pain in the arse we wouldn’t need to catch up. He got silent for a while and I thought he felt guilty or something but then he just started talking. When we were teens and spending so much time together, our mom would come to him and tell him over and over that brothers and sisters must not be so close. That it was very inappropriate and he was messing me up and that he could hurt me. He said she’d make him feel bad about spending time together and did this for about 4 years or so till we finally stopped speaking often. He said that as he got older mom would be very vicious with him when it came to me, when it came to everything else they got along well but she’d be frighteningly protective of me or at least against us spending time. If we hugged or anything like that she’d verbally tear into him and on more than a few occasions she hit him. Eventually it just got to be too much and coupled with his first breakup which happened shortly before we stopped talking, at that point he was just so depressed because he felt like he was intruding on my life and couldn’t ask for advice. Mom hammered home that I should be left to my girlfriends and whoever else I was friends with and that as my brother, the best thing he could do was stay far away from me.




So he did. He ignored me to avoid being harassed by mom and as the years went by it got easier and here we are a decade later and practically strangers. He’d feel guilty for wanting to talk to me and wanting to spend time with me. Mom made him feel like he was being incredibly dirty and inappropriate for these things and at some point that was how he began to feel. 




I asked my mom about it and she confirmed it to me. I knew about her past with her family but this was where I got all the details and why she felt she had to protect me from my own sibling. I feel like I failed as a sibling, I’m angry at myself and my mother. I feel sorry for her and understand why she might think that was something she should do but I just feel crushed right now. 





And I have no idea just where to begin dealing with this situation. 





TL;DR Mother was violently abused for most of her childhood/teen years by most of her immediate male family, despite having a close relationship with my brother she felt she had to protect me from ever potentially ending up in such a situation by sabotaging my own relationship with him to the point where we’ve barely spoken in years and are strangers to each other when we used to be very close

"My [32F] boyfriend [36M] is better than me at EVERYTHING and I feel so inferior


My boyfriend is wonderful, and treats me amazingly well. I met him when he was newly out of a 14 year relationship and still in love with his ex (the breakup was not a mutual decision), but I just couldn't justify cutting things off with someone who was so awesome in every other way - I just figured I'd take it slowly and see what happened. I was worried about being a rebound because he was incredibly lonely, but thought that if we were still together by the time he got over his ex, that worry would disappear.

However. He went to one of the best colleges in the world, got a PhD from one of the best universities in the world. He speaks 4 languages, has traveled the world, can talk about history, politics, music, etc., is athletic, and everyone who meets him loves him. His ex is very similar.

He and I work in the same industry - I had just made a career change when we met, and was incredibly green. He's been mentoring me and I've actually become decent at my job but have a long way to go. I had been halfheartedly trying to learn another language when we met and still am, and I work out and am in decent shape but rarely am able to keep up with him (but he's too nice to ever rub it in). People aren't as interested in me - I just don't have the ability to converse on such a wide range of topics, and am not as sharp and witty. I used to think of myself as reasonably intelligent but everyone who knows him thinks he's one of the smartest people they've ever met (I'd say the same), so by comparison I feel ""slow"".

So when people see us together they automatically assume he's with me for the sex. They think we don't make sense (some have even said that aloud), and I don't blame them. He knows EXACTLY how much expertise I have in basically everything, how much I'm lacking. It makes me feel so exposed. I've spoken to him about my insecurity and he reassures me that he loves me and thinks I'm awesome. But I don't feel awesome. Especially today, since I just failed a test for a class that I was taking in our mutual field.

TLDR; my boyfriend is perfect and I don't know why he's with me.

How do I move past this feeling of inadequacy? I need to stop asking for reassurance because I'm starting to annoy myself."
"How should I [F22] interpret this email [M??] (accountant emailed me)


Basically, I went in to book an appointment to get my taxes done at a big company yesterday, and I asked the (extremely attractive) guy (maybe late twenties or thirty) who was helping me book the appointment some questions. He answered them and said that he would book my appointment with him tomorrow, to make things easier. 


So I went in for my appointment today, he was really nice and helpful, explaining things in a lot of detail and asking if I had any questions. I kind of felt like he was trying to prolong the appointment, which I didn't mind. We also talked about other unrelated personal topics, for example, our weekends, he asked me about my future plans with school, made some jokes etc. We also briefly talked about a coffee shop I regularly visit. So all of this is pretty normal I think, and it was a good convo. After he asked me a few more times if I had any last questions, which I didn't, I left. He said to contact him or come back if there was anything else. 
When I came back home, I dramatically gave a run-down to my roommates about how the great appointment was and how cute I thought he was (lol). 


WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING, I got an email from his work email... he basically said ""thanks for the appointment, feel free to contact me if you have any other questions"" AND he referenced the coffee shop I had mentioned during the appointment and said maybe we would bump into each other there. 


SO my question is, is this weird or normal? Is it even flirty? Is it inappropriate?? What do I do? 
Mind you, I felt a good vibe during the appointment and I was FREAKING OUT when I saw that he actually emailed me because of how jokey/stupid I was going on about it to my roommates. 


TLDR: Really hot guy who did my taxes sent me a suggestive/flirty? email afterwards. Is this weird or should I go with it??

"My [17F] boyfriend [16M] passed away and his sister dislikes and she doesn’t want to let me attend the funeral but her parents let me and I need some advice


This really hurts. It hit me really really hard. He was only 16 he lost his life too young. He had everything going for him, high grades, graduating ahead of schedule, good kid, worked, very respectful, helped his parents, and he had a great personality. 

His older sister who is 22 blames me for him being gone which I feel like it is partly my fault. His sister never really liked having him around girls and always tried to protect him from being hurt. He was the best boyfriend, I wish I could have him in my arms at this moment.

He dropped me off at home after going to prom, he wasn’t under the influence or anything, but, another drunk driver rear ended him into a wall. I didn’t get a good nigt text or a I’m home safe text from him. I stayed up all night and nothing, I called, texted, and still nothing. Then I told my dad about it and he got concered and eventually we went to his house at midnight and his parents were asleep. 

He wasn’t there and we went home for the night. I still didn’t sleep and his mom finally called. She broke down crying and his dad broke the news to me. I haven’t been able to stop crying. His sister blamed it on me and doesn’t want to see me. His parents still invited me to his funeral .

tl:dr How do I act at the funeral? Do I avoid the sister? Do I hug her? I don’t know what I should do"
"My wife and I [32M] have been having problems for about a year. I finally did something about it and she's [31F} begging for another chance and promising to change. I don't know if it's enough.


We got married 3 years ago after 4 years of dating. About a year ago, my wife - for lack of a better way to say it - got mean. It wasn't all at once, but things have definitely gotten worse. She's just rude and indifferent to me, that's really all there is to it. She never asks about my day or shows any interest in things going on in my life. Everything I do, she has a problem with. Even when I try to do something nice for her. A little isolated example: for our anniversary in January I surprised her by leaving work early and fixing her favorite dinner (which is pretty challenging to cook) so it'd be ready for her when she got home. The first thing she said to me was that the meat was too salty and then she fixed herself a salad. 

I just feel like she doesn't even like me. Like I'm an annoyance and something she puts up with. She doesn't even respond positively to compliments I give her. She acts like she doesn't hear or just gives little one-word responses. The only time I hear her talk for an extended period of time is if the conversation is about her. And this isn't a total personality change. I've seen her interact with other people just like her old self. It's just with me.

We've talked about this, of course. Usually to not much of a conclusion. Last month we had a big talk and I finally brought up separation. She broke down, swearing she'd try to do better. I was somewhat hopeful. ""Better"" lasted all of a week.

Over the weekend I hit my breaking point. I woke up early on Saturday to go play basketball with friends. She made absolutely no acknowledgement of me leaving. When I got back I tried to strike up a conversation with her. She made no initiation and no response. No ""How was the game?"" or ""How is [friend]?"" I'd try to initiate by saying stuff like ""Oh, [friend] is moving in with his girtlfriend. That's exciting."" She'd say ""Hmm"" and that was that.

After about a solid 30 minutes of trying to fucking *talk* to my wife I just...gave up. For good. I packed my duffel bag back up and told her I was going to go stay with a friend, that I really needed some space to think about what I want out of this.

My wife has been calling me nonstop since, saying I can't give up yet. That she's sorry, she never knew I felt so bad (bullshit), that she is going to do whatever it takes to make it better, and that we'll go to counseling.

Problem is: I don't know if I even want that. I'm so not in-love with my wife that I don't see how counseling could fix it. Even if she treated me better, I don't think I can forgive the past year. I also don't know if I believe that she'll do better. It's like she's only in the last month realized how fucky our relationship has been for a year now, and she's already promised once to do better with absolutely no results.

Am I giving up too soon? I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR: My wife is mean to me and has been for a year. After me initiating a separation she's suddenly all about fixing us. I don't know if I care.**"
"My [21M] boyfriend is extremely critical of my [22F] new job. I’m starting to think we’re incompatible.


I’m 22, an engineer, and about to graduate. I’m starting a job with a company I’ve interned two summers for (and I’ve enjoyed working for them both summers). It’s a very, very demanding but cool job, very interesting thing I’m working on and personally I find it fulfilling.


My boyfriend is engineering student (a junior in the same major) and will not stop talking about how he thinks this job will make me miserable. He makes constant passive aggressive remarks coming out of nowhere about what’s wrong with my job and how it’ll make me unhappy. I start in two weeks. I’ve signed a contract ages ago. Uhhh... yay. 


I suppose I feel this has been a pretty rude thing for him to do and am wondering what the hell he’s thinking. He has to know I think the world of him, and will take anything he tells me to heart, and that his negative opinion of something will get to me.


What I honestly suspect is happening? He doesn’t like the idea of women with careers, and just wants a person with a low stress job that can stay home and take care of him. That is totally fine with me. He doesn’t *have* to date me. I honestly understand, I’m pretty sure I’m going to have 50 hr work weeks and most people wouldn’t want a partner like that. 


My view is this - you never know if you’re going to be compatible with someone, and if you’re going to break up with them in a few months regardless. Well, I also suppose you never know if your boss will lay you off and leave you without a personal life either. 


**tl;dr : boyfriend very rude and critical about my job, I’m starting to be filled with self-doubt **"
"UPDATE - How do I (30F) uninvite our creepy neighbor (70sM) to my son's first birthday party?


Original post is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/80qzq2/how_do_i_30f_uninvite_our_creepy_neighbor_70sm_to

After posting this my husband and I decided next time one of saw our neighbor outside we would tell him the plans for the party had changed and it was just family now. Well 3 weeks passed and we never ran into him once which is unusual because he's retired and home all day and so are we because I'm a SAHM and my husband works from home. I'm certain after the awkward incident in the driveway (where he tried to pick our baby up and then scurried away) he was avoiding us. Which I'm more than fine with.

Realizing we weren't going to see him in person I asked my husband to send him a text message explicitly uninviting him to the party. He wrote the words ""...we are rescinding your invitation..."" The reason I wanted it to be explicit is because I took the advice from the post and spoke to the Sheriff's office. They told me if we explicitly tell him to stay away and he doesn't then they will come and help. 

Our neighbor never responded to the text message and he didn't show up to the party. He has still been avoiding us as well which is a big relief. 

Some people in the post told us to move which just isn't going to happen. We just bought this house and it's our first and hopefully only house. We saved for a decade, moved across the country, picked the best school district and a location with low taxes, privacy and the recreation and weather we like. It's a beautiful perfect house in a beautiful and perfect location. 

We are hoping this unhealthy, alcoholic 70-something year old neighbor will either move or pass away sooner than later. He's mentioned moving to be closer to his ""honey""... So fingers crossed.

We've taken some other security measures. We installed 3 outdoor security cameras. We also had shades installed (new construction home and didn't come with window treatments). 

We have future plans to extend our fence to the front of the house and install a driveway gate but we need to save some $$$ first.

Like I said I spoke to law enforcement. He's not registered as a sex offender in this county and I couldn't find anything online regarding criminal activity either. They confirmed that his actions and comments were unusual and told me to call them if he ever comes by after we tell him not to.

I also Facebook messaged his nextdoor neighbor. He mentioned her and her daughter numerous times but I never once saw them speak or say hi or anything. I thought mother to mother maybe she could tell me more about him. Unfortunately she never messaged me back and I never see her outside. 

We are extremely vigilant watching our son when we play in the front of the house. But we just had our backyard redone so we won't have to be in the front anymore once the sod is settled. He's a big healthy 12 month old and we aren't going to let anything happen to him.

TLDR: neighbor never showed up to the party, got the hint and is leaving us alone."
"My (35m) MIL (60s, married to wife, 35, for 10 years) threw away about 200lbs of Elk meat I'd hunted/harvested. I am so hurt/sad/angry I'm afraid I might do or say something terrible.


This post could literally go on for days because of our very contentious relationship with my MIL but I will do my very best to keep it on point and concise. 

I could start at the very beginning, but to suffice to say my MIL is truly a rotten person. She is exceptionally cruel to those people that love her  like family but to the outside world, she's a very attractive, in shape extreme extrovert who is every strangers best friend. I believe she's one of the only people I've ever met who I would say is a true narcissist and she doesn't see people as ""real,"" rather just plot devices to move her story along.

About four years ago, after every single visit to our house going bad, my wife and I finally said ""enough"" and basically banned her from visiting. We'd see her sporadically at family events but even then, she and my wife would fight constantly but it was a true relief to not see twice a year like we had been. 

So back in March, MIL called and said that she had a friend that lived in our city who was dying of cancer and she'd love to come stay. My wife and I talked it over and we decided that the ""right"" thing to do would be to let her stay but with some very strict ground rules (she had to rent her own car, she had to give us some space and we were unwilling to discuss any hot button issues). It went south from the second she got out of security at the airport when she told my wife ""you know, when my friend Jane's daughter picks her mom up the airport, she's able to meet her at the gate. Why didn't you try that?""  (the comparison to other peoples kids is one of my wife's serious trigger issues and MIL pretends to not know this) It devolved into an argument over us over not having the right popsicles, not having a coffee maker and the fact that she had to get a rental car. 

By the time they got home my wife was in tears and locked herself in our room. I sat my MIL down and said we aren't even an hour into this and she's broken her agreement. I said she had to behave or she would have to leave. She agreed, that was Monday morning and she spent the afternoon with her friend so we didn't see her. I got up and went to work yesterday and she was in our guest room. 

As an important aside, a few years ago I decided to start hunting because I have a real problem with factory farming as I love animals. I realize this may be an oxymoron to people but becoming a hunter was a solution to what I saw was a real problem, people may or may not agree and that's fine. I also need to say that killing an animal deeply affects me, I mean when I get a kill I sit next to the animal in tears, praying, thanking it for it's sacrifice. I also use every single bit of the carcass which is practical because I'm so deeply moved by an animal giving it's life to feed my family and want to make the most of it. This last years animals were deeply special to me as they are the ones that I cleaned completely by myself. 

So I went to work yesterday and didn't see MIL, she had a huge issue with my wife in the morning because MIL was supposed to help get the kids to school, instead she wanted to sit in our hottub, so the day didn't get off well. I got a call at about 4 when my wife usually gets home saying ""all I can tell you is, please don't come home. Get a room at the Westin, I'll pay for it."" I sort of joked ""its that bad?"" Wife said ""its worse than it could ever be, please call me back in an hour or so.""

I didn't really take my wife seriously because I thought this was just one of their ""normal"" arguments but I called my wife back and she said ""please sit down."" My instant thought was my MIL had passed away. I said I was so she said ""mom went into your freezer and threw away all your elk meat today."" It didn't really process at first so she repeated it and I asked why. she said ""it turns out mom's been a vegan since her friend got cancer because she's convinced why she got cancer and she's worried we're feeding the kids meat."" So basically her mom has been a vegan for about a month. I asked how she was even able to do it, she said MIL waited until we were all out of the house and put I all in our curbside trashcan. Tuesday is trash day and it's gone. 

I am devastated. I mean devastated. I took my wife up on the hotel because I don't know what I would say to my MIL. I am so crushed. I'm crushed for all the work I put in to preparing, practicing with my bow, all the time and travel away from my wife and kids to hunt, the hassle of the getting the tags, etc... But mostly I'm devastated that I watched the life go out of a beautiful creatures eyes and now what's left of it is sitting in a metal box at the country transfer station. Maybe this is hard to understand, but this is bringing up the pain of watching that bull die all over again. And it's just such a waste, it's gone. 

I don't know what to do. I want to confront my MIL and make her understand but I don't think she ever will. I don't know if I can be trusted with my words to not just go off on her but I think the trouble is she either wouldn't know or just wouldn't care how much pain she's causing me and how utterly wasteful she was. 

I texted my wife that she has to go and currently there's a battle on where she'll go but I truly don't care. I trust my wife to handle it and that she'll be gone but I never, ever, ever want to see her again. 

Because I need to reconcile this down to questions, here goes:

1. What restitution should I seek from her? I mean I could extrapolate this out to being worth thousands of dollars in time, effort and meat. And now that food has to be replaced (much less quality beef, likely). I will never see a penny from her so do I use this as leverage to say ""pay me or you don't see us or your grandkids""

2. What do I say to her? How do I make even make her understand how much this hurts and how wasteful it is? Is it best just to not say anything because any argument will just be more frustrating?

tl;dr: my MIL threw away about 200lbs of elk mean that I'd hunted/harvested. I am devastated because hunting to me is a truly spiritual activity and I'm crushed by the waste of what was a beautiful animal. She's been a problem for a long time and this time, I truly don't know what to do. 

edit: please don't think this is some slam on Vegans. I deeply respect vegans for their respect for animals. I feel we come at this from the same place but with different solutions. I also think veganism is probably a very passing fad for my MIL.

"My best friend (27M) left me (25F) to pet-sit in his apartment, which turned out to be flea- and roach-infested. What is a reasonable response when he returns?


My best friend, who I have known since high school, left for a two-week trip last weekend. I agreed to pet-sit for his dog and his roommate's cat in their home. It was supposed to be convenient for me, too, since his apartment is just down the street from my work instead of my usual one-hour commute.

The first day, I realized there were fleas. The dog had fleas. The cat had fleas. As evidenced by the bites all over my and my boyfriend's ankles, the house had fleas. I treated the animals and spent hours taking care of the problem.

The second night, 20 roaches scattered onto the walls as I turned on the kitchen light. Same story in the bedroom. I realized they were living in the dog food, his electronics, and an empty salami container under the bed. I slept with the lights on that night because it was too late to do anything about it.

I've been trying to handle the problem. But this morning I woke up with a roach on my arm. Then I rinsed one from my hair in the shower. Then I found one on my backpack as I was carrying it. I can't do it anymore.

I'm backing out of petsitting and am arranging other care for the animals. My friend seems nothing care too much, implying that I am inconveniencing his vacation.

When he gets back, I plan to talk to him about this. I don't want to damage our friendship, but I'm pissed and want him to know it. Is it my place to tell him to clean up his act and that he's an irresponsible pet owner? Or should I just take this as a lesson to stay away from his apartment? He also owes me about $200 between the treatments for the animals, the bug sprays, etc...

**TL;DR -- Friend had me pet-sit his bug-infested apartment. I can't do it anymore. Is there any point letting him know how pissed I am when he returns? What would be overboard?**"
"UPDATE: My [24/F] partners [28/M] parents are mad because I accepted their offer to stay with them during an emergency


So my partner and I have been talking loads about the situation. He spoke to his sister who revealed that his dad said after they second time they met me that he has hesitations because I am a different religion, culture, my job, ethnicity and my parents are divorced. I guess his dads ideal would have been a young british indian traditional girl who is a doctor from a good family (IRONIC because I'm doing a phd). Also because we have not had a formal agreement to get married he felt that I am too free and too comfortable.


The dad also seems to not be very straightforward, ie as many comments in the previous post suggested, that he offered to appear one way (kind, accommodating etc) but perhaps did find me an inconvenience. He also felt uncomfortable about the key (which really upsets my partner) because I use it to help them with their dog who would have been at home, hungry, without a bathroom walkie for nearly 12 - 15 hours when there was no one at home. I would have never used the key without telling anyone and if they had asked I would have given it back. I can't help but feel upset that they gave me a house key to look after the dog and then complained about me having one. I gave the key back and my partner spoke to his parents. Parents were not so straightforward about their hesitations with my partner, probably because they know it would upset him and his dad probably knows inside that his comments are not justifiable. I think me accepting their offer to stay over just aggravated the situation and everything came to light.


I told my partner that I have no control over things like my ethnicity, and that while this situation can be forgiven and moved on from it foreshadows much more problems in the future and that if we are to stay together he has to prove to me that he will stick by me and stand up for me. I don't think his family was happy that my partner told me what they said and showed me the messages.


Anyway, my partner is away till Tuesday training on a new plane. His dad texted me today (friday) saying ""Dear Sam, I am very sad to know that there seems to have been some misunderstandings recently. We would like to have dinner with you tonight. I should be back from work around 7:30. Can you please confirm you will be able to come? Thanks, Dad"".


What do I do? I can't help but feel that this may not be genuine and that they are only asking me to come to save face and not look as traditional / unfair as they actually are. On a good note, his mum does in fact like me and thinks that this situation is stupid.


TLDR: Partners parents asked me to stay over, then got angry I did and are now trying to rectify the situation

"My (23F) boyfriend (27M) can’t decide between me or a girl he met two weeks ago


Throwaway, really just posting to rant and possibly get advice.

My relationship was great we we were together almost two years and living together in a house I own for about six months we both have insecurities but we were both working on them.

These past couple weeks I’ve felt like something was off but I was assuming I was just overthinking everything and decided to wait it out. Last night felt really weird. So I confronted him asking if he’s going to break up with me or something. He said “I’m not breaking up with you but you’re probably going to break up with me.” He proceeded to tell me he met some girl 2 WEEKS ago and they had an instant connection and he can’t get her out of his mind. They’ve been texting for these two weeks and they go to the same gym.

I told him crushes fade. He says it’s not just a crush. I said oh you fell in love with someone in two weeks? He said no.I offered two options 

A. He goes no contact with her, we go to therapy
B. We break up and he can go enjoy whatever relationship he thinks he’s going to have with her

He couldn’t decide. So we broke up. He spent the night somewhere else last night and is coming by soon to pick up all his shit.

Didn’t sleep at all last night all I can think about is how fucked up this is. Just does not make sense to me. We have the same values, we go out, have amazing sex, laugh together, also do our own thing, and enjoy spending lazy time together at home.  I’ve been with him through his battle with severe depression with seeing drs and getting on and off and on again medication. But someone else can just come along and he forgets about everything?!!! 


TL;DR boyfriend couldn’t decide between our two year relationship or some girl he met two weeks ago so we broke up"
"My [28f] abusive ex [35m] has popped up on social media twice in the last few days. I'm nervous. Am I being crazy or should I tell my husband [31] of 4 years?


So when I was 19, I made one of the worst decisions of my life when I dated this guy John for a little over a year. He was extremely abusive to say the least. When I tried to break up with him, he beat the crap out of me and ended up in jail for just under a year, complete with a full package of restraining orders and just general madness. I was happy to be rid of him but also spent a LOT of time being afraid to leave the house, afraid he'd come after me after he got out of jail (he threatened to do so), etc. 

I have seen John twice since he went to jail - once walking down the street while I was driving and one other time at the local mall. We live in a small city so I guess it was unavoidable. Both times led to some pretty serious mental decline on my part - panic attacks, being afraid to leave the house, etc. It's not good.

Unfortunately, all of the restraining orders and things have expired now so I just have to be careful about who I associate with and avoid him however I can. He's never tried to contact me post-breakup so there's not a whole heck of a lot the police can do. I have him blocked everywhere I possibly can.

I've been doing really well the past couple of years (it's been about 8 years since all of this happened), but something happened recently that has me worried. 

A couple of days ago I saw a comment he posted on a mutual friend's facebook wall. That shouldn't happen, because I have him blocked everywhere (or so I thought). Turns out he made a new facebook account so I had to block him again - I have no idea how long he has had access to my profile through mutual friends. Maybe a couple of months. I also deleted the mutual friends we had in common just to be safe.

Then, today, I went to delete an old plenty of fish account from years ago. Out of curiosity, I checked the ""who viewed you"" section and... there he is. The profile was already full of gibberish from the last time I tried to delete it (I couldn't figure out how to do it so I just deleted all the photos and replaced the profile text with nonsense), so the only real reason I can think of about how he ended up there was by searching for my old email address.

These two things combined have me feeling like I'm somehow on his mind again.. especially if he is specifically seeking out my email address on dating sites, etc. That's not something I am equipped to deal with. My husband and I are moving soon (still within the same city) so he won't know where I live but frankly I'm nervous.

Is there anything I can do to protect myself? Is this something I should mention to my husband? Am I just being paranoid? Basically any input at all is appreciated. Thanks!

**TL;DR - Extremely abusive ex from 8 years ago (who threatened to come after me after he got out of jail for beating me up) created a new facebook account and could see my stuff due to a mutual friend - no idea how long he had access but he's blocked now. Then I found out he viewed me on an old dating website profile, that he could only find if he searched for my email address. I'm nervous. Am I being paranoid or do I need to tell my husband to keep an eye out? What can I do, if anything??**"
"I [17M] am tired of my friend [17M] who keeps mentioning this girl [17F] to me (that he thinks I have a crush on) and has come up with ridiculous theories on how we could be together.


My friend and I are both in grade 11, and she's in grade 12.

This girl named Natalie walked into our chemistry class six months ago, and my friend Stanley \(of two years\) made some comment about her. A few days afterwards, he followed her on Instagram, and I saw it in my feed. I thought it was funny so I took a screenshot of it and put it in our group chat.

He turned it around and made it seem like I had a crush on her. I played along with the joke because at the time it was just a meme.

Stanley would mention her to me every day, ""Doesn't Natalie look really nice today?"", ""Guess who I saw? Natalie!"" and he convinced my other friends to join in on the joke \(they got bored after a week\). In all the classes we had, he'd turn around and say her name to me. I told him to stop multiple times, and he refused to. This happened for a month until winter break came around.

The month after winter break was great. Stanley stopped talking to me about Natalie, and we went back to discussing school work, video games, and other people besides her.

\(What happened between the month after winter break to now is complicated, but as the months went by he started mentioning Natalie more until...\)

A recent event caused the meme/joke to come back, and it's at its worse now. A week ago there was a talent show at my school. Of course, Natalie was in it, and so was Stanley. In the days leading up to it, my friend kept mentioning that she was going to be in it, and begged me to come to hear her sing. I told him the joke was dead, and there wasn't a point in talking about her anymore, but he refused.

I came to the talent show, not because I wanted to hear her sing, but because I wanted to support my friend who was playing the guitar. He talked to her afterwards and mentioned my name. God knows what Stanley said, but I hope he didn't tell her that I like her, because while I think she's attractive I don't have a crush on her.

I guess maybe I shouldn't have come because his ""obsession"" with talking to me about her has gone overboard.

He also came up with this stupid theory \(one of many\) that since my parents were high school sweethearts, it means if Natalie and I were to date, then we'd be together for the rest of our lives. That's the only one that makes sense because the other ones are so ridiculous that he himself can't say it with a straight face.

I told him to stop, and his response was that I didn't ""have to be afraid"" to show him my true feelings/love for Natalie.

My patience has run out. He mentioned her name to me 10\+ times today at school, and I'm getting pissed. I don't understand why he's so interested in my love life, even when I've told him explicitly that I don't want to date anyone in high school. It's like the only thing he wants in his life is for me to be with her.

How do I get him to stop talking about her to me?

**tl;dr:** My friend thinks I like this girl because I said she was pretty, and he turned it into a joke/meme because apparently me having a crush on someone is amusing to him \- to the point where he comes up with stupid theories on how we can be together, and mentions her name multiple times a day to me."
"My [30f] ex husband [34M] [6 yrs together] keeps writing shitty songs about me and it infuriates me.


TL;DR - Emotionally abusive, alcoholic ex is using our divorce as fodder for his shitty songs, and it makes me want to fight back because none of what he's saying is true. What actions can I take to feel empowered again?


I was married in my 20s to a man who I spent a total of 6 years with. He always drank, but as soon as we were married instead of dating, he began binging and abusing me. It was like a switch flipped inside of him the second we got married. I didn't understand it, I was naive, I thought I was being strong and supportive of a sad person when really I was being abused.


After months of him yelling, throwing things, drinking &amp; driving, and violently waking me up, I gave him the choice to divorce or get help. He literally said to me, ""I'd rather get divorced than stop drinking."" He was sober when he said that. The next day, he tried to take it back, but I was so exhausted and destroyed that I insisted on the divorce. We filed mutually, I paid him 14k so I could keep MY house (which I bought before we were married, he contributed NOTHING financially to it), and then we went on our way.


I have been in therapy for the past 3.5 years. I was diagnosed with PTSD and worked through it using a special type of therapy called EMDR. I also took medication for anxiety, until very recently when I was deemed well enough to taper off of both medication and therapy (over the course of a year).

Anyway, my ex still lives in the same city as me and while I actively avoid places I might see him in person, the internet alerted me to his band releasing a new album. A mutual friend posted a picture of the album and said it was good or whatever. I obviously don't care that much but then I noticed that the album cover was a photo TAKEN OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE. On my street. My street is not a major street. This was definitely done on purpose.

Okay, so I clicked through to the album and it's a bunch of ""pity me, my wife left me"" songs written by my ex, including songs that are titled with the cross streets for my house (ex: 1st and Vine). The lyrics are terrible, but the absolute worst part is that they rewrite history to make it look like I'm the evil bitch and he's a poor sad chump that got dumped.

In reality, it was the opposite. I have videos of him directly abusing me that I took to show him what an asshole he was when he was drinking. I have definitive proof. 

I don't know why it makes me mad, but it absolutely boils my fucking blood that he is writing this shit. I now realize that at the other side of every heartbreak song, there's some ex rolling their eyes over how skewed it is. It makes me so, so, so mad.

I already reported songs he's posted on Youtube for using my name/details, but half of me is tempted to just post the videos of him being an abuser and link them to all the outlets where his album is posted. I know that won't solve anything, but the problem with abuse is that it already makes you feel unheard, like you have no say in anything, and now it's just compounding that feeling. 

I also want to write him a lengthy, ranty email about what a POS he is, but I know that won't solve anything either. 

What should I do? I feel voiceless and at a loss.

"My [29F] husbands [26M] jokes and comments are ruining what little self worth I have left


Background; we’ve been together for 6 years, married for 7 months. No kids and no plans for kids. He is, in his words, brutally honest, and he likes to think he’s very funny (which sometimes he absolutely is). I am generally insecure, dealing with anxiety, ptsd, and my weight. 



The past year and a half, I have gained about 20kg, after learning that my mental issues stem from abuse as a child. I’ve been very aware of it, and trying to fix it, but obviously it’s difficult. My weight gain has halted, but I’ve yet to lose more than a couple of kgs. 

My husband rarely tells a white lie, and will just flat out say I’m too fat.  He will not hesitate saying this in front of other people either. Yesterday I told him I wanted to dye my hair a dusky lavender and he told me I’m too fat for that, which broke whatever little confidence I had left. 

Secondly, he likes to make mistress jokes, divorce jokes, and, being his honest self, refuses to make promises he potentially can’t keep. He has been joking about serving me divorce papers on the day before my 30th birthday for months, he keeps joking about having a mistress named Susan, and will often joke about wanting a divorce in front of his family. 


While I do know these are jokes, and that I *am* too fat and need to lose weight, the frequency of which he says these things are completely ruining whatever confidence I have left, and makes me feel so inferior and like human garbage that deserves nothing. They fuel my self hate spiral, so to speak. I have asked him dozens of times to please stop, a few of them while *crying* due to his behaviour, and he always says he will, only to start up again a day or two later. His jokes are tame enough for me to be able to handle them while in a better mental state, but being very alone in dealing with my trauma (he doesn’t understand) it’s difficult, and I will suck all of his comments up like a sponge. 


As I’ve pleaded with him to stop multiple times without success, I need advice on how to make him understand he is unintentionally destroying my self worth. I need to make him stop for more than a few days so that I’ll have a chance to repair myself. 


*TL;DR!* Husbands fat comments and jokes about divorce and cheating is making me feel like garbage and he can’t seem to stop despite being asked to. "
"My [29F] husband [29M] is not pulling his weight around the house, even after multiple conversations and promises to step it up. I'm so tired.


I've been with my husband for 7 years, married 3.

I am a full time student, and bring money in via the GI bill and VA disability. I have class every day. I will be getting a full time job after this quarter. My husband works part time, but works close to 40 hours most weeks.

So that's a bit of background, now the issue: He doesn't cook. He doesn't clean. He doesn't shop. He just doesn't take any initiative around the house. We have had a few talks about it. It is worth noting that it took a few months of individual therapy for me to be confident enough to bring these things up.

The first time I brought it up, I was swamped in school. I was taking 20 credits and it was in the summer, so some classes were condensed. I told him what I had coming up, he had seen me stay up well into the night doing school stuff for the entirety of the term, and I didn't see friends or do much because I didn't have time. He saw how busy and stressed I was. When I asked him if he would do more around the house so I can focus a bit more (JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS, I MIGHT ADD) he responded by saying that ""there will be days I'll be wiped out, and days you'll be wiped out..."" something something, I was so taken aback that I honestly don't remember everything he said. And he didn't help. At all.

Another time, I just asked point blank if he could do more housework. He said yes. Next day, he mentioned that he didn't have a chance to sit down that morning before work because he was cleaning. Later that morning, I dropped a berry on the floor, he told me it was under my foot. I got distracted by the cat and stepped on it and he said ""so much for cleaning."" When I asked him what he meant, he said that he was upset that I expected him to do more around the house, but then made a mess after he spent his morning cleaning the house. I said I didn't mean to, and that I don't expect him to spend half of every morning cleaning. I just want him to lessen my burden, because one person cleaning up after two people is stressful and exhausting. We talked more about it, came up with a plan to basically clean up after ourselves and work on weekly tasks together and....he's not doing any of it.

The last time I brought it up, I said that I haven't been happy because I still feel unsupported when he doesn't help with housework and just makes a bunch of work for me. He said he's not home as much, and I said things are going to get busier for me, and it just isn't fair that I keep doing all the work. He said that he sometimes works long days, and is so damn tired. I said I get it, that's fine, but please just try to lessen the burden around here because it is a lot. That was a few weeks ago and...nothing.

Fast forward to now. We had some guests over for dinner on Saturday, it got kinda late. I did all the cooking, btw. He said he would help me clean the kitchen tomorrow (so Sunday) and...didn't. I have 3 tests and a job interview this week. But today, I watched him play video games before work. I cooked dinner and took a nap, and he spent all evening playing video games. I'm so hurt, exhausted, and...I just don't know.

Reddit, what the fuck can I even say to him at this point? I am so hurt and resentful because I've told him how much it bothers me that he doesn't help me, and pushes back the way he does when I ask for help. It's a lot of fucking work cooking, cleaning and shopping for two people when I have my own obligations. I am hurt because he knows what I have on my plate, he has seen me stressed, I have told him it was making me unhappy and....nothing. I'm at a loss.

**TLDR: My husband is not pulling his weight around the house even after multiple conversations and promises to pick it up. I'm hurt. I don't know what to say.**"
"I [19M] was extremely ungrateful to my sister [27F] when she raised me. I want to fix our relationship, and apologize to her, but do I even deserve a second chance?


My sister was 20, and I was 12 years old when our parents passed away in an accident. In their will they had her named as my guardian, and she accepted the responsibility of taking care of me.

My sister sacrificed a lot when she chose to become my guardian. The benefits we received weren't enough, and she had to stop attending university to get a full-time job to support us. Her boyfriend at the time also broke up with her, because she spent all her time raising me.

When I was younger she would read to me every night, do something special for my birthdays, and tell me how much she cared about me. My sister would take us to the beach, and the park. I didn't want to spend any time with my sister because I hated doing stuff with her. I didn't understand why my sister kept making me go to these places, or do these things with her. Now I realize it's because she loved me, and wanted to get closer.

I hated the way my sister raised me. She made me do things that I disliked - chores, cooking dinner, studying, homework, etc. She taught me how to do things that I didn't want to learn - how to drive, how to swim, how to manage finances, how to study properly.

I was able to get a full ride scholarship to the best university in my country, because of my sister. I was already a good student, but her efforts in making me do all my homework, and daily studying pushed me to do even better. My sister would even talk to my teachers to get a better understanding of what I was learning so she could help me.

I was so stupid. I didn't know that my sister was doing all of this for my own benefit, not because she hated me. I should've appreciated her more, but instead I pushed her away. I never told my sister that I loved her. I never showed any appreciation towards her selfless acts. I delayed my sister's career. I caused her boyfriend to break up with her. 

It's been almost a year since I talked to my sister. The last time I saw her was when she helped me move all my stuff into my apartment for university. I never thanked her, when she said goodbye I turned away from her and I didn't say anything back.

I want to fix my relationship with my sister, but I've been so disrespectful to her that I don't know if I deserve a second chance. How do I tell my sister I'm sorry for treating her poorly? How can I ever make it up to her?

I miss my sister.

**TL;DR:** My parents passed away 7 years ago, and my sister became my guardian. She was extremely selfless and caring when she raised me, but I never told her I loved her, or appreciated any of her efforts. I left for university without even saying goodbye, and now I miss my sister. I want to fix our relationship but I don't even know if it's possible.

"I (30f) am finally trying to exercise and lose weight. I run every day and the neighbor kids (6-15?) make cow and pig noises when I go by. I HATE confrontation but do I need to tell their parents or ignore it?


I guess the title pretty much implies that I'm very overweight and I am. I have avoided exercising and eating healthy for a while. I got a raise at work recently so I decided that I would finally bite the bullet and spend the extra money on healthy food so I could lose weight. 

I am also trying to start running. I hate running and I don't think my body is designed to do it but I also don't really want to go to the gym since I feel like the fresh air would be good for me. So I'm running around my neighbor hood and it SUCKS but so far I've stuck to my plan. 

The problem is the second I get outside my apartment complex there is a basketball court adjoining the next complex over and every single time I go that way there are kids in that court. They always say ""mooo"" or ""oink oink"" as I go by, maybe some other things too. I know their parent's are in the complex as it's only 6 units. 

My question is do I take this to their parents? I hate conflict so much that I literally feel like I'm going to have a panic attack even thinking about walking up and ringing their door bell but I also think that if I'm taking control of my life, I need to take control of my life in all aspects and stick up for myself. 

What should I do?

tl;dr: I have started running in order to lose weight. Every time I go by the neighbor kids they make cow and pig noises in my direction. Do I take this to their parents? I hate conflict so much but feel like I should.

"I [F/34] might be breaking up with my bf [M/35] of 7 months tonight, and I feel physically ill. There's a girl from his past who won't stop interrupting our relationship.


I've been with my guy for 7 months. I'm 34 and he's 35. The beginning of our relationship was tricky. About 3 weeks before he met me, he met a girl from out of town while skiing with his friend. They really hit it off, and he proceeded to book a flight to go visit her in her state a couple of months later for more skiing together. Then, he met me via online dating. We hit it off tremendously, and started spending all of our time together. We were both quite smitten, and agreed we weren't seeing anyone else. He even dropped the word ""girlfriend"" once during this time to see how I felt about labeling our relationship in that way. 

Then, he let me know that he had this trip planned. He and I had been dating for 3 weeks, and he said (over text) that he would like to still go visit this girl, just as friends, but that he would understand if I didn't want him to. I felt weird about asking him to cancel his trip after only knowing him 3 weeks, so I told him I was fine with that.

He went on the trip. I felt off the whole time he was gone (4 days). I ended up writing him an email on the last day explaining how I was feeling, that I wished he hadn't taken the trip, actually, and I felt really weird and bad about it. He told me he felt weird about it, too, and that we needed to talk. So when he flew back in, he came straight to my house, and we talked. He said his feelings for his girl hadn't disappeared, and they both felt it during the trip. Nothing happened - no kissing or sex - but they were clearly still into each other. He said he didn't let things escalate because he wanted to be in a relationship with me. He said he didn't want to be with her. So we talked a lot and shed some tears, and I told him that I understood it was a weird situation - it's hard to meet two people at essentially the same time that you have feelings for. But I also told him I trusted him when he said he wanted to pursue something with me. I told him if that was going to happen, then he needed to cut contact with this other girl. He had to show me that I was his priority. He agreed, and he cut contact with her. He and I proceeded to rebuild our bond and deepen our relationship.

About 2 months later, he told me that she had reached out to him, saying she missed him. It sent him for a loop, and some of his feelings for her came rushing back. After a tumultuous week, he again told me that he was committed to our relationship, and wanted to be with me. He said he felt like right after the trip, he had cut contact with her because he wanted to show me that he was serious about me and us. But now, he felt more ready to cut contact with her of his own volition. He'd had the time he needed to let go of her, or whatever.

So again, I thanked him for his honesty, and I told him I trusted him when he said he wanted to be with me. He told her (for the second time) that he didn't want her to contact him anymore.

Then, he and I had a great several months. January through now has been so lovely. We've gotten more serious about each other, and we've both expressed to each other that we could see a future with one another. We've been saying ""I love you"" for about 3 months now.

Last week, she reached out to him again. I don't know the specifics of what she said, or what he said, but it was basically that she still missed him. It threw him for yet another loop. He was honest with me again, and told me what he was feeling. He feels like because his experience with her was cut so short, he's still wondering what would have happened if they'd had a chance to explore their connection. There are feelings of ""missing out."" 

He said he also realizes that it's not fair to compare their 6 days together with the 7-month relationship he and I have built. He realizes that the first 6 days are always awesome, and there are never any problems, and you usually feel like you're ""meant to be."" Intellectually he realizes this, but feelings are not always rational. He reiterated again that he wants me, and he wants to be in the relationship with me. He just doesn't know what to do with these feelings. I told him that if we were going to continue, he needed to come up with a solution for her to stop contacting him. Change his phone number - something like that. I said that if he was serious about me and us, he needed to show me that he's willing to protect our relationship by taking action. He agreed.

He talked with one of his close friends about the situation before he talked about it with me, and his friend pointed out that perhaps the reason he can't let go of this other girl is because he feels like something is missing in the relationship with me. He thought about that for a while and realized that he does feel like something is missing between us in the emotional intimacy department. So he and I talked about that for a long time, and we pinpointed some issues in our sex life that we'd both like to change/improve. After that conversation, he said he felt a lot better (and he looked to feel better, too), and that he was committed to our relationship and wanted to keep working on it with me.

But, I still feel really insecure. After 4 months of no contact from her - time spent building OUR relationship - his feelings for her still haven't faded? It makes me feel like he's never going to be able to let go of the possibility of her. It makes me feel like I'll never be enough for him. It makes me feel like I'm going to have to keep working to ""win"" him...forever. It feels bad.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend met me and another girl at about the same time. He decided to pursue things with me, but the other girl continues to contact him, and it's bringing up his old feelings for her. I'm not sure if this is a lost cause."
"My [33M] best friend [32M] of 7 years is terrible with, and to women.


My best friend of the past couple years has some serious problems, and it worries me.


He's reasonably attractive, has a great job, is talented and interesting and wants more than anything else to meet meet and have a long term romantic relationship.  Whenever he hits it off with somebody, however, he'll inevitably creep her out.  I've never met anybody quite as inept at talking to women.  He talks about himself and doesn't listen, gives unsolicited hugs, stands too close and hits on women with boyfriends.


He was raised in an evangelical christian family with a father that exercised complete control over every aspect of the women in his family.  His mother and sisters exist on a fixed allowance and live their lives pending the approval of his father.  Thankfully, he escaped the religious insanity, but the patriarchy did a number on him.  I'm worried he doesn't respect women as intelligent and independent.


I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend [26F] for a year.  We have a vibrant, caring and healthy relationship.  For all intents and purposes, I have exactly the type of relationship my friend wants, but he refuses to acknowledge any of the good advice my girlfriend and I give him.  It's maddening.  We live in a liberal city in a liberal state both work in tech, the opportunity to meet and treat new friends well is abundant.


Does anyone have any experience with this type of situation?  My friend has serious problems and I don't know how to help him.

TL;DR  My best friend has no idea he might be a misogynist."
"My [40F] oldest son [18M] just had the cops called on him and arrested because he punched my husband [49M] and I don’t know what to do.


I married “Sam” 9 years ago.  We have a son [7M] and I have “Ryan” from a previous relationship.  Ryan just turned 18 about 2 weeks ago and tonight I got home late to find the cops arresting Ryan and medics looking Sam over after Ryan had reportedly punched Sam multiple times.  I was obviously distraught and since it was so late the police said I’d have to wait till morning to talk to Ryan.  Sam says that he doesn’t know why Ryan acted violently towards him as they’d been joking around just a short time before.

I don’t know if that’s the truth though.  I’ve known Ryan all his life (obviously since I’m his mother). He’s tall and built like a football player and he’s serious and can be an intimidating presence when he needs to be.  **BUT** he’s also  the kid who spends most his time reading, he prefers chess to most sports, he loves all living creatures (even bugs), and despite how he looks and might be perceived, he’d never harm a fly.  In middle school, he used to be pushed around and bullied a lot and he never once fought back against them and instead would just take the abuse until I finally called the school and told them they needed to take action.  He’s the sweetest child and there was a long time when it was just us going through this world alone and we have a very tight bond.  I’ve never seen him lose his temper once.  When his baby brother was born, he constantly offered to babysit, always wanted to help, and loves playing with him.  And our youngest loves him just as much.  There’s hardly a time where Ryan’s home that our youngest isn’t attached to his hip.  I just can’t see why Ryan would violently attacked Sam for “no good reason”.  It doesn’t fit his personality at all.

When I brought this up to Sam he told me that “he always knew Ryan would snap one day, no one can be that peaceful and happy.”  Which is strange as he’s never mentioned this before.  Then he told me he thought my son was crazy and I was trying to avoid it since I’m his mom.  I admit because of our close bond I feel I have a very good read on my son but even his teachers mention how well behaved and helpful he is in class, so it isn’t just me seeing this.  Our youngest is at his grandparents (Sam’s parents) right now so he has no idea of what’s going on.  I just don’t know how to continue and approach this situation.  I know I **NEED** to talk to Ryan but I’m also worried he won’t tell me the truth either.  He always talks about how he wants to protect me (as a kid he used to pretend to be a knight protecting me lol) and I’m worried he’ll try and hide something from me if I question him on this.  How do I start the dialogue in a way that will get him to tell me the truth?

—-
**Tl;dr**:  my oldest son got arrested for attacking my husband (his step-dad).  My husband says my son “finally went off the deep end” and he doesn’t know why my son attacked him.  Knowing my son and his personality I feel like something isn’t adding up.  However, due to my son’s protective nature I don’t if I just go in there asking what happened that he’ll tell me the full or real story either.  So how do I approach this and open up the dialogue in a way that gets him to be honest with me?

"My 32M boyfriend said he might leave the relationship if I (25F) gained weight


I (25f) have been dating my 32 M bf for about 4 months but I’ve known him for 2 years and we’ve been on/off sexually but not in a committed relationship until now. Well since I’ve known him I’ve noticed that he will make unprovoked hateful and negative comments about other women at random. Women who are overweight. Or not overweight but just not his very narrow minded view of what hot looks like. Last week we were hiking and a women came up running behind us with a weighted pack on her back and SMOKED us on the trail in an impressive way. I was like “Oh wow!” and he whispers loud enough that she probably heard, “She just seems too chunky to be able to do that” and thought it was a funny joke. I told him to shut the fuck up.

The next time it happened was last night. We were watching a show together and he made a comment about a skinny actress regarding her knees looking fat (????) and that’s when I’d had enough. I point blank asked him if he would still like me if I gained a little weight. I am 5’5 and 115. I’ve never been overweight my entire life. But a major insecurity of mine is always wondering if men are into me for me, or because I’m a hot body to fuck.

He didn’t directly answer my question and said “I mean...maybe”. He said that he has a type and I’m that type, and then gave very specific rules policing what he thought an acceptable amount of weight gain for me would be before he thought he couldn’t date me anymore and it would “raise a lot of red flags for him” (btw, apparently my limit is 150). He literally told me that fat or curvy women are unfeminine and gross, and completely unattractive. If the woman isn’t petite like me then he’s not interested. I even asked him if he would overlook my weight gain given an emotional connection and he really wouldn’t answer my question directly. He said it would depend on where in the relationship we happened to be and WHEN I gained the weight. He said that even if a woman is really put together with hair, makeup, nice clothes, nice attitude, pretty face, if she’s overweight he thinks she’s disgusting and he’s not willing to overlook that because “that’s just my preference”. He said that women who gain weight and let themselves go are failures and lazy, despite me bringing up that there are a variety of things that can cause an increased tendency to gain weight.

Personally I think he’s a complete douchebag now and I just can’t get over this. I want to break up with him. I don’t think there’s anything here to work out as he’s already given me his reasonings behind what he meant by his comments and his reasoning was still rude and hurtful. Most of my friends are fat and my sister is fat. When he makes dumbass comments towards women like that, it hurts me personally. He apologized but basically said that’s just how he feels. Now I’m not comfortable having sex with him or being around him in a bikini or taking him around my family or friends because I know that this is how he really thinks of fat women.

I wanted some opinions. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: my boyfriend basically said he’s only with me because of my body, and he would consider ending things if I gained weight. "
"He [M/27] is sweet. Way too sweet. To the point it's creeping me [F/24] out.


I started seeing this guy about a month ago. We followed each other online and work in the same circle, but live across the country from each other. 

We attended the same conference in NYC last month and met in person for the first time. TBH, didn't really give him much thought before I met him. He's so not my type at all, but hey; I've been known to be picky in the past so I wanted to be a little more open-minded.

He asked me out on a date when he met me. I said sure, let's grab drinks. He proceeded to confess he's has a huge crush on me for two months, since he first started following me online. I felt a little weird about that but shrugged it off. It's been awhile since anyone has really liked me or wanted to treat me well, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

The date went well and the next night, we ended up sleeping together. This is normally not something I do (I've only slept with 3 guys my entire life including him) but again, wanted to try something new. I made it clear to him beforehand I wasn't looking for anything serious and was ABSOLUTELY not interested in a long distance thing.

He said he understood, but I'm getting the sense he doesn't. He changed his flight out to be at the same time as mine so we could spend more time together. He asked me if we could talk on the phone most nights and text every day. He sent me flowers as soon as I got home. He asked me to come to his city and stay with him. And, he asked if I'd stay in the same room with him at the next conference we go to, in June.

He says he can really see himself with me. He already calls me by petnames like ""babe"" and ""sweetheart"". He says he daydreams about our future and spending holidays together. Every morning he texts me and says ""I dreamt about you last night"" and how he misses me and can't wait to see me. If I dodge his calls or take too long to respond, he calls me and asks me to reassure him I'm still interested. He needs reassurance at least 3 or 4 times a week that I still like him.

But now I'm starting not to. This is too much for me. I can't handle all of the romantic gestures and talk. It makes me uncomfortable. I feel bad saying that because I'm so used to assholes and selfish guys that I should be grateful to have found someone so sweet. But it's like eating way too much cake or too many cookies; he's just TOO damn sweet. And he barely knows me, and lives 3000 miles away from me, and it's just weird.

And I'm also just really focused on my career right now. Like I said I'd be in NYC again next month for a work thing and how excited I was and the first thing he asks is ""would it be weird if I drove down to see you and stay in your hotel all weekend so we could spend time together?"" (he lives 6 hours away) I didn't wanna say ""yes"" so I just said I needed to focus on work.

Am I being too snobby or ungrateful? If I am, just tell me. Because he seems like a guy who would be really nice to me and I'm not used to that. So maybe this is how relationships are supposed to go. But I feel like he's at 100 and I'm around 15 on the interest scale. And it's depleting every day.

**tldr:** Guy I just started seeing is reaaaally into me and is taking things too fast. Not sure if I should give him another chance or break it off.

"My [27F] future MIL is planning on wearing white to the wedding and my fiance [28M] will not intervene, plus a whole mountain of bullshit


So this is partially a MIL problem (classic MIL, she hates me and is crazy) but mostly a problem with my fiance. We have been dating for 3 years, including our 1-year engagement. The wedding is in a month. I have been absolutely head over heels for my fiance ever since we started dating. He was the smartest, funniest, most caring guy I had ever met. We would stay up for hours just talking. We've only had a couple of major fights in our relationship, your typical ""right after moving in"" kind of disagreements and we were both really constructive about it even when we were arguing. On paper, we should be perfect for each other and great together as a married couple. I thought that's what we would be, but this entire process of wedding planning has me second guessing.

- My parents and I paid for EVERYTHING. 

10k out of my own savings, 5k from my parents as a generous gift. This wasn't a case of ""I wanted a big wedding and he didn't."" He wanted not to spend any money, but also expected a fancy, decorated party with amazing food and photography to just happen. I think he has put maybe 1k in towards wedding planning, and it was all for ""his"" stuff (tux rental, groom cake, etc.). We both make good money and I'm not spending more than I can afford, but it's the principal of the thing. If he wants just as fancy a party as I do, he should be footing some of the bill.

- He has not done any of the legwork.

I don't know if he's even met our planner. I did the cake tasting alone, I looked at all the venue options alone, I have coordinated and planned and done *everything* with every single vendor. His contributions so far have been to pin a few halfhearted ideas on our Pinterest boards and to veto my ideas. Several times I was in the final stages of confirming things with a vendor only for him to finally pipe up at the last second that he wanted to do something different. And not for lack of me asking his opinion on things, either. I would have killed for some input, but he only seems interested in providing it at the last possible moment.

- He has been aggressively useless with simple tasks.

I ask him to do a couple of simple things to take 1% of the pressure off of myself and he can't even fucking do it. I asked him to mail the invitations and he just picked up the whole pile and dumped them in the mailbox without stamps. I asked him to write up a couple paragraphs about us for our wedding website and he copied and pasted something generic from the internet and added our names. I asked him to research musicians/DJs for the reception and he told me that he'd ""pick a finalist"" once I had narrowed it down to 3 options.

- The white dress

And the straw that is currently breaking my back is that his mom is planning to wear white to the wedding. I only know about it because she showed my mom the dress she was planning to wear. It's knee length but it is all-white with lace. I am so sick and tired of dealing with everything, and it is not my mom, so I told my fiance that he needs to have a talk with her and make it clear that that choice—or anything else white—is just not acceptable. The next day he comes back and tells me that she can't return the dress, but agreed to wear a blue cardigan over it. Um...no??? I don't care if she wears a cardigan, she's not wearing that dress to my wedding.

So I pretty much blew up at my fiance and told him that he needs to talk to his mom again, because I have done *everything else* and he hasn't pulled his weight, and I am not doing this too when it is not even my responsibility to deal with his mom's misbehavior. He told me that I was being a bridezilla, which is a term that I can't stand, so I left and have been staying with my friend for a couple of days. He has texted me with a couple of small fry decisions like picking out matching socks for the groomsmen to show that he's ""pulling his weight,"" but no mention of his mom's dress.

I'm not sure what to do. I don't even know if I want to get married anymore, since my fiance has basically acted like someone I don't recognize for the past year of planning. I don't know if I can go through with a marriage to someone who won't help share burdens with me. I am seriously considering just pulling the plug on this whole thing, but part of me is wondering if I really am a ""bridezilla"" and if we would not have had any problems if we had just eloped.

tl;dr: Fiance has been very unhelpful throughout wedding planning and unwilling to make any effort (financial or otherwise) to help plan. Won't even talk his mother out of wearing a white lace dress. I am reconsidering everything.

"I [17M] had to run my girlfriend [16f] to the emergency room a couple days ago. Her parents [40's m+f] won't let me talk to her or tell me how she is.


So I've been dating Riley since this past summer, so about 9.5 months.

It's been great! Riley is an awesome girl! We've had maybe a few small arguments but nothing that really endangered the relationship or anything, so I think we are doing pretty good.

The only real problem has been her parents. I don't think there is anything they don't like about me specifically, but they are *not* crazy about her dating. All the same, we've generally followed the rules and they have been pretty tolerant of me coming around, if not thrilled. So it has me really scratching my head about what is going on here.

Her parents had some big ceremony to go to on Monday night, and Riley was by herself at home. She wound up calling me when it was close to time for me to get off of work, and she said she wasn't feeling good and asked if I would come by and sit with her. 

She *really* did not look good when I got there. Her skin was really pale, she felt clammy to the touch, and was sweating even though the house was freezing. She kept saying there was something hurting in her side. We were alright for the first hour maybe everything was fine, but she started saying the pain in her side was getting worse. Finally it hurt so bad she was in tears and I told her she should go to the ER. She tried to call her parents to ask what they thought, but she got no answer, so she sent a message instead and asked me to take her.

I drove her to the hospital and sat with her in the waiting area for what seemed like half of forever, but when they took her to the back they wouldn't let me accompany since we're not actually family. I wasn't really sure what to do at that point, so I just sat in the waiting room.

Riley eventually texted that she had finally gotten ahold of her parents and they were on the way. When they got there I met them in the waiting area, they basically said that I could go home now. I figured they were right, so I just sent Riley a last message telling her I love her and was going home. She responded likewise, and that was the last communication I got from her.

I was pretty worried about her so I woke up every couple hours to check my phone and see if she had sent any updates. I got nothing. She wasn't in school, which *really* made me worry, because her parents are kind of Nazis about her attendance. It was the same today. Did not attend school, no communication. By the time I got off work today I assumed I was justifiable to call her dad's cell phone and just ask how she is doing and maybe see if he'd let me talk to her.

But when I called he very gruffly asked me what I wanted. I just said I wanted to ask how Riley is and maybe talk to her if it was a possibility. He told me it wasn't my concern how she is and he wasn't going to let me talk to her, then hung up. Maybe it had just been a bad moment, but I'm either ignored or blocked now.

Would it be that hard just to tell me how she is?! I'm worried about her just like I assume they are. I'd like to let her know I'm thinking of her and stuff. 

Would it be a terrible idea to stop by her house and just tell her parents that I'm sorry for bothering them, but I'm really worried for my girlfriend and would at least like some reassurance that she is hanging in there? I mean, I already know the answer to that question is probably yes, but I don't know what else to do. I haven't really been sleeping, friends of hers keep asking me for updates because they assume I would know and I keep having to tell them I have heard nothing and know nothing.

Anything I can do? I'm not trying to be all up in their business or anything, but I feel like I deserve maybe some small consideration considering we've dated the better part of a year.

"My (26/F) boyfriend (28/M) of three years spent the night at his friend’s (30/F) house knowing that this friend has a massive crush on him.


It’s hard to explain the situation in the title. 

But basically, he’s known this girl since university, and she’s pretty much always had feelings for him. 

Everyone in their group knows about it, including him. To my knowledge she had never really made a show of hiding it, at least until he and I had started going out. She toned it down a lot after that, probably because she knew for sure that he didn’t have feelings for her. Before we were together, she would “jokingly” ask him out all the time, tell him all of the girls he dated were either too stupid or not beautiful enough for him. She hasn’t said anything like that about me according to him and his other friends, most likely because I don’t take shit from girls who think they have some sort of weird ownership over their guy friends. Especially the ones who refer to them as “brothers”. Like ... he’s not your brother. Stop lol. 

Anyway.

The one thing I’ve always asked my boyfriend is that he keep this friend at a distance. I know he’s not into her like that or else he’d have done something about it a long time ago. But she’s still really ... strange. She stares at him all the time, leaves fire emojis on all his photos on IG, and always tries to give him these long, creepy hugs when we see her at group gatherings. 

They don’t hang out just the two of them. It’s always a group situation, and I’m usually there. He doesn’t talk to her, text her, etc. 

Last night, though, he had a party to go to. I had to do some work at home, so I stayed behind. And I told him to call me when he needed a ride back. We do that for each other all the time. He didn’t call. I figured he had spent the night at his friend’s house. A different friend who doesn’t have feelings for him. I didn’t hear from him at all last night after he left for the party. In part I was worried, but I just decided to go sleep. Then early this morning, I woke up to him taking a shower. Once he was out, I asked where he had been, why he didn’t text, and he just said, “Nowhere.” 

After a bit more questioning, he admitted that he had spent the night at his creepy friend’s apartment. 

I honestly thought he was joking at first, but turns out he wasn’t. According to him, once the party was over, he’d looked at the time and decided not to call me for a ride as it was so late and he didn’t want to wake me up. His creepy friend offered to drive him home as she had nothing to drink that night. He was hesitant going into it, but he eventually agreed. Then somehow, she convinced him to spend the night at her place playing video games. 

He said that he wasn’t *that* drunk when he first told me the story, and then the second time he told me, he said he was completely smashed. I don’t know what to believe. 

According to him, the second that he sobered up and realized where he was, he took a cab home. Nothing weird happened. They just played video games. 

The fact that he didn’t at least shoot me a quick text last night to say that he’d found another way home ... that’s the part I find weird and out of character. He’s usually really good at communicating and letting me know what’s going on. He’s not the type to just vanish for a night without saying anything. 

Also it’s kind of strange that he immediately climbed into the shower once he came home. Usually even if I’m fast asleep, he’ll at least wake me up to say good morning or something before he carries on with the rest of his day. 

Now I’m not saying he had sex with this girl. I honestly don’t like the way it happened. The fact that he got in a car with her and went to her apartment, just the two of them. That’s not okay. I immediately told him that I don’t appreciate that, and that was when he changed his story and said that  he was actually smashed, and had no idea what he was doing.

He’s been drunk around her before, without me there, and nothing like this has ever happened. 

I don’t know. 

He thinks I’m overreacting. I’ve been very calm about it, and I’ve pretty much just told him that I don’t feel comfortable with what happened last night. If that’s an overreaction, then okay. I just know that if he were the one in my position, he’d have completely lost his mind if I’d spent the night at a friend’s house without texting him, knowing this friend has a crush on me. 

The whole situation just feels weird to me when I give it even just a moment of thought. 

He’s sleeping now, and I’m on my way to work. I’m not sure what to do about this. Honestly it’s not some big apology I’m looking for, I’d just like for him to admit he could have handled the situation better. To go from thinking this friend is creepy and weird, to accepting a ride from her and spending the night with her at her place after a party, and getting all uncharacteristically cold about it when I ask him why he did it after? 

It looks bad. 

It looks really bad. 

What does this mean? I’m sure it’ll come up again at home later. What should I say when that happens? 

**tl;dr** To my knowledge he finds this friend creepy and weird, and only puts up with her because she’s in his group of friends and she’s hard to avoid. He was supposed to call me for a ride home after the party last night, but instead he spent the night at her place playing video games, and he thinks I’m overreacting for saying that it looks bad and for wanting him to just admit that he could have handled the situation better.

"Update: roommate (28f) regrets setting me (25f) up with her friend (27m)


ORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/84w8pv/roommate_28f_set_me_25f_up_with_her_friend_27m/
Thank you for the good advice and insight from my last post. I’m sadly back because the situation has changed.

Since my last post, I stopped asking Tess (28f) if it was okay for Julian (27m) to come over but continued to give her the heads up and I bought a tv so we can spend time in my room instead of the common room. Per Tess, Julian is only allowed over two nights a week and before last month I would either spend 2-3x nights at his place, sometimes one at mine and sometimes none. This past month I shifted to doing 2x/week at my house every other week. 

Yesterday, Tess told me she is thinking of finding a person to sublease to because she is sick of having a third roommate. I heard her out and she explained that she was unable to feel comfortable in our house when people were over for too long because she gets stuck in hostess mode, and that her memory of how Julian was when dating her best friend (they were very clingy) is also a factor. I reminded her that I understood that which is why I initially agreed to the 2x night a week limit, and that I try to be extra courteous by limiting the time we spend in common areas when over our house. Tess said this is not good enough, and that she wants stricter rules; for example, if Julian stays over Saturday night, he cannot hang out in my room Sunday and must leave the house, even if we leave for a few hours and come back later.

I’m at a loss because I don’t understand the problem is if we are in my private room and not interfering with her day. I asked for time to think about her request of further limiting his time over, but added that I felt I was already being very accomodating. She pushed that neither of us should dislike our living situation to the point where sublease is an option, and seemed to imply I would be an ass for not giving in to her demands.

She and Julian are getting dinner tonight where she plans to tell him that she doesn’t want him over as much (she keeps saying he is a third roommate/permanent house guest). Julian and I spoke, and he seems baffled that she is having such a hard time adjusting to someone spending time in the house, especially because we don’t spend time with her. We used to offer to get dinner or hang out but she asked me to stop asking because the answer would always be no. There have been two days in the past 3 months where we spent all day in my room to either have movie marathons or just lazy days. We always try to be quiet around her preset time of 10 PM, but I told her to text me if we get too loud so we can address is in the moment. 

My goal is to find a middle ground, but I feel I’ve already met her more than halfway. What is your advice on this, r/relationships? How can I best navigate telling her I am honoring our original agreement but further limitations when they are not directly interfering with her life are asking too much?

tldr: Roommate and I agreed on not having bf stay over more than 2x a week when we started dating. I recently started spending 2 nights a week every other week at my house, and now she wants to restrict how much time he spends over here while sleeping over here (example: staying over Sat and not being allowed to hang out in my room Sunday). What to do from here?

Thank you."
"How do I (33F) tell my husband (34M) that I want my mother (55F) to be my medical proxy instead of him?


TL;DR at bottom

Good morning, guys. I am a person who, through a massive loss in the genetic lottery, encounters medical emergencies on a far more frequent basis than I would like. I've been admitted to the hospital twice in the past two weeks, most recently for a suspected life-threatening (40% survival rate) cardiac event. Fortunately, false alarm. Same symptoms, but different and much nicer diagnosis. If you were to pull all my medical records since birth, you'd end up with stacks of paper looking like something Congress just tried to amend. 

When I was at the hospital, because it was (as far as they knew at the time) a likely fatal condition, the doctors asked me if I had a living will, if I had a specified medical proxy, and if I wanted Last Rites performed in the event of my death. I'm 33. No one had ever asked me that before. So I said no to all. Later, as I was thinking about it more, I decided it's time to think about these things. A month ago, my eldest brother died unexpectedly of a sudden medical emergency, and he wasn't even 10 years older than me. And with my medical history, it's not out of the realm of possibility; I'm probably not living to old age.

My biggest dilemma is the medical proxy. Where I live, if you're married, your spouse is your proxy by default. However, I'd actually like my mother to be my proxy instead (which may seem a little controversial). Here is why, the basic difference in their approach to medical situations. Ever seen the Deadpool movie? The scene where Wade and Vanessa are in the doctor's office being given his terminal diagnosis? And Wade says of Vanessa: ""She's already working on Plans A, B, all the way through Z."" Despite the dire nature of the situation, she's able to remain calm and look at all the options, and to be his biggest advocate. That's what my mom is like.

My husband is not like this. He's very passive with doctors and nurses, assuming each one is giving him all of the information at all times, and implicitly trusting that their first line of attack is the best one, without ever inquiring about possible alternatives or risks involved. When I'm having a medical emergency, my husband is always there, holding my hand, making me feel calm and safe, and helping me in any way he can, on a personal level. It's one of the things I love most about him, but rationally speaking, I just don't think he'd be the best proxy for me. 

I feel like my husband is there for support, and my mom is there for logistics, to keep tabs on my treatment team, make sure she always has the latest information, and to always ask ""What are our options?""

So this brings me to my question. How can I tell my husband this in a way that won't hurt his feelings, or make him believe I think he's not as capable of caring for me or making decisions on my behalf? The last thing I ever want to do is hurt him, but in a life or death medical situation, I simply trust my mother to handle it better. Any suggestions?

TL;DR

My husband is currently my medical proxy, but I would like to change my proxy to my mother instead, as I believe she's better at remaining cool under immense amount of pressure, and if staying as objective as one can when one's child's life is at stake. How do I tell my husband this without hurting him? 

Thanks so much!

EDIT: misspelled words"
"My (31f) sister (35f) screams at people in our family often. I take care of her baby full time and was yelled at by her Friday morning when I arrived at her house to pick up the child. I'm still upset over it and have to go pick up her kid again tomorrow morning. Need advice.


I take care of my sister's 18 month old daughter Monday through Friday. I drive to my sister's house at 7AM to pick up the child and then watch her at my house until my sister's husband picks baby up at 5PM. I charge them $25/day for this full-time daycare. I enjoy spending time with my niece and am financially able to give them a more affordable daycare option. A few weeks ago my brother (39m) found out he will be losing his job and is very stressed. His wife had been working part-time and decided to get a full time job to ease some of their financial stress. She asked me if I could pick up their kids (4m &amp; 11f) from school at 3PM and care for them until 6:30PM. Twice per week I would need to drive the 11-year-old to swimming practice across the city (40 min drive). I am happy to be able to help out my brother's family too. I told my sister that I was going to start doing this about 2 weeks ago and she did not object, but it should be noted that my sister does not like my brother's wife. She thinks my brother's wife is self-centered and that the family is ""always"" accommodating her. My sister made a few comments indicating she might be a little annoyed about the new arrangement, such as, ""wow, I hope they are paying you well!""

This past week was the first week of picking up my brother's kids. I had to start putting the baby down to nap about 1 hour earlier so that her nap would be finished by 2:30PM so that we could leave my house to go pick up the other kids from school. Furthermore my sister is wanting to sign up the baby for an activity on Thursday evenings at 5:45PM so I agreed to drive the baby to her work on Thursdays after dropping the 11 year old off at swimming. This means that the baby and I are spending a long time in my car.

Also, my sister and I flew out of town with her 18 month old last weekend and both of us, and the child, have been overtired and not feeling well as a result. Furthermore during that trip there were at least two instances where my sister was yelling in front of me or at me.

All week my sister has been saying things to her baby in the morning like, ""you need to take lots of naps today."" On Friday morning when I arrived at my sister's house to pick up the child she was running late and was flustered. She said the baby had woken up a lot in the night and had screamed all the way home from work in the car the previous night and they didn't even go to the activity she wants to sign up for. I made a comment that it isn't a perfect situation right now and that she seems upset about it and that I'm sorry it isn't perfect. My sister began yelling at me in front of the child. She complained that my comment was condescending and said, ""My child is flexible so my child suffers again. She is a baby, she needs to take a nap."" I remained calm and responded, that she consistently naps 2.5-3hrs every day which I have read is normal for her age. She yelled that I am not listening to her about what her child needs, and that I always respond with information I've read. As I am being yelled at my heart is pounding and I am doing yoga breathing to keep my calm. I ask her how many hours she thinks the child should nap. She yells that she doesn't know how many hours but that she needs more naps and that I should put the baby down for a second nap because the child is exhausted and starving when my sister gets home from work and that they can't put her to bed at 7pm because they don't get home (due to traffic) until 5:45 and then they have to make dinner. I explain that the child naps from 11:30AM until 2 or 2:30PM. I give the baby food when she wakes up and then a snack again at 4pm, and I asked what time I should put her down for a second nap. She says I should have her nap again at 4PM (which wasn't possible the night before because I was driving the baby to my sister's work at that time, but I don't bother to say that. I also didn't say that I can't make the child sleep if she isn't tired, and that if she was tired she would have slept in the car).

I never yelled back at her and mostly just didn't respond after that and eventually she calmed down. I was, however, upset for the rest of the day and now it is Sunday and I am still upset. I am sick of being yelled at by my sister. It feels abusive. I am sick of my sister yelling at other people in my family. My sister seems to think that she is always being dictated to by the family and that she is flexible and accommodating, but usually it feels like the opposite is true. I also feel like her lack of empathy for my brother's situation reflects the fact that my sister is self-centered.

I don't know if I should say something about this incident being unacceptable, and I fear that bringing it up might lead to more yelling. My husband thinks that if it happens again I should just leave and she can figure out something else to do with her kid for the day. I know I can't change her behavior but I'm not ready to just cut her out of my life.

TL;DR: My sister is always yelling at me and other family members and I don't know how to deal with her."
"Do I (28 F) have any right to disclose my abortion to my husband's (28 M) mom (52 F) against his will?


Throw away account


It has been almost a year since I (28 F) discovered I was pregnant with our (mine and husband's (28 M)) third child. He told me that he didn't want to keep our baby and that he preferred I get an abortion but that he would be there to continue to help care for our children regardless of the decision I made. We talked about it a lot and although he claimed he would be supportive his attitude was one that I didn't feel I could handle (he was angry, scared, etc) over the course of the pregnancy and I didn't want to force him to have a child he didn't want, so I got an abortion at 5.5wks pregnant.


We've been together 11 years and have been married 8.5 of those years. We've been having some serious marital problems over that last few years and I have been feeling like the abortion was the nail in the coffin for us. Initially, I was able to push through my own confused emotions regarding the situation out of necessity; our two kids are young (4M &amp; 6M) and we are both full-time students working towards a degree, so we are very busy trying to keep the family afloat. That being said, depression has hit me pretty hard over the last couple of weeks. I am having a difficult time seeing how I can heal and move past the abortion while still married to my husband. To him he dodged a bullet but for me I feel like I sacrificed my unborn child for the sake of his happiness. I do not want to get a divorce, but I am having a hard time seeing a future for us. 


As far as the abortion is concerned, I am feeling compelled to tell those that I am close to or have an ongoing role in my life because of the toll it is taking on me. I am no longer interested in my life, I am not eating well, I am not sleeping well, and I feel like I need the support of my family to get through this. Other than my husband, only a couple other people know. I don't feel like I can continue to keep this secret when it is something that is having such a profound effect on me. 


My husband's mom (F 52) and I have had a lot of strife in a last few years (somewhat related to my marital problems), but before that we were very close and had a good relationship. I saw her as a second mom, and I know she considered me a daughter. I don't know how she feels about me now, but she is around a lot (usually watches our kids twice a week while we are at school) and I know she is going to want to be around a lot more during our summer break. She is also planning to move across the country at the end of summer, so I am feeling like this is the right time to let her know what's going on (that any hostility that I've had towards her has stemmed from problems that my husband and I have been having). Also, in the event that my husband and I do end up getting divorced, I don't want my in-laws to be blindsided because they had no idea we were struggling all these years. And while my husband wouldn't slander me I don't think he'd be upfront with them about what has happened, so I want to mitigate any possibility that they could misconstrue the situation and turn it into an issue about how awful I am. I was also hoping that she'd just be an encouragement and support for us during a difficult and emotional time in our lives. The last three years we have been very withdrawn and isolated and I feel like we need support right now (I don't know that we can survive without it).


That being said, we are Christians and MIL has some very strong, conservative views regarding abortion. Husband says she would essentially disown us and would not be supportive of us. He also doesn't want to let people in on our marriage issues. He said he doesn't want to feel like a failure. I'm tired of pretending that everything is okay for everyone else's sake (including my husband).


I haven't talked to husband about this yet. I'm just wondering if I have any right to do this or if this is just a terrible idea.


TLDR: I want to start telling close family members that husband and I aborted third child so that I can have much needed support  during a difficult time/stop feeling like I have to cower in shame because of a bad decision I made. I feel this is part of my healing process and what I need to move on. Husband wants to keep everyone in the dark and is scared of judgement from his ultra-conservative mom. Is it wrong for me to want to say anything? Is this a terrible idea? 

As a side note, we are in the process of getting counseling and I am working on getting into an abortion support group to work through my thoughts/emotions."
"Me [28 M] with my wife[23 F] Our monthly disposable income is $3,500 and wife wants to spend $4,300 on one-way business class tickets for her parents to visit us. I don't know if I should say something (if anything).


One one hand, I don't want to make it seem like I don't care her parents but on the other hand, that's around 10% of our annual disposable income that we can be using to save for our house down payment or IRA contributions. I don't want to sound insensitive or cold if I say something and I understand her compassion, but $4k is a ton of money (flight is non-stop 13 hour international fight). The parents are buying their own coach tickets for the return flight. Any advice from married couples that have dealt with similar situations?

"Considering taking my [29F] own vacation for my 30th birthday because I don’t like what my husband [30M] planned. Would that be terrible?


A few months ago I told my husband I wanted to go on a weekend trip for my 30th birthday. We can afford this; money isn’t the issue.

Well, my husband forgot all about it, and scheduled something for himself on my b-day weekend. 

When I realized it was the same day, I called him out on it. He asked apologized. Trying to be a polite person, I told him it was okay and to not worry about it. 

Now that the weekend is coming up, I’m really regretting not speaking up more about a trip. I’ve found out he’s planning a dinner for me with friends. This is fine, except we do that every single weekend.

Would it be wrong if me to just leave on my own and go? How bad would that be?

TL;DR: Considering going on a trip on my own without my husband. How bad would that be?"
"I (28M) have no friends except my girlfriend of five years (29F). I'm starting to connect with someone else (28F) and can't tell if the excitement and joy I feel is love, or just the feeling of finally having a friend


I have been in an open relationship for 5 years with my girlfriend (29F). We have both been with other people during this time, but our general rules are that we can't catch feelings for the people we sleep with, we can't sleep with the same person more than once, and that they can't be someone that we spend a lot of time with, like a coworker or friend. Basically, we just allow each other to have one night stands occasionally if we feel like it. We are both completely okay and comfortable with this and it doesn't cause us any problems at all. 

Another thing about my relationship is that me and my girlfriend don't have anything in common, I love her but we don't have the same hobbies, interests, background, career, personality. I also suffer from a lot of anxiety and she doesn't, and while she understands and supports me, she doesn't understand how it feels. We are almost complete opposites, and that's okay but it makes me wish to have someone I can talk  with about these things.

I am on good terms with all my coworkers, we talk a lot at work and get to know each other well, but I don't consider any of them to be friends. I wouldn't tell any of my secrets to them or talk about anything deep. We never go and do anything outside of work, and I'm totally okay with this. I work, go home to my girlfriend, chill, sleep and go back to work. 

I have worked with this girl (28F, with a BF of 10 years) for a few months, but never really spoke with her. A few weeks ago we started talking and I realised that we have so much in common, we both come from the same place, we have the same degree, we share hobbies and interests, but the most important one is that we both suffer from severe anxiety issues. It feels great to talk with someone who understands it and now I am super excited about going to work every day to see her, and I can tell that she feels the same way because her face lights up whenever she sees me, and she feels comfortable enough to talk with me while she struggles to talk with other people.

I'm thinking about her outside of work and even tried a couple of times to see if she wants to meet me for a drink after work, but anxiety makes that difficult for her. 

Since getting to know her I feel different, I feel happier, more relaxed and I feel like I am drunk on the time that I spend with this woman. The problem is that since I have spent so long without a person to speak with about these things, I can't tell if what I feel is the feeling of finally having a friend, the feeling of getting so many things off my chest with someone who knows how it feels, or the feeling of love. 

Can anyone help? Surely if I loved her I would know? I don't have any sexual attraction to her, but I feel like any time I'm not with her is wasted time that we could be spending together, and that makes me feel so guilty because we are both in serious relationships... I spoke with my girlfriend about how much I like this girl, but was afraid to go into too much detail because I didn't want to upset her. 

**TLDR: I have no one to talk with except my GF but I have nothing in common with her, met a girl that I really get along well with and can't tell if the happiness I feel is from having a friend or from being in love...**"
"I'm [46M] having a hard time accepting that my son [21M] is gay. Can you guys help me?


My son recently came out to my wife and I. He sat us down on our living room couch and told us he had to tell us something. He asked us if he could tell us anything? We said of course. He then asked us would we always love him? We said always, no matter what. He then told me, “I’m gay.” That shocked me. His mother gave him a big hug and told him, “That’s okay, you’re still our son and we will always love you.” I was unresponsive. I’m actually having a hard time accepting that my son is gay. It’s not the kind of life I envisioned for him.

My parents always told me growing up that homosexuality is wrong, me and the guys I hung out with would make gay jokes, etc. The way I was brought up makes it hard for me to accept it. And just thinking about what gay men do behind closed doors is very disturbing to me. I don’t want people to look down upon me for having a gay son. I’m sorry if I’m offending anyone, I’m just trying to be honest and express my thoughts. I still love my son, I’m just having a hard time coming to grips with his sexuality, which is why I turned to you guys. Can you guys help me or give me advice with accepting my son?

tl;dr: My son came out to his mother and I, and I'm having a hard time coming to grips with it. It's not the kind of life I wanted for him.

"My [26M] fiance [25F] of 2.5 years asked me to consider letting her adopt my sister [9F] after we get married.


Around the time when I was finishing college, both of my parents passed away as a result of an car accident. My sister, Grace, was five at the time, and I had been offered pretty well paying programming job, so I figured that I was in a pretty good position to take care of her. Initially it was rather difficult to learn how to care for a kid, especially of the opposite sex, but I think I've adapted well (I'm basically an expert at women's hair at this point). Obviously losing both parents was pretty hard on Grace to understand, let alone deal with, so I had her see a child therapist for a while, and I think she has coping well.

My fiance, Alison, and I have been dating for about 2 and a half years now. I introduced her to my sister about 10 months in, and she moved with us about 10 months after. We just got engaged about 3 months ago, and we intend to have our wedding in about a year.

Grace and my fiance really seem to get along well. Not sure why, but Grace even seems to prefer going to Alison with some of her problems over me. I've always made sure to make her feel as if she could come to me with anything, but she says sometimes she'd rather talk with a woman over her brother for some things. In any case, I'm really glad that the two of them get along so well.

Recently, my fiance sat me down for a conversation. She said that she absolutely adores my sister, and wants to know if I would consider letting her adopt her at some point after we got married. She said that it would allow her to make time sensitive decisions about medical care, let her sign things for school, and let her act as her guardian should something ever happen to me. She said that it was obviously something we would have to discuss with my sister, but asked me to at least consider it for now.

The way that I adopted my sister is a little different from most adoptions (it was called kinship adoption, or something like that), so this would definitely be something we would consult with a family lawyer on before doing anything. However, I'm really unsure of what to think about doing it all. Would this be a good idea? What are some potential costs/benefits?

---

**tl;dr**: Fiance asked me to consider letting her adopt my sister, who I am the guardian of, and I'm unsure of whether or not it would be a good idea.

"My[25M] mum invested money in me as a kid and now asking for me to pay off her credit card debt, how do I navigate this?


So my parents invested in this ""fund"" that was meant to help pay for my college education when I was a kid, they got told their investment would double and I could access these when I was 18. It was a lie, they basically got the investment money 18 years later which didn't change meaning they lost money due to inflation.

Anyway, I've finished uni now and working full\-time. In Australia so living with parents is normal but I'm actively looking for places to move out to. I currently only pay the internet bill and have been buying the majority of household groceries for the last five years. 

The final payment of the money was \~9k. They just went on holiday which they RARELY take, I'm talking working 7 days a week to an average of 80 hours per week. Dad is building a house overseas and was low on funds to pay the builders and mum needed fun money to spend because she didn't have any.  

I don't have much savings because I only started work but they asked if the 9k came in yet so I could loan them some for the above \- in order to curb their spending a bit I lied and told them it didn't come in yet so I could only give them money from my savings. Now I won't go into detail but we do have money that has been given out as personal loans to extended families but we don't know when we'll get it back \- they're trustworthy I'll leave it at that.

When mum asked for a few grand I said I could only give her 1 and she got a bit passive aggressive which set off flags for me. I only gave mum 1k and dad 3k for the house \(thought something tangible is better than fun money\). Personally, I do think they're entitled to a bit of it considering they work hard and  I didn't use it for education \- our government loans us the money and we pay it back through tax. 

\*\*Okay\*\* so relevant to the topic at hand. They're back from holidays and she asked if the money came in, I said yes and she asked if I can pay 3.5k to the credit card debt. I stumbled for a bit and then went to ask for her credit card statements since I know shes a bad spender. She has spend a LOT of money on designer bags before and lied about how much it was so dad wouldn't feel as bad.. Sales people like to look at her with dollar sign eyes when she goes into a store. 

I noticed she spent \~$1k to buy clothes. I was thinking of just saying I'll pay for the necessities that were paid on credit card so insurance, bills etc. but I was thinking that it might be enabling her to otherwise spend that money that I just paid off to bills to pay off the clothes from the CC anyway. What do I do?

tl;dr: parents got me a loan as a kid and now I'm getting that loan at about 9k. Gave them 4k when they went on holidays. They are now asking for 3.5k for CC debt yet mums spending habits are bad. Was thinking of just paying the CC debt that was used to pay bills but that might be enabling mum to pay back the money that she would have otherwise spent on the bills to just pay off her clothes. What do I do?"
"I'm [24f] going on a Disney park trip tomorrow with my siblings. Bf [25m] is upset that he can't come and is acting very petty. How to talk to him?


I have 5 younger siblings that I'm extremely close to (6f, 11f, 14m, 16m, &amp; 18f). I have been planning this Disney trip for them as a surprise for a minute now, as they've never been and have all been wanting to go. I had told my boyfriend of 4 years this some times before, but I don't really think he took it all that seriously as he would just say, ""thats cute"", or ""aww"" and give me a kiss or something. 

Anyway, I finally have gotten everything together, the disney resort reserved as well as airfare and park passes. We leave tomorrow, and I couldn't be more excited to be able to give them all this experience. But my boyfriend has gotten very upset with me, and is almost begging me to stay since he's not able to go. It's just my siblings and I that I budgeted for, and he's upset because I didn't budget him in as well. I was planning all of this in the beginning of our relationship, and didn't feel comfortable inviting a man whom my siblings barely knew around them. 

We will only be gone for a week. He keeps on accussing me of leaving him out and being selfish, but I really feel like he should just let me spend some time with them alone. This isn't a romantic getaway for us, as I know he would try to make it (he hates the parks so idk where he would be when we're out) and I don't want the kids to have to feel weird around him. I'll be busy trying to keep track of them all. He has been acting real petty toward me, and I've been trying to repair things between us before I leave. How can I talk to him before I leave? What should I say?

"I [30F] just found out I'm pregnant! Friend [27F] is a bridezilla and we'll be going to her boozy wedding soon - how do I handle this?


This is no way near as scandalous as most posts, but I'm not sure the best way to handle this situation. 

I just found out I'm pregnant! My husband [31M] and I have been married for 3 years, together for 5. We definitely weren't trying, but we are really happy about it. I am only 5 weeks so it is still very early, and we haven't told anyone yet. We were planning on letting family know after the first scans, and then announcing it publicly around 10-12 weeks.  

Two of my good friends [27F and 29M] are getting married in 2 weeks, and we are flying in and staying for a week before the wedding. We have a lot planned with my friends from college, including a whisky tasting and a dinner reservation at a super fancy sushi restaurant. I was a pretty big party girl in college and have a reputation for drinking a lot when we go out, so it will be noticed if I'm not drinking at the whisky tasting or eating sushi at the sushi place, and then to not drinking at all at the wedding (which will be a huge college reunion). 

My friend who is getting married is amazing, but is a bit of a control freak and has been super intense about her wedding (think multiple pinterest boards from before she was even in a relationship with wedding inspo). I don't want to announce the pregnancy until I'm at least 10 weeks (I'll be 7 weeks at the time of the wedding), but I also don't want people to figure it out from me not drinking all week and it to become a topic of discussion or distract from my friend's wedding celebrations in any way. She is a great girl, but she is quite competitive and definitely sees this as her day to shine (as she should! It's her wedding!) and would be upset about me flying in and being like SURPRISE I'M PREGNANT. 

I'm not sure the right way to deal with this. Does anyone have any experience in a situation like this and know what the proper etiquette is? Should I quietly tell the bride and groom and ask what they would prefer? Should I invent a reason why I can't drink (""I don't feel like it"" will be met with a lot of peer pressure and people being confused and insulted that I decided not to drink at a whisky tasting, which is kind of fair enough)? Should I just tell people I'm pregnant even though its so early?

**TLDR** How do I handle keeping a very early pregnancy hidden during a boozy week, so that I don't upset my intense bride friend by distracting from her wedding?"
"My[35F] sister [40F] is acting completely immature over our parent's moving. It's hurting everyone around her.


My parents have a second home in Florida. After this last winter, they decided to sell the family home and move to Florida full-time. My sister lives two hours away and has for the last 20 years. I live in the same town as my parents.

I've been a bit sad about it, but I want my parents to be happy. I've been helping them get their house ready to sell such as DIY fixes and cleaning. My sister usually came into town every other month, but for the past three months she has been coming every weekend then getting in the way of absolutely everything and making everyone miserable. 

Examples: My parents had a stash of toys for my nieces. My youngest niece really loved the Barbies. My sister told my parents that my niece wasn't allowed any of them, so my parents donated the toys. A few weekends ago my niece asked for the Barbies and my sister snapped saying ""Granny threw them out because she doesn't care about you anymore"" which got my niece crying. 

After we finished replacing all the carpet, my sister brought my nieces and a bunch of their friends up for a weekend over. My mom made it clear that NO drinks or food were allowed out the kitchen. My sister ignored her because ""it's rude to tell children they have to restrain themselves on a vacation"" and a girl ended up spilling grape juice on the new carpet. An open house had been scheduled, so we cancelled it to get the carpet cleaned.

Every weekend she has been here, she leaves the house a complete disaster and keeps ""forgetting"" things like clothes, shopping, and crap like that. She also refused to get her kids up and out of the house on Sunday, so when the first open house happened at 1 l, my nieces were wearing pajamas, watching television, and had their crap all over. This caused a huge fight between my mother and sister,  so my sister took it out on me when I showed up with cleaning supplies (She tossed them all over the front lawn and dared me to pick them up with her fists clenched).

I'm at my limit. There is a second open house this weekend and my sister announced she will be in town (of course). I told her they should bring their motor home and park it on my property and she caused a GIANT fight about it between my parents, me, and her. My niece called me crying because my sister has said my parents no longer love her, so when my parents move that will be the last time my parents see them. 

This is all so bizarre. Our family has always been close. My sister is a dramatic type, but this is going far beyond anything. I'm trying to figure out how I get her to acknowledge her grief and move past this sabotage. It is okay for her to be sad, but it is NOT okay for her to be doing this crap. When I tell her I want to talk about how I'm feeling, she says I would never understand because I am the golden child then she will hang up. She refuses to see a counselor. 

So... what do I do here?

TL/DR; My sister is angry my parents are moving and ous actively sabotaging their efforts to sell their house. She is also causing my nieces grief by saying my parents no longer love them. How do I help her to work through this instead of lashing out?"
"I(23F) don't wanna leave my dog with my mom(40s). Now she's hurt and the family is pressuring me. How can I diffuse this situation?


Hey guys, I'm sorry for the lenght but it's kinda of a complicated story.

Some background: my mom cheated her husband with my dad and I was born, my dad had my custody my whole life and while I did visit my mom I felt very unconfortable around her family, suffice to say I'm much closer to my dad, stepmom, half-siblings on paternal side. I recently started reconnecting more with my maternal side, especially since my mom lives close by.

I adopted my dog a while ago, when he was a puppy, he's of a larger breed(think german shepherd), very very active and demands a lot of attention and special cares. He's very defensive of me and our house but I've been training him(kinda like the switch thing, specific words to make him aware hz should be ok or not, I don 't really know the name in english), I go to the dog park every weekend with my brother and his dogs and he goes to a dog daycare during the week, while I'm at work.

I'll say that's really expensive but I love it. It gives him the chance to interact with other dogs and different people. Their staff is super nice and very well trained, they have a special space for elder or disabled dogs, if he needs to take his medicine or have a special food they'll separate, a great introduction program as well as a puppy interaction one. They do command training too, and trick ones(pretend to ""die"", that kind of thing).Bathing and grooming are also included(especially when they decide to roll over on mud lol). It's expensive but I feel it's worth.

My cousin(maternal) was looking for dog daycare and was looking around, her dog is very chill and not that active but she wanted him to be entertained during the day. Fair enough. She went to my daycare and then spread how much it cost to the whole family.

My mom then came and offered to stay with my buddy so I wouldn't spend so much, since she doesn't work and lives close by. I declined and explained he was a very difficul dog to control and demanded a lot of attention and energy so the daycare was the best for everyone. She got very very offended, started saying she had dogs her whole life(she did but they were very chill and small, I mean, small dogs can do damages but if my dog gets you then you're fucked), that I let my brother babysit him when I travel or whattever and he even has a son. That if I didn't want for her to take care of the dog I should just say it.

Now, I do ask my brother to take care when I'm out but that's because he has dog training, is very strong and experienced with working dogs(they actually have two) and my nephew is very aware and careful on how to act around them so I'm not very worried, other kids, on the other hand, I can't really trust my dog won't do something.

I'll admit I didn't handle this very well but I was super pissed. I tried explaining myself but she kept cutting me off saying ""I know how to take care of dogs, I've had 5 of them, why don't you think I, who has much more experience with dogs than you, won't be able to handle your dog?"" To which I answerd ""because you won't be able to stop him from taking someones nose if he wants"". It went downhill from there on.

My family hasn't stoped blowing my phone off, telling me to apologize and let my mom take care of the dog, that I should me grateful. I did call to apologize for being rude and that I do appreciate her offer but I'll keep my puppy on the daycare. She now says she won't talk until I apologize and let her dogsit. The thing is, how can smooth things? Her birthday is close by and I would like to spend with her..

TL;DR: I have a high energy, difficult to handle dog and my mom wants to dogsit him during the week. I declined because he's a very handful one. She got offended and now will only talk to me if I let her babysit the puppy. Her birthday and mothers day is coming and I'd like to spend with her, what should I do?"
"Me [28F] with my Ex [28 M]; we dated 3 months, now he wrote me an 18k email and ""jokingly"" threatened to kidnap me


## 

I am frightened and in a too calm state of shock. He sent the email 6 days ago and I saw it in my spam 4 days ago. He still messaged me a lot since we broke up 2 months ago. I blocked him everywhere but went looking for a school email in spam and found his latest email.

We dated for about 3 months. He was erratic and cursed at me, treated me like shit, and then one night freaked out when I wouldn't do some things. So I ended it.

Now comes the 18,401 word email. 18 THOUSAND words! And in it, he references a weird joke we used to make, well he made, about him kidnapping me so we could be alone. Except it's not funny now. He said this:

""No crazy serial killer Tinder first date story for us to share, I apologize. I should have kidnapped you, kept you chained up in some cabin deep in the forests of Oregon, where you could only write and make love to me.""

I don't know what to do. I hate getting the cops involved because it's traumatic for me to go to the cops. Childhood issues. It sort of feels like I'm tearing into my soul when I've had to go to them before.

I'm not sure if he really has the guts to do anything. But I also don't take words like that lightly. I don't want to end up kidnapped like that. I haven't been sleeping well. Is this for real? Either way, what do I do about it?

TL;DR! Ex wrote me a novel\-length email and maybe threatened to kidnap me. Is it a serious threat?"
"My (32M) wife (30F) is really insecure. I had to ignore two female work friends at a function we had recently and they're angry, not to mention my wife was rude to them. I want to smooth this over.


I've been married to my wife for ten years and we've been together since I was 16. She's literally all I've ever known and likewise for her. We've had a crazy journey together and have four amazing kids. All in all I'm pretty happy with our life.

She is, however, very insecure/suspicious of the women I work with. I've never given her a reason to be suspicious but she still is, unless the woman in question happens to be married.

This wasn't a problem until I became friends with Layla at work. Layla is 28 and sits in the cube adjacent to me so talking to one another is inevitable. We have to work closely together but we've also become friends. I tell her about my wife and kids, she tells me about her friends, her boyfriend, and other odds and ends about our lives. We often pull pranks on one another and others around out office; she's like the little sister that I wish I had, and she often says I'm the older brother she wishes she didn't have (har har). We do lunches and happy hours with the crew every so often, and I've bought her lunch every now and then to thank her for her contributions to our joint projects. 

We have eachother's personal cell numbers mostly to exchange memes, but occasionally she'll text me a funny video or a 'wtf' moment with one of our coworkers that I'll have missed. I rarely text her first usually because I'm so busy at home, but I did text her once about how my son beat me at bowling and was very proud of himself. My wife was scrolling through my phone at one point, saw the text, and raised hell asking me about why I was texting her, why was it necessary to text her outside of work, that sort of thing. After that, I made it a point to reply to Layla's texts with simple one word answers which was fine because she didn't text me much to begin with and we see eachother at work everyday. I invited Layla and some other people we work with over to my place for a cookout, just to have my wife meet everyone, and my wife was fixated on how ""pretty"" Layla was, and how she showed up to our house wearing makeup and cute clothes ""for a reason"". I told her that Layla has a long term boyfriend that she's very devoted to, and there's no need for concern. Even so, she was still sideyeing her. 

On Saturday, we had a work event that we all had to attend and I was there with my wife. Layla showed up with another girl we work with Lara. When Layla saw me she called my name and waved and I acknowledged her with a quick nod before turning away because I didn't want my wife to feel ignored or jealous especially considering how my wife reacted the last time my wife saw Layla. Even so, Layla and Lara came over to say hi while we were talking to someone else....and I kind of slipped by them to go say hello to someone else without stopping to talk to them. 

This didn't go over well with Layla. Today at work she refused to say hello to me or talk like we usually do. Instead she only would talk about work. I asked her why she was acting so weird and she said that it was obvious that we weren't really friends, only colleagues, so she didn't have to talk to me about other things outside of work matters. She also went on about how rude it was for me to ignore her, and that Lara was also upset about being ignored by us because she had wanted to thank my wife for the old baby clothes that we'd given to her for her newborn. She said to ""not worry"" about having to ""front around my wife"" and that we were going to be strictly professional from now on.

I talked to one of the other girls we work with, and she said that when we'd brushed by Lara and Layla, my wife gave them a really dirty look and said ""move"".  

I feel pretty shitty about this. I really do consider Layla a friend and I feel like an asshole for hurting her feelings. But still, I don't ever want my wife to feel insecure or like she has something to worry about. How do I strike a balance? In the meantime, how do I make this up to Layla and Lara?

TL;DR: My wife is insecure. I was trying to be mindful of her feelings and ended up ignoring two work friends in the process. Their feelings are hurt, plus my wife was rude to them. How do I strike a balance between having friendships and also, how do I make this up to them?"
"I(23F) was accepted to law school today. Boyfriend (25M) thinks I should apply to at least one more school.


I only applied to one law school this cycle. It was my number one in state choice because of the price, location, and quality of education. It took everything out of me to get that application in. I was an orange squeezed dry. I used lots of emotional, mental, and spiritual energy to get the personal statement and other information out. But it was all worth it because I was accepted! 

But now my boyfriend, whose family lives in another state is upset because he wants me to apply to one more school out of state to look good for his family. So it looks like I make an effort and take them into consideration. 

I’ve already explained I’m tired out. I can’t find the motivation to put anything else in, especially after getting accepted to my top (and only) choice. I always make an effort to go visit his family. I’ve flown in 9 times in the last year and a half and have 3 more flights planned for the next 4 months. 

When I tell him how I feel he says it’s all about how I feel and my feelings and I don’t consider his. This makes me upset because this IS about me. It’s my dream. I always wanted to go to law school the way I wanted and when I wanted, way way way before I met him. Him asking me to apply is discouraging and makes me want to just skip out on law school completely.

Please note he is a great guy, not controlling or manipulative at all. He moved here from out of state for me. He doesn’t expect me to go to a school out of state, just says it would mean a lot to him and his family to have that door open.

What are my options here? Shit out another application even though I really can’t and I don’t want to pay for any more application fees? How can I let him know this doesn’t feel fare and YEA law school is all about me and this is my journey (without disrespecting the efforts he has made for us)? 

Willing to listen to any and all advice. Tough love appreciated too. 


TLDR: Boyfriend wants me to apply to out of state school as a good gesture to his family but I’m pooped out. What do I do? "
"[Update] An old fling [35M] of a sort-of-friend [34F] is interested in me [32F]. We went on a “date.”


So [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8bvhux/an_old_fling_35m_of_a_sortoffriend_34f_is/) didn’t get a lot of attention but I always love reading updates and I’m kind of excited so here we are.

After about a week of FB messaging Trent and I arranged for him to come to my place for dinner. He fishes a lot and said he’d like to cook me some and who am I to turn that down?

We were both nervous - it was actually pretty sweet since I haven’t dated much and he let me know he was nervous even before I said I was - but it went great. We had fish and I made potatoes and salad. We shot the shit and watched a few episodes of my favorite show that he’d never seen but he loved it, and what was better was that he discussed the show with me while we watched. I hate watching stuff in silence but we were able to banter back and forth while still paying attention.

He helped me clean the kitchen after dinner and got along great with my dog. Around 9:30 Trent went home and I’d been so nervous the whole time about physical stuff because I’m not sure I’m totally ready for that yet but he just gave me a big hug and said he had a great time.

I learned a lot about him (and he learned even more about me because I never shut up, haha) and I felt so comfortable with him. I thanked him over message for coming over and he said we have to do it again sometime soon.

No word from Missy and at this point I don’t care because their relationship seemed like pure hookups rather than something where you connect with someone - not anything against her, but I think that’s why they didn’t work out. And the fact Trent wants to see me again without even a kiss makes me feel good, like he wants to know ME first.

So! I’m not going to worry about it from now on and I’m looking forward to our next date!

*TL;DR*

Had a date with friend Trent who had hooked up with mutual friend Missy when I was worried about the consequences. No word from Missy and had a great, wholesome time with Trent. Happy and looking forward to the future (as well as our next date!)"
"Me [28 F] with my husband [26 M] 6 years, 2 married, argument over my going out ""late"" mid-week, and going late into work the following day.


DH and I don't argue much. I am curious about your thoughts on the situation itself, but also advice on *how* to argue productively.

This is longer than I intended, but should all be relevant. 

tl;dr up front: DH is upset with me for going out ""late"" on a work night, then going in to work late the next day (for what I believe is an unrelated reason). I feel disrespected that DH doesn't give me the space to respond to his reprimand.

This Wednesday evening I went out with my BFF (F 28) who I rarely get a chance to meet up with just us girls, without her 3 LOs; so if we can find a night that she can get away, we go for it.

We met up at 6PM, went to the salon, then to dinner by 7. I was home by 9PM. Should be noted that DH and I go to bed early; typically between 8-9PM. We went to dinner, had two drinks, and I went home. It was mild, and I certainly didn't drink in excess.

That night, I kept waking up with a killer tension headache. I don't think I've ever been woken by a headache itself-- it was brutal. So come the 5:30AM alarm for work, I still have this headache and am extra tired from not sleeping through the night. I start getting ready for work, but I keep getting this headache in flashes and I sit down to consider my options. It doesn't seem worthy calling into work (I have limited time off), but I also didn't feel safe driving with my head doing this. So I called in for a late arrival, took some ibuprofen, and slept it off. I woke up after 2 hours and felt fine. I got re-ready for work and was in at 10:45AM. It should also be noted that at my job, we can ""flex"" time, so if I come in late for whatever reason, I can stay late that day or even the next top make up hours. It's a great benefit and the bosses don't care. My work can be done in any timeslot of the day, pretty much. 

So, I stay a bit late and come home, my DH arrives shortly thereafter. He has a solemn looks and states that ""he is disappointed that I went out late on a weeknight, then was late for work."" 

I assured him that I wasn't hungover, just has this freak headache, and.."" but before I couldn't respond, he said that there's no excuse, then walked off. He had also stated how strong his work ethic is, and that ""that's the type of behavior [he] loses respect for people over."" He had also stated that he didn't want to hear about my work situation and the ""flexing"" BS.

After just a few minutes, I went to him and said that it wasn't fair for him to reprimand me/accuse me, then walk off without letting me respond. He then said I was being defensive. I tried to stand up for myself, and I said, ""of course I'm being defensive, you reprimanded me then walked off, without allowing me to have a say."" 

So this turned more into an argument about having enough respect for me to state my case, vs. his attitude of ""there's NO excuse to go to work late"", final word. I continued to argue along the lines of, I'm your wife, I'm your partner, and you have to give me space to respond; you don't get to say no excuses and leave it at that. 

He then brought up how he hears excuses all day from his student (he's a HS teacher), and he's not taking my BS. I told him that he ""has to consider the context of my situation"" then he got angry and said ""stop telling me what I have to do. I don't have to do shit.""

This bit of argument happened this morning before work. So we went to bed unresolved last night, and now to work. 

I did just text him to say that I appreciated he was trying to mend things [this morning] and apologized for my rhetoric being unproductive, and that I'm sorry we're fighting. Love you, have a good day.

He just responded that he appreciated that. 

We have a general rule not to argue, or really have any important conversations via text; text is reserved for grocery lists and memes. :)

Alright, so you made it. I get that he has a strong work ethic, so I see how he views my choices as bad; however, from my view, I was home at 9PM on a work night (only barely late by our standards), I wasn't drunk or anything, and I had a freak headache which was bad timing. I've made bad choices, sure, but I don't see this as one of them. He is unyielding that I made a bad choice.

Beyond that, I feel disrespected that I wasn't allowed space to ""defend"" myself, or respond to his reprimand. Furthermore, he can be condescending and I'm not chill with that-- I'm NOT one of his students.

I'm typically a pretty passive person. There are plenty of arguments I just sit on and let go. So I think it's a bit more surprising for him when I DO stand up and demand an argument on a situation. 

DH is very proud. This isn't my favorite quality, but it's part of him. How do I productively argue with him? How do we help one another see the other's perspective without tears and raised voices?

I appreciate your time and advice.

Thanks!

"My husband (30/M) spontaneously flew halfway across the world to take a selfie in front of a landmark without telling me (31/F) and is on his way back now


To keep things short, we have been married for 4 years in what has been the pretty successful and run of the mill, committed marriage. We have two small kids and own a house, work full time and love our jobs and day to day lives. This should be an indication that everything in our relationship is fine, right? Little to no hiccups, lots of affection, good sex life and no monetary stresses. 

Well, that's what I thought too... Two days ago we both left home for work (we work close to our home in neighboring buildings), the kids were in day care and all was well. We were texting as we usually do throughout the morning and then he told me he was having a busy day and wasn't going to be able to message as much. Perfectly normal, it happens with our high management jobs, and we left our catch-up for after work.

At the end of the work day he contacts me saying that he will be working an extra long night. He had a goofy mood about him but I didn't think much of it. Late nights at his job are customary and he can be a pretty jokey type guy. Needless to say I went to bed alone that night. Again, not out of the ordinary but also a bit unorthodox, especially with no follow up. Not enough for me to start worrying yet. 

Well, after a full day of me worrying, stressing out, not being able to reach him and no one at his work having any information about his whereabouts or activity, I get a fucking email from him! In it he explains that he felt an instant urge to fly halfway across the world to Nepal to take a selfie in front of the Himalayas so that he could show me!

It turns out he had left work near the end of the day two days ago (carrying nothing but his work clothes, wallet, cell phone and car keys), grabbed an Uber to the airport and paid for an exorbitantly priced last-minute ticket to Katmandu, Nepal, where he was able to arrange a bus and tour to the nearest entry point to the Himalayas he could reach at the very last second. No plan, no nothing, just felt like doing it. Didn't even tell his co-workers, friends and not even his fucking wife or kids. He said he got the idea while at work that day and saw a picture of the Himalayas on his desktop. 

He is currently on layover and destined to be back by tomorrow night, several thousand dollars of airfare and nearly two days of tears, anxiety and cellphone wall-tosses later. Even typing this is difficult as I am seeing red after this whole ordeal!

I am beyond upset by his spontaneously irrational actions, never expected him to do something like this as he has shown nothing but love for me and our children, this is completely out of left field and I do not intend to take any action or am close to considering divorce. 

That being said, I feel conflicted over this and do not feel like adding any tension to everything over two days of rash activity, but I feel like something has to be done. The sensation I felt when I opened that email was like being a healthy person walking down the street and having a heart attack. 

I have told no one about this except for my parents and siblings, and they are all on my side but have remained well-humored about the situation and have offered to be by my side when my husband lands in town. Our kids obviously don't know about this or are even old enough to understand, and my hope is that they never find out what their father did. 

Has anyone here been through something similar or know someone who has? How should I deal with this when he gets back as someone who hasn't experienced any major hiccups in their marriage? I have less than a day to chill out and consider how I will approach this. I do not want my loved ones involved in the confrontation, but have always felt that I can turn to reddit in times of need.

TL;DR - Husband felt a spontaneous urge to fly to Nepal and take a selfie in front of the Himalayas at the end of the work day without telling me. He racked up thousands in airfare, worried me and his colleagues to death and is on his way back now. I am not sure how to confront him, as the entire ordeal has taken place over the course of 50 or so hours and I have not had time to process it. "
"I [31F] just found out my boyfriend [31M] is on Tinder.


Essentially what the title says.

We have been together for 2 years, however we don't live together yet. His job involves a lot of travelling and an old friend I have on Facebook sent me a screenshot of him on Tinder in the city she lives in where he is currently working. From the description of himself I know that he made the profile.

He doesn't come back for 2 weeks and I can't wait until then to say something. I thought we were happy and this is a slap to my face. I don't know what to say to him?

TL;DR my boyfriend is on tinder, isn't coming back home for 2 weeks, and I have no idea what to say to him."
"My (22F) future ""mother-in-law""(50sF) is asking way too much from me


I have been dating my boyfriend for about 5 years now, so I guess you can say we are in a long term serious relationship that could possibly lead to marriage. 

For the past year, my boyfriend's mother has been suggesting different things I should do to secure my future with her son. The first thing she did was suggest that I start a life insurance policy and add my boyfriend as a beneficiary. The agent came to their house and we had a 3 hour long discussion about the different policies and she was pushing me to go for the policy which would cost about $300/month. Although I have a decent paying job, I am in no position to pay that much every month for life insurance when I am only 22 years old. I filled out the application and provided my bank routing and account number for the initial deposit, but I decided not to go through with it right now. 

After the whole life insurance policy discussion went away, she started suggesting my boyfriend and I get a safe deposit box together and put our income in there as savings. No way in hell would I do that, so I declined, but my boyfriend went ahead and opened the safe deposit box on his own and added his mother to it. 

Now just recently, she has been pressuring us to buy plots in the cemetery as ""security,"" saying that we can sell it in the future if we desperately need the money. She also said that open plots are hard to come by in this specific cemetery so we have to buy it now before it is all filled. Unbeknownst to me, they decided to go ahead and purchase the plots without my knowledge, each costing about $14,500 and we are contracted to 3 plots (one for me, one for my boyfriend, one for his mom). There is also an initial down payment of $5,000 and I would have to pay about $250/month for 60 months to pay off the plot for myself. This whole situation makes me INCREDIBLY upset because they went ahead and did this without my knowledge and I have to be stuck with a stupid piece of land I won't even utilize until I'm dead for who knows how long. The crazy thing is that I'm not even on the deed so if we break up, there's no guarantee I will get my money back. Although $250 a month won't be a huge hit for me, it still makes absolutely NO sense as to why I would need to throw away close to $15,000 when I could use that money towards my new car or down payment for a mortgage. 

I expressed my displeasure with the whole situation to my boyfriend but he basically just brushed it off saying it'll be good for our future. Regardless of what happens, I still have to pay it monthly, but how can I prevent things like this from happening in the future when we get married? He comes from a really superstitious Chinese family and is a momma's boy, so he believes EVERYTHING his mom tells him, even if it makes absolutely no sense. Would it also be weird for me to have legal documents involved in regards to the cemetery plots and my payments? I am really close to his family and I am certain they won't do anything shady if push comes to shove, but I do need to my own security.

TL;DR: Boyfriend's mom is trying to make unnecessary financial decisions that has little to no benefits, but claiming it will secure our future. Now I am stuck paying $14,500 for a cemetery plot for the next 5 years and my name isn't even on the deed. How do I prevent similar things from happening in the future? Should I get legal papers involved for the plot?"
"My grandma [81 F] wants to give me [27 M] her engagement ring to propose to my girlfriend [26 F]. My sister [29 F] wants the ring for herself as an heirloom.


I was talking with my grandma this weekend about how I want to propose to my girlfriend, Maria. We’ve been together for almost 3 years, we live together, and we’re best friends. My grandma loves her too and, by her own volition, offered to give me the engagement ring my grandpa got her 62 years ago to propose with. I loved the idea, and I knew it would mean a lot to Maria. I told my grandma I first wanted to talk to my mom [55 F] and sister [29 F]. Both of them have a history of volatility, but especially my sister, Sarah.

I talked to my mom first, and she loved the idea too, which was a huge relief. But when I called my sister Sarah and told her what I was hoping to do, she wasn't as warm to the idea. She mentioned how she had talked to both our mom and grandma at various points about how she wanted the ring for herself. We had what I thought was a very civil, respectful conversation and I told her I would consider her opinion, and asked her to later reconsider the idea. Nobody yelled and it was a nice talk, despite the disagreements. When I talked to my mom a few hours later, she mentioned how Sarah called her and they started arguing and yelling, mostly about how mom didn’t outright agree with her.

To put it bluntly, if she had any real prospective chance at using the ring as an engagement ring, it would be a different story and I would back off, but she doesn’t. She maintains that she chooses to be single (which I completely support) but I often hear her complaining about how she can’t ever meet a nice jewish boy (she’s heavily involved in her local Jewish community.) Since this is the case, she wants to keep the ring for herself as a keepsake.

My sister has a history of making things about herself. Vacations cut short, celebratory dinners stormed out of, and she almost ruined our step-sisters bat mitzvah because she was asked to stay at her friends house (just down the street from our dads house), just to name a few. Our whole family has spent the last 29 years bending the knee to keep her slightly less than miserable. 

Tl;dr: My grandma offered me her engagement ring to propose to my girlfriend with. My sister wants to keep the ring for herself, not to use in an engagement, but as a keepsake. Should I give into her or stand up for myself and my new family?

"I’ve (35F) lived with my best friend (35F), for 3 years. She applied for a job for the summer just assuming I would be watching her 9 year old when she knew I was also looking for a summer job. Do I have the right to be pissed off?


3 years ago, I was in a bad spot. I lost my job, was in an emotionally abusive relationship and was taken advantage of by my old roommates/“friends” from college. Long story short, my best friend (whom I’ve been friends with for over 20 years), wanted me to move in with her, her husband and her little boy so I could get back on my feet and have a fresh start. She had been wanting me to move in with her for years. I finally agreed, moved several states away from my home state and have lived with her and her family since. 

Things have gotten much better since then. I work full time as a teacher’s aide, (so does she) and I’m in a relationship with a wonderful guy. (Going on a year soon)  I pay rent and am on the lease to our place. I’m also building a savings. Things have been good. Until recently.

Lately, my boyfriend and I have been discussing us moving in together when my lease is up in the fall. We think it’s the right time. I love my best friend dearly, but she and I couldn’t be more different. She’s a born again Christian and I’m not. It doesn’t normally bother me, but lately her ideals have been bleeding over into my personal life. (She assumes my boyfriend and I won’t have sex before marriage for example.) Also, (And I feel terrible for saying this) she’s been driving me crazy lately. Her 9 year old (who is extremely smart. We’re talking genius IQ levels) treats me more like a peer than an elder. He constantly comments on what I eat and drink, lectures me about unhealthy eating habits and one time made a comment about how I don’t pay rent. People use to think his mini adult ness was cute, but I think he’s going on 10 soon and it’s stopped being cute a long time ago. 

My best friend’s husband has often corrected (or tried) to correct his behavior, but often my best friend will step in and explain why he is the way he is. (For example, one time he was spinning a chair around and around and his dad and I told him to stop. She immediately swooped in, explaining it had been raining all day and he was cooped up inside and that’s why he was spinning the chair.) Another time, he ignored all of us when we were trying to get his attention. We told him he needed to start listening better and she immediately said it was because he played video games too much with Dad over the weekend and studies show that if kids play video games too much, they listen less, blah blah. I also caught him picking up my phone and scrolling through my text messages. I feel like I get no privacy at all. Best friend doesn’t seem to understand that I want my own privacy. She’s offered many times to have my boyfriend come over to “hang out” but frankly, I can tell he’s uncomfortable the second he steps foot in the door. And I know privacy is a long shot in my house. 

Anyway, onto what happened tonight. Best friend knows that I’ve been looking for a part time job for awhile for over the summer. I figured it was a great way to earn extra cash and put it toward my apartment fund. (I’ve discussed moving out with her, but she doesn’t seem to get it and she assumes that l’ll be moving out after my boyfriend and I get married. ) Plus, I’m a hard worker. She knows this. She knows that I wouldn’t just do nothing all summer. Tonight, she casually asked me how the job hunt was going. I admitted not very well, and that no one was calling me back. She answered that she applied to work at a donut shop, has an interview and that she would just need someone during the day, “probably in the mornings.” She goes “You wouldn’t mind that right?” Well, Yeah. I would mind that, and told her so. She never asked me if I could watch her son, she just assumed I would, knowing full well I was looking for a job. She never discussed anything with me beforehand. She always assumes that just because her kid is “easy” that I’m readily available to watch him. I’m not. And frankly, I don’t want to. I feel duped into taking this “job”, knowing she won’t pay me and I know “It’s just in the mornings” will turn into “It’s just during the day.” Etc. Do I have a right to be mad?

Tl;dr Best friend (who I live with), applied for a job just assuming I’d watch her kid. I’m annoyed.

"PSA: Match.com reanimates old profiles and shows them on their website, regardless of whether the person has logged in or not.


More than seven years ago, I had a Match.com profile and subscription. Then I met my now-wife, and I unsubscribed/deactivated shortly thereafter, like people do, and never logged into the site again.

Two or three weeks ago, there was an email from Match in my email inbox. Something about singles near me. I figured it must be spam, marked it as such, and went about my day.

Last week, I go look in my Spam folder to see if there's anything that needs saving. Lo and behold, I'd started getting Match messages almost daily - sometimes 2x/day. Moreover, the subject lines indicated that women in my metro area were messaging/winking/whatever at me. I was concerned someone might've gotten control of my old account somehow - but it was deactivated, right? How could that be? I definitely don't have my old password for that, so I called up Match.

**Turns out** that Match.com actually trawls through its compendium of old accounts, *even those that have been unsubscribed/deactivated,* and takes some to show on their website as if they're active accounts. This is why I was getting all these emails. The Match.com representative explained this quite matter-of-factly. I pointed out this could pose a big problem for people in committed relationships, like myself, whose partners might be understandably troubled to hear their SOs were turning up on a dating website. The representative said she could understand why I'd feel that way. (!)

Anyway, she helpfully deactivated my account (again) so that it is once again invisible, and assured me it won't happen again.

Moral of the story: watch your email for shit from Match, or be prepared to have a really awkward conversation with your partner.

**tl;dr -** Match.com might start displaying your old profile at pretty much any time. If you start getting emails from them and don't understand why, call immediately, because your picture might be shown as active on their platform."
"I (29F) broke up with my partner (33M) because he could not commit and put a label on our relationship.


This is a pretty straight forward situation, and I’m pretty sure I’m doing the right thing. I think I need to just get this stuff off my chest and to get some reassurance that I’m doing the right thing. I \(29F\) met my guy \(33M\) a little over year ago. We got along really well immediately. He was easy to talk to and we started spending a lot of time together. About 3 months pass by, and I ask that dreaded question “what are we?” He tells me he really cares about me, isn’t seeing anyone else, and wants to continue seeing me but just isn’t ready to put any labels on anything because it’s too early. Now I’ve never been in a situation like this and already a red flag is going up but I really like him and it had only been a few months so I agreed and we continued as is. Again, things are great; we continue to spend a lot of time together. I’m at his place all the time, we hang out on the weekends, go the gym together, help each other out in whatever way we can. Typical happy couple life \(but with out any labels\). I have no doubts in my mind that he was honest about being exclusive and he made me incredibly happy. I started to feel myself developing very strong feelings. I think it’s fair to say I fell in love with him, and I was getting really attached. Not having a label was really starting to frustrate me because I felt like he wasn’t fully committed, despite him saying that he was. It was just something that I needed. So I spoke to him again in December. He says the same things he said the first time around. He acknowledged that it has been a while, but his last relationship was difficult and he likes how things are with us and he is not sure if he is able to give me everything I want just now. So again we leave this as is. But this time, I can’t just let it go. It eats away at me and I feel so incredibly insecure. I don’t want to bother him because he has his own stuff going on with work, and starting a new school program, so I just keep it to myself and try to be as supportive as possible. He is also there for me as well, and again I do not have any reason to think that he is doing anything manipulative or sinister. He just isn’t comfortable with labels at this time. The one year mark comes, and by this point, I just started to feel like an emotional wreck. I wonder if there is a future with his guy, and he wants to be in my life, but at the same time he isn’t really there, there is a part of him that is removed, and that hurts. I started to feel like something was inherently wrong with me that made it so that he did not want to fully commit to me. So we have this conversation again. He recognizes how upset this is making and says that he doesn’t like seeing me hurt like this but right now he does not feel he is stable enough to give me what I want. I say I understand but that doesn’t change that I need more of a commitment and I want to have someone in my life who is willing to make that commitment to me. I would do anything for this guy, I would move half way across the world for him. Drop everything. But I don’t know if he would do that for me. And if he doesn’t know by now, then I just have to end it. He says that it’s not fair that I’m going to cut him out, and he still wants me in his life as a friend. But I can’t do that, it just stings so much because every time I talk to him, I can feel the emotions I have for him coming through and having to come to terms with the realization that we will never be together. It’s like going through a breakup every time we talk, even if it is a pleasant conversation. It’s mentally killing me. \(I know, it’s dramatic but breakups tend to bring out the melodrama in me\). I’m doing the right thing? Right? By cutting him off? I mean is there a part of me that wants him around, of course but it makes it so much more harder to move on. I hate that I’m in this situation stuck in this limbo. I feel like I’m just coasting right now, and I just want this all to be over. And hopefully never have to deal with this every again.

**TL;DR: Broke up with my guy because he said he could not put a label on our relationship after a year. I want to cut him off. He says it's unfair. What do I do?**"
"UPDATE: My [28F] BF [29M] of a year keeps joking about proposing. Not sure what to think of it.


Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8c8sfx/my_28f_bf_29m_of_a_year_keeps_joking_about/

As some suggested, we ended up having a conversation about his joking and our future. He said that he had indeed been thinking about our future and ""definitely saw us going down that road."" He made it clear he'd like us to raise a family and move to a new city (that we're coincidentally visiting in two weeks). He did not make it sound like an engagement is imminent, but he was very frank in saying that if we were to get married and build a life together he would be very happy. 

Thanks Reddit, you got this one right!

tldr: Boyfriend had been joking about proposing, I didn't know how to take it. We talked about it and he does want to get married. "
"Workplace related - my [28F] assistant [32F] of 3 months has a ""holier than thou"" attitude and wants to call the shots. How do I rationally explain to my boss [40sM] that I no longer wish to work with her?


**Tl;dr A shared assistant who doesn't respect me  and has been allowed to call the shots will be reporting directly to me going forward. I admonished her today for giving short notice when requesting leave and flexible hours, and she snapped at me. We don't have HR so how do I explain to my boss I don't want to work with her?**     

**Some background info...** we hired Frankie [32F] as a shared assistant to two managers, myself and another woman [50sF], around 3 months ago. This is the usual probationary period with the small family-run company I work for. Unfortunately Frankie's probation ended yesterday so I am unsure if there is still time to inform her we aren't continuing her employment, nor am I sure if my boss [40sM] would actually do that.     

Frankie switched careers a year or two ago, from a high-paying job in engineering, to our low-paying creative industry.  
I think this contributes to her ""holier than thou"" attitude as I believe she sometimes sees herself as the smartest person in the room, despite everyone else having years more experience that is relevant to our industry. She will often speak with authority when in reality she should be checking with her managers on the way they wish to manage the team's work. She is also over-confident in areas she is not yet fully competent in, as she never undertook study in our field (she learned on the job after her career change).     

Since starting work, she has caused myself and her other manager a few problems. Things like making decisions that are above her authority, giving away team assets without checking with us, requesting that I change one of my processes I've had in place for years as she thought it was ""unclear"", making mistakes (which is natural) but not acknowledging fault when approached about them (trying to blame an external subcontractor), complaining to me about her other manager, complaining that I am ""micromanaging"" her (as I mentioned she is not yet fully competent in areas I would like her to be, so am watching these aspects of her work closely) but patronisingly congratulating me on ""doing a great job"" in my management of her, leaving for the day before all her work is completed, giving short notice when taking leave and requesting her hours be changed, and her attitude in general (she has a habit of ""telling"" rather than ""asking"", which irritates both myself and her other manager as well as other employees and subcontractors who work in the building).

Recently we have taken on more work, so Frankie was told she would soon be moving full time to work with her other manager and we'd be hiring another assistant for my team. After around a week's time Frankie went to our director (my boss) to complain that she didn't actually want to work with the other manager (as that team deals with different subject matter) and that she wanted to stay on my team. Despite my reservations about her capabilities, and about letting someone so new call the shots, my boss agreed to this out of fear that she would leave if he didn't.

**To today's incident...** I am the kind of boss that would rather be casual about things, so don't really care if people want to work fewer hours one day and more the next. Our office has regular hours but requirements can be pretty flexible, and none of the other assistants seem to have a problem with giving their managers the heads up when they want to work different hours.            
The problem is that Frankie has been taking advantage of this. She has been applying for leave with short notice, applying for leave with short notice then cancelling it with short notice, taking leave she doesn't have (so her available leave goes into negative), and this morning sends a text message at 8am saying she is at the office and wants to leave at 5pm (usual hours are 8.30am until 5.30pm). I didn't see this until 10am when I looked at my phone - I had been in the office for hours by this stage and she hadn't mentioned it to me in person nor to her other manager.

At this point it's the last straw for me and I approach her about it in an informal way, like I do with most things. I was angry but tried not to show it, I said basically ""so I just saw your text, this isn't cool, you can't really keep doing this, company policy is actually 2 weeks notice for leave, plus we need at least a day's notice and you'll need to tell us in person if you're changing your hours"".     
I turn away to take a phone call but when I hang up the phone she snaps at me that she ""would appreciate it"" if I could be ""less condescending"" and not to use that tone with her, without acknowledging anything I'd just said about her hours or leave.       
I've never had anyone talk to me like this, I was so shocked I couldn't say anything in response, I had to walk away from the situation.  

I went to my boss to discuss. He agrees with me and will talk to her later this week about giving more notice for leave and hours, but I don't think he sees the underlying problem - which to me is that that Frankie wants to call all the shots, and doesn't have any respect for either myself nor her other manager.    
He also asked me whether she was doing a good job, despite her hours, and I told him that yes she is trying hard, but also about incidents where she had left without finishing her work, and mistakes she has been making. To be clear, I prefaced this by saying that I believe she is over-confident and also new, so unsure whether the mistakes are going to be an ongoing problem or if they're just teething issues. At this stage I don't know the answer to this either.

**Having thought about it throughout the day, I've come to the conclusion that I don't want her on my team. But how do I go about explaining this to my boss (we don't have HR), and how do I deal with Frankie going forward if he ignores my request?**"
"Me [28 M] with my wife [27 F] 5 years together, I cheated a long time ago the other woman sent me a letter. What should I do with it?


Yeah I cheated, I regret it probably more than anything because of how bad I hurt my wife. It happened 3 years ago i met another woman it was during a time when me and my wife would in a bad place.

I slept with the other woman 2 times I couldn't lie to my wife and just told her what happened. We found out a few weeks later that she was pregnant so I have been trying as hard as I can to be a better husband and earn her trust back.

We are in a good place now, she doesn't trust me fully yet which I know will take years or never happen. She has access to all my devices so she can look whenever she wants no problem.

So here's the thing, when I got the mail today and she sent me a letter I haven't opened it and don't know what to do. Should I give it to my wife or just throw it away, should I read it and show my wife or read it together or what.

I don't know how to proceed and could use some help her on what to do.

TL;DR: I cheated a long time ago I have worked hard to try and earn my wife's trust back, I got a letter from the other woman and don't know what to do with it.

"My boyfriend(20M) doesn’t really react to my stories or ask me questions. It’s making me insecure and I’m debating on whether or not to go on a road trip with him or not.


Hi there.

So my boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and I generally feel loved and cared about. He spends all his free time with me, is super affectionate and all that good stuff.

However, this has been a problem throughout most of our relationship. In the beginning I didn’t notice it so much as we were both really into each other and talking 24/7. He was very responsive and even when he wasn’t, we talked so much that the awkward silences were easily overshadowed by all the hormones flying around.

About 6 months in, I noticed that he didn’t respond to stories or jokes I told like any of my other friends or family did. He doesn’t even make a sound of encouragement, not even a courtesy laugh.  I understand that not everything I think is funny or interesting will be to him, but I happens way more often than it ever has with other people that like me.

We can talk for hours about his work, his friends, his family, and things that we mutually did together, but when it comes to things just about me, I get no response. I tell a story about my family, nothing. Something weird happened at work, nothing. 

He also rarely ask questions about me. He’ll give the standard how was work? Or how are you? But not much past that.

Just as an example. I started an online schooling program ~4 months ago and had to withdrawal because I had to choose between car maintenance and paying for another class. It’s kind of embarrassing and not information that I’m super excited about, so I figured I’d tell him that I’m not in it anymore if he asks. He has yet to ask and it’s been 2.5 months. I haven’t gotten a single “hows the class going?” Not interest in what I was taking or how I was doing.

It makes me feel weird about sharing information with him. I feel like he either just straight up doesn’t care or just doesn’t think I’m that interesting. I find myself not freely offering up stories like I would with others because it makes me feel insecure and ignored and a little embarrassed. 

I’ve seen him around other people and when they are talking about something interesting to him or their lives he seems interested and engaged, even when it’s things about their personal lives or stories they are telling. It seems like it’s just me. 

With his friends, they’ll tell him some funny/complaining story about something and he’ll laugh and respond back with something like “dude that’s messed up” or validate them somehow, I tell a story or complain about work and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall.

I’m at a breaking point because I feel as though I can’t share anything with him without feeling judged/embarrassed. Sometimes I’ve even been talking and stopped mid way through and said that he doesn’t seem interested, and he’ll just say “I’m not always gonna be interested, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t tell me” which is great and all, but it happens so much that I don’t even know that he likes me at all. 

We are both on vacation this week and I’d really like to go on a road trip, but at this point I’m not even sure I want him to go with me. I mean he doesn’t drive so it’s not like hed be helping with that. But really, I’m not sure if I want to be in a long car ride and have every one of my stories ignored. When I do things with friends we swap stories and it makes car rides fly by, with him it’s filled with silence or his music (which I don’t always like). When I am with friends, we end up going random places and even if it seems weird or ends up being lame, we still have fun. When I am with him, and I pick a spot that’s kinda funny and it ends up being lame, he’ll stand expressionless and look bored and tell me that “I picked it so I should be having fun”. This kind of thing doesn’t happen all the time, but it happens enough that I’m always worried that I’ll pick “wrong” and that he’ll be unhappy it’ll be my fault. 


Any insights?

Tl;dr: my boyfriend of three years doesn’t ask questions about me and doesn’t really react to stories and jokes I tell. I want to go on a road trip, but now I’m unsure as I do not know if I want to go with him. I don’t want to drive for 8 hours in silence broken up by me making jokes to a brick wall and feeling embarrassed when I look over to see him staring straight forward with no expression."
"My (35f) husband (35m) has been acting so sweet and considerate and I don't know what to do with it.


We've been married over a decade.  He's a quiet gruff gamer who works hard, isnt romantic, and a great dad.  I've always felt I like him a bit more than he likes me (I still feel infatuated, he isn't very cuddley) and I'm ok with that because I know he loves me and I love our life. 

He recently went on a work trip and got training about the gottman technique of having 5 positives to every negative and always making deposited in our emotional bank.  Since he's been home he's been talkative, cuddley, wants sex (was a once a week if that, kind of guy), and wants to do things with me.  

Sounds great right? I just... It makes me nervous? I don't know why. My main two issues have always been that we only have sex when he's interested (not other way around), and he rarely holds a conversation.  Now i feel so unsure how to respond.  Im almost on the verge of tears.  I don't understand this response or how to act around him and any insights would be appreciated.  

To further complicate things we recently (before his trip) attempted a challenge where we had sex everyday.  He gave up after a week and said he didn't like it and unless the sex was something involved it was as fun as the dentist.  Now he's all cuddly and in tune with me and I'm getting whip lash from this.  

Tldr: typically stoic, grumpy husband is now all sweet and romantic and I don't know why I don't like it.  
Pls. Help. "
