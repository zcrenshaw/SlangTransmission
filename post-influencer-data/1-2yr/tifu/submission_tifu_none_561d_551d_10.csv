"TIFU by falling asleep wearing VR headset, breaking my monitor, and making my parents think I'm dying.


This happened about 30 minutes ago, it's 4am and I'm tired and stupid for this. 

I'm one of those people, where if I fall asleep I sometimes forget what I was doing before I went to sleep.

So I was playing RE7 in VR, but it was getting kinda late but I wanted to stay up and play anyways. I started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

Then I woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. BUT HOLY SHIT I JUST WOKE UP AND ALL I CAN SEE AROUND ME IS A DARK ROOM WITH SOME TABLES CHAIRS ALL I CAN HEAR ARE CREEPY NOISES AND ITS DARK OUTSIDE AND  I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM. 

So logically I stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but I'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

Somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), I also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because I wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

I start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that I didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""What the hell, are you ok?""

She took the headset off of me, and I see the destruction I did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall. 

My mom laughed her ass off at me, and told me we will talk about it tomorrow. 


tl;dr slept with scary game on, thought it was my reality. broke stuff by accident and feel dumb."
"TIFU by fucking my dads couch


Throwaway, because I don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

This happened last week on Saturday, because Saturday and Sunday is my father's custody time for me. Saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

This made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. 
Materials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags

I started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. 

Another detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

Not today

He left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

I heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". I couldn't decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

TL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

EDIT: Typo

EDIT NO.2: HOLY SHIT YALL BLEW THIS UP.
I really, really, REALLY appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. My couch fucking earned me a dollar and I'm proud!"
"TIFU by convincing my brother's friend I killed him


This happened years and years ago when I was about 15.

It was around Halloween and we still had a bunch of fake blood and didn't know what to do with it.

My younger brother wanted to prank his friend. So we came up with a plan where while his friend would be sitting in the kitchen I'd come in and tell my brother I wanted to show him something in the basement and take him downstairs.

I then ran a bunch of my dad's power tools while my brother screamed bloody murder and saying ""please don't kill me"" but then went silent after running the saw for a few minutes. I then came up the stairs with my white undershirt covered in fake blood laughing.

The plan was for my brother to then come up the stairs and pretend like he was a half dead zombie, but his friend took one look at me covered in blood and ran from the house screaming before my brother could come upstairs.

Within about 5 minutes, police cars just kept coming from all directions and they came running out with guns drawn.

The cops got confused and were looking for a dead kid, and put both me AND my brother in handcuffs not understanding he was the ""victim"" and wouldn't listen to our explanations and just kept screaming at us with guns drawn.

Eventually the whole thing was sorted out with no charges filed against anyone but we were never allowed in our dad's workshop again for like 5 years.

TL;DR played with fake blood, got handcuffed at gunpoint"
"Tifu by being an idiot on an airplane


So I was on a cross country flight the other day and am sitting next to a girl my same age. We start talking and she is awesome, great looking, in med school, we have having a great time and it turns out we like all of the same things, same tv shows, video games, same sort of drinks, everything you could think of. We talk for the entire 6 hour flight. She was going out to see her friends for a week long vacation and would be in the same city as me for the next 4 days. This seems awesome, make plans to get some drinks everything is going great. She was even texting her friend about me and feeling my arms to tell her about them. It all seems flirty and she seems into  me. We order drinks and are still talking about life, league of legends, and a million other things. Well at one point I think she is leaning in so I start to as well. She wasn't, I'm an idiot and now am hoping I disappear into my seat. She brushes it off and continues to be great company. Says she would give me her number, takes my phone and tells me to find it later. We get off the plane I'm aware that I made this weird feel like shit and quickly leave. I look at the contact later, there was a name no number. That's completely fair since I was a creep. I'm usually pretty good with girls and had never misread something so badly. Posted this here because I wanted to get it off my chest but obviously don't want my friends to know about it. 


****I suppose there's a chance she sees this since she is a redditor, if you do, I'm really sorry I was weird. You were awesome and I was a bit too drunk. 

**TLDR**
Had an amazing time with a girl on a plane misread a sign and tried to go for a kiss. Now I assume I'm some #metoo story and am fully aware that that is deserved, and now feel like shit.

**edit** As this got way bigger than I ever thought, the metoo thing was kind of a joke. I mostly just meant I'm now a story she will laugh about with her friends of some weird guy who over reached. I get the comments saying I was desperate as it does read that way but honestly I'm not, just a bit over confident in the moment I guess (thanks gin). Just trying to vent a bit about being dumb."
"TIFU by failing my road test before it even began.


So, I've been practicing how to drive for years now. Been taking some online practice tests, passed my written test, been practicing on roads and it all led up to today. I even drove my car to the DMV and the ride there went quite well. I pulled up to the starting line (or more specifically, one car length behind the starting line) and let my instructor get settled in. She told me to drive straight ahead and prepare to make a right turn. I did just that, but as soon as I turned on my right turn signal, she told me to stop and asked what I did wrong. I was honestly taken aback. She told me I ran a stop sign which, to my surprise, was an automatic failure. It turns out there was a stop sign about a car's length from where I ""started"" which I must've missed. I'm aware it was an honest mistake, but it's still probably the dumbest way I could've failed.

TL;DR - I ran a stop sign I didn't even see at the starting line, which was an automatic failure.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the positive reinforcement, as well as sharing your fellow stories of road test mishaps. My day became better as soon as I read your comments. :) Also, to answer a question people have been asking in the comments, I have a learner's permit and was driving to the DMV with an older, more experienced driver in the car."
"TIFU by forgetting to flush the toilet while I was on my period, convincing my ex that heart break can also break your ass.


Obligatory, this happened about three weeks ago. My ex and I were in the process of breaking off our engagement, and it’s been extremely stressful for the both of us. A day before I moved out he asked me if I was on my period, which I replied yes, and he seemed somewhat relieved. I didn’t think much of it, naturally, I had many other things on my mind. Well a few hours later we talking about how it all sucks and how we wish things were different, and mentioned how stressful and heartbreaking it has been but he’s learned a lot from it all, yada yada yada, then he started to giggle. 

He proceeds to tell me that a few days before I decided to move out, which was an extremely rough time for us, he smoked a bowl and went to take a shit. When we went to flush he looked in the toilet and saw blood. He stood there really really high for quite some time looking at his poop. He was convinced that the stress was causing him to shit blood. He spent days googling if heart break and stress can cause bloody stools, and with no avail he brought it up to his friend and his (friends) wife, his dad and with multiple coworkers (since he works at a human hospital) and even they were all stumped and extremely worried, so they started doing their research as well. 

At this point I’m laughing so hard I started crying. Well, unfortunately, when I cry I tend to throw up, which he used to his advantage. (I cry more than I’d like to admit so I’m not generally bothered by it anymore unless I cry in public.) So I’m sitting there by the toilet laughing my ass off and throwing up as he keeps going on about how high he was looking at his poop and how terrified he was for days,  googling for hours and hours and, in his need for some sort of petty revenge he wouldn’t stop talking about it for a good 45 minutes making me laugh harder, cry more, resulting in me throwing up more. I miss him. 


TL;DR I forgot to flush the toilet while on my period, convincing my ex he was shitting blood due to stress and heartache, which got me laughing so hard I started throwing up. 

Edit 1: I fixed the wife part. It’s his friends wife! 

Edit 2: Oooo! Thanks for the gold stranger!!! 

Edit 3: People have asked why we broke up, I don’t mind sharing [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/81qt8k/comment/dv4z8m0?st=JEBX3U51&amp;sh=6658bd85) , it’s actually kind of a relief to talk about it with people other than my family. 

Actually now I’m a little nervous about sharing so much with a bunch of strangers. I’ll leave it up nonetheless but please don’t hurt my feelings too bad! I’m a sensitive soul. 

Edit: I can’t even begin to tell you all how much it means to me that you are sharing your stories and giving me support like this. I honestly was expecting some sort of backlash. I’ve got my issues, I’m a disorganized person who never did the dishes, (I’d rather clean the whole kitchen before i do the dishes and I hardly did that) who drinks, sleeps and swears too much. I’m also hot headed and I am good at hurting people’s feelings if they hurt mine. I’m not a perfect person. We all have our issues, doesn’t mean we are bad people, and it just depends on finding someone who can deal with them and hopefully helps you better yourself. He’s not a bad person, and I feel I probably made him come off worse than he is. There was so much good in the relationship I just couldn’t handle the bad. I hope sharing my story helped at least one person out there because reading all of yours helped me. "
"TIFU by being too tough for a novacane shot


So a few months back, I got two screws put in my jaw, and I've had to go back for what feels like a million check ups since. Today's appointment was a ""15 minute appointment"" just to ""take some measurements."" I walk in thinking it would be another routine appointment to measure my bite or something simple like that. Wrong. 

I walk up to the chair and see the novacane shot. I know I've been bamboozled. I start panicking. I ask ""whoa whoa whoa doc, what's that for? Nobody said anything about needles."" I am informed that they're cutting open my gums to get a measurement of the actual screws. I've had no chance to mentally prepare to get a needle stuck in my mouth. It's a huge phobia if you haven't gathered that by now. 

So I ask to get it done without the novacane. I've cut my gum on a sharp corn chip before and survived. Plus I've got a really high pain tolerance, so no big deal right? Wrong again. They start out and I'm fine for the first bit, then like half-way through I realized mistakes were made. 

I make it a few more minutes, tears are streaming down my face and I hate myself. I have to pathetically justify the crying by saying its just a physiological reaction and assure them I'm fine. 

I tapped out about 80% of the way through. And ended up having to get the goddamn shot anyway. 

TL/DR: TIFU and thought I was a such a big tough badass that I could get my gums cut open at the dentist without novacane to avoid the horrors of getting a shot in the mouth. Wussed out 80% of the way through and had to get the shot anyway. "
"TIFU by trapping myself in a sadistic torture chamber (diagram inside)


Dear reddit, today I should not have changed my meditation routine. At least once a week for over a year I have a long meditation session in my bathtub. I shut out all light and lay silently in a very hot bath and quiet my mind for an hour or two. I've done this a million times the exact same way without fail.   
  
Here's where I fucked up, I changed the routine. I've been sick and congested lately, so I figured I would sit in the bathtub under a hot shower to steam up the room and clear my sinuses. I got the shower running and went to go shut off the lights. The light switch is a good 30+ feet from the tub, but I figured navigating back to the hot shower wouldn't be a problem. I was right, it wasn't. 
  
Navigating back, however, felt like a trip through a torture chamber. As soon as I got to the shower I dipped my toe in the water that had started to fill up in the tub. It was very hot, just how I like it. What I didn't realize, was that the temperature was offset by the cold water that hadn't warned up yet. The shower water was scalding hot. I yelped a bit in pain and jumped out before both feet had touched the floor.  
  
Here's the real fuck up, in my blind stupor I kicked the glass of water I had set on the side of the tub. It went flying in the direction of the door and shattered along it's way there.   
  
I was trapped at the end of a long hallway with zero vision and a puzzle of broken glass to maneuver around. I can't tell you how long I I spent on all fours like Velma, slowly sweeping glass out of my way to clear my escape route.   
  
TL;DR- There are better ways to meditate than doing so in a pitch black shower of steaming water.

"TIFU by burning my penis with a spark from a lightbulb


This afternoon, I am minding my business, watching some college basketball, enjoying an adult beverage or twelve. So naturally, nature calls and I must do what all humans do after consuming too many beers. I get up off the sofa and make my way to the bathroom.

Now, something you must understand about my bathroom is that the lightbulbs are directly over the toilet, on the ceiling. They are 120 Watt flood lights, so it is pretty bright, but hey, I like to have a well lit bathroom experience. The bulbs are incandescent, because I prefer not to feel like I am shitting in the middle of an office boardroom. There are two switches on the wall, one controls one of the bulbs, and the other controls the remaining bulb as well as the fan. When I’m just taking a piss, I only use the one light, without the fan, because who needs the fan just to piss? This will become important later.

I flip the switch, and the lights come on as usual. “Oh great,” I think, “I am about to feel sweet relief in my bladder and I can get back to my game! Just like always!” Boy was I wrong. I pull my penis out, lift the lid, and begin to urinate. It’s a steady flow, no reason to think anything out of the ordinary is about to occur.

The piss is going about as well as one could expect until I hear a deafening “pop,” and the entire room goes dark. Turns out that when 120 Watt flood lights burn out, they do so with style. Out of nowhere, sparks rain down from the ceiling, and fuck me if one doesn’t land directly on my dick, singeing the skin. As you can imagine, this hurt pretty fucking badly. I jumped from the initial shock of the “pop” and the darkness (the only lightbulb I had turned on had just burnt out with quite the fireworks display ensuing), and I jumped even higher from the pain of charring a good amount of phallic skin. The rest of the pissing experience was quite a bit worse than the initial pissing experience. 

At this point, piss is hitting walls, toilet, the bathtub, toilet paper on the little holder thing, the floor; no surface went un-pissed upon. I wish that were even a concern of mine, but I’m significantly more worried about my capacity to have children at this point. 

I leave the bathroom, and put iced peas on my dick to try and soothe the charred skin, when the thought hits me: my girlfriend is coming over for date night tonight. I spend the rest of the afternoon applying ointment and icing down mini-me so I can be ready for some loving.

7 o’clock rolls around, and I’m feeling much better. I’ve cleaned up the mess in the bathroom (because at this rate, there’s already enough to disappoint my girlfriend without adding a pissed on toilet seat to the mix), and my penis is feeling a little better. We get down to business, and I’m not too concerned until the boner starts coming on.

Turns out, singed penis skin hurts quite a bit when it expands during the process of becoming erect. I try to put on a brave face but she instantly knows something is very wrong. When I have to tell her that I burned my fucking penis today from an exploding lightbulb, she dies laughing and tells me to take my pants off (significantly less hot when it’s not because she wants to fuck, if you were curious). I show her the singe mark, and she immediately says I need to go see a doctor because it’s pretty bad. 

So, that’s how I’m currently in the waiting room of a CareNow, awaiting a doctor to check out my penis for burn damage. 

TLDR; Thanks to Phillip Lightbulb Co, I nearly received circumcision via spark and date night was ruined. I pissed all over my bathroom and missed the end of the game. I’m now sitting in line behind a bunch of sick 8 year olds so that a grown man can inspect my penis. "
"TIFU by leaving a negative review for a hotel


I'm a musician. Last month, I had a two-night gig in a small town about 10 hours away. The hotel was free and it was pretty good (e.g., soft bathrobes, pool, hot tub, waterslide, complimentary breakfast) except for the fact that I was kept awake BOTH nights by the people above me. They weren't even talking that loudly (though it was loud for 4AM) but the sound carried extremely well.

After our gig, on the 10-hour drive home, I was exhausted and annoyed. Completely forgetting that the hotel was FREE, I wrote a 2-star review on TripAdvisor. I wrote about all the pros (lots) and a couple cons, but stated that the fact that I couldn't sleep outweighed ALL the pros.

A week or so later, I remembered that the hotel was free and realized that they could easily revoke this privilege. I decided to delete the review but didn't get around to it. I told myself I would do it before our next gig.

Well our next gig is this weekend. My partner called me up today and said, ""Hey, so... the hotel isn't going to let us stay with them. Because of a negative review left on TripAdvisor."" He is really good at staying calm when he is mad, so I couldn't tell how pissed he was. I must have apologized a million times. I said I would take it down immediately, but it doesn't change the fact that they saw the review and took away our free hotel. On top of that, the hotel has some sort of business agreement with the people who hired us, so that relationship has been compromised too. It seems like my partner spent quite a bit of time putting out the fires I started.

What I'm really not looking forward to is trying to put on a show while I feel like a fucking idiot. Sometimes the hotel people show up to these gigs, and the lady who hired us will be there thinking I am idiot the whole time too. I don't know if it will affect our ability to be hired again or what.

TL;DR Left a negative review on TripAdvisor for a hotel where I stayed for free, they won't let us stay there anymore (duh).

EDIT 1: After the first morning, I asked if the people would be gone and the staff checked and said yes. The next night, the new people were loud too. I called around 2:30 or 4:30 AM to ask them to deal with it. Nothing happened, so I called again. The night staff said that she ha called but they hadn't answered, so she would have to go knock on their door. By then, I just gave up and put ear plugs in and covered my head with a pillow, but I could STILL hear them.

So they DID try to help when I contacted them, but it didn't matter because there was almost zero sound proofing.

EDIT 2: Before I deleted my review, they responded that my experience wasn't typical and hoped that I would return. There was no offer to fix it, but really, it was free, so what are they supposed to offer?

EDIT 3: Yes, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Seriously don't.

EDIT 4: Yes, I should not have criticized this place if I was planning on staying there again. 
TripAdvisor reviews use your first name and last initial. I don't know if there is such a thing as anonymous TripAdvisor reviews. Yes, I am stupid.
I have a white noise machine on my phone--great idea. It wouldn't have cut out the noise, but it would certainly have helped. Definitely going to do that in the future."
