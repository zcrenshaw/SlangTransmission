"TIFU by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. I ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.


I worked for a Workman's Compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - Todd - who was mildly annoying.  Nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  He enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  Little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. It got to be enough, so I decided he needed some payback.

He paid out a claim that was HUGE and he was nervous about it. I don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so I waited. About a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but Todd), I said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

A couple of days after that, I stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""Did you payout x-amount on the Smith file?"" He said he had and asked me why. I just walked away.

The following Monday, I had my plan laid out fairly well.  After sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that I borrow his black surplus Impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. Then, early that morning, I went about putting crime scene tape across the door to Todd's his office.

I had the receptionist in on it too. When Todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

Todd made it to the top of the steps when I rushed up to him and said, ""Dude - go, just go!""

""What the hell are you talking about?"" He asked.

""Just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

He shrugged me off, but I could tell that he was a little rattled. He turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. He walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. He ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

He was gone for nine hours. I had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

His absence meant that management got involved. I had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. I got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and I lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

Todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


TL;DR  I played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*Edit:  I posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and I wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  I have to say, I've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying I went too far.  Yes I did, which is why this was a FU.  For any of you worried about Todd, he's fine.  This actually happened in 1993 and I posted it because Todd and I were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so I had it on my mind.  Yes, I still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*"
"TIFU by running with the school flag, tripping, and destroying the state championship trophy in front of the whole school.


So the fuck up happened yesterday and I'm still saying ""oh my god"" to myself every time I think about it.

This past Saturday our school's girls Cross Country team won state and because of that earned everyone a pep rally. The night before someone asked if anyone wanted to be the flag runner and I [happily volunteered](https://i.imgur.com/qfllRsL.jpg), because that's a super dope job. I mean what could possibly go wrong?

Well here is exactly what went wrong:
 
The pep rally is in motion. The Cross Country Team starts pouring down from the stands to lead a school cheer. This is exactly when you should do a flag run, so I start haulin' out and narrowly avoid plowing one girl and make my way around the crowd (Definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend now though). I am caught up in the buzz of the moment and then all of a sudden I'm [going down hard...](https://i.imgur.com/XPL4P0i.mp4)
All that is going through my head is siren noises and me thinking ""I should just die now"" but unfortunately that never came to fruition and it got worse as I saw what I had tripped on and destroyed: [The state trophy we just won AND the one from last year!](https://i.imgur.com/gyAgaiL.png)
Now I'm a bit more famous around the school and kids keep seeing me in the hallway an saying ""OMG! You're the kid who broke the trophy!!""
RIP me

TL;DR I was the flag runner and I tripped over and destroyed two state trophies in front of the whole school.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! That makes it all worth it (sort of)! Just a bit of extra info, the trophies have been repaired with tender, sweet words and some wood glue."
"TIFU by having diarrhea for my entire adult life


This TIFU is a lifetime in the making, but I realized the depth of my stupidity today. 

When I was a young kid (under 10) I watched some sort of health program where other kids were explaining how different body systems worked, what you could do to be healthy, how bad injuries heal, etc. During this program, there was one kid talking about your digestive tract. He had a clear tube a couple inches in diameter full of food stuff. He explained that when you ate food with fiber, it helped move your food through your system, demonstrated by pushing a pipe cleaner through the tube and the food flying out. I thought, oh cool fiber pushed food through your system. 

Fast-forward to adulthood. I develop a myriad of gastrointestinal issues, eventually diagnosed as IBS. I get wicked poops. Like, pure liquid running out of my butt. Picture lava flowing down a volcano. It's gross. 

I start to see doctors. Lots of doctors. Before the IBS diagnosis, all of the life threatening things are ruled out with lots of very invasive procedures (hello colonoscopy before 21!). The first doctor tells me to eat fiber to help with the diarrhea, I nod politely and ignore him. So does the second, third, fourth...all of them. These quacks want me to introduce a pipe cleaner to this situation?! I have no problems getting food out! Why in the world would I do that?

I proceed to suffer through over a decade of IBS, alternating between medicine to stop it and medicine to make me shit. 

Today, after a stint that cost me yet another pair of underpants, it occurs to me that fiber isn't a pipe cleaner. 

Fiber is what bulks up your poops so you can have normal poop. Fiber IS what I need. 

I've paid for thousands of dollars of doctors and ignored their advice based SOLELY on a fucking tube and a pipe cleaner. 

I've sharted countless times and ruined so many underwear. I've spent fifteen years in misery because of something I learned at 9. 

Because I am an idiot who doesn't listen to doctors. 

I fucked up. 

I will be buying fiber supplements in the morning. 

TL:DR: fiber bulks your poops up, doesn't push them out like a pipe cleaner. Take your fiber, kids. "
"TIFU By Getting A Cop To Pull His Gun On Me...


So a little backstory I have a black Buick and the window doesnt go down becauase I was fixing the lock on the door and messed up the window. so last night I was going to walmart getting groceries and cat food. When I left and was driving I was speeding a bit without realizing it and hear a siren go off. This is where I fucked up... so I pull over and remember my window doesnt open so I opened my door as he was walking up and he yells while getting his gun out ""DONT YOU FUCKING MOVE STAY IN YOUR CAR OR I WILL FIRE"" I freaked he pulled me out of the car and searched it for weapons... he asked me why I opened the door I explained my window doesnt go down, he was actually pretty nice about but I did get a speeding ticket.

TL;DR Opened door when I got pulled over and nearly got shot.

Edit: I didnt open the door to get out

Edit2: windows fixed"
"TIFU by giving a very inappropriate sympathy card


This happened a few days ago. 

So we have these neighbors who are very nice, well-mannered people, but to be frank I don’t know much about them. I caught wind that one of their sons, in his late 20s, has passed away tragically earlier this week after an accident. It remained unclear how exactly he died, and for some reason I didn’t ask - when my mother called me I was on a quick lunch break so I just gave one of those “okay, I’ll go pick up a card” responses. 

Even though I don’t know the parents well and don’t think I ever met the son who passed, I knew I should go to the wake at least and/or send a card. Now I had been working busy shifts between two different hospitals, like the kind of shifts where you only have time to eat dinner, shower, shit and shave before waking up for work again. So on my way to work I ran into a shop and grabbed the first sympathy card I saw without reading it. As stupid as this way, I figured I couldn’t go wrong with a sympathy card. I was wrong. 

When I arrived at the wake from work I filled out the card in the car, finally reading what it said, and I went inside to pay my respects and leave the card. Now at this point I saw my brother, who told me how the son had passed: he was sitting on his apartment window smoking and he fell several stories through the window. 

What did the card say? 

*When God closes a door, he opens a window* 

**TL;DR gave a card that said “when god closes a door, he opens a window” to a family whose son fell out a window.** 

EDIT: I shit, shower, then shave. I’m not a monster! 

EDIT 2: I didn’t get the card back; I just hoped they would look past it, and after all that expression is used often enough in grief that I’m sure they knew my intentions were good. 

EDIT 3: I know it’s a shitty card to give either way, but my family just gives cards for everything - it’s just our way of paying our respects. And what I wrote in the card hopefully made up for the card print being shitty. And I can’t prove that this isn’t made up but it just isn’t. It’s a mishap I decided to share with reddit, and it “reads like a joke” because I formatted it that way. "
"TIFU by running with my toothbrush in my mouth


I woke up this morning and started brushing my teeth just like any other morning. I realized I was running a bit late and that it was dumping snow (I live in Northern Idaho), so I ran outside to start my car with my toothbrush still in my mouth. It was freezing outside and I was not properly dressed so I ran back to my house. Right when I was approaching, I stumbled slightly on the bottom stair and hit the toothbrush on my door, jamming it into the back of my mouth. It hurt a little bit but I didn't think anything of it and continued brushing my teeth. When I went to spit and rinse, there was more blood than toothpaste. I opened up, said ""ahhhhh,"" and looked in my mouth to find that the toothbrush had poked a hole in the back of my throat. Stitches in the back of your throat are not pleasant.

TLDR; ran with my toothbrush in my mouth and ended up with stitches in my throat"

"TIFU by sucking my own dick


The main part of this happened a few days ago, but first, some backstory: 

Back in high school, when I was randy as it gets, I would often look for new ways of jacking off—you know, like you do. Sometimes this involved using the ol’ left hand, sometimes both, sometimes some lotion in a plastic bag stuck inside a toilet paper roll. Variety is the spice of life, after all. 

But one day, everything changed. One day I looked down and thought, “That’s not that far away”. So I bent over. Now, as you may imagine, it was further than I thought, considering my non-athletic and stiff back (I’m not terribly flexible). But did I let a little thing like that stop me? Being ever the optimist about my new-found method of desired masturbation, I decided to see if a different position might help. 

I laid down on the bathroom floor and rolled over to where my feet were behind my head. Still no luck—so still no lick. 

Then I had another idea: why don’t I use the cabinet to get some leverage? So I laid down again, this time with my head towards the cabinet and kicked my feet up in the air. I put my feet against the cabinet and slowly walked myself down, pushing my high school boner ever closer to my face. No luck still. 

That didn’t keep me from trying again another day. And another. And another. Until eventually, I felt my lips around my own penis. I never succeeded in getting it too far in my mouth, but that didn’t much matter. The orgasm was unlike any I’d experienced up to that point in my life. So of course, despite my disgust at my own cum ending up in my mouth afterwards, I did it again. 

This became a somewhat regular occurrence, but I eventually stopped for some reason I can’t quite pinpoint. (Growing a beard might be part of it, as that really makes cleanup a lot harder.)

Fast forward to the present. I’m pretty out of shape and definitely less flexible than I used to be. 

Several days ago, I was bored and for some reason thought about my old habit. Eh, why not? A little auto-fellatio never hurt anybody. 

So I get back into the old position that was so tried and true. I put my legs behind me and walked myself down the wall forcing my back lower and lower. I remember thinking that this was harder than it used to be. But no matter. I’ll just keep trying. Sure enough, eventually I got back to the point where I could touch my dick to my lips. Not any further though. 

But that tantalizing closeness gave me determination. I used my legs to push myself down. And I kept pushing. And I succeeded. And oh, it was everything I remember. Except—

Except in my post-euphoric shame, I also felt my back hurting more than I remember it hurting when I used to do this all those years ago. I had to walk, hunched over to the bathroom to clean myself off. It hurt to stand back up. I had to slowly move myself from my hunched over position into an erect position. I tried not to think too much about it and chalked it up to not being as flexible as I once was and being out of practice.

But as the day went on, it continued to hurt. And the next day. And the next. I couldn’t ignore it anymore, and being the responsible adult that I am, I went to the hospital to get my back checked out. The doctor asked me about the pain and finally decided to do an x-ray. Turns out, I have a stress fracture on one of my lower vertebrae. 

Don’t trust yourself to know your limits when you’re in the middle of sexual arousal, kids. 


Tl;dr: sucked my own dick, broke my back. "
"Tifu by wrecking my house


So this happened about 5 years ago, sorry to all the tifu purists out there... 
 I was at a buddies house all night partying, playing drinking games. We ran out of beer at one point in  the night and since rum was the only other alcohol on hand, we switched to using that. Its safe to say that by the time I was being driven home I was thoroughly hammered.

 I was so drunk I couldnt actually get in my house when I was dropped off. One of my friends had to unlock the door for me to get in. I, for some reason, proceeded to go in to my sister's room to try to sleep on the floor. I woke her up (so she tells me) to demand that she go downstairs at once to get me some water. She declined and told me to leave. I reluctantly agreed, and apparently said ""maybe I'll take a shower"", (so she tells me).

 I remember getting in the shower. Now for some context, I was on the 2nd floor, and the shower in question was one of the stand up ones with no door, just a curtain and about a 4 inch lip that prevented the water from spilling out in to the bathroom. Once in the shower, I distinctly remember leaning on the wall and slowly sliding down it toward the floor. I remember telling myself to stop, but was so drunk and exhausted that I just kinda let it happen. 

 Next thing I know, I wake up to all sorts of banging and yelling. I realize its my parents and sister all banging on the door(locked) and yelling my name. My mind was racing. I knew I had fallen asleep, but thought I had done so for only a few minutes. I was wrong, so very wrong. I stepped out of the shower in to shin deep water. All of my clothes, as well as anything else on the floor that wasn't secured were floating around the bathroom. Panic set in immediately when I realized there was no quick fix to this and that I had to open the door and face the music.

 Opening that door was, I think, the moment I became a man. It took all the courage and strength I had to open that door and face my father. I opened the door, the water rushed out in to the hall, and my dad rushed in to the bathroom, hands outstretched reaching for my throat. My mom, bless her, stopped him from killing me. In his rage he screamed ""go downstairs!!!"".

 Once I got downstairs I realized the extent of the damage I had done. The drop ceiling in the kitchen had completely collapsed, and the whole first floor was flooded. Shocked, I went in to the basement to gather up every towel I could find to try to clean as best I could. However, the basement was flooded as well and most of the towels I found were far from dry. After checking the time and talking with my sister to see approximately at what time I left her room, we figured out that I was in the shower, asleep, for about 3 hours.

 Apparently, once I slid down the wall in the shower, I landed sitting right on top of the drain. So, three hours of shower water wound up everywhere in my house but in the shower drain. As big of a fuck up as this was though, it was made even bigger due to the fact that my parents had literally days before just finished selling the house, and we were due out in less than two weeks. The next day my dad took me to the bank where I emptied my savings account and handed it over to him. Luckily, pretty much everything damaged was repaired in time for us to move out, so in a way this has a happy ending. I haven't touched rum since.

Edit: Hey so I wanted to clear up one thing I keep seeing in the comments. People keep asking why my dad didn't take the door down ""what parent would let that go on for 3 hours"" etc. Its my fault for not elaborating on this but this all happened after midnight so my whole family was asleep. My dad woke up after I had already been in the shower almost 3 hours, and I woke up and opened the door only a couple minutes after he started banging on it. Hope that clarifies a bit. 

TL;DR - Drank too much, fell asleep in shower, flooded entire house right after my parents sold it"
