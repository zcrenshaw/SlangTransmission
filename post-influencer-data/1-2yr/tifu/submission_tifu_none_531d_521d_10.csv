"TIFU by eating 2lbs of grapes and drinking a pint of chocolate milk


So this happened about nine years ago now (my how time flies). Anyways, in high school I was in jazz band, and my school would always make the trip south (I’m from Canada) to the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival held at the university of Idaho in Moscow...Idaho...

Anyways, one of the other guys in the band, call him, I dunno; Balthazar Collector of Souls, was feeling sick one day cause all we’d had to eat really was shitty fast food for a few days. I recommended to old Balthy that we make the trek down to the supermarket to get him something to settle his stomach. He agreed and off we trekked.

When we got there we settled on some ginger-ale for him, and I, feeling peckish grabbed some healthy grapes and chocolate milk. I figured some vitamins would be good for me after three days of McDonald’s. Purchases in hand we started to make the trek back to the arena for the evening concerts. It bears mentioning this walk was about two hours, Balthy and myself had grossly underestimated the distance, but a little exercise never hurts, so off we went!

On our way back I was absentmindedly eating the grapes we had purchased, and had finished my chocolate milk (one of those little ones that look like a jug but not full sized, think they’re a pint?) Balthy and I joked, and chatted our way back, all the while I’m popping grapes in my mouth. About half way back I realize I’ve eaten almost all the grapes, about two pounds, things started to go down hill right around now.

As I previously mentioned I hadn’t been eating well up to this point, and was in fact kind of constipated. Whatever McDonald’s was blocking me up however was no match for the melange of exercise, grapes, and milk that I had just launched at it. I realize now that I had effectively drain snaked my entire bowel, and stuff started to move - fast. We are about a half hour from the arena (and nearest bathroom), and I am desperately trying to hold it together. By fifteen minutes away I’m waddling and speed walking like a penguin who’s been at sea for months.

By five minutes away I don’t know if I’ll make it, I’m sweating from everywhere and very distressed, but the arena is in sight. I break off into a sprint, and tear into the nearest bathroom. What followed was the most horrifyingly loud and violent diarrhea I have ever experienced in my life. So violent in fact that I actually shouted in pain as the deluge exploded from my poor anus.

After an indeterminable amount of time, full of agony, and I’ll admit fear, and some crying. I looked to wipe. In my haste I had not noticed the stall I selected had no toilet paper. “That’s ok,” I thought, “I’ll just make the quick dash over to the stall next door!” Oh, my folly. I realized though, that I had such a mess of myself there was obviously splash from the toilet (gross) and so I bent over to keep my cheeks apart and backed out of the stall.

I emerged, splattered ass first, and was greeted by two members of my band who had apparently been in the stalls when I arrived, two kind band members who had heard the entire cacophony decided to see if the crying person in the stall was ok, two band members with such kindness and mothering instincts that they could only be female. I turn around and we lock eyes, I glance between them frantically and then look helplessly around the bathroom to see that there are no urinals anywhere.

Horrified by the fact their classmate has just exposed himself to them, covered in diarrhea splash-back, the two girls run out and I dash into the next stall to clean myself. When I was finished I leave the stall only to be greeted once again by a woman at the sink who stares daggers at me. As I exit the bathroom I look back and see the six foot tall yellow letters that say ‘WOMEN’. Their gargantuan size taunts me as I go off to find the rest of the band, all of whom have heard the girl’s version of events and collapse in laughter as I approach. I’m just happy I didn’t ruin my pants.

TLDR: ate a bunch of grapes and chocolate milk, almost shat myself, ended up having terrible diarrhea in the women’s washroom, didn’t have TP, made a dash to the next stall and ended up exposing myself to two of my classmates.

Edit: This is by far my most upvoted anything, so thanks for all the love! I’m really glad you guys enjoyed the story. For those saying so, it is DEFINITELY not as bad as blasting it in either or both of those girl’s faces. But that story definitely reminded me of my diarrhea story and I felt I should share.

Some people were wondering about where I could have gone in Moscow that was that far away and I honestly don’t know. We definitely got lost at least once or twice, just from being outa towners, not that it’s complicated. I believe we may have gone further than we needed to, we just went to the grocery store we knew about, which was attached to that small mall. It also may have been a case of time dilation, minutes tick by slow when you have to go."
"TIFU by blasting diarrhea in a girl's face


In 2012, I led a team of volunteers on a mission trip to a rural part of the heart of Brazil, and what happened back in those jungles still haunts me to this day.

 We landed in Manaus Brazil, our team consisted of 15 people all about the same age (25 - 19), myself included. Then we took two of those minibuses out to some rural villages where there was no running water at all. Fortunately we did not have to sleep on the ground because some German missionaries had built a rudimentary concrete church building in the 1950's.

I've lived most of my life in Canada, but I have been on several mission trips throughout my life, so I like to pride myself on having a stomach of iron. No Hershey squirts in a foreign country for this guy. However, this trip was different. It must have been undercooked pork from the night we arrived in the village, because pretty much everyone got diarrhea the next day. 

We may have been in a church built by Germans, but there was no running water, no air conditioning or anything of the sort. However, the people of the village built an outhouse about 50 yards away. This thing was nasty too, flies were all over it in the day time because it was pretty much a pit. And when it rained, which it did often, the palm thatched roof leaked. 

So the night of the ""incident."" It was about 2 AM and pouring rain when I woke up feeling like I was going to explode, I had puked that night but this felt different. My stomach was making all manner of noises a healthy stomach shouldn't make. I got up and put some pants on as quietly as possible so as to not wake anyone else, tiptoed downstairs to the main area of the church. That's when I realised, whether I was ready for it or not, my sphincter was about to dump its contents in about 15 seconds. 

I sprinted out church doing the widest ""I got poo in my pants"" run I could to extend the time of the anal evacuation. I could barely see where I was going because it was raining so hard. The genius part of my brain had me already undoing my jeans as I was running. I also worked out in my head that I was going to be able to make it if I dropped my pants, opened the door and turned around all in the same moment upon entry. I did exactly that, but it wasn't enough. Mid air through the jump I shot a gas charged explosive into the outhouse, completely missing the seat. I kind of stood there in a moment of defeat, then heard a blood curdling scream. 

I turned around and saw one of the volunteers absolutely coated in excrement. My excrement. She had gotten the same stomach bug I had, must have woken up before me with the same horrible thing. Only she had made it, and I didn't.

Needless to say, she flew out back home the next day.

That was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life. I would rather poop my pants in front of a crowd while giving a speech, than relive the embarrassment of that night. 

I couldn't imagine what went through that poor girl's head as the door flew open, a random dude jumped out of the jungle, then pooped all over her. If you're reading this, I hope you forgive me.

Edit: Due to popular request, here is the aftermath:

I stood there with my jaw floored because of the situation my rectum had just created. After she stopped screaming, the girl started crying. 

I felt so incredibly bad at this point. I had nothing give her to wipe her face off. So she kept trying to wipe everything off her with just her hands. You know when you're in deep when your heartbeat becomes the loudest thing in your ears. 

As she ran out of the outhouse crying, I kept saying how sorry I was, then I realized my pants were still halfway down. 

I was left just listening to the rain in an outhouse that smelled so incredibly bad I almost puked after I had come to my senses. I went out and washed in the rain and wiped with some leaves I found.

When I got back the girl had woken up most of the team. The other girls were helping her wash her face with their water bottles. One look from all the girls, and I knew she had told them exactly what happened. I had messed up so bad. She had vomited all over the floor of the church, probably because she realized how covered she was.

The next morning I had apologized to her, and she sort of acknowledged me. I'm not sure how far sorry goes for taking a dump on someone's face. She left that day, and I felt like I had never truly made it up to her.

The feeling I get every time I sit on the pot is the worst part, as I am constantly reminded I have pooped on someone's face.

Tl;dr I got the worst stomach bug of my life. Then I went on a life or death sprint to the outhouse, didn't make it, and coated the current occupant in feces, which happened to be a girl."
"TIFU by overpacking and not securing my sex toys in my luggage


YIKES so this happened yesterday and I'm still trying to figure out what to do. So I'm studying abroad this quarter. Before going to my study abroad location, I went home for spring break, and left most of my study abroad luggage with my boyfriend. The plan was that during my layover (between home and college) he would bring my study abroad luggage to the airport and I could get on my merry way.

Now my luggage was already pretty overpacked when I left it with my boyfriend. But while at home I started to realize what life would actually be like without a boyfriend on hand, and so I asked the boy if he could pack my vibrator and dildo into one of my suitcases. Being the loving boyfriend that he is, he managed to shove them into the edge of one of the suitcases and force it closed again.

So he brings my stuff to the airport, we say bye and I fly away. Flight is fine and we land. I get to baggage claim, and that's when I find my suitcase spinning around the carousel, completely OPEN. I had overpacked so much that the zipper burst open while the crew was moving my stuff.

I spend the next 20 minutes running around the carousel picking up stray leggings, panties and bras, and leave once I feel like I've gathered most of my things. Already embarrassing, but it gets worse.

I get to my dorm and unpack everything, only to realize I can't find the dildo or vibrator. I text my boyfriend to check he packed it, and he did. So right now, somewhere in the airport, someone is cataloguing my sex toys in the airport lost and found, and I can't decide if I want to file a claim for them or not. Help.

**TLDR; Packed too much, suitcase bursts open at baggage claim carousel, my sex toys are MIA at the airport somewhere**"
"TIFU by destroying a marriage over Connect Four.


I'm gonna keep this short: me and a friend just lounging around, shooting the shit at his house for the weekend. Somebody left a connect four set on the dining room table, so we were mindlessly playing with not much else to do.

I was a little zoned out, but this fucker tried to cheat and put two checkers in at once while I was on my phone. **Nope, fuck you**.

I blurted out ""Not the first time you've tried to hide your cheating!"" which is true, because this guy loves to bend rules in his favorites whenever we have anything involving a competition. 

Unbeknownst to me, his wife was in the other room, and neither of us heard her go through the front door. She charges into the room, absolutely speechless, wanting to know what the fuck I just said. I tried to say it was just a joke, but apparently she was already suspicious since he had been coming home from work later than usual (a road he took was getting repaved, I can confirm he wasn't being a dick).

Fast forward a few weeks and now they are filing for a divorce. My friend said it wasn't my fault, but that she retaliated and cheated on him since she thought I really did spill the beans, resulting in the divorce.

TL:DR Female spy undercovers fake information; retaliates and starts nuclear war."
"TIFU by flipping over a piece of paper.


I was doing paperwork as one usually does at a sit on ass job, and flipped over a piece of paper. This piece of paper had a smaller piece of paper paper clipped to it. Being in a hurry, I was a little careless in my simple flip, and did it a little close to my face. In  mid flip, this smaller piece of paper decided to contort, and swirl around, heading straight for my face. BAM. PAPER-CUT ON MY FUCKING EYEBALL.  Not on my eye-lid, not right under or above my eye, ON MY EYEBALL.  And yes, it was absolutely a paper cut, and not just a poke in the eye. I heard the classic paper cut sound, where it sliced through whatever dares to get in it’s way. 

The pain was so intense, I almost shit myself. After about 10 minutes, my eye stops watering and I determine I’m not going to lose my eye.

Almost 8 hours later now, and it doesn’t hurt, just as long as I don’t blink, or move my eye at all.

I am now terrified of paper. 

TL;DR  I got a paper cut in my eyeball. Hurt really bad. Still hurts 8 hours later. "
"TIFU any trying to be a bro to a wild animal


Hello TIFU!  I am currently writing this from a bathtub,  on orders from my wife. 

This actually happened today, at around 1:30pm PST  

I am a carpenter by trade, and we don’t usually get wild animals on site due to the amount of noise being made. The odd dog, cat, or brave crow are not unusual. 

What was unusual today was one of my roofers (also neighbor) yelling at me that there is a skunk coming up behind me. Normally I’d just steer clear until the skunk got bored and ambled back into the woods. Not today though. 

I turned around to see a rather large skunk, trying to drink some water out of a puddle. This in and of itself is quite normal, as skunks still having figured out indoor plumbing, nor how to turn on a tap. The problem, for our little furry foul smelling friend, was the plastic peanut jar stuck on its head.   

Being the person I am, I vehemently hate skunks. I liken them to the possum, whose only purpose is to annoy, scare small children, and be eaten by larger predators. 

Yet, no matter how useless the creature is, I felt bad that this small woodland creature was either going to suffocate, or die of starvation, and no one deserves to go out like that. 

So, being the man of action I am, i grabbed my heavy rubber raincoat, while channeling my inner crocodile hunter (sans sweet accent) while the other guys were laughing, and Snapchatting the poor bugger. 

I crept up behind pepi le pew, and deftly swept my coat on top of him, and grabbed the little bastard by the neck started attempting to free him from his planters peanut prison. 

It was at this time I realized exactly what I was doing. I am a grown ass man, father of four, pinning down an animal known to be a carrier of diseases, and not known for the calm demeanor, nor temperament, and attempting to cut a plastic jar off of its head with one hand, using my rain coat to protect myself from getting sprayed, holding down the coat with my knees, while simultaneously trying to control the 15lbs stinking ball of fury with the other hand. 


After a few quick minutes of preying to the animal gods I managed to remove the offending object from the skunk, and this is where the fuck up happens. 

Like a white knight charging into rescue his princess, I flung the jar away, grabbed my coat and ran, careful to not get in contact with the skunk juice he had so kindly deposited upon my coat. I double bagged the coat, deposited it into our waste dumpster, and turned around to check on my patient. 

He seemed no worse for wear, was drinking as much water as he could, and I was hoping he would just mosey on over to the bushes, and disappear out of sight, instead, as a final thank you he turned his back to me raised his tail, and with precision that would make a sniper jealous, sprayed me from head to toe. 


Which is why, kind reader, I am currently in a bathtub, full of Campbell’s condensed tomato soup, and my wife has been kind enough to assist me by taking the kids to her mothers, and telling me to “figure it out” between giggling fits. But at least she brought a case of beer into the bathroom for me. 



Epilogue:  

The homeowner, while impressed at my selfless act, is upset because now her yard has the smell of skunk, and I left early. 

After apologizing I said “ma’am, with all due respect, if you had a jar stuck on your head, I’d throw a blanket over your ass so I didn’t get sprayed, and wrestle you down to ground to remove it. Would you rather have me hit you with a shovel to put you out of your misery?”  Needless to say, my foul attempt at humour was not well received. 

EDIT 8:00pm PST. 

Tomato soup (48 cans worth. What? We shop at Costco) did nothing. Currently doing a recipe from my MIL that she used on the dogs. Will update. 

EDIT 9:17pm PST. 

Used my MIL dog de-skunking recipe. Works quite well, still smell like r/trees. I’ve burnt my clothes, and drank 8 beer, kids are asleep, wife, still laughing. Also, when you burn clothes at night, in the backyard, in your own fire pit, while drinking beer, in your pajamas, it draws suspicion. 

Thanks for the gold, I hope my day of misfortune brought you happiness. 

TL;DR 

I tried to do a skunk a solid by removing a jar from its head, only to be repaid by being sprayed, while also sacrificing a nice rain coat, brand new carhart pants, and my company sweater, causing my loved ones to laugh and abandon me in my desperate time of need. "
"TIFU when I tried to take a quick shower


I’m laying on my couch right now. I should be asleep but I’m in pain as a result of my shameful clumsiness. I was running late for a date because I got off work late. I shot out a courtesy text, informing her that I needed to wash up. So, I hopped in the shower. I work in a shop that makes fiberglass products, and the itchiness of fiberglass shards is maddening. Needless to say, not showering wasn’t an option. I was trying to be quick, but I left my body wash in my gym bag. I could have got out if the shower to get it, but I chose not to. I used the bar soap that was already in the shower. I soaped myself super thoroughly, probably too thoroughly. I thought I felt something slimy on the bottom of my foot, but I figured it would wash off. As I stepped forward to grab the face wash, which was just out of reach, I slipped and fell backwards. There was a chunk of friggin soap on my heel. I grabbed the shower curtain but I was moving too fast and it just slipped between my fingers. You know that metal thing that you pull up to redirect the water? I fell on it. It penetrated me. Physically and spiritually. Probably Psychologically as well. I spent my “date” in the er. No stitches needed, but there is some localized swelling and bruising. Also, no sex for at least a week. I’m a dude.

TL;DR 

Slipped in the shower. Got poked in the b hole."
"TIFU By Going Out To My First College Party


**TL;DR**: Went to my first freshman college party, ended up getting arrested right outside my dorm, and had an incredibly interesting/shocking night in the drunk tank watching a guy go crazy. All of which could've been avoided if I just went to Chick-fil-A.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

*Preface: Not going to tell names, the school, the frat, or anything. Please don't ask.*

This happened my freshman year of college, so about 5 years ago.

It was the second week into the semester and I was super excited to start experiencing what I'd heard so much about in highschool, college parties.

Unfortunately for me, the only college parties going on so early in the semester were frat parties, meaning if you didn't have at least a 3 to 1 girl to guy ratio, you weren't getting in. Well, the girls would get in, but definitely not me.

I somehow managed to find 6 girls (I was with a friend of mine so the ratio needed to be doubled) and at around 11PM we headed for the party. Everything went smooth. We got in, we managed to make it to the drinks, and the night began.

I was doing all the usual male at a frat party things: playing some BP, dancing with a few ladies, and trying to make some friends. At one point, in search of new scenery, I made my way to the back of the house. I walked into a back room where I witnessed three girls. One is pissing in the sink, one is pissing in the corner, and one is pissing in the trashcan. It was at that point I decided it was time to go home.

I leave the party by myself after saying bye to my friend, and start to head back to my dorm that is no more than 10 minutes away. 

On my way back I have a HUGE inner battle with myself as to whether or not I should go to Chick-fil-A for some delicious foods, and in the end I decided against it. 

This was my mistake I later realized.

As I'm approaching the steps into my dorm, still buzzing from the party, I suddenly hear an authoritative voice behind me say, ""Excuse me sir!"" 

Immediately I think, *aw shiiiiit*.

I turn around to see a chubby police officer briskly walking towards me. Here's how the conversation went:

Police Officer (PO): How are you doing tonight son? I've been following you for a bit and noticed you're stumbling occasionally. Have you had anything to drink tonight?

Me (heart racing now, young and naive, trying to hope that honesty is the best policy): Honestly, I did sir. But I don't believe I was stumbling. I was attending my first party here actually, but I'm about to head off to bed for the night I promise. I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

PO: Unfortunately young man, I can't let you do that. I'm going to have to ask you to please take this breathalyzer. If you refuse, I'll take you down to the station and you can do it there, your choice.

Me: (Thinking this really isn't a freaking choice). Sir, are you being serious? I'm literally only 2 minutes from my bed, I'm going to go to sleep and not hurt or bother anyone. I swear!

PO: I'm sorry son, but rules are rules. If I let you go I'll have to let everyone else go too. But I'll tell you what, since I'm feeling generous, if you can call one of your buddies **who is completely sober**, I will allow them to come pick you up and escort you to your room.

Me: (In my head I'm like, WOW, this guy is a complete dick...). Okay officer, thank you for the opportunity. (Again in my head, FML! All my friends are wasted right now it's freaking Friday come on!).

I proceed to call 6 of my friends, none of which answered. 

Lucky me. 

At this point, my phone falls to my side and I look at the policeman, who by now has taken my ID and everything, with a face of utter defeat and despair. He takes this as his cue, and asks me to turn around and put my hands behind my back.

PO: I'm really sorry to have to do this to you buddy. Tell you what, since you were being so respectful and honest, I'll only charge you with drunk in public, not drunk in public and possession of alcohol underage.

Me: (In my head, OH THANKS, you're such a freaking saint!). Thanks.

I get thrown in the back of his cruiser, cuffs incredibly too tight, and we ride for a half hour to the station. I get the whole 9 yards and tossed into the drunk tank, but not before the police officers took the sweatshirt I was wearing, because they thought I would use the strings to kill myself or fellow drunk tankers apparently.

If you've never been in a DT, it's **COLD**. I had two tank mates, a guy who's just passed tf out snoring loud as hell, and a larger male who began making friends with me. 

Skipping most of the downtime where we just sat in silence, at one point an officer came to the door and said, ""How are you dumbasses doing?"" to which my new large friend responded, ""Hey ass hat, give this lil dude his sweatshirt back! God damn pigs! He's freezing!"" (Nice guy I thought). 

Officer says no, obviously, and then we are given food. My first prison meal! Milk, a square of cornbread, a slice of ham, mashed potatoes, and some peas. I ate the cornbread and drank the milk, but my larger friend requested, maybe slightly demanded, my ham. I gave it to him without a fight.

After this, I thought the night was over and I was hoping to pass out. Nope. My larger friend ended up nudging me as I was fading out and told me to look across the hall to the other drunk tank. There was a man all alone in there, curled up in the fetal position. That's weird, I thought, but I don't give a crap to be honest, so I tried to drift off again.

My larger friend nudged me again and said, ""Yo check out this crazy ass dude!"" Now being slightly more alert, I focus on the guy across the hall. Here's what this guy did, no joke:

He's stirring around a bit, twitching here and there, when he suddenly starts yelping. Then this dude stands up, strips off all of his clothes, and starts to yell-sing some inaudible song. He's spinning in a helicopter motion, arms all the way to his sides, and then he starts pissing! All over! Everywhere! I'm like, holy crap this dude is wild! 

It gets worse.

Once the dude is done giving that DT a golden shower, he changes from sing-yelling to yell-chanting, and starts PUNCHING THE WALLS. Real ass punches too, this guy was not fuggin around. Soon his knuckles are a bloody mess and he's covering the walls with them. He starts drawing things and writing chicken scratch. 

Me and my new friend are speechless and wide eyed looking from the dude, to each other, to the dude again the whole time. Then a guard comes to the other guy's window.

PO (to the naked dude): What in the FUCK is going on here!?!? Your dumb ass is cleaning ALL of that shit up!

Naked Guy: (Swear to God) Puts his thumbs in his ears and gives the cop a long raspberry (I don't know how to explain this if you don't know what I mean by raspberry, motor boating with your tongue??). 

Cop bangs his fist on the window real hard.

PO: HEY!! YOU THINK I'M FUCKING JOKING HERE PAL?!?!

Naked Guy: (His expression goes from crazy guy with nobody home upstairs, to sudden realization and panic). WHERE AM I!? WHY AM I IN HERE?! WHO ARE YOU!? LET ME OUT OF HERE!!! 

And he proceeds to bang the glass, covering it with even more blood. It was at this point that I think I decided it was time to check out for the night. I looked at my new friend, shook my head in disbelief, and we agreed it was time to try and sober up.

Next morning, I'm moved from the DT to a holding cell with, believe it or not, one of the frat brothers at the party I went to. We're both held until around 3PM, when a cop FINALLY comes to take us back. I get dropped off at the courthouse and end up having to walk 3 miles back to my dorm.

What. A. Freaking. Night. 

I ended up transferring by the end of the year and the charges were eventually expunged.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

Edit: Chick-fil-A. SORRY PEOPLE!

Edit 2: Before this potential storm hits: I **DID NOT** post this to criticize or shame our police force. I posted it, because on that day, I fugged up. I'm not mad about it, the charges got expunged, and I strongly believe a majority of our police men and women are very good people, with a few bad apples giving them a bad name. As we all know, bad news makes headlines whereas good news is often overlooked and underappreciated. 

Edit 3: I moved TL;DR to the top because ""that's where it's supposed to go."" And, admittedly, my story length is the reason TL;DR was invented. lul

"TIFU By inviting a date to a comedy show for which I was a bartender


So I had this girl I met on tinder a few weeks ago and we talk our way into a date. It was amazing and everything. The moment came to find a time in our busy schedules for a second date that was a week later. The time goes by and we talk every day and everything looks like a dream (meh I might be seeing the world with some pink glasses).   The day we were supposed to meet I get a call from my boss where I am a bartender that someone got sick and there is no way I can refuse to replace him.   So I manage to at least get her a ticket for the show since I know she really like this comedian and that my bartending shift is going to end about 20 min after the start of the show.   My plan was to get over with my work and join her for the rest of it.  


Now where it gets tricky... She asked me if she could invite a friend to join her for the show. My first thought was that it was not a problem since I could get the extra ticket easily.   Now before you tell me that I am an idiot... We are both French speakers... So when she told me 'J'ai une amie qui aime bien cet humoriste. Peux-tu lui avoir un billet aussi' [I have a friend (FEMALE) that love this comedian could you get an extra ticket for her] my answer was a pure yes... Why not.

Well here what really happened. She used the extra ticket to bring a date of her own and they both left kissing eachother at the end of the show while I was slowly chugging down my gin and tonic as a sign of desperation....


TLDR: I had to cancel a date with a girl because a colleague got sick at work. I got her a ticket for the show I was working for to join her  mid-show. She tells me her friend wants to come and instead she brings an other date and I ended up having one hell of a shitty night. "
"TIFU by letting my best friend join me on a date and I ended up third wheeling them


Dear Reddit, today, I fucked up.

My friends and I decided to go out partying as it was one of my friend's birthday. I ended up losing them in the club so I went outside and I saw other people I knew but there was this guy that I didn't know with them. So I got to meet him and we kind of spent the night together alone somewhere near the club. We ended up making out and I could tell he was interested in me so he asked me to meet another day. 

So we get to this day, my best friend and I went to the gym together and we made plans but then he texted me and said he could meet later in the evening and I wasn't going leave my friend because that would be rude as we made plans. The thing is I've been talking to her about him telling her that he was cute and that I really liked him. So she asked if she could come and maybe he could bring some of his friends which tbh I didn't really want her to come as I wanted it to be just us two. I asked him if he rather meet another day as I was with my friend but he didn't mind her coming. I thought this meant he was going to bring another friend along.

It ended up just being us three so we hung and I was feeling kind of uncomfortable and awkward as I notice Harry wasn't paying much attention to me and he was being very friendly to my best friend. I also noticed he barely looked at me but I thought I was being paranoid and I didn't want to be jealous. I ended up backing up a bit and being more distant because my friend was putting her head on him and shit like that. Basically, I was just there listening to their convos and he was showing her pics on his phone.

When we went back home, I was telling her how I felt unsure about what happened and that I couldn't tell anymore if he was interested or not. She told me he tried to hold her hand but apparently, she wasn't sure and she told me she couldn't tell either if he was interested. 

Today I decided to text him and get an answer as I thought it was kind of unfair on me. I also found out he texted her and I asked him what was going on and he told me that he liked my friend better... Obviously, I told him to f*ck off the nice way as I didn't want to be immature about it.

I don't know what to do I feel kind of betrayed and mad at my best friend as I know that she thinks he is cute but I also know that it's not her fault in a way. What do you think I should do?? 

TL;DR Went on a date and my best friend joined me ended up ruining it for me and got his attention. Don't know what to do but learned my lesson...

EDIT: I actually saw my friend after all this happened even though I didn't feel like meeting up with her. Now we are fine, I guess I'll let it pass. She apologized for the situation and asked me that if I was not okay with them talking that she wouldn't do it. She also told me that she values our friendship more than any guy. 

I agree also with some comments that mentioned that the guy didn't belong to me and so on but man he could at least be respectful about it. I appreciated his honesty though."
