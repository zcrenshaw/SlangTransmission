"TIFU by not telling my wife our son was coming home


This happened Sunday night.



My oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



I get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



We discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......



I walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



What i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



So no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



So my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.




TL;DR  Didn't tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game



edit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

Update: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    Son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

"TIFU by using my roommate's ""toy"" NSFW


My roommate and I are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others' ""bedside drawers"" (need condoms, lube, etc.) As far as I know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. My roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and I am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. 

Due to improper planning, I ran out of personal lubricant so I took a visit to my roommate's drawer to see if he had some. He did, as well as some other things. One of those things was what I can only describe as a [triple cock-ring] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3178JrK6a1L._SY355_.jpg) contraption.
For context, my roommate is a 6'2 black guy and I'm a 5'10 ginger. Naturally, I assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. I was woefully wrong.

I was in the mood so I didn't think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. Almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, I realized my horrible mistake. 

Within 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. As with any bad situation, I figured my best way out was to power through. I took the aforementioned lube and went to town.

After what felt like a lifetime, I began to approach climax. For my trouble, I was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. Again, I was wrong. 

Instead of a powerful release, I was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. This thing was so tight that there was NO ejaculate. I freaked out.

I figured once I got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, I was wrong.

The caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.
I continued to freak out. I didn't want to go to the ER and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so I did the next logical thing. 

I filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. After 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that I could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.
After another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, I went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what I assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.

2/10 Do not try.

TL;DR: Use a flexible cock ring, and don't be racist"
"TIFU by getting school canceled for the day for my whole school


Unlike some posts, this actually did happen today. Just a few hours ago actually. 

I get to school in the morning, first period goes by and its just any other day. I get to my second period gym class, and I noticed there were little drips coming out of the sprinklers that protect us in case of a fire.

I notice a few drops come out every couple of seconds, so I think that this cannot be that hard to fix. I start messing around with it, twisting it, and pulling it a little. After playing with it for about 15 seconds, it falls off and the fire alarm goes off. 

I start panicking because I think it was my fault, so I run out of the locker room and tell my gym teacher. He says just come outside and we will discuss it in a minute. Cue 5 minutes later a few police cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance en route. We come to find that there is not a fire, but the firemen find out that the sprinkler system now has problems.

After talking to my gym teacher, they go look in the locker room and sure enough my sprinkler is the one that caused it. Not only did firemen and the other emergency services show up, but the sprinklers are damaged and we have to shut down school to fix it.

They evacuate all students to our football stadium, and then they decide that they are going to put everyone on buses, or those who can drive can drive themselves home. They canceled school for the rest of the day, because of me messing with a sprinkler.

TL;DR I messed with the sprinklers on the ceiling to try and fix it, fire alarm goes off, school gets canceled for the day.

EDIT: Lots of people in the comments are saying that it was dumb of me to mess with, so I will just point out a few things I missed in the post. Someone had put a gym lock on it and ripped it down with made the thing a little loose, and I noticed it was leaking just a tiny bit. I thought I could make it tight and screw it back into place. Yeah probably not my best move and should leave it to others next time but hey this is TIFU for a reason"
"TIFU by hiding a murderous clown in my roommate's closet


This happened a few years ago, long before the resurgence of IT...

My mom is an artist and made me an assortment of life sized Halloween decorations. A 12 foot tall grim reaper, with scythe, a bandage wrapped mummy and... a 6 foot tall, stocky, murderous clown. This creature was the source of nightmares. It had crazy clown hair, dead eyes and held a decapitated head in one hand. 

Both my roommate and I hated this clown. I had nightmares about it crawling up the stairs to murder me in my sleep. So it was normally stored, in a corner of the basement, facing the wall. 

One night, I was feeling particularly pranksterish, so I hauled the clown out of the basement, and positioned it in my roommate's closet. The closet had sliding doors, so when you opened the door, the clown would fall out. 

I took some fishing line, tied a bell to the end, placed it in the closet, and wrapped the rest out of her room, down the hallway and into my room. And waited.

She comes home, goes to bed... 

And I wait.

Around 2 am, I start pulling on the fishing line, making the bell jingle. 

She got up, expecting one of my cats to have trapped themselves in her closet, flings open the door... 

And the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard filled the house.

She moved out shortly after. 

TL;DR Hid life sized clown in my roommate's closet. Needed to find new roommate. "
"TIFU by calling 911 on my hedgehog.


A little background context for the story: I'm a medic. Also 22w pregnant. 

So, let me tell y'all the story of how I answered the door, wet, butt naked, in a towel to the police about an hour ago because of my damn hedgehog. Oh, I'm hormonal too, so my mind is a little insane and I'm jumpier than usual. 

I'm just sitting in my bubblebath, warm, content, Himalayan pink bath salt, Lush bath bomb fizzing, sipping my prego concoction of cranberry juice and sprite (minus alcohol, obvs). Hair put up, face mask on, facebooking, playing Candy Crush (is that still a thing?) you get the point. Netflix playing Criminal Minds on the iPad sitting on the toilet. Nibbling some fruit. The baby is sitting so far back in my uterus that I'm already getting terrible back aches, so this soak is pretty routine. Being a medic and lifting all the time, (I usually work the bariatric crew) I am toootally in the zone up in this bath. 

Anyway, I start hearing some crashes. They sound like they're coming from the other side of the house. First one, okay, no big deal, dishes in the rack probably fell over, or the washer was banging on the wall. It does that sometimes. No biggie. 

Second crash, a few minutes later- okay, what the hell is that. I'm over here thinking me or my husband left the door unlocked or something. (Husband is at work right now, also on the ambulance, 40ish miles away... We have old fashioned gates and bars around our house, the only way to get in is if someone leaves it open or you have loud cutters.) I got home this morning from my shift just as my husband was walking out the door to leave for his. I had woken up sore all over and decided to eat and take a bath, I hadn't been out of the house yet. We've never left the doors or gates unlocked though. 

I hear more commotion and noise, I'm immediately convinced it's TOTALLY a person, I'm shaking and high key flipping shit. I hop out of the tub and dial 911, asking for a rapid PD response because I think someone is in my house. My dumbass goes to hide in Nick the Prick's room. (Adjacent to the bathroom I was in.) My mind and adrenaline went from nothing to EVERYTHING in .023 seconds. Straight up fight-or-flight mode. 

I was being as quiet as possible, until I heard another loud crash. From right next to me. Nick was trashing his cage, flinging his bed/wheel/bowls everywhere, echoing in the empty room, down the hallway, (all wood and tile floors, EVERYTHING echoes- we were rearranging furniture and stuff making room for the nursery, that end of the house was virtually empty save his spot/cage in the spare room.) And it hits me. 

Nobody is inside my house. It's my damn hedgehog throwing a temper tantrum. 

Gates were locked and secured, doors and windows were locked and secured, my car was sitting snugly in my driveway. Answered the door to PD half crying, half laughing, soap in my hair and still dripping wet. 

Long story short, PD wasn't even mad, they thought it was hilarious. (Still checked my house and perimeter anyway, to be triple sure.) I'm embarrassed as hell, and someone needs to have a drink for me tonight. They all thought the little bastard was adorable. He is. He knows he's a little shit, too. 

TL;DR: Thought someone was breaking in. Nearly had my hedgehog arrested. Will never live down the embarrassment of my hogtruder. 

[Older pics of my lap cactus I posted for another thread.](https://imgur.com/a/oCBTy)

Edit: To keep this in TIFU fashion (apparently this post was a grey area), I also have to add that I have an $800 ambulance bill (the irony, I know!) because I have a heart condition and the whole anxiety of it gave me chest pain. They wanted to get me checked out, I got hooked up to the monitor, everything was cool, I still refused to go to the hospital but still got saddled with the bill. Hoping it'll be reduced via my company (this was the discounted rate!) and I won't actually have to pay $800 for my hoggle's temper tantrum. My embarrassment should be plenty payment enough..."
"TIFU by accidentally recreating the first World War at work.


At the warehouse where I work we have a waste oil burner. We dump all of the waste oil into a 250 gallon tank which pumps up to the burner. The burner is a giant heating unit, basically it burns oil and heats the entire the warehouse.

I had just gotten there in the morning, and was the only person there. It was cold as hell too. I noticed that there were some new cases of oil in the ""suitable oil"" bin. This just looked like standard 15w-40 So I went ahead and dumped it in.

Oh boy, I couldn't have been more wrong. I can only assume that someone was to lazy to get two containers for different chemicals and decided to give it to us anyway. Turns out it was chlorinated brakekleen mixed with oil. I don't even know how you'd mix the two, or why?!?

So that's no big deal right? It will just vaporize the chlorine and everything will be alright, right? We have filters for this kind of thing.

Sure, that would have been all fine and dandy, until I put some oil in that contained some sort of acid. See, one of the reasons you get an oil change is that there's a lot of acid buildup in your engine and motor oil combats said acid. Under normal wear and tear most of this acid is nutrilized, but what I just poured in was most certainly not a ""normal wear and tear"" situation.

Seconds after I poured the acid into the tank I started to get horrid chest pain, started coughing profusely, and wanted to remove my lungs from my body. 

/r/TodayILearned, when chlorine is mixed with acid, it makes chlorine gas, which in the slightest amount can severely ruin your day.

Keep in mind the pump is still running at this point, so it proceeds to send this mixture to the burner.
I guess our filters don't do much in the way of chlorine gas after all, so it got pumped into the entire warehouse.

After some good ventilation and a call to my boss, they are now changing all of the filters on the burner and cleaning it. Hopefully it's not completely destroyed because one can only imagine how expensive one of these systems is.

My lungs feel like I just took a bong rip of bear mace and I'm more than likely not going to be working here much longer.

TL;DR accidentally made a toxic gas and pumped it into my work.

"TIFU by trying to take on everything a Vietnamese chef threw at me.


This happened today - about four hours ago, in fact - so I'm still feeling the side-effects of my ill-advised bravado and hiding under my bedclothes regretting everything that has led me to my perpetual goal of trying to ""spice up my life."" I'll start from the beginning.  
  
Where I live, on the East Coast of Straya, you're spoilt for choice if your tastebuds tingle at the thought of meat pies, prawns for the barbie, or if you're just cray-cray for crayfish. And while I have all my life gone ga-ga for Gold Coast cuisine, about four years ago I had the fortune of discovering what is now my favourite dish in the world - Pho, a traditional Vietnamese soup. Because I first ate this in a hole-in-the-wall ghetto in Kreuzberg, I was well aware that I hadn't found my golden goose, and since then I have been on an eternal search for the perfect Pho. I haven't found it yet, but there's a winner of a Granny-and-Gramps home-run Vietnamese restaurant that does a 9/10 for just $14 (that'll hardly buy you a decent Maccas Down Under), and by lord if I haven't been there at least twice a month with old mate since I found it.  
  
I haven't always loved spicy food. And if you think you can see where this is going, no it's not your traditional ""white-boi-eats-spicy-food-and-shits-fire"" story. I didn't grow up with it, but I love to cook and experiment and recently I've gotten so comfortable (read: arrogant) in the kitchen that I consider(ed) myself a bit of a hothead for the red thunder. I'll go out and pick chillies off my neighbours plants (with permission of course) and I grow my own at home. Came across some Carolina Reapers in my supermarket a few months back, bought em, tried em, LOVED THEM. I'm not going to argue the science over whether it's endorphins or natural highs or anything like that, but eating those little bastards makes me feel amazing, and by golly do I chase that feeling.  
  
So the last few months, old mate, her boyfriend and I have gone to this restaurant many times and each time I politely request that the Pho makes me ""cry at the table, sweat out of my clothes, and beg for forgiveness"", or some variation thereof. Each time, old mate and I cry, moan, eat quickly and tip well, but looks like I crossed the line tonight when I asked for ""the hottest Pho this kitchen has ever made."" (I think this is the specific point of where ""I fucked up""). When asked if I wanted fresh or dry (aka hotter) chillies on the side, I asked for both, as I normally do.
  
So the Pho is served in these huge bowls with the small plates of chilli, beansprouts, and other aromatics alongside, and boy does it smell good. But my chillies aren't served on the normal black mini-plate - they've come in a small bowl, and are coated with a thin dark sauce. I think nothing of it (how bad can it be? LOL) and dump them all right in there. Old mate tries some of the sauce on her finger after I point it out and I'm not sure if she needed an excuse for another Vodka Tonic, but she sure went and got one after that. Confident I could put her ""I'm-Indian-and-you're-white-therefore-I-can-handle-spice-and-you-can't"" argument in the ground for good, I dig in, and BY GOLLY it's hot. I ask the waitress what's up with the sauce, and she says the words I'll never forget;
  
   **""The chef made that up just for you. We don't serve it to the public.""**   
  
Elated by the fact that I could now crown myself as the regular spice-king-hothead of this lovely little restaurant (and my chilli high was coming on) I smash down the whole bowl, with not a drop of water for the duration. I was sweating by the third mouthful, tears by the fourth, but I made it through (helped by the chilli numbing my mouth) and happily ordered the banana fritters with ice cream for dessert.   
  
But before they got there, the pain started. As the ""high"" wore off, and that familiar *HEAT* started moving down my chest, I became deeply uncomfortable. It was like watching the last episode of How I Met Your Mother - you know something's about to happen, and it's probably about to be pretty shit. I ordered two bottles of water and smashed them down, but unfortunately we were past the face/mouth stage and I had capsaicin about to nuke my stomach. I ducked out of the restaurant and bombed over to the gas station, where I managed to smash down two bottles of good ol' Breaka Choccy Milk before I'd even paid for them. Next visit: the Domino's toilet.  
  
So there I was, sitting on the Domino's toilet with what felt like Ragnaros and Deathwing having an flame-filled orgy in my chest. I couldn't shit; I didn't need to shit, so I knew the only option was to weather the pain. Stepped outside, lit a smoke (fight fire with fire, amirite?) but to no comfort. I was at the mercy of the Vietnamese overlords, and oh golly do I regret ever trifling with them. This was no indigestion; no ""bad tummies for spaggies"", but a combination of ""you may have ulcerated your colon"" topped off with a nice helping of ""you've necked so much Breaka you feel physically ill."" 
  
About thirty seconds after that I offered my finest artistic work to date - a spraypaint of the back pavement of Zaraffas (think Starbucks) with ""Dinner; a rendition by DrinkingSpaghetti (2017)"" and now four hours on, the immense discomfort has finally begun to subside. I have taken off my imaginary fucking medal that I awarded myself for finishing ""the hottest Pho ever served at Grammy and Gramps"" and thrown it in the imaginary fucking dumpster. I will of course, return next week, and allow the staff to mock me and offer the chef my praises. Going to the doctor's tomorrow to make sure that I haven't permanently damaged my body.   

**EDIT**: Cheers for all your concern boys and girls, I've been fine all day! Due to popular demand, the restaurant is called Can Tho Kitchen and is in Runaway Bay on the Gold Coast, NEAR Harbour Town. Mods didn't delete my comment where I detailed this so I assume it's okay. Bookings are a must, they do 2 seatings a night and the Pho really is the best thing on the menu. It's really affordable as well. 10/10 my fave restaurant around here. Maybe I'll see some of you there next weekend! 
  
**TL;DR** white boi may have ulcerated stomach due to a lack of respect for a plant that is used in concentrated doses in surgeries to permanently deaden nerves .

"TIFU by trying to surprise my boyfriend and accidentally waxing my lady parts shut


Part of this story did actually happen today, contrary to TIFU norms

About a week ago my boyfriend had been a bit uncomfortable during sex because of the newly grown hair that arises from waxing (similar to 5 o' clock shadow but in the nether regions), so I decided a wax would be the best way to solve the issue because it rips out all the follicles and forces the hair to start from square one again
Problem is I'm frugal to say the least, so I decide that doing it myself would be best. First mistake.
I go to the shops and buy a pot of hot wax, not seeing it's the non-microwaveable kind. I take it home, open it up and see a metal mug of this browny-yellow stuff and a popsicle stick. I'm not a complete idiot and I know that metal+microwave=bad idea, so I put it on the hob and let it melt.

Once it's all melted I bring it to the bathroom, disrobe and start waxing. All is going well until the pot of wax solidifies before I've done half the job.

""Not a problem"" I think to my lazy self

""I'll just get some wax strips tomorrow instead, those worked way better last time""
Second mistake.

I'm back in the bathroom with my patchy day-old half wax. I take the wax strip and get to work. It's more painful than I remember but I persist, hell bent on completing the deforestation.
I notice that the wax isn't coming off but sticking to the hair, so I coat the waxy areas in baby powder and try remove that wax with more wax.
Third mistake.

After using more than half the pack of wax strips I give up and decide a hot bath will calm my nerves and dull my pain receptors. Little did I know that the bath would melt the leftover wax just enough to get my labia to stick together. Since I wasn't too keen on going through any more pain, I just accepted my fate, coated my lady bits in even more baby powder and slunk to my room where I proceeded to grab my phone and google ""remove wax from skin painlessly""

As I type this I am applying olive oil to the aforementioned area in an attempt to unstick myself and regain some pride

tl;dr I tried waxing myself, took a bath that melted the stubbornly skin-bound wax and ended up sticking my outer labia together

EDIT: It didn't take long for the wax to break down and it got sorted out in about 15 minutes"
"TIFU by getting sleep paralysis in public and subsequently letting out a battle cry.


Theres a nice little corner in our union (a hub like building) on my college campus where I go to study inbetween classes, but more often, outright sleeping on the comfy chairs there and getting absolutely fuck all done, which was today's case.

Also, I get sleep paralysis very often since I enter REM sleep very quick. I'm so used to it by now and it usually only happens when I take long naps during the day. My solution is usually to either wait it out or act out like I'm ""screaming"" to make my body controllable again. I dunno, it works, even though I don't actually scream.

So I wake up from this scholarly nap, but I can't move or see, only hear other people talking and moving around. Suddenly, I hear one of them mention the time, ""11:24""...**Shit, I have class in 6 minutes and it's nowhere near the union...**

Not waiting this shit out, I act out my usual silent battle cry of slumber, but what came out was a fully fledged ""NYAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"", echoing through the entire building. I'm instantly woke up completely now, and I see a girl fling her coffee behind me to the floor, with a room full of people staring at me wondering what the fuck is going on. I bailed the hell out of there... 

TL:DR Fell asleep in public, and dragonborn'd the shit out of a girl's coffee.

Update: Seeing my post explode this morning literally cured my hangover. "
"TIFU by getting banned for life from my local supermarket


This happened about 15 years ago but I was just reminded of it today.

I got banned for life from my neighborhood supermarket once.

I had bought a bunch of stuff and when I got to the checkout realized I'd forgotten my wallet. I only lived a few blocks away and they knew me so the cashier said she'd just walk home with me and I'd give her the money and I was like OK sure. I did exactly that and I thought everything was kosher then the next time I went the manager kicked me out. Apparently she'd just pocketed the money and told the manager I stiffed her and he believed her. I was never allowed to shop there again.

I had even left my pager there (back then this was like leaving your iPhone, I carried one because i worked as a sysadmin) so they wouldn't think I was trying to scam them. I never got it back.

You may notice some flaws in my thought processes - it's because I was high as a kite when this happened.

[TL;DR got banned from my local supermarket for letting a cashier scam me out of $100 worth of groceries because I was high]

[Edit - I didn't just go get my wallet from my house because they were about to close and there wasn't time, and the cashier assured me it was no problem]

[Edit 2 - As people pointed out I misspoke when I said I got scammed out of the groceries - the cashier scammed the store out of them and I got blamed]"
