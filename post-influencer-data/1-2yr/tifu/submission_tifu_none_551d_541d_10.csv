"TIFU by accidentally committing theft as a Police Officer in full uniform.


Poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. This happened a few weeks ago.

I woke up one morning at 5:00 A.M. tired as fuck. I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.

I started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST"". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

My vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

At about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said ""I need to talk to you at the department.""

Oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant's office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, ""Close the door"". At this point I knew this wasn't good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.

After a preface from my Sergeant, he says, ""Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

I didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito."" Then I just heard ""Guess what, that's theft.""

After a ""Come to Jesus"" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn't want to press charges.

Although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

On a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me ""The Burrito Burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.

Tl;dr: I'm a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it."
"TIFU by embarrassing myself in front of the whole school


It's been awhile since I've graduated but I still haven't been able to live this down. It was the annual talent show for our high school. Every student had to attend the show as an audience including me so I thought it might be a great opportunity for me to show the whole school that I am a funny rebellious kid and they should l love me. 

I spent weeks planning it, I would run up the stage and tell my very own written joke. It all seemed so great in my head. Everyone would be bored out of their minds at the performance and I would save the day by making everyone laugh and cheer. Then the time came. It was a normal average singing performance by one of the senior girl. Crowd was quiet, so I assumed they were bored. I got up from the crowd, ran up the fucking stage like Kanye West, stole the mic from the poor girl who just wanted to sing. And at the top of my fucking lungs I shouted. ""Hello everyone, I am Shake..Spear"" while doing masturbation gesture. Nobody laughed.Nobody cheered. I got suspended for a 2 days and detention for a whole month. And 6 years of hell. 

TL:DR I delivered a bad pun in front of my whole school resulting in suspension and detention.  "
"TIFU By Busting My Clit Open


So this fuck up happened a few nights ago, and I‚Äôm still in pain.

So in less than two years my husband and I have had two beautiful and very big babies. They‚Äôre adorable and I love them so much, but our sex life became very sparse due to my lack of libido (thanks breastfeeding) and the major fact that my body took a major hit from carrying 10lb babies back to back. 

So late one night whilst browsing Amazon, I came across [this massager wand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GXONRK6/ref=mp_s_a_1_16_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1520447056&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=massager+wand) . I looked at the reviews and found that it was useful for sore muscles and several women claimed it was great for other regions of use for pleasure. I thought maybe this is what I needed to get my sex drive back in motion. 

So fast forward to last night, and I start to use this wand on my clit and notice that its a little too intense, so I turned down the speed, but that was even more intense as it felt like a harder vibration and started to really hurt. I put it back up to the highest vibration and kept it there as it did start to feel good, but also still hurt. Well my husband and I start having sex while I‚Äôm still using this thing and IT. FEELS. AMAZING. After 20 or so ‚Äúyes yes yes yes‚Äù ‚Äòs we both finished and I staggered off to the bathroom to clean the wand.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it, blood all over the head of the wand. I start to panic, then I inspect my clitoral area and find the skin on and around my clit is busted open. I‚Äôm crying while blotting it with toilet paper and asking myself why I ever bothered with this stupid wand. Now I‚Äôm in pain and too embarrassed to phone a doctor about it.


tl/dr: Ignored pain a massager wand caused me, busted skin on and around my clit open. 

Edit: Well shit, this kind of blew up! 

Edit: Thank you for all the (mostly) kind words! I‚Äôve never had so much love put upon my clit before üòÇ 

Edit: Originally posted this the other day, but it was removed due to the ‚Äúweekend rule‚Äù so I saved it and resubmitted on the weekend, and forgot I put ‚Äúfast forward to last night.‚Äù 

Edit: Front Page! For my clit.....from my clit? I‚Äôm tired, going to bed now! Thank you so much guys and gals! 

Final Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger! And thank you to most of you that have been so kind! To the others, well, I‚Äôm not a fat slob pig üòÇ sorry to disappoint you! "
"TIFU by trying to have a dating life


Boys, let me start by saying that I am a fuck up and also one of the most unlucky guys in history .... Here is my legendary prowess with girls displayed in its magnificence. So this week, I worked hard on tinder. I was on it like gravy on poutine and for about 1 1/2 weeks I tried using all of my ''like'' bank every day. Match match / talk talk ... I managed to get into a good place with 2 girls; we'll call them Marie and Margaret .... 2 beautiful girls, both seem fun to hang out with. The problem is that I have no improvisation game so I made a plan, a template of sorts, and I use the same kind of conversation topics/jokes for each girls, as usual. Fortunately, my plan is good and it makes me look like a good / funny guy who is real dateable so I use it on the 2 m's ... I managed to close and according to the plan I have a casual date Friday night with Margaret and Monday night with Marie (Ma favorite she was really of my taste) ... Dudes, I have not had any formal action with a girl for about a year; Not even a spicy conversation so I tell myself that more opportunity = more possibility. At worst, I grab a beer with a nice girl, have a good conversation, practice my social skills and go home alone; At best, it works and I find myself a girlfriend.... Now comes the juicy part... I ask Margaret if it's ok if we grab a drink at the local bar very casually after her work but Marie texts me suddenly saying this: ""Okkkk we won't be up for the date anymore. When you date several girls at the same time make sure they do not know each other! "".............. Fuck me sideways, they are roommates ...I have been having the same conversation/jokes with both of them at the same time. Now I feel small in my shorts and I'm going to masturbate while drinking tequila until I sleep tonight. Ashamed and sad, I think i deserved it this time; Cheers!

**TL;DR I tried to have 2 tinder dates with 2 separate girls on 2 separate nights, turns out they are roomates**

"TIFU By Cleaning My Ears


This being my second post ever, I'm prepared for it to disappear into oblivion, but the more I think about it, the more I realize this sub would be incomplete without it.

(obligatory this was several months ago)

I've got waxy-ass ears. Every time a doctor checks them out, I get a ""tsk, awful lot of wax in there."" Like yeah dude, I fucking know, but I'm not supposed to q-tip that shit, so what do you want from me? Like it's some kind of personal moral failing. But I digress. Once a year or so, I pour some hydrogen peroxide in there to deal with the issue (on the off chance anyone reads this, don't lose your damn minds. I've had doctors suggest I do this, doctors who say not to do it, and doctors who look at me like I'm fucking crazy. My takeaway is that it works for me and medical science might not know all there is to know about waxy-ass ears). The peroxide bubbles away for awhile, then I flip over on to that ear to let it drain while I do the other side. It's great.

So I have my SO help me with the procedure by pouring in the peroxide. He expresses some misgivings, being unfamiliar with the plight, but gamely helps me out. All goes well, I put the bottle to the side, and we go to sleep.

Fast forward several hours. I wake up, reach over, grab my water bottle, unscrew the cap, and take a big ol gulp. As I'm in the middle of taking my next gulp, it dawns on me. I don't have a water bottle next to my bed - I have a glass. In that half-second I realize what I've done, and leap from bed with a mouthful of hydrogen peroxide. I spit into the bathroom sink and take a long hard look in the mirror. Fuck. I'm feeling the bubbles work their way down my esophagus into my tum. It does not feel good. It is burny. And bubbly. I try to make myself throw up - not happening. I realize this might be one of those things where you *don't* want to throw up the poison you just drank, to avoid further damage. I go to the fridge. I drink a shit ton of cashew milk, cause that's what we've got. I eat a glob of peanut butter, thinking the peroxide might attach to that rather than the lining of my stomach (I don't fucking know man, it was 3am and I was freaking out).

Realizing I was gonna be up and down a lot, I move my pillow and blanket to the couch. I do some Googling. I'm probs not gonna die, says the internet. I haven't drank enough and it's the very diluted kind, as opposed to the sort of diluted kind. This knowledge is only vaguely comforting, as my entire insides were on fire. I eventually fall into a fitful sleep. An hour of so later, my SO realizes I'm not in bed and comes to see what's up. ""I drank peroxide."" No really grasping wtf that meant, he tells me to come back to bed and I do. I move a pillow on the bed and as I do it bursts, covering our bed in a layer of feathers. Having reached peak ""what the fuck"" for one night, we put a blanket down over the feathers and go the fuck back to bed.

My next several days were spent cleaning feathers and pooping tar. Very cheap cleanse that I do not recommend.

TL;DR - cleaned my ears, drank peroxide, shit unholy blackness for awhile. Also fun feather pillow denouement.

Edit: Thank you for all of the ear cleaning advice, team! This is the most exciting day! Oh, and as for team ""call poison control"" - I did, but a) it was tremendously unhelpful and b) it was uninteresting and made the story too long. Also, Dr. Google informed me that night that people drink food grade hydrogen peroxide *on purpose* to cleanse. It's a terrible idea, but apparently a thing.

One more: Thanks for the gold, internet friend! I will always remember this day, probably!

Also: I too use the Q. The yearly-peroxiding is just extra. I'm very interested in all this other stuff though.
And: The *seam* on the pillow broke open as I pulled it across the bed. Dunno bro.

"TIFU by brewing tea out of what I thought was white dead-nettle


I went on a business trip to China two weeks ago and a client invited me to go on a trip to Xishuangbanna Tropical Forest. Long story short, we decided to camp there for several days and discuss business strategies to recruit some firms into our agency. 

Cue night time. I decided to take short walk outside our  base camp, and I found what I thought was a white dead-nettle flower patch. I thought to myself: ""well I be damned, this grows in China?"" As a tea lover, I thought it would make great tea for the night so I went back and brewed some, drank some, and went to bed.

Cue morning. I woke up with puffy eyes, itchy patchy skin, and an inflamed throat. At that point I knew I fucked up. The face of my client was indescribable; a mix of disgust like I fucked his wife, horror like I drank his sake, and hilarity. I immediately showed him the remains of what was brewed and said that I picked what the locals called ""white leopard bush"" which when injested is poisonous. 

With everything considered, he said in the quantities that I've used, you wouldn't experience very serious side-effects (i.e. death) 

Proof NSFW: https://i.imgur.com/LKY5yXC.png

TLDR; brewed tea out of an unknown plant and got covered in very itchy and blistery rash.

"TIFU by surprising my boyfriend with poop.


This actually happened on Tuesday but I had to wait until the weekend to post because it's a nasty one. 

I am not a huge fan of anal sex. My boyfriend likes it so we do it every once in a while because I like him. 

Monday was my birthday and he made it a really lovely special day for me. I know he didn't expect anything in return but I wanted to do something nice as a thank you. I planned on being dressed all sexy and having my butt plug in when he got home from work on Tuesday.

About an hour before he was supposed to be home i texted him ""I have a surprise for you"" and started getting myself ready. I pooped and took a shower and put on sexy underwear. I got some lube and started loosening things up preparing for the butt plug. For some reason I decided to pull it back out once and put it back in since it has been a while and I wanted to make sure it was ready. When I pulled it out I felt some lube leaking out and didn't think anything of it... until it started smelling like poop. I still don't really know what happened but for some reason my butt just started leaking poop. 

It got all over me, the bed, the mattress cover, and the carpet. I stripped the bed and hopped in the shower to rinse off. My boyfriend came home to a bare mattress and me cleaning up poop from the carpet. Worst surprise ever.

**TL;DR: tried to give my boyfriend surprise anal sex but instead got poop all over our bedroom.**

Edit: This is my throwaway that I use for embarrassing stuff that I don't want linked back to my real life and pooping when I'm not supposed to is pretty much the only thing that *really* embarrasses me at this point in my life."
"TIFU by leaving my panties in an airplane toilet. An old guy took them, stuffed them in his pocket, and pretended it didn't happen.


In true TIFU fashion, this happened a few years ago when I was on a long-haul red-eye flight. I am a nervous flyer, so I had a few wines to calm my nerves and promptly fell asleep. I woke up with horrendous pins and needles in one of my feet, busting to go to the toilet. I weaved my unsteady way down the darkened aisle, dragging my leg like Quasimodo, finally arriving at the claustrophobia-inducing toilet cubicle.

My stomach turned over when I saw how wet the floor was and I almost barfed when I got a lungful of the fetid air. Having no choice, however, I lifted my skirt, pulled down my underwear, and did ‚Äúthe crouch‚Äù over the soggy seat, avoiding all contact as best I could considering I had a brick for a foot and was fighting alcohol-induced dizziness.

The relief was enormous until I noticed my panties had slid past my sleeping foot and were resting on the floor, greedily soaking up a puddle of who knows what from who knows who. Ugh. Acting on instinct, I fought my rising nausea and slid my other foot out of them, cleaned up, re-arranged my skirt, washed my hands and was about to exit when my brain woke up and said ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ you really want to leave your undies in a toilet cubicle?‚Äù Obviously not, but neither did I want to *touch* them. Thinking quickly, I kicked them as far behind the toilet as I could (so, not far at all, really), planning to ask the flight attendant for a nuclear-waste disposal container and return to get rid of the evidence.

I exited the cubicle, and to my horror, an old guy was waiting to go in. This in itself should have set off alarm bells. It was 2am. Everyone else on the plane was asleep. There were four toilets, all of them empty, and he was waiting to go into the only occupied one. Did it occur to me that this was weird? Did it fck. I raced back to my seat as quickly as my (now burning-like-the-fire-of-hell) foot would allow, and informed my SO of what had transpired. His response was to hand me the industrial-grade plastic wrapper from his airline blanket. Which I, to add insult to injury, immediately and comprehensively puked in.

Cue my SO being dispatched to the toilet cubicle to retrieve the errant panties‚Ä¶ and returning two minutes later to report that not only had he failed to locate his quarry, he had seen the old guy exiting the cubicle *stuffing something into his pocket*.

I lurched back down the aisle, armed with a fresh blanket bag, needing to see for myself that my undies were indeed gone. To my absolute horror, they were nowhere to be found. In my desperation, I even triple-wrapped my arm in the blanket plastic and conducted a quick reconnaissance mission in the paper-filled waste bin. Nothing. After coating my entire arm in the whole bottle of hazardous-waste-masquerading-as-hand-sanitizer, I exited the cubicle. Doing what felt like a walk of shame back to my seat, I clocked the undie-stealer, two rows ahead of us in the aisle seat, eyes closed, apparently asleep, wearing a creepy sleep-smile *with his hands in his pockets*.

What to do? Accost an old guy and reveal my shame, possibly leading to some air marshal cuffing me for being drunk and causing a nuisance, and causing the plane to land in some unpronounceable flea pit of a country to offload me? How to even explain the situation without appearing to be a wine-swilling, germ-phobic, undie-ditching creep myself? Nothing for it but to return to my seat and try to sleep through the honking sounds of my SO trying to contain his mirth.

When we were woken for breakfast five hours later, I consumed liters of black coffee whilst attempting to burn a hole in the back of the panty-stealer‚Äôs head with my glare. I was still staring when we disembarked, all the way up the corridor and well into the airport. In fact, I continued to stare until I missed my bag on the carousel and was forced to look away momentarily.

Panty-stealer remained oblivious to my murderous intent. Walking slowly, waiting calmly for his bag, collecting it from the conveyor and appearing to be such a harmless and guileless old man that I began to believe I had made a mistake. (In fact, if I hadn‚Äôt been wearing no underwear, I would have been convinced it didn‚Äôt even happen).

Then, just as I was beginning to calm down in the taxi queue, the old guy climbs into a cab ahead of us and *waves at me out the window* with a huge, leery smile on his dirty old face.

The last thing that guy saw as his cab pulled away was me, with the remaining blood draining from my face, shouting in utter indignation ‚ÄúI KNEW IT!‚Äù while my SO fell over cry-laughing. I spent the remaining holiday alternatively hoping the old guy: a) just threw them out or, b) did what I feared he was going to do with them and caught some kind of nasty from the human soup on the toilet floor.

I now carry a disposable raincoat and spare underwear every time I fly. This event has passed into family folklore as ‚Äúthe undie incident‚Äù and will almost certainly outlive me.

Edit: formatting

TL;DR: My panties touched the dirty, wet floor in an airplane toilet. I didn‚Äôt want to touch them, so I kicked them off and planned to immediately come back for them with some gloves or something. An old guy went in after me, put them in his pocket and pretended it didn‚Äôt happen."
"TIFU By dating a girl I did not know was my cousin and my whole family found out


Alright my repution is hurting and everybody is clowning on me right now. I am 17 and my cousin Brianna is a month older so she‚Äôs also 17. I need to give background on how this happened. We were dating for a year. So my mother divorced my biological father when I was born because he was having like 3 affairs (holy shit). She raised me as a single mother up until I was like 3 years old and she met my stepdad Chris. I am really cool with him and I can trust him just like if he was my dad. My mom cut off absolutely all contact with every family member from my biological‚Äôs father side. 

I grew up not really trying to meet my real father since chris is basically my dad he raised me. My real father tried getting in contact with me over the tears but that was forbidden. Okay I was scrolling through facebook and I got a friend request from a random woman and I had only 1 mutual friend with her, which was an uncle from my mom‚Äôs family. I inspected her profile and it was a real person‚Äôs profile. I met Brianna one day I went to the movies with my friends and there was a group of girls in the same theatre. 

As a teenager obviously I went to go flirt and I ended up getting one of the girl‚Äôs number which was Brianna‚Äôs. I started going on dates with her for a while and the relationship was getting really serious and comitted. She finally invited me to meet her mother (her father passed away) and it was the same woman from facebook but since I‚Äôm inactive on facebook I didn‚Äôt notice it was her. I only greeted her and told her I would be taking her daughter with me on a small trip with some friends (I didn‚Äôt have a full on convo with her).

We came back, (3 day trip camping at te closest mountain range) I dropped her off, only waved goodbye to her mother and got home. My mom was looking through my FB so she was basically facebook stalking me. She called me over to her room in a pretty upset voice. She showed me the woman‚Äôs profile on her phone and I was asking what was the problem. She said that was an aunt from my real father‚Äôs side and she told me she wanted to block her. Looking at the picture of the woman, holy shit, that‚Äôs my girlfriend‚Äôs mom.

I‚Äôm shook. I kind of didn‚Äôt believe her and thought it was a joke so I went to my girlfriend‚Äôs house and see what was going on. I talked to her mom asking about facebook and how she had me as a friend. I had no profile picture of myself just of my truck and my family as my cover photo. I asked her why she had added me and she had a sick look on her face. She threw up in the trash can and she said I was her brother‚Äôs son (her nephew). We had to tell Brianna about it and word got out to everybody, now it‚Äôs pretty shitty. I don‚Äôt think I can ever fix this

TL;DR I was dating my cousin frok my dad‚Äôs side without knowing she was my cousin and everybody found out now I‚Äôm fucked

Edit : we are staying together. We love each other too much, after we graduate we are moving into an apartment together (we graduate in 3 months she is turning 18 next month I turn 18 in 2 months.). We are going to stay together in an apartment while we go to college we are going to same university since it has majors and certificates for many different departments. "
"TIFU by hatching mosquitos in my house


So this actually happened when I was about 7 years old, but I completely forgot about it until I saw a video about mosquitos today. Anyways, when I was little we used to have a country house with a stream in the back. I was fascinated with the animals, and would often spend hours playing outside, catching frogs and salamanders and the like. 
Anyways, one day I came across what I thought to be frog eggs. I scooped them up and brought them inside and begged my parents to buy me a tank for them, to which they begrudgingly obliged. I took them back to the city and put them in a tank and waited. Soon, they hatched! They didn‚Äôt look like what I thought tadpoles should look like but I had never seen a live one before so I figured tadpoles are just kinda gross in person. I excitedly showed my parents, who apparently also had no idea what tadpoles should look like, because they allowed me to keep them. 
Fast forward a few weeks, and I wake up one morning to see that the ‚Äútadpoles‚Äù, which had gone into some sort of pupae form awhile ago, are gone, but there are no frogs to be seen. Instead, there are a couple mosquitos in the tank. It is important to add now that the top of the tank was covered in a mesh wiring, meaning that something say, mosquito sized, would have no trouble leaving the confines of the tank and exploring the apartment. I am at this point suspicious that what I hatched were not baby frogs at all, and when I get to school I go to the library and take out a book on insects. It is there that I find out what baby mosquitos look like, and realize that I unknowingly cared for blood sucking parasites in my bedroom for the past few weeks. 
At this point I am freaking out because there had been like, a hundred of these fuckers in the tank, and they had at this point all escaped and were loose in the apartment. 
As soon as I got home I dumped the water in the tank down the toilet, but it was too late. My family and I spent the next few weeks waking up to bites. I never told my parents, when they asked what happened to my tadpoles I told them they died. 

TL;DR today I fucked up by hatching mosquitos in my bedroom thinking that they were tadpoles and subjected my family to mosquito bites
