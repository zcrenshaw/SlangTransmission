"TIFU by voting to end net neutrality


Obligatory ""this didn't happen today"".  Well, actually I guess it's happening right now.

Today is the Internet Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, and /r/TIFU is participating.  We support a free and open Internet, so today we have restricted the submissions to this subreddit to give you a feel of what it might look like if net neutrality is ended.

Here are some links for further reading about net neutrality:

"TIFU by hanging out alone with 5 drunk girls


So, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. 
I thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. It was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. Sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? 

Wrong. 

I was invited over to start up a fire pit because ""I can't do it myself"". 
So, I ask ""having a pool party, huh? Yea, I can do that!"" I get a reply ""yea, a party, sure!"" 

Red flag one. So, I take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the ""party"" is at. 

Red flag two, the fire pit is already a' blazin. 

I didn't think much of it, but I also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but I'm not complaining. I settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...

One of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. Funny thing was, she was the only girl I didn't see drink alcohol. 
And like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, BAM she was blitzed. Then, Another girl looked at me at one point and said ""come here, I gotta tell you a secret"" So, I swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. I'm thinking, ""okay not what I expected but I ain't mad."" 

As I go to kiss her back I hear, in an extremely angry tone, ""What the FUCK?!"" One of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.
She swims over to us, and I'm thinking that I'm about to be castrated, but my presence doesn't phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. 
They start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, UFC style. 

But, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. I'm thinking to myself ""what the fuck. Should I be aroused or terrified?!"" 

I assure you, I was both.

After that, shit got scary. They threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. Now, I grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so I know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! IN THE DEEP END OF A POOL WHILE DRUNK. That shit got me praying to every God in every religion. I wasn't sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, I was just trying to stay alive, man. Their ""playful"" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. I thought it was the last thing I'd ever hear. 

Then things kinda settled down, so I, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because I had too much to drink and I'm not trying to get a DUI or wreck my motorcycle. 
But I woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and I thought ""aw fuck. This is it. These ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. MY LUST, MY GREED, I DESERVE THIS."" So, I flip around to better see what's happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. I mean really going at it. Like a fire hose. 

Then, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of Blue Poles by Jackson Pollock, she looks at me and says ""sorry, didn't mean to wake you"" and walks away. Like it was nothing. Then, I just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until I was sober. And I got the fuck out of there.

TLDR; hanging with 5 girls in a pool sounds like a dream, but it's actually a nightmare and they will get naked and try to drown you."
"TIFU by shooting a physically handicapped man with a paintball gun at point blank range


So, this story, as is the case with most, did not happen today but a few years ago.    
My first year in college was about 3 years ago. So at about the 2 and a half month point into my first year, my residence counselors decide it would be fun to go paintballing. So 2 of my friends and I sign up and the rest of the list is people I have not met or talked to yet.    
Fast forward a little bit and we are playing ""Deathmatch"" in paintball. Teams were just kind of thrown together and my side was most of the athletic males and females against the people just looking to make friends. Eventually, it is about 5 of us taking on 1 person. Me being the tactical genius I am, decide to flank around and catch him by surprise. So I sneak my way around while my teammates are distracting him and eventually got the little hold up he encased himself in. Now, when you're playing paintball/airsoft, it's courtesy to give someone a ""mercy"" rule when you're close enough to where shooting them could really hurt. So I started saying mercy while having my gun to his back about a foot away from him. No response. I say it again and louder this time. He's still shooting at my teammates so I say ""Final time. Mercy!"" and still no response. So, I unloaded about 3 shots into his back and he winces in pain and grabs his back and falls to the floor. Ref calls for everyone to come back to the player meeting area so I say ""sorry, dude. I called mercy."" As I'm walking towards the player's hub, I turn around to see him walking with somebody and I thought they were shaking hands as a good game thing. Then it dawns on me that they aren't exchanging pleasantries, they are communicating through sign language. I snuck up and yelled at a deaf person and then shot them 3 times in the back from about 3ft away for not listening. At this point, a huge wave of ""Douchebag"" just washed through my body and I felt sick to my stomach.   
I eventually went up to the man and the person he was with, asked her to tell him I was the one that shot him very close and then asked her to show me how to say ""Sorry for being a dick"" in sign language and then repeated it to him.     
TL;DR Ran up behind a deaf person in a paintball game, yelled at him, punished him for not listening, apologized in sign language.     
EDIT: Alright. Since this gained attention. I have gotten mainly two comments that I wanted to address.     
1. I play paintball once every 3-4 years so I have no idea what ""barrel tapping"" was at the time. I have taken that info for future games of paintball so thanks for that.     
2. I did not mean to offend for calling a person that was deaf, physically handicapped. I wanted to use the broad scientific term for it to avoid any possibility of offending somebody. I get there are some people out there who are deaf and find it offensive but if I used the term deaf, there could have been people that were offended I used that term. It's just a choice of whos going to get offended the most in this situation. "
"TIFU by losing a staring contest with my dog.


So this little fuck up did actually happen today. 

I have a big, yellow lab who lounges all over our house. He’s sort of like a giant twinkie who doesn’t really move and gets in the way at times, but can also be great to snuggle if you’re stressed. 

Now one of his various habits is to track you with his big, brown eyes from the moment you enter a room to the moment you depart it. (Or until something distracts him). 

So over the years I’ve developed a game where I’ll enter the room, snap my eyes on him and try to stare him down as I navigate the house to do whatever I need to do. For the record, he tends to win unless something else gets his attention, so the scoreboard is relatively even, I would say. 

On the day of this particular fuck up, I was walking through our kitchen and I happened to be testing out a new Nikon camera with a stabilizer. 

So, holding the stabilizer in one hand and balancing it with the other, I stalk the kitchen like a velociraptor with IBM, trying to get the perfect balance. (It’s friggin’ hard to get used too).

As I’m working away, I catch my dog staring at me. He’s not moving his head or anything…just following me with those big, brown eyes. Naturally I get sucked into his gaze, ready to beat the fluffy motherfucker in yet another stare down while I continue to stalk across the kitchen. 

Unfortunately, I forget an important detail in the layout of our kitchen. We have a couple overhead cabinets that extend slightly beyond the counter and you have to be kind of careful around them so you don’t whack your head. I, being a tall, lanky bastard, don’t usually have to worry about them as I come up to chest height with the bottom of them and can navigate them easily. 

However, as I was testing out the stabilizer, I adopted a crouch to get lower to the floor and stabilize myself. That in addition to my intense stare down with my lab afforded the perfect conditions for me to walk head on into the fucking corner of the cabinets. 

I slammed into them, hard, and jerked back instinctively. But due to my awkward position, I completely fucked up my center of gravity and sort of keeled sideways, slamming my chest into the edge of the counter, cracking the shiny, new Nikon lens in the process and dropped like a sack of potatoes. 

As I fell to the ground, the bottom of the stabilizer (which looks like [this] (https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Professional-S-40-plus-0-4M-Handheld-Stabilizer-for-Steadicam-Camera-Video-DV-DSLR/811114_1869449274.html)) sucker punches my balls in the most effective manner possible. All at once my vision dances, my breathing shallows, and my nuts explode in a tempest of agony as I slump on the ground, clutching a broken, fucking Nikon. 

It takes me a couple minutes to recover, but I do eventually. Of course Roofus McDoofus ambles over to ensure I’m alright, licking my face and generally rubbing in yet another victory. 

I ended up cracking the lens which put me out a couple hundred bucks, and plan to order another. Injury-wise, my forehead is throbbing but not cut, my chest is slightly bruised, my groin aflame, and my dignity in shreds. 

I think I’m gonna put a wide angle lens on next time and film my dog in a funny fucking hat. That’ll show the bastard who’s stare-master. 

TL;DR Got into a staring contest with my dog while testing out a new camera stabilizer, walked into the corner of a cabinet, went down hard doing damage to both myself and the camera, and ended up losing the contest. 

Edit: I'm okay, I've forgiven Roofus (real name Dyson after the vacuum cleaner) and am currently icing the more tender areas of my being while looking over the damages of both equipment and bodily harm.

Here's the pair of us: https://i.imgur.com/ZMbz8Ju.jpg with him giving me even more bodily grievance with a paw to the face in the second part. (He saw a squirrel)

Edit 3: In case anyone is curious, yes, this is the same dog featured in this tifu: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6gtkwa/tifu_when_i_almost_died_while_paddle_boarding/

Final Edit: Thanks to the GLORIOUS MOTHERFUCKER /u/GeekusMaxmius for gilding me. I'm gonna sick a certain giant, golden twinkie on you as thanks!"
"TIFU by being faster than my puppy.


Earlier today I was playing with my 4 month old Jack Russel  Cross Terrier puppy in the living room floor; rolling around, playing tug of war, him going nuts as he chases me etc. I decided to sit down to rest a bit and let him exert his enormous ball of energy at the tug rope on the floor, but suddenly he spies something. 

He looks. 
I look. 

He spots a shiny piece of something.
I spot the shiny piece of something. 

Now obligatory explanation monologue; for anyone who has not owned a dog, a puppy at this age jumps at anything with it's mouth as its hands to investigate. As this was a delicate period of my puppy, since he had a bad case of diarrhea a day ago and is now on antibiotics, I was on full alert to haul ass to stop him digesting anything bad.

As I saw the little shit spin up his gears to jump, I grabbed it with first finger and thumb. I felt a searing pain. I dropped whatever it was I grabbed and yelped, bewildering my puppy who was now frozen. As I looked at my now bleeding finger and thumb, I realized that the shiny object was in fact a shard of glass. A flashback hits me.

Just yesterday night my father had dropped my food weighing scale made out of glass.... he missed a fragment in the clean up.

At least I saved my puppy from possible death.

TL;DR : Cut myself picking up a shard of glass on the floor before my puppy could grab it and ingest it.

Edit 1: no longer ""4 month year old"" :)

Edit 2: ""haul ass""

Update 1; i think i really fucked up today. Just came back from the vet with my baby. Was playing with him and accidentally kicked him as he jumped at my shoe to play. He yelped and whined as i picked him up. When he was calm,as i put him down, he fell flat on his face and held his right paw up, and couldn't walk.

Vet said it must just be sore or sprained as theres still range of motion. So he was given painkillers for now.

I feel like shit. I might post another tifu but right now it feels like i just disabled my own child.

Update 2: Hes OKAYYYYY YAYYY. Was walking this morning but will be on more drugs for a bit more. Will make a new post later."
"TIFU by doing a nazi salute on a class photo


As most stories, this didn't happen today but rather ~7 months ago.

Let's give this story a little background.

I was in a school obsessed with dabbing. My classmates did it everywhere, and even the teachers dabbed once in a while.
Me, being the rebel I was, absolutely hated this. I thought it was ""cancerous"", and only used it to mock others. Alright, enough background.

.

It was a sunny day when all the grades' classphotos were taken. The photographer would announce the class, the class would position outside right next to our school and the pic would get taken.

After about 20 minutes of waiting, our class got called outside. We aligned ourselves how the photographer wanted us to, and he took the photo. Now something I haven't told you, is that at our school the photographers always take 2 pictures: one serious one, and one ""joke"" photo. On these joke photos the students would usually freak out and do some weird shit.
As you might already imagine, on the joke photo, everyone was dabbing. Me, being the 16 year old rebel I was, I decided I wouldn't give in to their bullshit. But I also didn't want my classmates to kill me afterwards for standing out in the picture.

So... I decided to do a nazi salute. Dumb idea, right? Not in my mind. At least back then. I was in the last row, I tilted my head slightly, and did a nazi salute. I knew it would look like a dab from afar, so I rolled with it. The photographer took the photo, and so I assumed he didn't notice. At least my classmates didn't notice.

.

When the yearbook which included all of the class's classphotos was published, no one seemed to notice. No one seemed to notice my nazi salute on the pictures hanging on the classroom door. My nazi salute was almost invisible, and you could only see it when you really looked for it.

About two weeks after the class photos were published, people started to notice. They would stop by our class door and look at me. And my nazi salute. Eventually, the teachers knew about it, and I got called into the headmaster's office.

He wasn't too happy. My parents got called, they (obviously) weren't too happy about the burst of my nazi-genes (that's what the headmaster called my nazi dab. Seriously.) I got suspended for two weeks, and when I was back in the school... the class-photo was gone, and most of my classmates hated me. A few of my friends found it hilarious (so did I), but it was forbidden for me to talk about it.

TLDR: Did a nazi-salute instead of a dab, got suspended, classmates hated me, parents mad, shitty schoolyear. 

Edit: Expelled =/= Suspended

"TIFU by almost killing my father-in-law, while simultaneously destroying a $2000 piece of equipment


As per usual, this was a few years ago.  

I worked for a small landscape contractor and nursery as a laborer/salesman/mechanic/whatever else they wanted me to do.  We had a moderately sized (11 acres) property where we grew Christmas trees.  The trees were prone to getting spiders and praying mantis nests, as well as bagworms, so we would spray the nursery once a year with a very potent insect spray.  

The way we did that was to take our wheel loader (think a giant forklift with big tires that turns in the middle) and load a spray tank with a gas engine and a hose on the front, and hoist it and someone to use it up above the trees so they could spray the nursery.  

Before we continue, a word about my father-in-law, the foreman of this little outfit.  He was the kind of guy not scared by anything, and also the kind who did everything himself.  Basically, for this job he didn't trust anyone else to spray the nursery effectively.  He also didn't trust any of the other workers to drive the wheel loader well, so that became my job.

We pulled this off successfully for years, but it always scared the hell out of me, because he would end up 10+ feet in the air just holding onto the end of the machine, with no regard for his own safety.  OSHA would have had a field day with us.

This particular year, we had just gotten a new machine to do the spraying, with a much higher capacity tank, and a fancy electric reel to pull the hose back after you had extended it.  

We did our thing, spraying and moving around the nursery, until we got to a section that always freaked me out because it was uneven and made everything sway back and forth.  

We hit that spot fine, but he signals me he wants to go higher to get a couple trees so we don't have to double back.  No problem, I raise him a little, and inch forward.

Right into a ditch.  

It wasn't a bad one, but the height coupled with the angle the forks were at caused the new spray tank and reel to rock forward, to the point where they almost fell off.  I should point out that its cradle had no bottom slats, so it was just resting on the forks instead of being supported all
around.  

I angled the forks back so cradle the tank, which normally would do the trick.  Problem was, the water inside the tank was rocking back and forth, and when I angled the forks back almost all of the weight was beyond them, which instead of catching the tank, had the effect of flipping it like a diver off a diving board.  The tank came crashing to the ground upside down, right on the brand new hose reel.  Literally an hour into using it and already destroyed.

As I'm lamenting the equipment, my father-in-law has been screaming and yelling at me, for what I think is dropping the tank.  

So I look up.

Nope, he's holding onto the forks for dear life.  He lost his balance when the tank went over, and my overcorrection with the forks made him lose footing completely, so he's hanging like Doc Brown from *Back to the Future* off the end of the machine.

So I panic, thinking ""shit, if I drop him I'll have to tell my wife I broke her dad"", so I try to lower him down.  As i do, the forks tilt forward, causing him to slide forward off the end and land square on his ass .  Luckily the distance was much shorter by then, but it still looked like it hurt.  He took one look at me, with fury in his eyes.  I'm expecting a lecture or a stream of cursing, or worse.

He says, and I quote: 

""Neither of our wives hears about this.""  

Knew right then I was actually part of the family.  Several days and one large repair bill later, and we're no longer spraying the nursery like that.


TL;DR:  Spraying a tree nursery with a guy and a water tank lifted on a machine to its max height, hit a ditch and dropped the tank and the guy.  Guy happens to be father-in-law, who also happens to be boss.  Didn't get fired, but cost the company several thousand dollars and myself some embarrassment.  Upside, in a weird way bonded with the Father-in-law.

EDIT: a for people have asked for pics to help with visualizing this story, so [here](http://www.kubpower.net.au/listings/new-r30-series-wheel-loaders/) is a picture of the machine I was driving (minus the bucket up front).

And [here](http://m.northerntool.com/products/shop~tools~product_200329207_200329207?hotline=false) is a picture of the poor doomed tank and reel.


EDIT 2: The Editting:  wow, front page!  didn't think my story of stupidity and needless risk would be so popular!"
"TIFU by trying to light a joint using microwave


Was high so quite disoriented in my thinking. Anyone who has been in this state knows that certain bad ideas seem like GREAT ideas at the time. 

On this particular night I wanted to light a joint but had no lighter and it was seriously late so couldn't leave my room to get one. Our dorm room we're only equipped with a microwave and fridge. With the microwave in mind, I remembered that I had a few times accidentally put metal in the microwave and it had caught a small fire which I could easily extinguish. I had aluminum foil and thought it'd be genius to put a little bit in the microwave and quickly let it light and then use the flame to light the joint. 

So I go to carry out my 'master' plan. And my microwave fully blows up in my face and my smoke alarm goes off, evacuating the whole building, and giving me a $1500 fine because the fire department were contacted. 

And I still never got to smoke my joint (though when the flames were raging full considered just smoking it while the alarm blared) 
 
Though upside was we got new microwaves because I blamed it on the shit quality appliances we have 

'TL;DR tried to light joint using aluminum foil in a microwave, which blows up, causes evacuation, gets $1500 fine, and no joint was smoked ;("
