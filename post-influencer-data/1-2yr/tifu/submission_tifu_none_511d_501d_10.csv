"TIFU by having sex with a tampon in, losing it, and having to get my professor remove it (NSFW)


This happened last night. Put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. I had a busy night, but at the end of the night I got to see my boyfriend. Totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. I have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an IUD, so between that and my busy day I totally forgot I had a tampon in. 

We wake up the next morning and I remember. My stomach drops. I immediately go to the bathroom and I can't feel it. Its gone. I tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything I could think of. Nothing. After close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the Vagina Gods, I accept my fate. This shit is GONE. 

At this point I'm worried that I'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of my forever. I also know the risk of contracting TSS if I keep it in much longer so I know I need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. After class I'm off to our Student Health Center. I go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. I strategically timed it so that I WOULDN'T see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, Gen Med, at night once a week. I wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so I was hoping the nurse could do it. 

Nurse is very nice and reassuring but says I have to wait for the doctor. Great. Some time later I'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. He comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing I wanted. Really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

He starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
Dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
Me: "".........""
Dr: ""Theres no final in Gen Med!""
Me: ""..oh""

I for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. Don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

He finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. I have his class in a few days. Not sure how I'm going to look at him. I'm a 4.0 student and I've never felt stupider in my entire life. 

TL;DR: forgot I had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. Had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. "
"TIFU by walking into my son's bedroom without knocking while he was with his girlfriend


My son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he's going through his own life and I'm trying to respect that.

So I came home after work, him after school, I decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some Mario Kart.

I'm still mortified at what I found...

I walk in, fully clothed my son's girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son's face is buried into her butt... She stares at me with the widest eyes I've ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the ""Horns of the apocalypse"" and farts directly into my son's face. 

He falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. He yells ""dad!!"" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.

I rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. My son's pants are down, he's crying and I'm panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. 

His girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all I can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.

My son is bleeding, I haven't said one word at this point. I muster the strength I have to get him to the car for an ER visit. I try to get his girlfriend but all I hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.

In a moment of weakness I back up and just leave my house locking the door.

My son's alright now, physically anyway. I'll update if he gets pink eye. His girlfriend hasn't contacted us so I can assume she's still going to town. I'm no longer hungry so dinner's out.

tl;Dr walked in on my son burying his face into his girlfriend's anus, she farts, he falls off bed and takes down a table and his entertainment center"
"TIFU by wearing reflective glasses to a poker game


Mandatory this didn’t happen today, it happened Saturday night.

So me and my friends have a Saturday night poker game, and this time we decided to spice it up and play for money. We all brought in 100$ to  start. Now this is where I fucked up. I bought these new pair of aviators that I really liked and made me look really cool. So I decided to wear them to the game, which was inside. I hoped it would improve my poker face, which is lacking. I proceed to have the worst game of my life. They knew exactly when to call my bluff and fold. It was like magic, I couldn’t get it. I went out super quickly. They continued playing until the end, and as we were leaving I told my friends “you guys have balls of steel!” My friends started laughing like crazy, and I asked them what gives. They said, “you know those glasses are reflective, right?” And I realize they could see every hand I had through my glasses. They laughed and handed me 50$ as compensation.

Tl;dr: don’t wear aviators to a poker game "
"TIFU by hanging all my underwear out on the balcony to dry...


This happened a few hours ago, writing this while I'm still sitting in shame.

I live on the 9th floor of a student accommodation building. Now, it's great, I have my own balcony with a full view of the whole parking lot. This becomes important later.

It's almost the end of the month so I've been trying to save some some pennies here and there because I may or may not have ordered too much Dominoes a few times the past couple of weeks.  So, today was laundry day and I decided I'd save on not using the dryer after using the washing machine and instead, drying all my clothes on my balcony. It was a nice, sunny day, so what could go wrong?

So, I go and wash about 3 weeks worth of underwear. Thongs, granny panties, just about everything I own. I carry everything back upstairs. It should be mentioned that I don't own a drying rack, but it wasn't windy so I thought it would be fine if I just hung everything on the railings. No clips or anything. I have no idea what I was thinking.

20 minutes later, after I had lunch, I peeked onto the balcony to see how the drying was going. There was nothing hanging there anymore. Cue panic as I go and look over the railings to see... all my underwear strewed across the parking lot. On the ground, on top of cars and even one of the securities chair. I ran to the lift and went downstairs in shame. I spent 20 minutes picking up half dried underwear, being watched by laughing students who thought the whole situation was hilarious and so snapchat worthy.

Now, I have to wash everything again and even pay for the dryer. So much for saving money. I'm just waiting for all this to turn up on the University Memes page. Also wondering if anything landed on someone elses balcony on the way down but nothing seems to be missing atm.

TL;DR : I hung my underwear out to dry on my 9th floor balcony. I forgot that wind was a thing and had to rush downstairs to pick everything up off the parking lot. Lots of snapchats were made."
"TIFU - my neighbor who is a police officer knocked on my door on 4/21


I've always smoked in my apartment but I had a female over that day that I couldn't see on 4/20 and she had on weed socks and he was in his truck while we were outside smoking a cig. We go inside and light up a joint we pre rolled full of really loud bud, and lit up. Smoked Damn near the entire thing while watching a movie. About 45 minutes into the movie, I hear three very loud knocks on my door and see him through the peep hole. I immediately spray myself (stupid, whatever), and open the door and step out closing it behind me.

He introduced himself, asks if I remember who he is and what he does. Explains that he can smell from outside and inside his apartment below and to the left of us. He's upset he had to explain what the smell was to his daughter, and was upset that other families around me likely had to smell it. Told me that between my friends socks and the smells he has enough that he doesn't even need a warrant.

He then says he's coming to me as a neighbor, not a police officer. He says he appreciated me helping him find gear for his daughter to skate, and that he's never had problems with me and that he thinks it should be legal, but that I need to find somewhere else to do it, and that if it happens again he won't be so nice. I had the biggest heart attack of my life, my anxiety was ridiculous. Even though it's only misdemeanor in my state I'm still not trying to deal with it. 

Tldr: lit up some loud and got a visit from the police. "
"TIFU by not showering and desicrating some poor girls bed sheets.


This happened about a year ago and I still cringe when I think about it.

 A few months after finishing University and moving away I made a trip back to catch up with some friends.  I had planned to stay the night at a girls house who I had been seeing casually, which we were both excited about.

Upon reaching the city, the friends I had planned to catch up with simultaneously bailed and I had a few hours to kill before I could meet up with the girl I planned to stay the night with.  Wanting to kill some time I decided to go on a mini cafe crawl as this city arguably has some of the best coffee in the country.  Several black coffees later and feeling super spaced out on caffeine my friend finally texts me to say she’s finished work.

As I go to get up to catch a bus to her place the dreaded coffee shits hit me.  I race to the cafe toilet and spend a solid 20 minutes ridding my bowels of shit the colour and viscosity of liquid tar.  To my horror my arse is like a marker pen to the remaining toilet paper and I wipe my way through all that is left.  I decided to just catch the bus to my friends place in my current state and just let the shower wash away my worries later.

Several anus chaffing minutes later I arrive at her place and she’s having some drinks with her flatmates.  Not wanting to be weird and go straight for the shower I indulge in a few drinks which quickly turns into a hearty night of wine and drunken sex.  

I wake up in the morning to what can only be described as a compete shit-show.  Being drunk and forgetting to shower, my marker pen anus has painted its masterpiece on the white sheets of this girls bed during the drunken sex.  There are brown streaks everywhere on both sides of the bed.  

As I go to the kitchen to get some breakfast she seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that her bedsheets now look like a Jackson Pollock painting.  I try to think of a way to tell her what had happened but I was just to embarrassed.  Panicking I resort to damage control mode and take the cup of coffee she just made and pretend to trip and fall as we head back to her room spilling black coffee all over her bedsheets.

The good news was that the shit stains were now mostly obscured, the bad news was that she had no mattress protector which meant that her mattress was now wrecked.  Long story short she could never get the coffee stain out and I had to buy her a new mattress.  She never found out about the shit stains and we kept on seeing each other for a while afterwards.  

TLDR:  I forgot to wash my arse after a particularly sticky shit and got shit all over a girls bedsheets while having drunken sex.  To cover the shit-stains I spilt coffee on her bed which lead to me ruining her mattress and having to buy her a new one."
"TIFU - my daughter busted me on 4/20


I was on our deck last night enjoying a joint.  I usually vape at night because it’s discreet and there’s no smell. I have 2 kids 14 &amp; 17 and they have no idea I partake.  Being 420 and not smoking a joint since summer,  it was a beautiful spring evening so I decided to treat myself.

I heard my neighbour come outside to let her dogs out.  My neighbour doesn’t know I smoke and not sure I want her to.  I quickly snuffed out my joint, hid it in my hand with intent to flush it, and came in the house.  

I walked into the the house and my 14yr old daughter was standing in the kitchen.  “Oh THERE you are”.  Unbeknownst to me, the joint was still a little bit lit and she totally smelled the weed.

Well.... needless to say I was busted and we totally reversed roles.

We had an honest talk about it.  I do use because of my knee pain and I accentuated the benefits it has for that, but I feel like I let her down and am not the example I ought to be. 

She’s very mature for a 14yr old and did say she feels more comfortable to come to me about stuff now that she knows I’m not uptight about weed.

This is just not how I wanted it to go.  With legalization around the corner I was going to tell the kids, just not yet. 

TL;DR got busted smoking weed by my kid, but have a better relationship for it."
"TIFU by smashing my mother in-law through a glass table WWE style because I wanted to browse Reddit


This is one of the most ridiculous things that I've ever experienced in life. I know the title sounds click-baity, but seriously, there were tables and ladders and reddit involved. 

My wife and I moved to a town near her parents and her mother loves to come around to help us do stuff. It's like we have our own handy man. My wife will say something like ""Oh we were thinking of painting our walls yellow"" and my mother-in-law would be here with paint buckets and brushes. I don't know why she insists on this, but my wife is indulging her because we think she's just really bored. 

In any case, yesterday, she was helping us wallpaper our walls and she absolutely INSISTED that she did it all herself instead of letting me do it, so I'm stood there holding this rickety step ladder she's got as she aligns the patterns and does everything else. This went on for like a few hours where I literally just followed her around asking if I could help and being refused.

I'm quite bored at this point because she won't let me do anything, so I whip out my phone and I start reading this FU on this sub about some dude who whipped his boss's son's dick with a microphone and I heard the ladder creak. 

Let me just help you visualize the room at this point. So my MIL is doing the wall where my wife's vanity table normally is. It's this wood/glass top thing that we moved behind the ladder before we started doing the walls. The reason we did this is because my MIL is using the vanity table to keep some shit like extra glue and some other tools handy.

So anyway, as soon as I turn, my mother-in-law's screaming ""ooh!"" in that stereotypical old lady in trouble voice. She was a bit wobbly and maybe she would've been fine if I just left her alone to balance out on her own, but no. I was so distracted at the time, I assumed she was in immediate danger so I threw my phone to the ground and grabbed the ladder to steady it (like I was supposed to the whole time). That seemed to have thrown her entirely off balance because I see her start to fall...I grab her by the legs, but I'm on the other side of the fucking ladder so it's quite an awkward rescue position. What happened was that I basically did some sort of wrestling move like a real flimsy [Alabama Slam](https://youtu.be/QqgmKIdme4c?t=10s) or some shit and she came crashing down through the fucking table (I'm not really that into wrestling, so I'm pretty sure there's a better move out there)

I assumed the worst, but her injuries didn't seem as serious as I would've expected them to be. She didn't break any bones or anything, thank fuck, but she did get a few cuts and definitely a big bruise. She was refusing to go to the doctors last night and I've been feeling so guilty about it, but at the same time, playing it back in my head is so fucking comical. Luckily my MIL has a similar view on the whole thing. There's no love lost or anything. My wife and I have insisted on taking her to get herself checked out today, so while I wait for her to let me know when she's ready to leave, I thought I'd share this moment with you. 

**TL;DR: Was supposed to hold the ladder for my mother in law. Decided to browse reddit instead and smashed her through a table when she began to wobble.** "
"TIFU by accidentally stabbing myself during sex and making my wife look like a sex freak in front of all her colleagues.


Obligatory this was late last year. 

My wife and I are fairly busy people - she is a doctor (emergency ward) and I work as a senior advisor for a big firm - so often we don’t get to spend to much time with each other, but when we do, we make it count. 

She’s an awesome person who I love - and we try every day to show each other that physically and emotionally. However, due to our schedules we sometimes don’t get a chance for a few weeks at a time. 

On the day I fucked up, my wife had the day off due to her roster and I was only going to get home around 7pm. Nonetheless, she sent me a kinky text during the day saying when I got home we could have *some special fun times* and a nice meal.  She’s an amazing wife and was making a delicious meal for us to have when I got home. Needless to say, I was pretty darn excited. 

Come 7pm, I walk in the door and greet my wife in the kitchen. As you do when you haven’t seen a spouse in awhile, I gave her a backwards hug and kissed her on the neck. 

Next thing i know, she starts pulling me towards her and we start making out. Things started to get hot and heavy and somehow I slipped and fell on the bench into the sink. Only problem was that I landed and managed to stab myself in the arm with a knife she was using. 

FYI The knife was in the sink above a pan, so she didn’t stab me on purpose. 

Being a doctor, she inspected the injury and knew I would need stitches. She wrapped me up, with the knife still in, and drove me to hopsital. Obviously she didn’t remove the knife just in case, but she knew how to bandage it up so I be transported. 

Given the closest hospital was her work, she had no choice but to take me there. We park the car and walk in the front door of the emergency ward - where she works. Needless to say, everyone who was waiting (patients and other doctors) was in shock - as they could see a man walking in bleeding with a knife in his arm. 

As I was waiting to see a doctor with her, several colleagues of hers walk past and stop to see what the heck happened. Eventually word gets around her workplace that we were having weird kinky sex that ended up with a knife in my hand  

I get bandaged up and the doctor stitching me couldn’t hold it in. He started laughing because he heard what happened. 

Apparently people made jokes/puns to her for the following few weeks. 

My wife wasn’t impressed either. 

TL;DR stabbed myself with a knife during sex. My doctor wife took me to her work to get fixed up. Everyone now thinks she has super kinky sex. "
"TIFU By walking in on my mom masturbating...


As per the usual of this subreddit, this happened about 3 years ago. So some things you may want to know before is I was 16 at the time, and my parents are die-hard, anti-masturbation Christians, and my dad was always travelling for work and I had after-school activities, so my mom had a lot of down time.

So back in high school I played a lot of video games and always kept my doors closed, because I enjoy my privacy. My mom was always SUPER suspicious about my door being closed and what I was doing, so she would bust open trying to ""catch me in the act"". 

So after my wrestling coach got in altercation with another teacher, practice was cancelled for the day and I got home a lot earlier than I usually do. Also my dad was out of town, and my younger brother got out of school a lot later in the day than I did, so it was basically the perfect storm.With no lifting or wrestling practice, I was in a super good mood, so I thought I would play a prank on my mom. I was always really annoyed when she would bust my door open, scaring me half to death, so I figured it would be a good idea to do the same to her.

When I got home the house was eerily quiet, which was odd because usually my mom was watching TV or cleaning the house. So I slowly and quietly walked upstairs to my parents room. When I got there I could hear her breathing heavily which was SOOO weird, but nevertheless I still thought It would be funny to scare her. So I busted the door open as loud as possible and yelled ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!"", only to see her with an obvious face of pleasure with her hand down her pants. then she SOARED off the bed like an Olympic high jumper an then crouched behind the bed, SCREECHING at me to get out. 

So I ran to my room and starting freaking out hard, kicking myself for being so stupid. About 15 minutes passed of sheer anxiety and worry, my mother quietly enters my room and tells me that she was taking a nap and I scared her, and that she was very angry and disappointed that I would do such a thing.

 I was too petrified to tell her that I knew what she was really doing, so I played along in hopes that it would save myself from the awkwardness in times to come. I was then grounded for two months from my computer and phone. But from then on, she ALWAYS knocked before entering my room, so mission accomplished I think?

TL;DR. I busted in on my ultra-christian mom masturbating and she got super pissed off, grounded me for two months, and tried to play it off as a nap..."
