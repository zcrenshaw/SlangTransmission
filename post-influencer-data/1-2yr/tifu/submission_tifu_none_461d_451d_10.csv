"TIFU by accidentally buying tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers not Peppers


Few years back I was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""Red Hot Chili Pipers"" were playing in Edinburgh...I thought it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers! £30 for a ticket I thought it was a bargain! Bought two tickets one for me and one for my ex gf.

I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!

So we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.

I thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

About an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

I turned to the man next to me and asked when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

It was at this moment I realised I was not going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

TL;DR: bought tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers thinking it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"TIFU By Masturbating Too Hard Which Led To Having Surgery


Obligatory this didn't happen today but when I was in the 8th Grade.

8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the ""Birds and the Bees"" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.  

One day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let's just say I was a little too rough with my ding\-ding. 

After I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had ""spatooshed"". I just assumed I over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area. 

I was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said ""Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you'll be fine in no time."" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""Thats it, I can't take it anymore. We're going to the hospital.""

Oh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.

We eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. I didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. So they run everyone stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. At this point it's been 2\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" Right away she yells WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look. 

The nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

The surgery was quick and I didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to ""normal"". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would've lost him.

I ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.

Lesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.

TL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons. "
"TIFU by permanently burning myself trying to connect with my recently deceased dad.


This was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.

For the last five years, I've had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. I emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever I used it. I don't use sugar a lot, so I've never had to refill it, I just dip into it when I need it.

My girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when I packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.

""Don't being your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck's sake.""

""It's perfectly fine,"" said I. ""Sugar doesn't go off."" 

""It does,"" she said, wrongly.

""It doesn't and I'm not going to throw out totally useable sugar.""

So the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. I want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. Maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.

---o---

Fast forward to this past January. My dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. He falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. But that was my dad to his core. He didn't know how to stop. He single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.

I am not that person. I love stopping. I'm self-employed too, but I put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever I like. My dad couldn't have lived like that. We were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we'd never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations I'd had with him in life were now all we had. That was as close as we'd gotten.

Fast forward again to last week, early June. We're trying to sell his shop, but it's a tip. Sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. And the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven't been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.

I get to work. Breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn't take as long as I thought, and after lunch I start on the workshop. My dad specialised in Seagull engines, which are now collectible, so I'm sorting everything into Rubbish piles and This Might Be Worth Something piles.

Then, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and brushes, I find an ice cream tub. I open it up, and it's half-full of sugar.

The best before date is from 1998. So he's had this box of sugar since I was 12 years old. Maybe longer. For his coffee I'm assuming.

I call my mum through from the front of the shop.

""Look,"" I say. ""Dad had a box of sugar.""

""Why would he have a box of sugar?""

*""Because its perfectly bloody normal, that's why.""*

""Won't it be out of date?""

""Guh, no.""

She doesn't look convinced. I lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.

""Look,"" I say, ""It's fine.""

I put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it's not sugar. It's bitter, and it's bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. I run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. I do that another half dozen times, but I've already burned my tongue very badly. One of my dad's friends comes from the end of the pier.

""Everything okay?"" he asks.

""Yeah. Ugh. I just ate what I thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. It wasn't sugar.""

He laughs. ""Why would your dad have had-""

""I DON'T KNOW.""

He walks in and comes back with the tub. It's caustic soda, he says. For cleaning engines.

I now have chemical burns on my tongue. It's been a week, and they haven't healed. I can't eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. I told my girlfriend, and she didn't even laugh. Apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn't normal.

**Tl;dr: My girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. I find a big tub of old sugar in my late father's workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. It's a chemical cleaning agent.**"
"TIFU by summoning a Kenyan drug lord on a school trip


Yes Reddit. Its here. For those just joining us, I must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

In my second last year of secondary school I was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in East Africa over my summer holidays. The idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of Kenya, south of Mombasa and then work in a safari park (Shimba Hills IIRC) before crossing over to Tanzania for an actual safari in Ngorongoro Crater and then top it off with an ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro. This wasn't free by the way, I had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

We had two teachers accompany us on the trip, Mr F who was a no nonsense former Royal Marine Commando as well as Mr B who was an absolute legend. Mr F's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

Mr F utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. To him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. Mr B was more interested in ordering in crates of Kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (AFI - Sing the Sorrow for NOFX - So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes was probably my favourite swap). I wont digress too much but giving a band of Masai Mara warriors my CD player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to NOFX was awesome.

During our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. Eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named Sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. We bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""You like?"" He said.
""Yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in Kenya too?"" I replied. Remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

During the boat ride I wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. Then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. I was not ready. We tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. Over the course of lunch Mr F kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. Eventually his GF came up to us and said something like ""Boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" Cold sweats.
""Its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""It doesn't look like that too me, I better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

About half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. I didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""[My name], can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, I don't remember who. 

As I was still high I started to panic again and the paranoia was back. I walked over to them. I'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. Sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken English. He had thought that I was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from Mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. And listen Reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. In no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation I just had. Yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but I was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

I think I managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""I'm sorry I have to go"". Then I ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

About a minute later I heard Mr F yell my name.

""Where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""Where is he boys?""
""Hes in the toilet sir""
Silence, then Mr F's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""You fucking little shit, what have you done? Who are these people? Come out here now""

""I can't sir.... I'm on the toilet, its really bad"" This was sadly the best thing I could think of.
""Get the fuck out here now""
""I can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""You fucking little liar, open this door""

He was trying to shake it off its hinges. I wanted to die, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, I was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

At this point Mr F's girlfriend and Mr B stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""Let us talk to him"". 
""What happened, why are these people here""
""I'm so sorry, I was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, I have no idea how this could of happened.""

Somehow it was smoothed over, I don't know how, but I stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. When I came out the dealer from Mombassa were gone. The teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

The rest of the trip passed without incident. I wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, Mr F was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. Sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. Also I think Mr B and Miss F had done me a huge favour by calming Mr F, coming to my defence and for that I am forever grateful.

TL;DR a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising Kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from Mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the UK, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

"TIFU by trying to teach my kids bugs are fun.


So... Most of these start off with ""not today but...."". However, this one is today and ongoing! Four weeks ago (may 15th) I thought it would be hella cool to buy one of those habitats that has multiple praying mantis egg sacks and watch them hatch with my kids. The plan was to release them in the front and back yard. So the package comes and one of my kids (4 year old) is perplexed and the other (11 years) is like F\-you, gross. We check them every day for the first week or two and nothing happened. The excitement died off but we still checked it every 2\-3 days. My 11 year old has a Girl Scout trip to Hershey, PA this last weekend so we spent Friday and Sat night and drove home Sunday, getting home late afternoon. I cannot find this habitat anywhere.. I was like WTF. We do have a cleaning lady that is known to put stuff away and we have to look for it so it was nothing out of the ordinary, it will turn up.  

Some come today I am sitting in a meeting and my wife texts me at noon and says ""OMG praying mantis are all over the couch.""... I drove home (only 10 mins away) and sure as shit I see 10 or so baby mantis crawling all over my couch. I start to take apart my sectional so I can find where they are coming from. Finally I find one egg stack, pick it up and take it outside. As I am walking outside with it mantis are crawling out of it and jumping. I then find out my dog chewed the habitat, the dog watcher cleaned up the mess and did not tell us. Problem is.... that habitat had 3 egg sacks, I found one. So ether the dog watcher cleaned up and threw away some or I potentially have 1\-2 more egg sacks in my living room. Each egg sack has 50\-200 praying mantis. Damn it.   

TLDR \- Purchased \~500\+ praying mantis. Dog thought it would be funny to release them all over my living room.

"TIFU By biking alone and face planting on concrete


So this actually happened Saturday night/Sunday morning.   
I was out having some drinks with my friends and although I was a bit tipsy, I wasn't necessarily drunk. However, I am quite stubborn, even more so when I had a bit to drink. So, I decided it was a good idea to bike home alone by myself. This is where the fuck up begins, considering i already got a number of scars due to falling of my bike when alcohol was involved. None of those come close to this fuck up however.

The next thing I know I'm laying in my own puddle of blood and a stranger is comforting me and reassuring me that help is on the way. Apparently I've been laying there for about 30 minutes and lost quite some blood. It's all pretty hazy and i can't remember anything about what happened (I can't remember much about anything of the night previous to my fall). I somehow managed to fall of my bike on a straight road without any curves, face plant on the concrete and knock myself out.

I got a concussion, 12 stitches in my lip, they had to glue my chin, a fracture in my front tooth at the root, a fracture in the enamel of the other front tooth which has also moved backwards and two other teeth have a chip broken off.

I haven't been able to eat much besides liquids and i'm on a pretty high dose of morphine to deal with the pain.

I'm now never allowed to bike home by myself again.

Marked NSFW for the gory picture. [I look like a mixture of a zombie and the exorcist](https://imgur.com/a/BjVBwcs).

It took me 3 baths to wash all the blood out of my hair.

TL;DR Decided to bike home alone after a night drinking, face planted on concrete and messed up my face/mouth pretty badly. Never allowed to bike by myself again."
"TIFU by bringing an air soft gun to school


This immense fuck up occurred several years back during my Sophomore year of high school. I want to preface this story by making it clear that I’m not nearly as stupid as the following events might suggest.

During my Sophomore year, I joined the cross country team. I had a lot of friends in it, and the coaches were all really relaxed, kind people. While I wasn’t overly fond of running, I did enjoy the practices and races. 

Our practices were always at the nearby elementary school’s football and track field, as it was bigger than any field at the high school. At least once a week we’d get to run through the trail in the woods near the school. That was always my favorite run, as it was scenic and beautiful. Every Thursday we were able to choose where we run, and I always chose those woods.

One thing you’d always see in the woods were air soft pellets, all over the ground. It always seemed like a fun place to have an air soft war, as there was plenty of cover and places to hide.

Cue the fuck up.

The collective brilliant minds of myself and my friends decided to coordinate an air soft fight that would take place on a Thursday during our free run. It was supposed to be the Sophomores versus the Freshmen, and we were all excited about it. Our practices occurred after school, but since I didn’t have a car, I couldn’t run home and get my gun, so I had to bring it in my backpack. 

The day comes, and I bring my gun to school, but never take it out for obvious reasons. Class ends, and I head over for practice. After some light stretching, we were able to go on our merry way, so my dumbass friends and I ran to the woods and begin our little war.

So, we’re running around, having a jolly old time, shooting one another with our guns, until one of my best friends accidentally runs by a coach while holding his air soft gun. The coach asked why he had a gun, and my buddy ran off. 

We quickly dispersed, and our short conflict came to an end.

Fast-forward to the next day, while I’m sitting in health class. The teacher gets a call, and I get a sick instinctive feeling like the call was meant for me. It was. I was summoned to the vice-principal’s office, who was in charge of discipline. The vice-principal was a wicked woman who only lasted a year at my school. She was a total bitch who made sure everyone called her Dr. because she had a PhD in Education. Basically, Dr. Bitch asked if I had been involved in an incident involving guns on school property. I was raised to be honest, so my dumbass told the truth.

After being escorted to my locker, having it searched by the school officer, and then being locked in a white-walled room, I was called into Dr. Bitch’s office once more.

I was suspended from school for a week, and had to sit there as the wicked witch of my high school called my mom. She was furious with me. That was not a fun conversation.

While a suspension might not seem terrible, it had a lot of consequences I wasn’t prepared for. For starters, I wasn’t able to be on school grounds for a week, and they wouldn’t even let me take the bus home, so I had to walk. I wasn’t able to attend my brother’s senior night soccer game which was really important to him. I couldn’t participate in the next two cross country meets. I was informed that I’d have to put the suspension on any college applications, and the National Honors Society barred me from joining.

Perhaps worst of all, is the whole incident looked really bad for the head coach, who was a really kind, fun, and supportive guy. He was the head coach for many years, but that was his last year being involved with the team. I am almost 100% certain the administration forced him out.

I’ve always been a really good kid in school. Got solid grades, was always highly respectful of teachers and other students, but this one fuck up smeared an otherwise clean school record. 

Don’t bring guns to school kids.

TL;DR: My friends and I brought air soft guns to the school woods to have a little war during our cross country practice. A coach caught us, reported it, and I was suspended from school and faced many consequences."
