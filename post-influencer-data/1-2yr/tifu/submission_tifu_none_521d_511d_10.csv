"TIFU by having sex for the first time in 2.5 years [NSFW]


Obligatory, this didn't happen today, rather three days ago.


I've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, I joined a dating site.  


I started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn't been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn’t want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn’t seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. 


It started well and I was like fuck YES, let’s do this! So I said as much. I also said you’re not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He’s a liar. So bullet dodged. 


Anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I’m like STRIP because I’ve gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I'm grand.



There’s a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. It’s over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he’s just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


So I’m trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse.

So much fucking blood. Well, I know it’s not a wild period since I’m not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I’m like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I’ve never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


We have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it’ll stop. 


Nope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don’t want them thinking I’m some harlot. I'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


Wake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I'm freaking the fuck out. Obviously can’t tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I’ve broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I’ll ever have sex and it wasn’t even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she’s wonderful.


Get in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.

Theres surgical glue on my vagina. I'm never dating again.

tl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together."
"TIFU by casting my poop to my living room TV


Ok so this literally just happened. Still recovering.

My girlfriend and I recently got a Chromecast instead of getting cable again and have been loving it. I cast everything to my TV. Everything. For the last few days, I've been having a blast casting my balls and pics of my morning poos from the bathroom while my gf is doing her thang. She's a good sport. No idea why she's still around. 

Today was a special case. My stomach wasn't feeling great after a heavy dinner last night. Went to the bathroom and emitted a substance from my anus that I couldn't describe. So what do I do? I cast a picture of my diarrhea filled toilet to my TV and sent a text to my gf asking if she thinks I'm dying, based on the poo's appearance. This is where everything went to 'shit'. Turns out the neighbors came over while I was blowing out my insides and hanging out in the living room. All I heard was a scream and my gf apologizing profusely. Needless to say, I stayed hidden in the bathroom, looking for new apartments... Came out to a fuming gf yelling about how we'll never have friends. 

TLDR; cast a picture of my diarrhea to the TV that my gf and neighbors were watching effectively scaring them off and pissing off my gf. Great way to start the day. "
"TIFU by not telling my company I'm color blind.


Obligatory this did not happen today. I have Protanopia, the color Red is non-existent to me, as well as most of the green spectrum, with a considerable part of the blue spectrum classified as ""Muddied""

back in 2006 I took a job outside of my chosen field, working in the transportation department, doing cargo shipping and receiving, I had been working on the software side of the industry and after being laid off, I called in a favor and started in the physical side of things.

Started out in an air cargo company, small outfit, less then 10 people, domestic and international cargo transport, I know the vernacular, I know how this works and I've got the talent to make things happen.

I realize that I excel at the whole negotiation process in terms of cost for cargo and things are going smoothly,

One day, I'm tasked to do some work in the records room, sorting and filing waybills, I'm given the instructions,

""International shipments go into these folders"" Points to stack of boxes with open box of folders on the top ""Domestic shipments go into these folders Points to different stack

Put waybills into folders, label with first name of supplier and store in drawer

I bang it out, I'm on fire, I blitz through the back log and I get through 6 months of backlog in a day and a half.

The fuck up?

Folders were red, and tan,

I saw no difference, no one said any difference and the boxes under the open ones were mixed up,

queue 4 months later, we are doing an audit and one of the files is noted to be in the wrong folder, then another, then another.

The company is in panic mode, because now their system cannot be trusted, so if they get an investigative hold, they might miss the paperwork etc etc.

A memo comes out, and the whole company comes in over the weekend to basically re-sort the last 2 years worth of cargo waybills, we all sit down, grab boxes and start sorting, and that's when I realize that this is all my fault.

So I'm sitting there, holding up 2 folders, trying to tell them apart when the owner asks me ""What the F$#% are you doing?""

and I tell him that I'm color blind, that these look exactly the same, and that I'm pretty sure I screwed everyone's weekend up.

I wish I could say a good laugh was had, but no, it was not, they were angry that I didn't bring it up before, It's not something that really effects life so I tend to not think about it, but in this case, yeah, totally my bad.

Probably cost the company a good chunk of cash, everyone most of the weekend.

When I was laid off a few months later, I really wasn't surprised.

TL;DR: Mixed up Domestic and international waybills because I never mentioned being colorblind causing overtime expenses to fix my mistake. "
"TIFU by eating some pears and going on a road trip with my family.


Obligatory: This was not today.

When I was a young lad I developed a habit of gorging myself on anything that tasted good because I could. Pizza? At 14 I could eat a large in a single sitting and have a snack a few hours later. Mind you I never broke 140 at 5 8 until I was 22. Those were the days.

Egg Nog? My record is 1.5 quarts and I only stopped because a buddy of mine started vomiting after 2 and I didn't feel like wasting good egg nog. Granted 6 hours later I blew a hole in the bathroom floor becoming the inspiration for Chocolate Rain to our downstairs neighbor but I was ok.

We used to go on Cheap Beef runs in highschool and I was known for eating 5 McDoubles in a sitting back when they were on the dollar menu. Years later I was in college I could pound 8 thanks to the powers granted by Mary Jane. My point is I thought I was invincible.
Then it happened. When I was 16 my parents got a sweet deal on pears. It was a whole bushel basket from a shifty neighbor that years later was arrested for stealing boat tarps in the dead of night, dragging them down the road from the local marina and selling them on eBay. 

Our grandfather had a minor but unexpected procedure that week so we packed up for a trip and I was told to get rid of the pears so they wouldn't go bad while we were away. Over the course of a day I had maybe 15? They were so damn good I couldn't stop. We get into the car about 5PM to drive from Mexico NY to Binghamton NY via Route 81. That's a 4~ hour ride if you include explosive shit breaks.

About 20 minutes into the trip I let one of those silent hot silent farts go, the type that sear every orifice they come in contact with like a hot griddle and immediately my sister screams ""Mom! Chris farted and it hurts!"" Mom responds ""Lila don't be drama-OH GOD! Chris!"" and my dad laughs in delight. Ten minutes go by and I set another one free. My sister yells at me and mom tells me to knock it off. Dad and I are laughing and he locks the windows then turns the heat up until mom threatens to leave him. The third fart about an hour in dad's laugh is not nearly as enthusiastic.

An hour and a half in dad turns and says ""Chris, it's not funny anymore, you're making your mother sick"" as I'm still farting. Like the air is coming out of my fluttering sphincter as we're making eye contact. I tell him ""Dad something is wrong I can't stop."" Mom asks me if I was sick and I tell her no. She asks if I ate anything weird. I tell her 15 pears. She freaks out and calls me an idiot, dad agrees I did not do a smart thing, my sister smirks at her inherently superior decision making skills, I fart, everyone gags.

It's two hours into this trip from hell and there's a tight knot in the pit of my gut. It hurts so bad as my insides try to figure out how the fuck to deal with all these pears(I eat the whole things except the stems). I tell dad I need the next rest stop. He tells me it's 10 minutes away. My colon goes ""Best I can do is 8.""

I'm pouring sweat at this point and shaking as the painful ball of tension shifts. A gurgling sound slides from right to left and my sister looks at me horrified saying ""I heard your poop move"" to which dad laughs and mom scowls. I fart and the fart ends with an abrupt wet plugging sound. The windows are just staying down at this point. Mom is making little gagging sounds.

We get to the stop and I run inside, a partial squeaker slips out in the lobby of the visitor center and I know everyone will know the foul stench is me moments from then. I don't care, I'm whimpering as I enter the bathroom.

All three stalls are occupied and I want to cry. Wait no, the door opens on one and a guy comes out, it was like a gift from heaven above. I don't care if the seat is warm I brush past him apologizing slam the door and slam my ass onto the seat as my cheeks parted and the gates of Hell swung open.

*The Reckoning*

You've seen Dumb and Dumber I assume. It was like that except 3 people could hear every squirt plop and splash as the poorly mixed pudding texture mess erupted out of my tender teenage hiney-hole, splattering the inside of the bowl like a sinister Jackson Pollack. I don't know how but it felt like at least a third of the pears had reassembled themselves. The disasster was a wild combination of consistancies. 

For a few violent moments my ass was centerstage in what can only be described as a Blue Man Group sketch artistically celebrating the phases of matter. Liquid, solid, gas, solid, liquid, fiery jets of plasma back to viscous rancid ropey ass fluid splashing plopping blasting to some unearthly rhythm. Gasps were heard inside the restroom followed by muffled laughter as thirty seconds of plops and periodic flushes rang out. I was afraid it would stack up and touch my balls so I kept flushing.

I sat there for twenty minutes wringing the last of satan out of my anus until my dad came in and asked if I was ok. I cleaned up and we got back into the car. We rode in silence the remainder of the trip.

To this day my parents won't keep pears in the house when I visit or let me have them at extended family functions.

TL;DR I ate some pears and they gave me gas so bad on a 4 hour road trip with my family that 15+ years later I'm not allowed to have pears at family functions."
"TIFU by branding my ass


Obligatory this didn't happen today but two days ago. I just finished taking a shower and my husband and I did what we call a hot swap (He got in as I got out). When I stepped out of the shower and grabbed my towel I knocked my husband's wash cloth off of the bar. Being the good wife that I am, I reached down to retrieve the cloth. Now, I should mention that my husband and I just moved to Massachusetts from Florida. We are not very experienced with cold weather or the heating methods employed in the Northeast. I thought nothing of it as I bent down to pick up his wash cloth. That's when things went bad. After a moment I felt a weird sensation. I slowly stood up as I started to process my mistake. When I bent at the waist my ass made contact with an active and uncovered stream radiator. Unfortunately it took enough time that when I pulled away the damage was done and the skin remained. Thankfully, the radiator was decorative so the burn looks kind of cool, but oh boy did it hurt wicked bad. 

TL:DR I bent over to pickup a washcloth and melted part of my butt on an extremely hot and active radiator.

"TIFU by having a hotdog eating contest before a dentist appointment


This actually happened in second grade. It was hotdogs for lunch at school, which were my favorite food by far. My friend knew this and bet me I couldn't eat 4 hotdogs, so I said let's just have a competition. Close to five hotdogs in I conceded the match. Not bad for a 7 year old, but my skinny little friend ended up eating like 6 of them.

So I'm not exactly feeling top notch after all those dogs and then halfway through our next class there's a knock on the door and it's my mom. I'm confused and then it dawns on me that she had told me this morning that I had a dentist appointment in the afternoon (I was a spacey kid and had forgotten).

We drive to the dentist and the motion of the car really wasn't sitting well with me but I figure I'll be fine once we arrive. Wait for a bit in the lobby and that classic dentist office smell really isn't helping anything in the nausea department. Finally my name is called so I hop in the chair, get through the pleasantries, am starting to feel a bit better and think it'll be a breeze. Dentist puts on his latex glove, I open my mouth, and he's barely gets his finger not even an inch in my mouth when it all falls apart.

I watch in slow motion horror as I feel my gag reflex engage, see the dentist's eyes shift to quizzical concern and then wide-eyed ""oh no"" shock as I projectile vomit an entire stomach full of hotdogs everywhere. Ev. Ry. Where. The room looked like a hotdog vomit grenade went off and no one was spared. I distinctly remember vomit dripping from the dentist's mask and my only thought being ""so that's what those are for."" Everyone froze, completely silent, all of us mortified and no one having a clue what to do. Finally the dentist shakes his head, calmly turns around and leaves the room. My mom grabbed me and took me straight home, not a word. I never saw that office again.

Part of me thinks this doesn't belong in TIFU since hotdogs are awesome and dentists and school sucks and I got a ton of the former and none of the latter out of that day. I'll let you guys decide though.

TL;DR: Ate as many hotdogs as I could and then projectile vomited them in my dentist's face"
"TIFU by declining a nice gesture from an A list star and telling him he might have lice


This was 1996,  and I was twelve. I had just landed a small part on E.R.  where I played a burn trauma victim because my mother was cooking meth in our upstairs apt. A firefighter had broken my fall and I was rescued! As Chicago’s heroes brought me to the ER, George Clooney began to work me up; intubation, pads, vitals, establishing a line, all the while spitting out Dr. jargon. 
Now, this is where IFU,  During the filming of this scene, George asked me if I wanted a his hat and that he would autograph it! I was so excited,  when suddenly the voice of my Mother entered my head telling me not to share hats, combs, drinks, etc with others. I was twelve, rationality hadn’t developed yet.

I told him no, because “he might have lice”. I remember the priceless look on his and the other actors and crews faces when I said this. Cut to later that evening after wrap, my Mother and I were making our way off set when I told her the story. She let go of my hand, and her jaw dropped as she whipped around to try and catch him in his trailer so that she could apologize on my behalf. Unfortunately George Clooney had already left for the day. Probably to go wash his hair. 

tl;dr on set with George Clooney, he offered me his autographed hat, said no bc lice, and have regretted it ever since. "
"TIFU by not plugging the Ethernet cable in to my Xbox


Many of you would be aware Australia has some of the worst internet in the world, it is so bad that I have 2 connections at home, 1 for downloading, watching Netflix etc which has unlimited downloads and I run only over Ethernet. The other I use exclusively for online gaming when my partner is using the main line, it is a 4G wireless connection that costs $55 a month and gives me 15GB in downloads (more than enough to play online) I am usually very careful about which connection I am using on the Xbox (Ethernet or wireless) but I had been playing on PC all day which is only connected by Ethernet so when I changed over to Xbox and started browsing the store it slipped my mind that it was still connected to the wireless 4G modem (you can see where this is going) I decided to buy Titanfall 2 (68GB) because it is ridiculously cheap in the current sale and then I went to bed. I woke up this morning to discover my 4G modem had downloaded 74.8GB this month. My ISP charges $10 for every 1GB I go over my plan. TL;DR I bought Titanfall 2 for $500 dollars."

"TIFU by being careless making my morning coffee


This happened a few hours ago. So I have a coffee machine that makes the coffee straight into the cup so I use the same cup couple days straight. Today I noticed that my SO had discarded a wrapping paper into my cup last night, so I threw it away and made my morning coffee. Little did I know it was not the only thing she had discarded into my cup. Its a tall Tigre mug so you don't really see the bottom unless you tilt and look, which I didn't. After the final sip I felt some tiny hard things in my mouth and I spat them out. My shock and disgust was pretty high when I realized it was her nail clippings and hardened foot skin from the night before. I'm also pretty sure I swallowed at least some skin pieces. She came home from her shift a couple minutes ago and almost died from laughter. Still kinda disgusted myself but at least someone got a laugh out of it.

Tldr: Didn't check mug, drank SO's foot skin and nail clippings."
