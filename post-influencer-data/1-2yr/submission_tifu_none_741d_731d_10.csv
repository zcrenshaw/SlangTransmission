"TIFU By applying for engineering jobs and telling employers I'm retarded


So this has been going on since I graduated in May and started applying for jobs. I've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback. Well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since I have ADHD, I have been checking the box marked ""Intellectual Disability"" all these months. 


So about fifteen minutes ago I'm going through an application like normal and I get to the part where they ask about disabilities. This is what it reads: ""Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I've been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.


TLDR: I've been checking the ""Intellectual Disability"" in applications to declare ADHD when that actual means mental retardation. I've fucked up over a hundred job applications."
"TIFU by taking the trash out without a shirt or shoes.


So a series of very unfortunate events happened to me last night, This happened last night at about 3am. 

I had forgotten to take the garbage can out to the curb and had just remembered i needed to.
Instead of doing the smart thing and throwing shoes and a shirt on (I live in Florida, Lots of bugs and spiders ect) I decided to do it in just gym shorts. Big mistake.

So i went outside to put the garbage on the curb and not even 5 feet from my front door i feel something Big, Cold, And Slimy jump on my back (It was a frog) I freaked out and tripped over this concrete edging thingy that we have at the edge of the walkway to the front door, They look exactly like this: https://imgur.com/a/9mwNC


Yea it fucking HURT since i was in my bare feet. But that isn't the worst part, As i tripped, My other foot landed right on one of these spiky fuckers FULL FORCE: https://imgur.com/a/ybLQ9
Seriously WTF nature why do these things even exist. This is what my foot looked like: https://imgur.com/a/7XyXK

So now my left foot hurts like a bitch, and my big toe is probably broken, And my right foot is hurting like a bitch too and i can barely walk. There is a trail of blood running through my house that i still need to clean up as well. But hey, At least i don't have to wait another week for the garbage man to get my garbage.


TL;DR Walked outside without shirt or shoes to take garbage to curb, Frog jumped on back and scared me, Tripped over concrete thingy, Landed foot first on spiky death ball thingy and now can barely walk.

Pro tip, Don't be lazy like me and throw some sandals on or something when taking the garbage to the curb, Or just avoid going outside at all cost.

UPDATE for anyone who reads; The trash did actually get picked up despite it being labor day so my series of horrible events wasn't all for nothing. As recommended by Kinolee, I went and got a Tetanus shot. Also my foot that got stuck by mother natures land mine is feeling much better now, But my other foot's big toe is still hurting like a bitch from tripping over that concrete thing but its okay ill be fine in no time."
"TIFU by scratching my back.


The following events actually happened today.

For the last year or so, I have been diligently growing this little bump on my back. Call it a wart, a cyst, whatever. Right between my shoulder blades, just a little left of my spine, and *riiiiiight* on the threshold of the 'can't-reach-it-without-a-friend' zone.

It's nothing to worry about, I swear. Just last night, after a shower, my girlfriend was giving me the ole ""You should really see a doctor yadda yadda I want you to be healthy yadda yadda"" spiel. I just told her, in my best Schwarzenegger, ""It's not a tumor."" And it most certainly is not. It's just this weird little bump under my skin, no bigger than a marble, or a walnut if you're using the metric system. It doesn't hurt or anything. I've actually grown quite fond of it. Until today...

I was at work, awaiting my coworker to relieve me from my shift around 5 o clock. He shows up, I'm shooting the shit with him, and casually scratching my own back. Try to imagine this as appearing ""casual.""

Right as my coworker is telling me about his weekend plans I feel my BackBuddy^TM gurgle beneath my fingers and change in shape. I remove my hand from my work shirt and see what appears to be a small amount of mashed potatoes smeared across my fingertips. Curiosity and mild confusion mingle upon my face until the stench hits.

Suddenly my coworker's weekend plans to visit his long-lost blahblahblah didn't seem so intriguing once I experienced the smell of death itself.

Perhaps you have never smelled the distinct odor of pus. I imagine war veterans are familiar with the harrowing scent. I, for one, have never smelled something so vile or corrosive. God, I can get a whiff of it right now as I type. It smells worse than your high school bully's diarrhea. It is the smell of hatred and doom. That smell is *pure evil*.

Immediately, I bolt for the bathroom. Alarm bells going in my head and I'm thinking, ""IT'S HAPPENING!"" I reach the public bathroom door, lock it shut (thank god for singular restrooms) and stand in front of the mirror before I pull my shirt off over my head. My back, fortunately, does not resemble a crime scene like I'd expected. I decide to be a gross human being and squeeze my back knob to see what happens. It changes in shape, feels like some air bubbles are being released(?), and I wipe my back clean with some paper towels. By now the bathroom smells like...not my problem -- it's the end of my shift!

I pull my shirt on, leave the bathroom, clock out, and head home. Driving home was peaceful enough, with the windows down of course. I was careful not to deface the delicate upholstery of my vehicle with my bodily excretions.

Upon arriving home, I disrobe immediately inside the front door. Shirt off, pants down. Leave the socks. Walk to the bathroom. Look in the mirror. Game face. I squeeze that itty-bitty protuberance with as much might as I can muster at this angle behind my back.

*Pus confetti.*

Ribbons of pus. Stream all over my bathroom. The wall. The mirror. The fucking ceiling. My eyes are watering. My jaw is clenched. *Everything* is clenched. The bump is literally making tiny squeaking sounds as I squeeze it mightily. It may have been screams. I'm not kidding. I'm salivating like a hungry animal who digs the pain for some reason. The smell is offending my ancestors. And at this point I'm fairly certain my girlfriend is going to leave me once she sees/ smells this biological catastrophe.

I jump into the hottest shower I have ever taken. I need to grieve. My relationship is dead, for certain. My BackBuddy^TM is vanquished. I don't really know what to do.

Upon exiting the shower, I see I have a text waiting from me on my phone. It's from my boss.

""This is embarrassing, but plz explain to me what happened in the company restroom before u left today. Customers have complained about the smell.""

With this picture attached: http://imgur.com/a/gwJsA

**TL;DR Accidentally ruptured a cyst on my back. Made pus spaghetti all over my workplace bathroom walls and got called out. Forever haunted by the mere stench.**

EDIT: Still waiting for the girlfriend to come home. The smell lingers like a ghost and seems to follow me around the house, no matter how many candles I've lit. Maybe it's in my nose forever. Dear god.

EDIT2: I still don't know what to tell my boss. Do I deny it was me? Do I explain myself? God he must be imagining the absolute worst. Am I going to lose my job holy shit

EDIT3: Still have my job, hallelujah. I feigned ignorance to my boss and then snuck a bottle of industrial bleach and a box of gloves into the restroom first thing the next morning. Badda bing badda boom. What bodily fluids? TO CLARIFY: I was not initially aware I had left a mess in a public place. I would never intentionally expose innocent people to my bodily sin, don't be ridiculous. My fuck-up resides in these simple factors: (1) it was the end of my shift and I was rushing to leave, (2) I was probably in a state of mild shock tbh, and (3) I never would have thought to check for back shrapnel on *the opposite wall of the restroom*. In fact, I wasn't even aware I was capable of that feat until I destroyed our nice bathroom at home. 

Speaking of which, my girlfriend still loves me. She's thoroughly disturbed by the way I anonymously read my own post to her, as if this shit *didn't* go down right in her nice clean bathroom. But she quickly caught on and had a good laugh. Turns out she still has that gag reflex after all. 

EDIT4: Apparently some of you are concerned about the timeline of this event. /r/TIFU has rules about submitting posts involving bodily emissions during the week. So I resubmitted over the weekend. Simple copy-paste jobbie. My bad. 

EDIT5: AND ANOTHER THING. I'm aware this was a gross story. Yes, OP is disgusting. Thank you. But if I can't make some of you internet fuckers lose your appetites then what can I do?? You're welcome. "

"TIFU by trying to help someone on the London Underground....


So after talking about how my brother found a way to give me a penile fracture I didn't really think I would end up making another post here. Turns out I had another fuck up in my life today. 
Every day I take the tube and apart from the occasional drunk man or minor argument nothing notably bad happens too often. However, today just had to be different.... 

I took my usual train after school and made my way home ready to browse reddit and procrastinate doing my homework. But a few stations before my stop 3 guys around my age got on the tube. Instantly you could see they were the types of teenagers who thought they were all tough even though they were no taller than 5ft7 and pretty scrawny. Anyway, at least once a week I see the same kid on the tube but never do much more than give him a nod and a smile. He seems like a quite a shy guy burying himself in his nokia brick (http://imgur.com/gallery/lUKzPKH) and probably playing snakes his whole journey. But back to these 3 guys. 

After a few minutes their rowdiness seemed to start annoying everyone else and most people were shooting them a few dirty looks. I really had no reason to do anything.... that is until one of them decides it would be really funny to knock the shy boy's (we can refer to him as SB from now on) phone out of his hand and say ""Let's see if this really is unbreakable""

SB looks at the 3 bastards laughing at him with a look of both shock and helplessness. Having an autistic cousin who regularly gets bullied I'm pretty sensitive about this stuff so I decide to say something (you'll need to know that for my age I'm pretty tall at 6ft but in this case i'm slouching pretty bad in the tube seat so probably wouldn't have looked like it)
All 3 guys from now on will be referred to as bastard aka B1, B2 and B3.

Me: Woah, why don't you give him back his phone and get lost. No reason to be dicks to this guy.

B1: Shut up lil man. This ain't got shit to do with you so just stay the fuck out of it.

*B2 and B3 just continue laughing even harder...* 
*At this point I'm completely pissed so I get out of my seat and the 3 idiots are looking up at me with stupid smirks smeared on their faces.*

Me: I'm sorry, who you calling lil man, lil man *(cringey I know)*

B2: What. You think your funny or something. Fuck off before we start with you. 

*B2 now decides to push me and at this point I can't take the shit anymore.*


I push B2 and he falls to the ground - I think to myself ok 1 down, 2 to go.

What I don't know about those 2 though is that one of them has the punch of Floyd Mayweather....

B3 who had been relatively quiet throughout lands the biggest punch on me sending me flying against the pole then onto the floor. They all run away as the tube doors conveniently open before B2 lands a final kick on me as I'm down on the ground. 

Long story short SB got his phone back. I on the otherhand now have a swollen lip, a black eye and a bruise on my shoulder (from hitting the pole as I fell) and the side of my torso. So all in all I have to say never try to be a hero when you're outnumbered. Or you'll end up lying in bed having to read reddit memes to distract you from the pain to both your pride on your body in general.

At least I can say I saved that boy's phone?

TL;DR: Saw 3 guys bullying a boy on the tube. Got involved, confrontation ended up becoming physical. I end up with a black eye, swollen lip and quite a few bruises... Don't be a hero kids


Edit: I just woke up guys and Oh. My. God. I have to start by saying thank you so much to u/moscow-mule for the gold. UNBELIEVEABLE. Also thanks to all of you guys for the really amazing replies. It may not seem like it but I have read all of them and plan on replying when I can. You've all really made the black eye and swollen lip worth it.
And who knows. Maybe SB will see this :)

Edit 2: OK. OK. 11.5k upvotes AND 3 golds!!! I have to say thank you so much to u/Actualprey and/u/misboundconcubine who has officially dubbed me ""that guy"" haha. But thank you so much to everyone for the kind words. As for reporting the incident to the police, I really don't think I want to go through the entire hassle of having to make a statement to the police and possibly even be at fault myself for pushing them back. They could very easily claim self defence if the police actually caught them. Still thank you for all the information left in comments and PMs - I'm sure these will help others and possibly me in the future :)"
"TIFU by ignoring advice while studying abroad in India


This happened in January but this still cracks me up to this day. To get the best experience from this story, know that I am a small female.

During grad school I spent three weeks in India for a study abroad trip.  We were staying in Karnataka, but took a week long trip to Kerala by coach bus, about a 12 hour drive. The bus was awesome, it had huge seats that reclined nearly 180 degrees, color-changing lights, blankets, and TVs. Thankfully, our bus ride was from 9PM-9AM there and back, so I could take full advantage of these seats and essentially sleep through the entire drive. All was well on the way to Kerala, it was on the way back home that shit got crazy (literally).

Before heading home, the group stopped at a street bakery/convenience store to grab some snacks. We had been eating pretty heavy food all week, so I decided to grab a handful of cashews, despite being warned not to eat street food. I get onto the bus and fall asleep. Seven hours into the drive I wake up with a sharp pain in my stomach--it's an emergency. As amazing as this bus was, the one thing it was missing was a bathroom.  I'm now not only sweating because of these stomach pains, but there's no restroom, it's 4 AM, and we're in the middle of nowhere.

Bathroom stops weren't announced during this entire drive, you just had to get off whenever the bus stopped if you needed to go. Thankfully, the drivers stopped within a few minutes. Assuming this was a bathroom stop, I got off the bus...only to find a highway with completely dark roadside stores. I asked the drivers where the restroom was--they didn't speak English, but motioned forward. Thinking that restroom had been a word so far understood throughout the early part of my trip, I walked forward. The more I walked, the bigger an emergency it became. Within a few steps, I couldn't hold it anymore. I ran behind a building, spotted some bushes, and decided this was the spot. I started to pull down my pants, but of course, as if the situation wasn't stressful enough, I then fell into a ditch (4 AM: pitch black out!) and IMMEDIATELY, the shit went flying. I rush to pull down my pants the rest of the way but it's too late. My legs, hands, arms, and pants are completely covered. I had some kleenex in my bag so I do my best to wipe up, but I don't have enough time or tissues. Within 20 seconds of falling the bus on the street starts honking and driving away. I have two choices: get back on the bus covered in shit, or get abandoned on a random  street in India 5 hours away from my hostel.

I get back onto the bus. I had to crawl past one of my classmates to get to my seat. She immediately wakes up and the only thing I can say is ""Molly, I just shit myself."" If you ever shit yourself in India, sit next to Molly. Her response? ""It could have been anyone. What do we do."" So I proceed to take a ""bath"" with hand sanitizer and wipe with plastic bags, change my pants underneath a blanket, and cross my fingers that no one could smell it.

I was somehow able to fall back asleep but was awakened again in about three hours, this time to another classmate begging the bus drivers to stop. The only other person who ate the damn cashews too.

All in all, had an amazing time in India and learned a very important lesson: when they say don't eat the street food, DON'T eat the street food.

TL;DR: ate street nuts while studying abroad in India and shit my pants on the side of the road"

"TIFU and left a stew in the slow cooker for a full fortnight.


Not a long one, this happened a fortnight ago. I cooked a pulled pork, potato, tomato and paprika stew with some cumberland sausages and pancetta thrown in for good measure. It was delicious. Then we went on holiday for a fortnight.

When we came back, we got an evil look from the neighbour, and couldnt think about why it would be.

Open the front door. The smell was so powerful it nearly knocked me out the door again. I immediately realised what it was. Went over to the slow cooker. Somehow, maggots had gotten inside under the glass lid and it was infested with flies. Hundreds of them. 

So, Im exhausted from driving, its boiling hot. The kitchen positively hums with stench, and there is a crockpot full of flies I have to get rid of. I ask the wife to open the kitchen door to the garden. She does. I pick up the crockpot. The lid slips a bit then goes back. 3 or 4 flies escape. This is going to be tricky. 

It took me a full 5 minutes to tape the lid shut using gaffa tape. I took the pot outside and undid the tape, shutting the back door. The cloud of flies positively exploded into the sky. I only thought there was about a hundred. Nope. There were hundreds and hundreds of the buggers. Whats worse, at the bottom, was a hive of maggots devouring the delicious meaty goodness. 

The smell - have you ever smelled rotting meat? Amplify that by 4 or 5 orders of magnitude and mix it with sulphur dioxide and natural gas odour.

The appearance - a wriggling, writhing, buzzing mass of bluebottles and black flies, white maggots and mouldy pork meat, growing fur and ring mould.

TL;DR Left a stew in the slow cooker over a fortnight and came back to a nest of flies and maggots."
"TIFU By Masturbating With My Back to My Dorm Room Window


NOTE: I wrote this 3 days ago but it violated Rule 4. Original text follows.

This just happened, and my face is still sizzling from embarrassment.

I am a freshman at a sizeable university on the east coast. I live on the first floor of a tower which, until just now, I thought was the luckiest thing in the world since it meant I didn't have to wait for the elevator/haul ass up the stairs. Things were going pretty well these first couple weeks. I have made lots of friends on my hall chatting and laughing in our hallways until 3AM on a school night, totally neglecting all academic obligations. Things were going great until now.

My room had an unmistakable funk the first two weeks. I thought it was just the smell of decades of teenagers and their cum and sweat soaked into the walls until last night I finally realized it was our mildewy window curtains that came with the room. I immediately threw them in the trash can and ordered some new ones on amazon that would be here in a few days.

As most of us probably know, masturbating is kind of difficult in the dorms. You've got a roommate, the walls are thin, and everyone knows what you're doing if you're alone in your room with the door locked. But I'm still a teenager. And I'm horny as fuck. And I'm also ugly as fuck, meaning that I've been making love to my right hand every night for the past 6 years. Dining services on my campus are open until 2AM, and around 11PM every night, most of my hall mates go out for chicken tenders, French fries, ice cream, and the like. While they're out giving themselves pre-diabetes, I take the valuable alone time to stay back and furiously masturbate for an allotted time slot of about 15 minutes.

Tonight, they left, like clockwork, right at 11PM. I immediately opened up my MacBook, head on over to a private browser, and pull up my favorite site: Lobstertube. It's shitty, I know, but I can only imagine I love it like a father loves his son: moaning while beating it furiously. I have a thing for mature women. Not MILF's, they're too young. And definitely not GILF's. They're far too saggy. I'm talkin' mid-50's with low-hanging, saggy tits that sway like egg beaters when she's getting it doggy style. Something you would find those googly eyes photoshopped on and posted to r/glorp. These women know what they want and it's just awesome to see them ride cock like teenagers again. Anyway...

Positioning my computer screen on my chest, right between my face and my dick, I pull up a nice red head about to take on the infamous ""big black cock."" My dick is 5 inches hard and part of what gets me off is fantasizing that I have a giant schlong. All of this is going great and I'm about to climax when I hear something. It's a noise that no man should ever have to hear in his vulnerable state of masturbating. My dick immediately went limp in my hand. I felt the blood rushing out of it, coursing through my body and into my face. It's pure fight or flight. I can hear, from directly behind my head, a group of maybe 10 nineteen year old boys screaming, laughing, hooting, and yes, even hollering. I had totally forgotten that we didn't have any window curtains in our room that night, and my hall mates had a direct view of me, my baby Johnson, and a cuck letting his middle aged wife get railed by a big black bull.

I slammed my computer shut, threw on my gym shorts, and ran to our study lounge, where I am now. In the process of writing this, my face turned from sizzling red to steaming red. My palms are still sweaty. I simply cannot return.

TL;DR Been masturbating for two weeks now when dorm mates go out to eat at 11PM. Forgot that I took down our window curtains. Got caught from the outside watching mature cuck porn."
"TIFU by thinking an emergency button was a piece of gum


So this happened last week. I'm a receptionist at a senior center in my town, and for some backstory, this center is funded partially by parks and recreation, and is therefore a government building. When I started my job we went through the orientation required for all government workers and had to watch a 3 minute video on what to do in the event of an emergency. It was very boring and the instructor kept saying things like ""this isn't a likely scenario for your building, but we still have to show it too you for legal reasons"" so I didn't really pay attention. Fast forward a year later and I'm sitting at your typical receptionist-desk, with a roll-y chair and those plastic covers, only they were a little too small and I would sometimes get the wheels hooked on the carpet and have to tug myself back onto the plastic cover thingy. 

So I'm talking to a patron and need to grab a pamphlet that's just out of reach, so, naturally, I pull myself forward by grasping the underside of the counter. I can feel something under the edge, but I'm still talking to the lady and I'm just sorta absentmindedly fiddling with whatever this thing was under the desk, assuming it was a stuck on piece of gum, because there was this softer piece and I decided to try and give it a tug...

Cue the *fucking loudest alarm ever* along with bright flashing blue and red lights.

About 5 seconds of utter bewilderment and fear while my boss comes sprinting into the room looking VERY alarmed. He shouts something at me that I can't hear and it clicks that I should look under the desk. Yup. Big Ass Emergency Button. 

Did I forget to mention that this Big Ass Emergency Button was to only be used in the event of a shooter?

The whole damn building got ushered outside, about 60 little old grandmas and grandpas who all probably shit their diapers when that alarm started going off. Before I left I managed to tell my boss that it was an accident (cue very exasperated look from him). We all hang out outside the building for 15 minutes listening to the alarms blaring and watching my boss running back and forth with his hands over his ears trying to find the switches that turn everything off. Luckily he managed to get a hold of the police department (they are automatically alerted when that alarm sounds) before they arrived otherwise that would have just been the icing on the cake. Some Very Important Reminders about the emergency buttons were sent out that day.

TL;DR- Got handsy with my button under the desk and the building called the cops on me. "
