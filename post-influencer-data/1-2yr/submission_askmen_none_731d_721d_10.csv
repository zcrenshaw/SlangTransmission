"Men of reddit, my girlfriend just dumped me - what are things that I should absolutely *not* do in the coming days and weeks?


We had our two-year anniversary on Tuesday and she broke up with me this afternoon. I won't get into the details because that's not really the point of this post. I'm just a lost 23 year old looking to the internet for answers."

"What is the most offensive thing you've ever said?


Yesterday I was drinking with my friends and we were talking about veganism, and my friends made a point about animals suffering in slaughter houses. After that I said that I'm kind of the opposite of a Vegan; I think animals actually taste much better if they suffer before they get killed. Which after I said ""Meat actually tastes the best when the animal has been raped a couple of times before cooking. Just go to a Syrian restaurant and order some lamb and tell me that shit ain't fucking delicious"". I was pretty drunk and now that I think about it that might have just been the most offensive thing I've ever said."

"What's an unattractive personality trait you have that you refuse to change to become more dateable?


Mine: I dress casually - t-shirts and gym shorts when I'm out in public, and pajamas at home. I despise being formal and will only do so when necessary for work. Idgaf if that makes me less datable, it's important for me to be comfortable with what I wear. "

"How do I talk to my son?


I've never been all that social, and now my wife says I have to talk more to our son (he's at the ripe old age of 11). Every single one of my efforts ends up in awkward silence or worthless questions like ""How was school?"", but it's not like he wants to talk about it anyway... I never read any books on parenting, so maybe this is why I can't properly talk to my kid, but I don't want to let him down. I want to be there for him. I want to be a cool dad.
My wife gave me this link on [how to ask kids smart questions](http://storytold.io/course-fathers-questions-kids), but I'd rather hear something from real people, you know? What would you guys recommend? What should I be asking my son?"

"AskMen, what signs you give when you don't want to be someone's friend?


*what signs do you give

I want to be friends with this one, seemingly cool co worker. He's really funny and calm, but I just don't think he likes me. I try to talk to him but he seems a bit aggressive (or maybe that's just him idk). Maybe I'm just being annoying and bothering him?  Maybe I should just stop trying, but I just want to know what are some signs that you don't want to be someone's friend. I know that not everyone will like me but I still need to know.

Edit: I'm a woman. This guy is kinda shy and awkward with people with new people. You might think, ""maybe he's shy because he hasn't met you yet."" No, he's already good friends with the new co worker and she *just* started work (whereas I've been here longer). 

Edit #2: Maybe I should've mentioned this, occasionally, he does joke around with me *at work*. He makes small, harmless jokes but then we get back to work. Not only with me, but with most other people too. Although, *outside of work*, when I try to talk to him, that's when he seems aggressive^. 

But okay, I see the point: at this point, if he comes up to talk to me, he wants to get to know me. If not, then he doesn't want to. 


Update: I tried talking to him today at work, he didn't keep the convo going. I'll just stop talking to him completely and see if he comes to me, but he probably won't 

Thanks guys for all your comments, I really appreciate you all :)"
"How can I stop being scared of hurting your balls during sex or foreplay?


I've always been under the impression that balls are super sensitive so it's best to stay away from them. Recently discovered my guy likes ball play during sexytime, but I'm still terrified of hurting him. How much ball play is too much ball play?"

Edit:
---My Story---
I didn't include my own story originally because, in my opinion, stories like these should only be told if they actually have endings. 
Four to five years ago I worked with a girl who quickly became one of my closest friends. She was different and refreshing,  but she came with her own set of problems that I hadn't been, at the time, mature enough to handle. I will be the first to admit how childish I was. 

To keep it brief, I was stupid and I ended up blocking her from everything I could for 3 years, basically torturing myself by not letting myself indulge in one  of the things that made me the happiest, time with her. This, on top of social pressure from the people closest to me telling me not to ""waste my time"" drove me to perpetuate my own, personal hell. During that time I used my self-loathing to fuel rigorous workouts and a strict diet, completely changing my lifestyle and shedding over one hundred pounds, thinking that looking good on the outside might fix how depressed I was on the inside. It didn't and I basically began to whore myself out, incapable of truly caring for women while living with the deep-seeded, inescapable guilt of what I had done to someone I was supposedly cared about. 

I eventually told everyone to go fuck themselves and reached out to her last March. I needed to at least see her again. I know people always say to let go of the past but I disagree. The past, our experiences, our memories, all of it makes up who we are. Without memories we are nothing - empty.

Fast forward to the present day and things are sporadic to say the least, but I'd sooner walk the Sun than abandon her again. I know I can't fix her either, and I don't try to, I just want her to know that I'm not running this time. Not for anything."
