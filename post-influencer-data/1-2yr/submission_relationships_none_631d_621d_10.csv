"[UPDATE] is my Christmas gift to my [29F] Christmas gift to my mother [65ish F] more upsetting than kind?


Okay so the original post can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7jx63w/is_my_29f_christmas_gift_to_my_mother_65ishf/

So first of all, you guys are amazing. I loved reading all of your comments and stories. The feedback was all based on personal opinions and personal experiences and it just made me feel a bit less alone. It was just touching and nice so thanks guys. 

So the summary for those that didn’t see the original, my grandmother died just over a year ago. She was a beautiful star of a woman and the world will never be the same without her. She was severely wonderful and she made every person that ever met her feel like they were special.  

For Christmas I stole the VHS tapes out of my parents basement when I was visiting a few months ago. I had them transferred to Digital files and I made a Christmas video. The video consisted of footage of my mother’s childhood, walking and eating ice cream with my grandmother. Playing with a kitten in the backyard, her 17 year old at the time brother wearing a full suit and tie. Footage of my moms grand mother. Footage of me and my brother when we were 3 and 4 going to visit Santa. And footage from Christmas in 1990 when my mom and her siblings and all of my cousins went to my grandmothers for Christmas together for the last time. There’s footage of my grandmother kissing me and my brother goodnight and The video ended with a beautiful clip of my grandmother saying “welcome to Christmas at the FakeLastName house. I hope your day is just grand”.  

I was worried that it might be a bit hard for my family to see at Christmas because it might reopen the wounds. 

Well. My aunt was very busy for Christmas so I asked her to please drop by for a few minutes whenever she could because I wanted my mom to see the video with her sister. 

I sat them down and played the video. Right away they were like “what?!? How did you?!? OH MY GOD LOOK AT HOW YOUNG MY FATHER LOOKS!!!”. They reacted so well. They laughed, they cried, they shouted out together in unison about all kinds of things like “OMG ITS THE GOLD DRESS!!!!”  And they were just so happy. Like so so happy. I’ve never seen them so happy and excited and it was just the best reaction. 

My mom took me aside afterwards to thank me. She then proceeded to forward the video to the entire family. She’s been receiving thank you emails ever since. 

My aunt showed the video to all my cousins on Christmas Day and emailed me today to tell me how truly wonderful it was and how every single person who saw it felt like my grandmother was talking straight to them when she said “I hope your day is just grand” which is exactly what I felt when I saw it. 



It could not have been better. Our family is changing and Christmas is so different than it used to be but just going back and remembering how things used to be for a few minutes is just so wonderful sometimes. 

So thank you everyone and I hope you all have a wonderful New Years and I hope your day is just grand. 

TLDR: my grandma died and we miss her. I was nervous to gift my mom footage of my grandmother for Christmas but you guys said I should so I did and everything was just so
Great. "
"UPDATE: My [19F] pregnant SIL [26F] is cold and short with me, but kind to everyone else


[My original post is here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7k4gy3/my_19f_pregnant_sil_26f_is_cold_and_short_with_me/)

So, I didn't get the chance to talk to my sister. When my parents came back from shopping with my sister, my mom started saying how she had the perfect onesie for her granddaughter. Before my SIL could start gushing, I asked what my mom meant. She asked if I hadn't heard I'd be having a niece, and I replied I hadn't. My sister said it was weird, because she'd asked her wife to tell me once they'd gotten the ultrasound. Her wife had zero excuse, and had the most deer-in-the-headlights reaction. There was something that just sort of snapped, and I started crying. I felt kind of spoiled and horrible for it, so I apologized, and went upstairs with the dogs. My parents came upstairs, and my mom went to go ask if I was okay, and my sister and her wife started shouting downstairs.

My mom basically said that my SIL does not like me, and that it wasn't really my fault- she's just bad with people she doesn't know, and took it out on me inappropriately. And yes, my SIL was still pissed about the wedding date thing, which just made it worse. I felt really shitty and just... Just like really bad? Part of it wasn't my fault, but part of it was my fault. And apparently my sister knew about both issues beforehand, and had given my SIL directions to try and get along with me. They were still shouting downstairs, and I was kind of bordering on a meltdown, so I asked my mom if we could take the dogs for another walk. We went out the back, and when we came home, my sister had left the house to cool down, and her wife was upstairs.

I spent most of the rest of the day downstairs, until my sister came home. She had obviously been crying, and was in a bad mood. My mom took her into the kitchen to try and calm her down, so I kept sitting in the living room. I felt like a bratty little kid again. Like, I genuinely felt like I'd fucked up my sister's marriage and probably ruined our relationship in the process too. Everything just felt awful, and when my sister came out of the kitchen, she didn't even look at me, just went storming back upstairs. Her wife started yelling first, and they were fighting for a while before it got quieter upstairs. My mom, dad, and I went out for dinner, and when we came home, my SIL was waiting for us.

My SIL apologized to me, saying she had been petty and rude, and that the wedding date thing had been a non-issue. I said it was okay if she was upset about the wedding thing, but I wish she had let me know. She said it wasn't that easy, since my sister would basically take a bullet for me, and it had caused them a big fight before their wedding. I said I had no idea, and that I was sorry to be the source of that tension, and I just wanted to be able to be a good sister-in-law myself, and be a good aunt. My SIL got angry, and said I had ruined the opportunity for the first one, and she wasn't banking on the second one. Then, she stormed upstairs, and she and my sister got into another big fight.

I felt awful. The bad feelings manifested physically, and I spent most of the night throwing up while my sister and her wife fought. My mom was really kind to stay up with me, and my dad tried to get my sister and her wife to get off each other's backs. I specifically heard my SIL shouting, ""Who would you jump in front of a train for? Me, or her?"" And my sister responded, without missing a beat, ""My sister, no questions asked."" They got quieter after that, and my SIL started up the screaming about an hour later saying, ""I'd let all my siblings die for you.""

My sister slept on the couch, and the two of us went out for breakfast in the morning. She basically said that after my SIL gave birth, she and my sister were going to separate. They would try counseling prior to the birth, and afterwards too, but if things weren't getting better, they'd be divorcing. I said that it shouldn't have gotten that far, and I was sorry for pushing the both of them. My sister said that my SIL does this to all my sister's friends, and they've been fighting often. But, she clarified that the way she treated me was a dealbreaker. She said it might've sounded sad, but I was her best friend from birth, and she wouldn't let me not feel welcome like that. I felt really guilty, and started crying again. She kept saying she wanted it this way, their relationship was broken as is, etc.

It's been tense and awkward ever since. My SIL won't look at me or speak to me, and I've given up. My sister has been by my side a lot, and has amped up the good sister behavior 10x. I feel like shit, everything is really terrible, and I'm sure I'm going to be making another post during the actual Christmas bullshit. Not a great update, but there we are!

TL;DR: My sister and her wife are separating because of my SIL's behavior towards me."

"Me [23F] with my BF [23M] 1 year, he played porn over my dad's (57m) new blue tooth speaker in front of my entire family. I want to crawl under a rock and die. What do I do?


Goddamn, where do I start. We currently at my parent's for Xmas. My BF and I live out of state so we are staying at the house. Everyone else lives closeby so there were at the house for our Boxing day party yesterday...total about 20 people including my sister, her kids, aunt and uncles and their kids. We've been here since last Friday but so far it's all been good. 

My dad really likes my boyfriend and since my dad is not tech savvy but loves listening to music on his phone, my BF decided to get him a really high quality bluetoothed Bose speaker for Xmas so my dad no longer had to be tied to headphones or his tiny phone speakers. My dad thought it was about the most amazing thing he'd ever seen and loved it. It took a prominent position above his TV right next to our formal dining table. During the set up my BF used his phone to demonstrate to my dad that the new speaker could sync to multiple phones, but just not at the same time. I assume he never hit the ""forget this device"" on his settings menu. 

So several things happened all at the same time yesterday as we were sitting around our huge table playing team monopoly. My BF said he needed a little break and went up to his room. Everyone was very cool with this and recognized that we can be a loud family and can be exhausting. Secondly my mom was fed up with  my dad looking up monopoly videos on youtube and bragging how the whole family could hear them on his new speaker. So she grabbed his phone and turned it off. I heart the Bose do it's little ""do do do"" noise to disconnect and then it did the connect noise. It didn't hit me what had actually happened. 

After a few minutes I heard the first few lines from my BFs favorite porn series. They are so disgusting I don't want to mention them by name but the jist of it is that this disgusting old man finds amateur wives to have sex other guys. So I hear this ""today we're here with Becky and her husband Rob and Rob wants to watch Becky...yada yada yada."" Everyone in the room stopped and stared at the speaker. What is worse is you could tell my BF was wondering why he couldn't hear the video and was playing with the volume because it kept going up and down. I jumped up and tried to turn off the speaker but my dad got to it first and he kept fumbling with it and doing everything but turning the fucking thing off. We got maybe a minute and half into the audio of this porn before he finally got it turned off. Everyone in that room except for my mom and dad's generation immediately realized what happened. My dad looked at the thing and said something like ""someone must have hacked my speaker!"" My stupid cousin said something like ""yeah, I think that person is up in one of your bedrooms."" It made it worse in that my BF didn't come down immediately and he didn't realize what happened until I told him later. Even worse than that is I have a pale/light complexion on normal occasions but last night, I was literally glowing red. My parents didn't get my cousins joke and my dad said something like ""well I'm sure Benji can figure it out when he comes down."" Everyone who understood what had happened but me audibly laughed. 

So I tried to carry on the night as normal but I wanted to kill my BF. I tried to quietly get mad at him last night but he was so embarrassed he didn't even want to fight with me. 

What in the hell do I do with this? Do I hope my parents remain ignorant as to what happened? no matter what this will be one of those stories that will become legend in my family. I'm already sure my cousin has gotten on facebook with all my other cousins who weren't in attendance and let them know what happened and I envision this story spreading like wildfire. 

What do I do?

"My brother (27M) is super focused on rules, and won’t let up, even with my (31F) son’s (5M) anxiety


Here’s some backstory, it’s a lot, and mostly relevant. Sorry if this gets long, I can be a blabberer. I have a younger brother, I’ll call him Adam. Our parents divorced when I was 12, and he was 8. For the most part, I was okay. Adam was the one who really struggled. He got really anxious, and desperate for structure. Our parents had a system where one week, one parent got the kids for 3 days, the other got them for 4, and the next week, they’d switch up the amount. However, it was never the same days. So one week, we could be at our dads house on Monday, our mom’s on Tuesday to Thursday, then with our dad the rest of the week. The next, we’d be at Mom’s Monday and Tuesday, Dad’s on Wednesday, Mom’s on Thursday, Dad’s on Friday and Saturday, and back to mom on Sunday. Our parents both worked a lot, so Adam regulated himself and me. He would write it before the start of the day, plan it by the half hour increments, and make sure he held himself to it, and tried to make me do the same. It was kind of a pain in the ass, and at that point, I didn’t realize the importance of it so I was kind of mean to him about it, and didn’t want to follow the schedule. Adam would write rules for whichever house we were at, and that’s what he really held me to. If I was still walking around at 9:30, he would come up to me and tell me to go to bed, because according to the rules, it was bedtime.

Adam is married, with 3 kids, and is in his pediatrics residency. When he and his girlfriend got pregnant with their first (8M), they were both still in college. It freaked him the hell out. He’d call me like clockwork, and was always Googling what to do, because he needed an answer. Our parents gave him a huge chunk of money when they decided to keep their baby, and continued to give him $1,000 a month until their son turned 5. His second (5F) was born right after they graduated, and before my brother went to med school. I stayed with his wife after their second was born (he married her shortly before their first was born- to “follow the rules”), and I noticed that there was a whiteboard just of rules and policies, and his wife told me that Adam gets very serious about it, so it’s hard for him to raise their children, because it stresses him out when they break rules. They had their third last year, and she turned 1 over the summer.

I have my own son, he’s also 5. He’s a sensitive, anxious little kid. Like, roadkill makes him feel like he’s going to cry. If he spends too much time thinking, he starts shaking and pulling his hair. We work with a therapist, and we have strategies in place to help him with his anxiety. His big tactic is to come find us when he’s getting stressed, and we try to talk it out with him. If he can’t get calm from that, then we try other techniques, like lying down with him, trying to get his mind off of it. We’re spending the holidays at Adam’s house, and it’s already getting on my nerves.

Adam has a rule that kids eat at the kids table, adults eat at the adult table. Kids don’t get up from the kids table, they don’t come to the adult table. My nephew has hit the stage where he loves to talk about guns and violence, and it stresses my son out. It was giving him anxiety, so he came to go find me. The second he got out of his chair, Adam went, “Kids stay at the kid table.” Adam does this irritating thing where if someone does something “against the rules”, he says the rule, and if anyone argues or keeps doing it, he  repeats it in a louder voice. If they continue, he keeps repeating it until he ends up shouting. My son said he needed me, and Adam repeated himself. He kept going, climbed up into my lap, and Adam repeated it until he was yelling at my son. I had to leave the room, covering my son’s ears while my son was pulling his hair and crying.

Once I got my son calmed, I asked Adam to come into the living room with me. I told him that my son needed to sit with me sometimes, and he just said, “The kids stay at the kids table.” I kept trying to argue it, but he just kept doing it until he was yelling again, and I had to give up. Adam also does taxidermy in his basement, but they’re in the process of redoing the area of their home where the kids’ rooms were to make more space, so all their children sleep in the basement, and my son is expected to sleep with them. Adam’s rule is “kids stay in the basement past 8pm.” His taxidermy is right across from where my son sleeps, and it scares him. So, my son will go try to find me or my fiancée, and will instead be met with Adam going, “kids stay in the basement past 8pm.”

Adam told me he “knows I’m a rule breaker,” and said my son can’t turn out like me if I intend for him to be a successful human. I know this is likely trauma from his childhood, and he should go to therapy- but I can’t make him do anything about that. I just need help getting through this holiday. My son is actively going to be harmed by these rules, if he can’t come to me for anxiety relief or be able to be in an environment where he feels safe and comfortable. How can I try to get Adam to lower his boundaries? Am I being unreasonable in asking him to change things up for my son? His kids are disciplined as hell, it’s not like letting my son crawl up in my lap when he’s anxious will make his house go to shit.

TLDR: My brother is super centered on rules, and has been making my son follow the rules even when it’s not beneficial.

EDIT: I’ve been trying to get a hotel room booked for most of the night, in between efforts to get my son smuggled upstairs. He’s currently right next to me, snug as a bug in a rug. We’re leaving first thing in the morning."

UPDATE 1:

Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did, but I’m grateful to all of you for your advice and comments. 
Her dogs definitely have ample water and shade, that is of no question but I don’t believe they are fed every single day which does bother me. I LOVE animals so I felt like I couldn’t just dump them at her house because I doubted that they would have gotten fed. 

Her Mum has guinea pigs so I have arranged for her to come pick them up and take them to her Mother’s house/farm TONIGHT. I am seriously considering reporting the living conditions of those dogs, but I felt that I had to deal with the guinea pig situation first. I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and as nice as guinea pigs are I cannot look after 9 animals and pay for the whole desexing as well. Tbh at this point in time idgaf about the money she owes me I just want her to take the guinea pigs.

My bf has raised guinea pigs his whole childhood so have no fear, mum and bubs are separated from dad but still caged near each other so they can see each other. 

I will update again if/after she picks them up tonight




Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some advice regarding a weird situation with a new “friend”.

My friend [20 F] recently had to move out of her home and 1hr away into her bf’s home as her house was being renovated. She left her 3 dogs behind in her yard and I offered to babysit her guinea pigs for the 2 months she said it would take her family to renovate her home. 

She now lives with her boyfriend an 1hr away and says she drives every day to see her dogs and feed them, but my gut feeling is that this is a lie. She has in the recent past been regularly calling me asking me to drive the 30mins to feed them. She says “Oh I’ll give you X amount of money when I’m coming through next” but I haven’t seen any money yet. 

It has been 3+ months now, her house is still being renovated &amp; her guinea pigs have given birth. I am now, out of my own pocket, providing for 5 guinea pigs and any time I contact her about getting her to take them is is aloof. I even offered to keep them but she tells me she definitely wants to keep them. But she just never picks them up.

She contacted me recently to ask if I could feed her dogs for her for a week while she goes away (she says she doesnt want to put them in a kennel) and said she would offer to pay me $100 for doing so. I stupidly agreed (as tbh she gets a little emotional and demanding when she doesn’t get her way) but have realized that she “adopted” a fourth dog and now I don’t feel very safe being in a yard with 4 BIG male dogs (I am a small 5’2 gal). 

All I want is for her to take her guinea pigs, but she either doesnt respond, says she needs my help moving their cage or says she will be round on certain days and just never shows. I’m done with this friendship and don’t want to feee the dogs or look after the guinea pigs anymore.

"I [22F] am thinking about cutting my brother [31M], sister in law [27F], and niece [1.5F] out of my life.


Hi everyone, thanks for reading. So, basically this has been somewhat of an on-going situation in my life. Apologies for the length.

Background:
My brother and his wife met about 8 years ago, and got married 4 years ago. They had their first child (my niece) in the Summer of 2016. Let's call my brother Jack, and my sister in law Lindsey. Also, my brother is my half-brother, we share the same mom but different fathers. 

Before Jack and Lindsey met, Jack was engaged to this super nice girl named Anna. Everyone in my family LOVED Anna. She had a really good career path (finished her 4 year, was going on to medical school), was good with money, helped my brother get a better job, helped him get into college late, etc. His father had passed away when he was 16, and she really helped him through that as well. They had been together for about 5 years when Jack proposed, and right after they got engaged, it had came out the Jack had cheated on her about a year prior, so she ended things. I was pretty upset about this as was the rest of my family. Anna had basically become a part of the family, she was like a sister to me. She was there for advice, taught me how to play piano, she would come over and help cook with my mom, and would help with my dad (he's disabled).

After Jack and Anna broke up, things started going downhill from there. Jack got fired from his job (he caused a lot of damage by not following procedures) got put on academic probation and kicked out of college. This is all within 1-2 months. All of a sudden, Jack brings home this new girl, Lindsey. I came home from school one day and see Lindsey at our house, so I introduce myself, yet she just awkwardly laughs and doesn't say anything. I thought it was a little weird, but overall not a big deal, I'm kind of shy myself so I just thought the same thing about her.

Over the next couple of years, Jack was still living at home, so I saw Lindsey pretty frequently. I would usually try and ask about college, her job, travel, etc. All things that she had expressed interest in, thinking that maybe we could talk. Usually I would get the awkward laugh accompanied by really short answers. After about 2 years of this, I started to give up, thinking we would just never be very close with each other.  During this time other things happened though as well. 

First, Lindsey has anxiety, depression, and abandonment issues. This is obviously not her fault, but she would go off of her medication and go absolutely insane at our house. She stayed with us one weekend, and my brother had to work one of the days, just a short 4 hour shift, so he was gone from around 7:30 am to 12:30 pm. Lindsey knew this before she came down, but seemed alright with the situation. About an hour before Jack finished work Lindsey starts calling him non stop, like 15-20 times on his cell phone (which he can't have on him at work), so then she starts calling his work phone non-stop, which make his boss angry with him. Finally she gets ahold of him and starts screaming that if he didn't come home right that instant she was breaking up with him. My mom tried to talk to her after/while this happened, asking if she needed something, if she could help with something, etc. Lindsey freaked out on her started screaming, broke some picture frames and a glass shelf, and got in her car and tore out of our driveway. We later found out she had stopped taking her medication and that she also has bi-polar disorder. 

After that all happened, we still tried to get along with her/include her in things, but she went off her medication several other times and had meltdowns at our house, we were all just starting to get stressed out about her visiting. Usually 50% of the visits ended like the example I gave above. 

Eventually my parents say my brother needs to move out, he was 24, and if he was going to bring someone into their house, they needed to behave better, So he moved about half an hour away to a bigger town, and she had almost finished her 2 year degree, so she decided it would be a good time to move in with him when she was done with school.

My brother lived alone for about 4-5 months, during that time it was like he was his old self again when I would go and visit him. He had a nice, Clean a apartment, we saw each other 2-3 times per month and things were great, I was happy that he seemed happier.

After she moved in with him things got bad, it turns out she also has some issues with hoarding, so it somewhat a constant battle with keeping up with it. My brother and I grew up in a house that was never super clean, as in it looked lived in, but it was never dirty though either. It was more like someone threw a blanket on the floor, or didn't put away a board game type of mess. Never a dirty mess. The first time I visited their apartment I was disgusted. They had been living there for around 3-4 months and you could tell the kitchen and the bathroom had never been cleaned, the carpet had never been vacuumed, it looked like she hadn't cleaned her cats litter box in 2-3 weeks, it was absolutely horrible. Also, the piles of trash and boxes. Lindsey blamed it on the stress of the move, but like come on, all she brought with her when she moved was her clothes and some photos, my brother had all the furniture, and she left all her other stuff at her parents house. I stopped visiting them at their house after that.

Anyways, now lets flash to the current situation. I moved to the same town Jack and Lindsey lived in for school. We live roughly 10 minutes from each other, it's been like this for over 4 years, they've not once invited myself or my parents over to visit, or contacted us to do anything, unless they want money or need something. 

Lindsey took out $100,000 in student loans for a very specific career path, which is not prevalent in our area. Therefore she makes $12/hour and she only works 30 hours per week. Ever since my brother got kicked out of school and fired he had been working at Walmart making around $12.50/hour and he also works 30 hours per week. They do this so that they always have someone home to watch the baby. 

I am currently still in college, but I was able to land a job in my field before I graduated, and I make more than both of them combined. My boyfriend is 26 and he does as well. Therefore we live in a nice house that he purchased, we both drive decent vehicles, and we both are good at saving our money and living below our means. 

Let's flash forward to this past weekend, Christmas. Lindsey and Jack do not show up. Lindsey does not like our family so for the past 8 years, they have never shown up to any family event. Jack will swing by the day after for about 20 minutes to ask for money and pick up their presents. My mom has met her granddaughter five times in one and a half years. She has been ""allowed"" to hold her once. Lindsey does not like my mom. 

Lindsey texts me saying that she wants to exchange gifts sometime soon, maybe my boyfriend and I could take them out to dinner sometime (which always means we have to foot the whole bill). I say sure maybe sometime soon, my boyfriend and I are both busy with work but we'll find time in the next week or so. Lindsey then calls me, says I was rude for not picking a day for dinner right then and there, I ignore it because I think she's being ridiculous. She then goes on to say that I should give her my Vehicle because they need an SUV (they drive two older cars her parents bought them) for the winter since she has a baby and I'm child free. I say no way I saved for my vehicle for 3 years, and I'm not giving it to them for no reason. She starts screaming that I'm a spoiled bitch and hangs up on me. I'm done. I can't deal with it anymore. They're both complete psychotic. 

Lindsey is obsessed with Jacks ex. She looks her up on FB all the time, tells everyone she's fat, ugly, etc. which I always find a little funny because Lindsey is obese, whereas Anna could maybe lose 5-10 pounds (not that she actually needs to).

My brother does nothing about the situation. I thought they would get divorced by now, but no. (Also she planned her wedding for the day I graduated high school, told me I couldn't go to my graduation ceremony, unless my dad paid for their whole wedding, then they would move it to the next weekend. So I just got to miss out on all of my friends graduation parties instead of the ceremony, gee thanks.) 

The only reason I'm struggling is because of my niece. It's not really fair to her because she's the innocent one in all of this, but I can't deal with those people any more. What do I do?

TL;DR: Sister in law is crazy, brother lets her be crazy, slowly ruining everyone's life, but I have a niece to consider.


EDIT: A few things have happened since this post so I figured I'd provide a small update:

1. I called CPS after work today and spoke with someone, she seemed pretty concerned after I went into detail about the living conditions and the mental health of Lindsey. When we were finishing up our conversation she let it slip that they already had something on file. The way I took it is that someone else has also made a complaint (not sure who though..).  I will be emailing screenshots of texts and copies of text/phone history to child services in the morning.

2. Lindsey texted me today. She wants my boyfriend and I to swing by there house Friday night so she can cook us dinner and have ""family time"" since ""they never get to see us"". I said yes. I am quite interested as to what they're up to now. I also want to get pictures of the inside of their house so that child services can see how they really live. 

3. I want to thank everyone for all the advice and insight. I tried to respond to everyone, but I know I missed quite a few comments, but I did read every single one. Thank you to everyone who has shown support in this situation, I really appreciate it. I will hopefully have an update for you all soon. Thank you so much!"

"I (24F) got really drunk, and my dad (55M) and his friends made fun of me and said horribly nasty things to me because they thought I was passed out. What the fuck? How do I deal with this?


Fire at my apartment so ive been staying with my parents. I went out with my friends, got pretty drunk, and came home with the spins. my dad had his friends over and right away noticed I was drunk.

I sat in a chair and felt sick and sort of passed out slowly but was still pretty concious. I heard my dad and his friends laughing at how drunk I seemed, instead of like, you know, worrying about me being sick. I heard my dad say ""shes always been a drunk, could never handle her liquor"" (interesting, considering ive never drank in front of my dad). He also said ""since she broke up with her boyfriend she put on a ton of weight, i suppose it always happens to women around her age, cant control what they eat"". Which is also interesting, considering I only gained about 20 pounds in total (I am 5'11, 20 lbs is nothing). He then went on this sort of like, sexist rant about how modern kids turn into awful people in their 20s, using my 'recent behavior' as an example. He said ""her apartment is fucked up because she did something stupid, so she just runs to her mom for help instead of helping herself"" not even mentioning to them that my apartment caught on fire as the result of a fire in the NEXT apartment over. He said I was sensitive, sheltered, lazy etc. He said ""I thought I raised her right, never thought she would be such a fucking failure, I mean look at her right now, jesus christ"". I literally earn more money than him at my job right now, but he has the audacity to call me a failure?

While I was drunk enough that I was basically slumped over with my eyes closed, at a certain point I could have gotten up but I was scared for some reason to let them know I could hear everything. So I just stayed there pretending I was asleep.

I am just so disgusted at my dad right now. I am actually genuinely astounded at the things he said about me, one, because most of it was just straight up lies, and two the fact that he would shit talk me in front of his friends that way?? What the fuck?

I honest to god thought my dad was a great guy but this just changes my entire opinion of him. Why would he do this to me? To brag to his friends? To make it seem like I am such a burden on his life? I have this horrible feeling in my stomach about him that I don't think will ever go away. He has always been such a great father to me and this just changes everything, I don't think I will ever forget those hurtful words he said. I honestly want to dead him, and never see him, ever again, but then I would be homeless until my apartment is fixed, and... well I just feel like he was such an amazing father before this moment. I have such conflicted feelings right now. How do I confront him about this? 

tl;dr: While I was passed out drunk, I heard my dad talk shit about me to his friends."

"My [40M] mother [67] intentionally ruined a long-planned and expensive Xmas surprise for my daughters [10 &amp; 12].


I live in the US, my daughters live in England. I have been setting up a huge surprise visit the day after Xmas and I’m taking them to see Hamilton in London. 

My wife, brother, mother and ex-wife knew about the plan. My mother told my brother about it yesterday, thinking he didn’t already know, and also told him it was a big secret and not to tell his nieces. 

This morning I get an excited FaceTime from my daughters about how they can’t wait to see me and go to Hamilton. They told me that Grandma told them this morning. 

I confronted my mother by text, first she said that she didn’t realize it was a secret. Then she changed her story to say that she thought that Hamilton was the only part that was a secret (which she also leaked). 

1) What would motivate a person to do this? 
2) How do I get over this crushing disappointment?
3) Do I make her explain her thinking to me or just let it go?

She has either become evil or senile overnight.

"[Update]Me [24F] with my BF [25 M] never have anything to talk about but he's constantly texting another girl.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7h3fb6/me_24f_with_my_bf_25_m_never_have_anything_to/

I guess this is really uninteresting since my post didn't get a whole lot of attention but I need to get it off my chest. Y'all were right I'll start out with. He's been cheating on me. He slept out on the couch the other night and I woke up at around 5 cuz he wasn't there and I walked out to the living room and his phone was sitting there and I got curious and peeked. He had been emailing her for weeks, because who the fuck checks emails for cheating? He left his email open. There were a ton of messages. Him and her telling each other they were falling in love, he calls her his baby girl, she calls him daddy (fucking ew) and they were talking about a Christmas party they both recently attended and he said he wished she would have driven him home so he could kiss her.

I blew up not gonna lie. I made him take screen shots and send them to me, he said if I wasn't constantly bitching he wouldn't have cheated. Then he said because of past infidelities on both our parts he was entitled to do what he wanted.

So in conclusion I got her boyfriends phone number and sent the messages to him and he also blew up. Her family blew up on her, her dad called her a whore. Her boyfriend, who is my younger brothers friend, is living with my mom now. Christmas sucked for all except my kids. I cried all day and burned my ham. So yea. Unfortunately I'm stuck in this house loan unless he will agree to sell or move or whatever which he won't. He's already trying to rugsweep.

**Tldr y'all were right And I'm an idiot.**

EDIT: Thank you some for the kind words. Others thanks for making me feel worse than I am. I am well aware I fucked up too. I'm well aware I'm as bad as him. I'm well aware we are not good for each other and should have left a long time ago but him being my first boyfriend and whatever kind of blinded me and I didn't want my kids to have to do the whole separate birthdays, Christmas holidays crap like I did my whole life and wanted to be the parent i wish I had. I messed up and i can't take it back. Doesn't mean I'm not allowed to feel upset he did this when he said everything was fine. So thank you for your judgemental attitudes. I'm sure y'all have never made a single mistake and I wish I was as perfect as you.

"Thought my boyfriend (29M) was cheating, but it turned out he was actually just buying a ring for me (30F). Turns out he bought the ring as an excuse, and instead was visiting his 'mother' who he told me was dead. What the fuck is going on exactly? How do I confront him about this?


caught my boyfriend sneaking out, and when I questioned him about it he was stumbling on his words and was clearly lying or making an excuse. His face was red, he was flustered, he couldn't even finish his sentence before he just left out. I was super confused, and I thought... he must be cheating. Like, sneaking out randomly? Not telling the truth about it? Okay, hes cheating. It just seemed obvious, like why else lie. Im not the type to like, jump to conclusions, but it was so damn suspicious. 

Except he came back, and I was standing there like ""hello, do you have an excuse?"" and then he proposed to me! right then and there. It turns out he was going to buy a ring, thats why he didnt want to tell me. All suspicion left me, we had a nice dinner, and just had a great night. 

The next week he left his phone on the counter and I saw it ring and the contact said ""mom"". I was like, what the hell? For one, his mom is dead. Like, I've heard this from his brother and cousin. I was so confused over this so I decided to just read some texts if there were some. That got me even more confused. The texts were saying ""hi, can you come over and bring this or that over?"" this or that usually being some form of groceries or something. This was the part that freaked me out the worst. A series of texts on that day he proposed, about 20 minutes before he left in a hurry saying ""Get over here now! Please! I've been waiting all day!"" and him replying ""okay mom"". 

So that was the reason he left. To see this 'mom' of his. This mom of his must be so damn secret that in order to deflect from it, he bought me a whole engagement ring. I don't know if he had plans to buy that ring either way and this was the excuse for it, but I feel... almost nasty accepting it on this premise that he was just using it as an excuse to deflect from another lie. 

So uhh. What the fuck? I don't even know how to confront him about this. What type of mom could this be? An alternative mom? Why is he bringing her groceries and all that shit? Why is he keeping this a secret? 

He is coming home in 5 hours, I want to ask him but I don't even know where to begin.

"A girl (19f) that I've known for 1 year or so asked me (20m) out, and I very politely declined her. Now she's spreading rumors around that I'm a fat shamer and a racist. I have one final left and I'm so stressed I don't know if I can take it.


Background on this, I've known ""Amanda"" for about a year and half since we live in the same dorm so we would see each other in the TV/gaming lounge and we have mutual friends. 

I always thought she was just really obnoxious and tried my best to avoid her but every so often we would end up at a party, share a ride, eat with friends, that sort of thing. My opinion on her never really changed though. Because she's so obnoxious I never once considered her as a potential date. 

Well last Thursday, she caught me after a final and basically asked me out. I was really caught off guard so I basically said that I really appreciated the offer but since I was making a special appointment with a professor to take a final this week and then heading out of town right after, it probably wasn't a good time. She then asked if I was attracted to her and I said it really didn't matter either way because I just didn't have the time--which in hindsight I should have been more diplomatic. But anyways she said ""is it because I'm fat?"" I said I really didn't have time to talk about it anymore and that I needed to focus on this last test. She basically did this like hand to my face thing (not a slap, but still made contact if that makes sense) and pushed me backwards and I actually stumbled and she walked away. 

When I got back to my room there were like 7-8 or facebook messages from all of her friends saying things like ""bigots get kicked out!"" ""fat shamer sucks"" ""wonder what the admin will think of your racism."" (for the record we ware both Hispanic, I guess maybe she doesn't know this because I have lighter skin?!?). When I went to dinner that night one of her friends saw me and made like a gun motion  with her finger to my back and said ""you'll get yours racist."" Things sort of calmed down over the weekend but just now I got like 20 texts from all sorts of random numbers saying things like ""fat shaming=r@pe"" ""don't come back next semester if you know whats good for"" and ""don't bother taking McKenzies final, racists get kicked out."" 

I just don't want to even approach her but I'm scared to death that the really are going to report me. I'm supposed to take my final tomorrow at 8 AM then drive home right after. I'm thinking I should maybe contact my professor and tell him I'm under extreme stress and can't take it. I just don't know what to do.

Do I contact my professor? What do I do about Amanda?

Edit this brew up, it got like zero responses in the first hour oe so so I just went back to studying. My professor is very understand and said that if I come in and take the test and even half way know my stuff he'll give me the grade if it's good, otherwise he'll give me the average of all my last exams (which is an A) so that's cool. I have about 10 minutes before I actually start since he's getting coffee. But my car is all packed so this is it. One person who was involved in rhe texting barrage mah habe actually seen this thread because they apologized and begged not to be reported. It's from a random number so I don't actually know who it is. So I,must screen capping everything and sending it to Somone (not sure who yet) as soon as I get settled at home.

"Update: How Do I Deal With My Racist Twin Sister?


Hi r/Relationships!

This is the original post in case anyone would like to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kkd77/how_do_i_deal_with_my_racist_twin_sister/

Now that's out of the way, I want to start off by thanking everyone for their overwhelming responses and support. It means so much. It honestly does!

My boyfriend [23M] and I [22F] will be house sitting for my best friend while she and her husband go away for the holidays. I had wanted to stay with my aunt at first but then I realized that if I stay with in my best friend's house, there's no chance of any family drop-ins. My boyfriend and I will be having a long sit down with my parents and telling them about my sister's behaviour. My aunt has said that she will be there the entire time in case my sister tries something while we're talking to them about it (you never know with her). Hopefully this Christmas goes well and we can look forward to more good ones without my sister's racism.

"My [28F] roommate [30F] eats all my food. Even the food I've hidden in my room.


I signed a year lease when I moved in with her so there's no way I can get out of this until months from now. It's only been less than 4 months and I cannot deal with this woman anymore. I think she has some kind of eating disorder. We're not especially close and I haven't known her for long, so I'm hoping for some advice about what to do that won't cause drama.

She goes on binges where she eats everything in the apartment. It doesn't matter what or where it is. She can clean out the fridge and cabinets (week or so worth of food total) in a single day. This happens at least a couple times a week. She spends all her money on takeout, fast food and cornerstore junk, then complains about how she never has any money. If she didn't have automatic payments set up she would probably not make her share of the rent each month. She's had to ask me for cash for things like gas, which after never paying back a couple times, I've stopped lending.

I've never seen anyone spend so much on food for one person, she buys like she's stocking a bunker or trying to feed a family reunion. She started taking my food shortly after I moved in, this was in September. First it was just one item going missing here or there. I thought I misplaced them or didn't remember finishing them. Then she got more brazen and would pass it off as not realizing things were mine, claiming it was on ""her side"" of the fridge. Things like that. I said if she wasn't sure then please ask me. I don't have a lot of money. She said she would. Never has. After that she more or less stopped trying to hide what she was doing at all. She's been eating everything I get for myself, on top of a half-dozen+ food trips per week for her own stuff.

Like I said it's all junkfood and I don't get much of that for myself, but that doesn't stop her. She'll eat whatever I buy. One shopping trip I deliberately bought nothing but lots of veggies and other ingredients for healthy meals like salads, omelettes and stir frys. I thought she'd leave at least some of it alone given her preference for sugars and fried food. She still ate all of it during that night. Most of her eating happens at night when I'm asleep, or in the morning when I'm in class or work. If I want to eat (like cook an actual meal, not grabbing something on the go), I basically have to buy my food and make it during a window of time in the afternoon when I'm at home while she's at her part time job. Otherwise any items I bring into the house will be eaten as soon as I'm away or asleep.
  
The last straw has been this week. I started just storing non-perishables and non-fridge items in my room. (Yes I did keep talking to her a few other times about taking my food when she kept doing it, but nothing ever changed so I gave up. I honestly think she can't control whatever problem she has.) Now I found she figured it out and has been raiding my room for food when I'm out of the house.

I may put a lock on my door (have to ask landlord first) but am I wrong for thinking it shouldn't be at this point? It's extreme and not sustainable for my budget. I was considering sitting down with her and telling her that I think she should talk to a doctor about her eating behavior. I'd of course do this calmly without anger. I think she's ill in some way and the compulsive eating is a part of it. I can't know if she's depressed, but physically she's well on her way to morbid obesity if not there already. 

If she isn't willing to talk to a professional then I'd try to get a lock for my door, but I figure I should first try encouraging her to get help.

Does this seem like a good approach? Anything else I could try? Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

*TL;DR* I live with a roommate who binge eats all my food whenever I'm asleep or not home. My past attempts at telling her to stop haven't worked, and I think she's suffering from an eating disorder or other illness. "

"My [24F] parents [50s] want to adopt a disabled child [1M]. I'm not comfortable with caring for the child when they inevitably pass away or that my current siblings will go without attention.


So my parents are going through the adoption process to adopt a toddler with down syndrome. I am one of 5 already, ranging from elementary school to high school. I was comfortable being their caregiver in the event that my parents die, because by 18, they will be full grown adults. However, I'm not comfortable being responsible for a special needs adult for the rest of his life when my parents eventually die. As I understand it, there is a strong possibility that he won't be high functioning enough to take care of himself. I'm sorry if that makes me sound selfish, but I also think it's selfish of my parents to adopt a child that will take 100% of their attention when they already have 4 other children to take care of. I'm really afraid my siblings will get even less individual attention than they get now. Not to mention, my dad is on an extended business trip out of the country for the next THREE YEARS, so it will just be my mom. 

I don't have to best relationship with my parents, so I'm not sure how to handle this. I have my adoption interview tomorrow night. How do I handle this? What do I say? I was thinking about calling my dad's sister to discuss it with her.

Title says it all, but basically, I matched with a guy who lied about his age. 

I have my age filters set for a reason, and it's not something I'm in the mood to debate. I may consider older if it were someone I met through work or school, but for the purposes of online dating, 30 is absolutely my max age.

He revealed to me his age after *two weeks* of chatting via phone. Kept making comments about how he was older, then said ""I am 36."" The app shows you your listed age basically every time you click on your profile. There's no way he did not know his age showed as 30.

So I told him he was a little too old for me and he never responded. I was morbidly curious to see if that was even his real age, so I reverse-searched his phone and found out, based on his college grad date of 1996, he is at least 42. That is with skipping some grades. I would put his estimated age at 44 - 45. 

Also, he used old photos to look much younger (ones Google search shows taken in like 2003).

This is REALLY bothering me. I know dating gets harder after 40, and I could understand someone fudging on 1 or 2 years (I wouldn't do it) so you get into the 30 - 39 bracket, but TWELVE to FIFTEEN YEARS? 

Am I morally obligated to report him to the app? He has my phone number and stuff, so I don't want to endanger myself.

"My (31F) Husband (31M) Together 9 Years Let His Step Mom (54F) Exclude Me From Gift Exchange In Our House


My husbands step mom is a real piece of work. She is always right, it is her way or the highway, and she is just miserable to be around. Her opinions are the only right ones. Step mom and Dad live out of town so this Christmas they came to stay with us. They have been here since the 23rd, I have cooked, cleaned and entertained while my husband relaxed with his Dad. I've been dealing with her constant meddling since she arrived and have been doing a great job of keeping a cheery demeanour and not letting her comments upset me.

Well Christmas day arrives and his sister and her husband were going to be coming up to visit for dinner. His step mom says ""We are not going to open any presents until Sister gets here."" Sure, whatever, that is fine.
I had a quick family thing planned for my own family that I had to go to in the early afternoon, which she knew about. While I was getting ready to go she came up to me and tossed me my gift and said ""You won't be here for the gift exchange so you can open yours now."" I laughed, thinking she must have been joking and said ""I won't be long, just a couple hours, we can all open them together.""
""We have waited long enough"" she said.
WHAT!

My mother was at our house getting ready to go with me and I told her what happened and that I wanted to leave ASAP. We went to leave and I said to Step mom ""Hey, I'm going to bring my own car to my brothers, I really want to be here for the gift exchange so can you text me when they arrive and give me 15 minutes to get here?""

She SMIRKS and says ""I will give you JUST 15 minutes."" SMIRKS.

I said ""Well I would really love it if you waited so we could all be together.""

""We waited long enough, gifts are for Christmas morning."" She says. After she wouldn't let us open our gifts this morning because we were waiting for his sister instead!?

""Well we should have opened them this morning then, I want to be there when Husband opens his gifts and when you open yours.""

She just smirks again and turns around. My mom, getting upset, cuts in and tells her basically to stuff it and we leave. My husband was outside for this whole ordeal and caught none of it so he asks us why we are storming off. We tell him and he says don't worry I will deal with this. I told him ""don't worry about it, let them open their gifts."" I had gone to 7 different stores looking for a specific gift she wanted, so I wanted to be there when they opened it and also wanted to be there when my husband opened his gifts.

My mom and I left and returned 2 hours later, dinner had not been started and everyone was sitting around chatting. They had opened all their gifts, and my husband had opened his too. The gifts we had got his parents and my gifts were the only ones unopened.

I'm deeply upset. First, that she behaved like this in my own home! I let her know twice that I wanted to be there and that they should wait, and it was ignored. Why? There was no reason not to wait.

Second, I am beyond upset that my husband did not stick up for me. I did tell him to ""go ahead"" so I guess I have no reason to be upset, but how did he just let it all happen? If the tables were turned I absolutely would have put my foot down. Even if he couldn't have stopped THEM from doing their gift exchange between the sister and them, he had every ability to NOT open his gifts and say ""I'm waiting for my wife.""

I don't know how to get over this. My husbands reason for letting it all happen is that the step mom is an awful person and the whole family just lets her get her way so that they can maintain a relationship with his father. There was no point in ""starting a fight"" and ruining Christmas. I think that is ridiculous, I understand keeping the peace and ignoring her snide comments but actually letting her exclude a member of the family for Christmas for absolutely no reason? That was taking it way too far and the fact that none of them stood up for me is so upsetting. I do not feel like a part of the family now, that is for sure. If my husband had stood up and said ""Wife really wanted to be here, can we wait?"" his sister would have said ""Yeah let's wait!""

"3 days before Christmas and I (36m) am thinking of leaving wife (36f)


We've been married 2 years.  My wife loves male attention. Before we got married there were various episodes where I was uncomfortable (her texting other men, being too flirty, etc).  I set boundaries and we understood each other (I thought).



=======================================



At the beginning of the month I received a call from her male co-worker's wife.  She had found out her husband and my wife had been extensively texting each other all of last year but it has since stopped.  She sent me some of the texts and they were very concerning.  Romantic (but not sexual) in nature.  All this was going on while we were newlyweds.



=======================================


My wife was upset and defensive and told me I was wrong.  Then she agreed they were friends but nothing more.  She then agreed they had a heated texting relationship but nothing more (which the other man's wife also says seems to be the case).


==========================================


My wife is sorry and wants to go to counselling.  She said she ended it on her own last year (but other guy tells his wife HE ended it).  When I ask her why she says it's because I was never there for her.  I don't even know how to respond to that.  We were newlyweds and I was home every single night after work.  We hung out all the time.  When I point this out she says I'm wrong.


======================================


I know it's not about me.  It's about her and her need for validation from other men.  But I'm so gutted by this.  It was not casual at all and she spoke to him the way she speaks to me.  I feel like our bond has been broken.  


========================================


Right now the problem is she wants to just get back to normal.  I have no desire to get back to normal yet.  She keeps pushing it and we get in arguments about it and when we do she becomes defensive and blames me.  She says it's my fault she became emotionally close with this man because I'm (cold, not there for her, too clueless to realize something was missing).


=======================================


When I point out that she could have talked to me if she felt something was missing she says we will have to agree to disagree.  I look at her now and I feel rage and I'm thinking I need to leave.  She said if I would really leave her days before Christmas over something that happened last year then I'm an evil person.  I don't know what to do.



=========================================

"I (24F) found out that my BF (29M) took his ex (29F) to the holiday trip he invited me but I couldn't go to. I don't know how to confront him because of the way I found out.


Carlo and I have been dating for about 10 months. 

He has an ex, Denise, they were together for about 7 years, then broke up, then 8 months after we met and started dating. However they were still in contact and even good friends since they have the same friend circle and live in the same area. I was ok with it because they were together for a long time and we just met back then.

As the months went by, Carlo and I got more serious, I even met his mom when she traveled to our town to visit him, and he talks about wanting to settle down. He even cut contact with Denise (or so I thought) because I felt like it was unnecessary for them to talk often). Things were going great, he has been a gentleman, treats me like a queen, and is a good BF. 

In november, he invited me to spend Xmas in his hometown, with his family, and I couldn't make it because of work and family reasons, so he told me he'd go alone. 

I know Denise's instagram account because I admit that when I met him and looked through his posts, and found pictures of Denise with a username tag. I never looked at it again though.

Last night I couldn't sleep, I had a weird feeling, and I was looking at his instagram profile and came accross Denise's old pics and snooped in her profile out of curiosity. Turns out she posted a couple of videos and pictures with the location tag of Carlo's hometown, where he ""went by himself"" for the holiday.

I was giving it the benefit of the doubt until I played one of the videos of her doing something, and Carlo's voice was in the background (he was recording). I don't think I ever felt my blood boil like last night. I didn't sleep at all because I was so upset. This morning, he texted me as usual (he's been texting me romantic stuff and ""I miss you"" ever since he left) and I replied out of courtesy, but low key I wanted to give him shit about it so much. But I didn't, and I'm just not talking to him.

I want to confront him when he comes back, we even had plans for NYE together but I already cancelled those. I just don't know what to tell him. I'm definitely not proud of snooping on his ex's profile, and he might think that I stalk her or something. But it was all a gut feeling, and I was right, and now there is evidence.

I know I should probably just walk away, but I don't want to remain quiet in this situation. I am very angry and I feel betrayed and a fool. What do I do?

TLDR: Carlo (BF) dated Denise (ex) for about 7 years, I met him when he was single for 8 months and started dating. I was never angry at the fact that they were friends because I met his mom and things seemed to go pretty serious between us. He invites me for a Xmas trip, I decline, and last night I snooped around in Denise's instagram and find out that she is actually over there with him. So he took her instead of me, and never mentioned anything. He's acting like nothing has happened, but now I am very upset. How do I confront him when he comes back and we meet? I am embarrassed of bringing up the fact that I was nosy and that's how I found out. "
"Gf [24F] is incapable of basic tasks due to her anxiety/depression. I [25M] was out of town for one weekend and she nearly killed my dog with neglect. Is this relationship salvageable?

"My [16/M] brother's [20/M] girlfriend [19/F] wants to cheat on him with me. I don't know how to handle the situation without making a huge mess.


My brother and his girlfriend have been staying at my parents’ house for the holidays/new years. They've been together for a year. I didn't talk to his girlfriend Kate much for the first few days when they arrived, but eventually she opened up to me and we started talking.

She confided in me about problems in her relationship with my brother. I told her I couldn't give any advice because I was always going to be biased towards my brother. She expressed not being happy with their relationship and wanting to leave. I thought in my head how inappropriate this conversation was but I didn't feel like stopping it. 

Yesterday my parents went on their date night and my brother was out of the house hanging out with his guy friends. Kate and I were the only ones in the house. I was on my computer when she started asking me a series of inappropriate questions. She asked if I was a virgin. I said I was, then she asked me what I thought having sex felt like. I felt uncomfortable so I politely asked her to stop. She didn't listen, and these questions culminated into her saying she wanted to take my virginity. I told Kate it was wrong for her to want to cheat on my brother, and that I didn't even want to have sex with her anyways.

Kate further attempted to convince me. She reasoned that having sex with her would be good experience for me, and that my brother would “never have to know about it.” She tried kissing me, but I immediately stopped her and left to go to my room. 

I’ve been holed up in my room since I woke up this morning. My brother asked me an hour ago if I was okay, but I was too scared to tell him what Kate did, so I lied to him. I know I need to tell him, he’s my brother and I love him. I’d never keep something like this away from him. 

What is the best way to handle this situation? If I tell my brother our household is going to be a mess. Kate and my brother are going to argue with each other, and they will be insufferable to be around. I don't want my parents and I to be subjected to that, but at the same time I need to let my brother know about his girlfriend’s terrible behavior.

**TL;DR:** My brother and his girlfriend are staying over for the holidays/new years. His girlfriend expressed not being happy in their relationship to me. Yesterday she started asking me inappropriate questions, which led to her saying she wanted to cheat on my brother with me.

We've been dating since we were 15, living together since 2010 and have supported each other through a lot of rough shit.  I should have asked her years ago but I low-key have always felt that I don't deserve the love of such a wonderful woman.  I always wanted to wait til I was rich and famous because her family is sort of well-to-do and I, well I'm just not.  I realise that's not a reasonable goal anymore and I want her to know I love her as much as she loves me.

"I’m [22M] concerned and kind of disgusted by my boyfriends of 9 months [28M] choice of engagement “ring.”


Throwaway account because my boyfriend may use reddit, I’m not sure. 

He wants to buy me a collar. Like a studded dog collar and call it an engagement ring and expects me to wear it in public. He says he sees no difference between a ring and a dog collar. 

I’ll admit that my boyfriend and I don’t have a typical relationship. We’re in more of an older-bro/little bro type thing. We have never been into pup play (which is where I’m assuming the collar comes from) at all. 

The conversation started off with us talking about buying a collar. It’s something I’d be somewhat interested in for use in the bedroom, I won’t lie. A few months ago we briefly talked about what kind of more kinky stuff we’d be into. I showed a slight interest in pup play but never took it any further than the 5 minute conversation we had. 

I don’t mind wearing a collar for him in the privacy of our own home. But, he wants me to wear it in public too. I do not feel comfortable expressing the dynamic of our relationship in public. I told him exactly that, and he turned it into me being closed minded and how I’m uncomfortable with being myself, along with being dishonest and lying to people about our relationship. IMO, me being myself and honest about us has nothing to do with expressing our sex life in public. That’s just too personal for me. 

I just don’t appreciate showing off the dynamic of our relationship in public. Expressing my love for him in public is one thing, but I do not feel comfortable expressing that with a collar at all. I would prefer something more traditional, like a ring. But, I don’t feel like he respects my feelings about it at all since he flipped out because of me telling him that I was uncomfortable. 

Other than that our relationship has been fine. This is the first argument we’ve ever had. 

Honestly I’ve been contemplating leaving him because of this. I don’t want to feel like he “owns” me, which is exactly how I feel about him even bringing up the collar. 

 I just need some advice on what to do or say. I’m honestly appalled by the fact he even brought it up. 

TL;DR - boyfriend brought up the idea of proposing to me with a dog collar. I’m not into it and he got mad because I’m being “closed-minded.”

Update: He apologized for acting the way he did. Collars are off the table. And he actually apologized for overstepping my boundaries with the kink stuff. 

Since this is his first offense, I think I’ll give him another chance lol. He’s always been very respectful of my boundaries and how I feel. This is the only time he’s acted this way. But, if it becomes a problem in the future I don’t think this will work between him and I. 


Update 2: nvm dumped him. "

"My (19f) roommate (18f) acts like our dorm room is only hers and only wants things her way.


I (19f) was originally placed in a dorm room with 5 other girls, but requested a new room due to anxiety and switched rooms a week and a half into the semester. My roommate (18f), Ally, and I were randomly put together. Before I moved into our dorm, my roommate didn't have a roommate and lived in the room by herself. 

Ally seems to think that since she has lived there a week and a half longer than me, she has seniority over me or something; she literally said to me ""it was my room first"" a couple of times (we pay the same amount for housing....)

She's pretty controlling about our room, doesn't really compromise, -and wants her terms and conditions to be absolute. 

For example, at the beginning of the semester, Ally emphasized the fact that she didn't want any alcohol in our room whatsoever. I was disappointed, but I said fine. Then, about three weeks ago, she briefly mentions in passing  that her boyfriend (21m) is going to bring her alcohol. I was and still kind of am livid; she made a whole big deal about there being no alcohol in our room and didn't even discuss with me changing the rules about it. 

She also goes to bed every night around 10 and wants lights out by 9:30 every night. She wakes up via an alarm at 7 AM, turns on the lights, and makes a lot of noise getting ready. I've told her that she wakes me up and to please not turn the lights on, but she still does it. 

The only time I'm ever woken up before her was when I was going home for the weekend. I dropped a metal water bottle, it made a loud noise, and she later made a snarky comment to me about how I woke her up. 

She also FaceTimes her bf in our room every night from like 6 to 9:30. It gets kind of annoying after a while, but I don't say anything and just deal with it. I was pissed though because during finals week, I was in the library all day, came back to our dorm, and texted my roommate that I was studying in our room  and I'd prefer it to be quiet so I could focus. She comes back like 20 minutes later, face timing her bf in our dorm. 

This annoys me because I have come into the room before and said a brief hi to her, only for her to say ""I'm doing work right now, don't talk to me"" 

I'm on winter break right now and want to know how I should deal with this next semester because I'm getting tired of it real fast. 

TL;DR: my (19f) roommate (18f) wants things her way and only her way. I'm tired  of it.  What do I do? "
"My boyfriend [25M] says that I'm not ""naturally attractive"". I'm [20F] really hurt but he says I'm overreacting.


My BF and I have been dating for 5 months. Before him, I never dated or really even talked to guys. I was (and still am) shy, introverted, and have low self esteem. People would tell me I'm pretty and that I should be a model but deep down inside I always thought I was ugly. 

Then my BF came along. He is a very handsome guy, tall and athletic and smart. I never in a million years would have imagined that somebody like him would even give someone like me a second glance. But he did, he asked me out, and now we're a couple. 

The first couple of months have been great. I love him. He told me that he loves me too. I thought it was too good to be true and I guess that it is. Because yesterday he hurt my feelings very badly. 

We had a dinner date planned yesterday. I was rushed and didn't have time to do makeup. When he came over to my place to pick me up, I could tell that he was in a bad mood. Not sure why. But the first thing out of his mouth was ""I think you're forgetting something."" I asked him what he meant and he was like, ""Why aren't you wearing any makeup?""

I told him I didn't have any time and he said that it was ok, our reservation could wait, that I do have time to ""do something to my face"". I told him it wasn't such a big deal. Then he said, ""Well, for naturally attractive women, maybe not.""

I was extremely stunned and hurt and asked whether this meant that he thought I was ugly. He seemed surprised by my reaction and told me that its totally okay to not be attractive, and that ""not everyone can be a hot blonde with D cups"". Double whammy because I'm a skinny, black-haired girl with a flat chest. He tried to justify himself by saying that he was just trying to be honest with me and that he personally thinks I'm pretty but that the ""general population"" may not think so. 

This interaction really fucked me up, to put it mildly. I've never been called unattractive before, and I certainly never expected to be called that by my own boyfriend. It kind of confirms my worst fears. I've always rated myself a generous 5/10 but apparently that's too high. I feel like I've been lied to my whole life by my family, friends, etc when they called me pretty. I also feel like I don't deserve to be dating my boyfriend because he is beautiful and I'm not. 

I haven't talked to my BF since last night and I've been ignoring his messages and calls. I've basically been crying in my room all day. He's texted me and he thinks I'm overreacting to what he said, that I ""misinterpreted"" his words and that I shouldn't be so offended.

I don't know what to do. What little self esteem I had is now completely and utterly gone. I don't know if I can ever feel good about myself again. I know this sounds drastic but its true. I don't even want to look at my boyfriend because it reminds me that I'm ugly and don't deserve him.

What should I do? Should I just break up with him? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 5 months called me unattractive. Completely destroyed my self image. I think I should break up with him for his sake but I still love him.

"UPDATE I [27F] 'saved' my friend's [28F] dog, she gave me a large amount of money and won't take it back


Original here- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7lo5hz/i_27f_saved_my_friends_28f_dog_she_gave_me_a/

Long story short, I saved my friends dog from a fire that happened while dog sitting and she put a large sum of money in my account via my mother's permission after I refused it. That thread was locked (?) but I looked over the responses this morning before I went to town and it led me to thinking stuff over.

I got a lot of helpful advice on this (and some unhelpful) and it really did bring in perspective with how I'd been acting. I do love Jane a lot but as many users pointed out I was refusing to accept her gift/thanks for saving her pet out of pride and straining everything due to just not accepting she wanted to repay me for saving something priceless to her. 

No one really wants to be told they're a stubborn ass or a brat but as many of you pointed out that's how I've been behaving, especially since this whole incident has been dragging out for some time due to me letting my pride get in the way of my friendship and Jane's desire to repay me, which I'd basically spurned with my attitude.

The comment saying I was valuing my pride over my friendship with her was especially jarring and it certainly made me look over my past behaviour and I admit they are correct- I was letting my own sense of pride and sense of independence turn into offense over Jane repaying me for saving her beloved pet. She had truly done it with no vindictive meaning but I had turned it into some type of 'pity gift' which it really wasn't since Jane is not that type of person. I've unintentionally turned her gesture of thanks into some prolonged unnecessary drama because of my pride. It kinda stung to see commentors say I was a jerk or acting like a brat but after some thought and going over my behaviour in the last weeks I'm kinda ashamed to admit you guys were right- I was making mountains out of molehills and strained my relationships with two people dear to me because I couldn't get my head out of my ass and just accept her gift.

I then spoke with my mother over lunch and we had a talk about it and I apologized for shouting at her previously but mentioned I had issues with her accepting Jane's money without telling me- long story short, we agreed we both did things that hurt the other, but also agreed we needed to get over it (me especially.) since it didn't have severe issues. My mom said she didn't want to seem like she went behind my back but at the same time she had felt I was overreacting to an attempted kind gesture from a friend- which I had been, since I was basically acting like a fed up teen or trying to see a 'hook/insult' in Jane's gift. 

With that in mind I called Jane and invited her over during New Years (since she's spending Xmas with her parents) and she agreed. The phone call was short, but I intend to apologize to her when we meet up and I felt a phone call was fairly impersonal due to the way I've been acting. I'm still feeling fairly emotionally iffy but I've decided to take the advice given on here- I'm going to accept her gift, give her thanks for it and apologize for being an ass. I've just made everything worse due to fighting it so much and didn't really realize how bad it was until people on here pointed it out so bluntly. I value Jane's friendship a lot and agree- it isn't worth loosing due to my injured pride 

A redditor also suggested I give Jane a picture of Scooby, so I did a browse of Jane's facebook and got bunch of pictures of her pooch printed out and then brought some frames. Over Christmas I'm going to doll it up (since my mother is arty) to personalize it then give it to Jane as a means of apology.

tl;dr: Thought over what you guys said and agree my pride was really getting in the way of a great friendship since Jane was being sincere- I've invited her over for New Years and hopefully can patch up from the fighting and I intend to apologize and give her a personalized photo set. Thanks for the advice and have a good Christmas! "

"I [30/F] want to cut ties with my biological father [53/M] who tried to sabotage my wedding


Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented on my post!  I really appreciate it.  I did call my grandparents, and they didn't even bring up my dad.  I would like to think that I'm a person who gives everyone a benefit of the doubt, and that's what I have been doing in regards to my father.  I'm so happy everything got resolved, and yes, I'm truly cutting ties with my father.  I have thought about it for 3 months now, and I know I will have a more stable life without having any contact with him.  Thank you again. Happy holidays!  

.
.

Just as reference, my biological father walked out on my mom and I when I was 3 years old.  I was raised by my mom and my step-dad who was the true father figure in my life.  They got married when I was 9 years old. 

My mom and stepdad never prevented me from having a relationship with my biological father.  In fact, neither of them have spoken badly about my father at all.  They always tried their best to keep a fair, neutral relationship with him so that I wasn't negatively affected by the situation while growing up.

My biological father never had a genuine interest in getting to know me as a person.  He never calls or tries to come visit me. On top of everything else, he is a full blown alcoholic, and when we do talk, he is usually drunk.

When I do make the point to call him, the conversation is always about him, what he wants, what he is interested in, how his life is going, etc.  He never asks about how I am doing, and if the topic just happens to be about me, it usually ends with him giving me unnecessary life advice.  

For example, he's never been to college, and I'm finishing up my Ph.D. He will give me a long list of advice about how to get a Ph.D. and what I should be doing with it.  It's really unhelpful. 

Anyways, even though he has always been a self-centered asshole of a father, I still have tried very hard to include him in big events of my life.  I did that because his parents (my paternal grandparents) did help significantly in raising me, and I have a strong relationship with them.  

However, when he does show up to these big events, he makes a point to ruin my day.  

At my high school graduation, he was upset that I wasn't going to a top-tier school (I was accepted to one but didn't want to take out loans) and wasn't the valedictorian (I was 5th in my graduating class). 

At my college graduation everyone already knew I was going to start my Ph.D. program.  He joked that I will never finish my Ph.D. because getting a Ph.D. is a long process, and he said that he knows I don't have what it takes to make it through. He said this at the dinner table in front of everyone there.

Then at my wedding three months ago, he really tried to ruin my big day.  I would like to mention that he made a huge deal about what he was going to wear.  He uses all of his money on alcohol, so he said he didn't have the money to buy nice clothes.  I didn't want to exclude him from the celebration, so I rented him a tuxedo that was identical to my stepdad's and my father-in-law's.   

Our wedding was basically a stay-cation, so a lot of the guests arrived 2-3 days before the big day.  My father arrived early, too, and complained about missing days of work, and then proceeded to get plastered drunk everyday.  He couldn't even stand up.  He kept falling on the floor because he was so drunk.

I tried having a conversation with him about not drinking so much, but he was dismissive with my comments, so I stopped talking about it. 

Then at the rehearsal dinner, he told me that he didn't want to wear the tuxedo for the wedding.  He said he tried it on, and it was uncomfortable.  I asked if he had a different set of clothes to wear, and he pointed to his t-shirt and jeans and said that he was going to wear that to the wedding.  

When I told him ""no,"" his response was, ""I'M YOUR FATHER, AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM.""  I put this in capital letters because he screamed those words at me. 

That was the last straw.  Honestly, I have been dealing with him for the last 30 years and tried my hardest to let it all go, but this time it was much different.  

I will totally admit it.  I let him have it.  I specifically brought up everything wrong he has purposefully done to me, and I told him he was a horrible father and a person.  I meant it, and I don't regret sticking up for myself.  

He said we should cut ties, and I agreed.  I don't think that was response he was looking for because when I agreed with his statement, his mouth fell open.  He mentioned it first, I just acknowledged. 
  
The next day (wedding day), he packed his bags and left without saying anything.  Everyone was shocked except for my mom and me. 

I don't care if I never see my father again. It may sound cold, but I think it's the best choice for my well-being.  

The only thing worries me is my relationship with my grandparents.  I haven't called them for the past 3 months because I know they will be sad about what happened. They weren't at the wedding because they live in a different country and traveling would have been too difficult for their old age. 

I don't care about my father, but I do care about them.  My grandparents are in their mid-80's, and I know they won't be around much longer.  I don't want to stress them out in their old age.  What do I do here?  Do I fake a relationship with my father for my grandparents' sake?  Do I just tell them the truth even though they might take my father's side?

"Me [28/F] marrying my ex [27/M]. Everyone thinks it's a mistake. Did we make one?


I dated ""Rob"" for 2 years but our timing sucked. He was always busy with school and work, we tried to make it work, but things just could never come together for us. About a year ago, we broke up and it was the hardest/worst thing I went through and I had a real shit 2017. 

Last spring, I got hurt in an accident and was in the ICU for weeks and a rehab hospital until early summer. My mother and father are both very squeamish, so they visited me as often as they could handle, which was once a day for an hour or two. I was alone a lot, I couldn't breathe on my own, I was scared, etc. Rob came by and seeing that I was alone, cleared his schedule and stayed with me. He helped me tremendously throughout my entire recovery, we'd spend long spells just chatting. He would help me eat and bathe, he would bring little gifts for the nurses and took detailed notes and impressed doctors with his adeptness. He was everything someone could have wanted in that minute. 

I moved back in to our old place to recuperate and because I couldn't afford rent on my own anymore, he helped with bills, handled the logistics of everything and one night we just couldn't help it. We had sex (sometime around late-June), it was achy and pretty slow, but that basically re-kindled everything. I stayed in our old place (haven't moved out, rather I moved back in fully) and a couple of weeks ago, he asked me to marry him and I gleefully accepted. 

My mom and dad are happy, they think he's great and glad we're together, but everyone else just can't be happy for us. Aunts, uncles, my brothers &amp; sister, and almost all my friends. ""There's a reason you two broke up!"" is what they keep saying. We committed to prioritizing our life together, he's finished his professional program and is working again full time, and we've changed what we couldn't before. I'm honestly happy and this feels right. But eveeryone is saying it' wrong. 

Did we fuck up? Should we have just stayed friends? I am starting to doubt myself.

tl;dr Engaged to my formerly ex-boyfriend after we rekindled our relationship. Broke-up because of bad timing, but things changed after I got hurt. Feels right/everyone says it's wrong. Now I'm doubting myself. "

"My wife’s (25 f) twin sister (25 f) and her boyfriend (55 m) have said lewd things to her. We find this bothersome. How do we handle this?


My wife’s twin sister and her boyfriend say they often fantasize about her in a threesome with them. They role play in the bedroom using this as fuel for their fantasies. 

We both find this bothersome and disgusting.  They have been together 1 year. My wife and I (30 m) have been married for 4 years.

The boyfriend has also said some inappropriate and flirtatious things to my wife when I’m not around. She also thinks he “accidentally” touched her breast when hugging her goodbye recently. 

How do we handle this? My wife wants her sister to be happy who has had a rough few years in her romantic life, but we find the behavior and comments inappropriate.  Her last long term relationship ended when she found out her boyfriend slept around and stole a lot of money from her.

We are most bothered about their fantasies and role playing. We know we probably can’t change their behavior behind closed doors. 

What should we do? We are trying our best to be harmonious and cordial. 

**TL;DR** sister-in-law and her boyfriend are being creepy and disrespectful. What do we do?"
