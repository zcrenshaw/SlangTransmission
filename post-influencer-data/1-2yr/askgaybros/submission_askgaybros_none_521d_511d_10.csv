"Accepting his lispy gender presentation...


He's the perfect guy for me in everyway. Sexually, intellectually, religiously, lovingly.
But he is an over the top, lispy, limp wristed stereotype. I'm quite the opposite, very masculine, and have mostly been with guys similar to that profile. When we go out in public, the moment he opens his mouth, every breathing person in the room thinks, ""wow he's super gay"". But it's cool. Once you find someone who is loyal, honest, who is a good fit, the awkwardness of bring exosed gets melted away by the bond of feeling a strong multifaceted connection with another human being. I guess this is the definition of acceptance. "
"What's the funniest thing that's happened to you during sex?


I was at my FWB's house the other day and we played a couple of games of FIFA before we got to it. Anyway, we started fucking and it was getting really intense, he was topping me and we were kissing passionately, moaning and holding eachother. Then, all of a sudden, he broke off the kiss and said, still thrusting, ""I don't even like FIFA."" It was so fucking random I could do nothing but burst out laughing as he continued to thrust, seemingly unaware that what he had just said was absolutely not relevant at that moment.

So, anyone here have any funny sex stories?"
"You aren’t some kind of gay icon because you treat feminine guys like human beings.


Lol... every few days there’s a post where a masc guy becomes woke and then realizes that fem guys are people too! Like what?? No fuckin way!!

Congrats bitch. Do you seriously want a medal for treating a human being like a human being? The fact that you ever thought that fem guys were just fags and bottoms to begin with is shameful.

It’s condescending and this sub eats it up every. single. time because the truth is, IRL most of you are feminine guys that seek and crave nothing more than the validation of a masc daddy.

"I'm getting gay ads on Facebook even though I'm not out. I must've clicked on a dick somewhere. It's a dating app called Romeo for LGBT and it makes me happy. Caught by gay cookies.


Cambridge analytica have got hold of my gay cookies."
"I just got called an ape on Grindr because I’m black


I’m not mad lol. It was a good laugh because I was honestly surprised. This guy went on a rant on how black people are ugly and awful and should still be slaves. I promptly reported him lol. 

He was right about one thing though, stereotypical as it is. I do love me some fried chicken lol"
"When guys lift up up their shirts in their Grindr profile pics and there's no abs just their tummies, I find that to be adorable.


Does anyone feel the same way? I dunno, it's just that boyish softness in gay guys combined with confidence that really wanna make me want to hug or cuddle them."
"Saw a Tinder bio: ""Gregory. Greg for short. Grego for medium."" Actually thought it was really funny.


Never laughed at a Tinder bio before, lmfao. Plus originality points. I felt like this needed to be shared."
"This sub is such a mixed bag.


You have people sharing how lonely it is as a gay man, and looking for answers, but then you have people sharing a story about how their asshole fell out at the supermarket after getting fisted the night before. "
"My long-distance relationship is ending...


...because my boyfriend got a job in my town!

I have been dating him for over year and we moved to long distance when we finished college moved to different towns. It has been a challenging year, but I am very excited that we’re going to be in the same place again!"
"Gaybros of reddit, what’s the cringiest way a guy has ever tried to flirt with you or pick you up?


For me it’s definitely this: I was at a gay bar one night after work by myself because my friend who I was planning on meeting was running late. Nbd, I’ll save him a seat and get started drinking, make a friend or two. Cue douchebag. He was actually pretty cute which is why I didn’t tell him immediately I was saving the seat for my friend. Maybe 5 years older than me or so (I’m 22) which is fine, I have no issue with that. He sits down and starts a normal enough conversation, but it soon turns to him belittling my opinion of literally everything from my favorite cocktail to my favorite baseball team (no, asshole, the fact that I’ve lived in New York for a few years doesn’t make it “really stupid” that I’m still a brewers fan after having grown up there). He then proceeds to tell me that it’s “cute” how I’m not afraid to be so publicly wrong about all those things (all of which are total opinion based preference things like my favorite drink and team and band and stuff) and he likes when guys don’t try to “pretend to be smart” and asks for my number. I decline. He starts yelling, and the bartender, who’s been watching this whole thing, tells him to back off. Starts yelling at the bartender, and the bouncer comes over and shoves him out the door. My friend who I was meeting shows up a few minutes later. Bartender gets me a free drink for my trouble and we all get to talking and he actually becomes one of our best friends over the next few months, turns out we’ve got a lot in common. So at least I got that out of the whole uncomfortable awkward situation. 

But seriously, who doesn’t love being told they’re dumb for 15 minutes for their opinions and then told its “cute” that they’re dumb? /s

Anyone else got stories like this?"
"Pretty siked


Hey ya'll

Just want to brag for a quick sec. 

So I went on a date with a guy I met off Tinder that I thought was really cute. We talked and laughed and really seemed to hit it off. The icing on the cake of this date was that at the end of the date I was walking him to his car and he grabbed me and we started making out. Now this may not seem like such a big deal but to me it was HUGE. I just started to accept my sexuality fully this year and to make out with a man that I find so attractive in front of maybe 15+ people made me feel so confident in myself. 

It's crazy to think that 2 years ago I never even considered dating a man, let alone making out with one in front of a group of people. I hope it works out with this guy but if not I'm still super proud of myself for truly accepting myself and not giving a damn who sees."
"TIL the true struggle that is douching


The human anus is a disgusting and frustrating thing and you tops should appreciate all the hard work bottoms do to have a clean ass."
"I’m coming out in 10 minutes


Holy shit. I’m so nervous and scared. Fuck. Wish me luck. "
"Just thought you guys would get a laugh (or an idea) from this submission in /r/funny

"Do you guys ever think dirty thoughts of guys you are casually having a conversation with?


I was playing soccer, and I didn't understand offsides.

So some guy comes up to explain it to me, as he is explaining it

I'm just nodding my head and saying ""yes"".

but I'm really thinking ""damn, he's cute I'd love to fuck him until he moans and tries to get away""
