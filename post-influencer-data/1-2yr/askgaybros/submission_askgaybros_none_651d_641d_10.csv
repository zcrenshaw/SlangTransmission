"As requested: Here's my tumblr with 100+ drawings of dick pics I got thru Grindr


[1000 DICK DRAWINGS](https://1000dickdrawings.tumblr.com/).

So far, I've posted 120 illustrations of dick pics I've done. I have ~10 that I was sent today and yesterday, so I have some catching up to do, but I have other things to do first. I'm submitting some artwork and writing to my university's magazine for consideration for publication next spring. A collage of 100 of these illustrations would be one of these things (which is the first post you'll see when you go to my tumblr.)

For a lot of these drawings I also include commentary on them. Spoiler alert: I've never done anything sexually with any of these guys in person. However, I have sexted with a couple of them. Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary. 

I will be busy drawing in the meantime, but I can't wait to read what you guys think. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And yes, I WILL draw your dick. It'd be my pleasure. I'm up to draw full bodies, kissing, sex, etc. I'm open to a lot! :)

"Austria allows homosexual marriage starting with 2019


The wording ""of a different sex"" gets removed from the marriage law and same-sex unions will be open to heterosexuals in the future.  

The judges considered the wording and two different forms of ""marriage/union"" for heterosexuals and homosexuals as discriminatory.  

Mom told me I am never gonna get married ever because only men and women can marry each other. Gotta rustle her jimmies with this later."

"UPDATE: I came out to my brother, and his reaction was less than ideal.


Yesterday, I wrote this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7gf2oi/i_came_out_to_my_brother_and_his_reaction_was/

I had no idea that it would receive such a huge response. So I wanted to thank everyone for their kind comments and messages. I really didn’t expect or deserve such an outpouring of support. 

Unfortunately, I can’t say the same about my family. My text conversation with my brother only got worse before he blocked my number. But even his reaction was mild compared to my parents’ reaction. Suffice it to say that my boyfriend and I will be spending Christmas alone this year (his family rejected him as well) and most likely many years ahead. He’s been consoling me since yesterday.

I really appreciated hearing from people whose families were initially unsupportive but eventually came around. I understand that it’s a tough pill to swallow and it’s partially my fault for springing it on them so suddenly. I was just tired of hiding. 

Thanks again.

Edit: A few people asked for more details about my parents' reaction. I responded in the comments, but I'll put my response up here as well. My father called me a disgusting faggot and warned that I was going to get a torn rectum and AIDS. He accused me of being a child molester and asked really invasive and derogatory questions about my sex life. He was emphatic that homosexuality was a choice and he would never accept it. He blamed my mother for coddling me. My mother said that I shouldn't expect some namby-pamby coming out party like on television and called me selfish for choosing a sordid disease-ridden lifestyle over my own parents. They said they would be ostracized from the family and expressed concern for my brother's reputation. Needless to say they're preparing to disown me."
"BF Caught on Grinder


Caught my bf of 11 years on Grinder. Set up a fake account and he sent me a pic of his dick in not one but two different assholes. Showed him the pic and ended our relationship. "
"I got picked up at a bar!


So Thursday I had posted about this dilemma I was in and decided that I was gonna go get a drink and some food at a local gay bar. Got there, took a seat at the bar and tried to order a sandwich but the bartender said they stopped serving food at 10pm (I had just missed it by a few minutes). He went over to the cook and came back saying that he can make me something (awesome customer service!). 

So I ordered my food and a beer. This guy about two chairs down asks how my night's going (Let's call him L). Now he's moderately attractive (6'1"", white, average build) and I think he's just being nice since we're both there alone so I tell him about my dilemma. About halfway through another guy shows up and sits next to him (I'm thinking the BF, call him G) and I finish the story. 

The three of us talk about what we do, other pleasantries, and the LGBT community here. After a while G tells L something then leaves the bar. Apparently he was checking out some other guy at the bar and I sat down in his view and the guy left. He was jealous of L that he was talking to me and went to a different bar. 

So me and L finished up and decided that we would meet G at the other bar. We close our tabs and head for the exit. Right at the door L says something but I barely hear him. He then pulls me into him and we start making out hard. I had no clue he was interested; I just thought he was being friendly! We go to the other bar where more making out ensues (G wasn't there) and eventually his place where we just groped, cuddled, and fell asleep.

I know that is effectively a humble brag, but after constantly being ignored and rejected on Grindr, ok Cupid, and tinder night after night, I'm just happy to know that someone can find me attractive and I'm not resigned to apps to meet people. I guess I'm saying don't be afraid to go out and be amongst your fellow bros. I went out for food and a beer and ended up in bed with someone. You never know what'll happen!"
"Does the use of ""gay"" in place of the word ""bad"" or ""stupid"" bother you?


Lately it has been bothering me, that and a few other things that are subtely homophobic in nature, but not meant with malice, at least amongst straight friends who only have me as far as lgbt friends go, or with people that don't know i'm gay. I'm not sure how much it **should** bother me, i definitely don't want people to not feel comfortable to talk freely around me, but it leaves me feeling unnerved and like I'd rather just hang out with lgbt friends instead.

Edit: wow, so many different takes on this, i'm glad my question created some discussion, thank you all for replying, I've come to a few conclusions and solutions because of it, hope it can do the same for any of you who aren't completely sure on the matter. "
"I came out to my room mates and people at school!


Im 13 and started at boarding school this year and have to share a dorm with 3 people last night we were all talking about stuff and relationships and girls came up and one of my room mates made a joke calling me gay (not in a mean way) and i sort of just said ""heh true"" and they were all like ""oh really?"" but everyone has been really nice about it so far and a few more people found out today and i think people already sort of knew i was but it feels so good not having it as a secret any more! :D"

"Dear gay men, it's OKAY to be DEPRESSED &amp; LONELY. Not fitting into gay society. December Downer Rant


Just want to share some of my experiences as I approach 23 next week ( December 10 ) and how some of you beautiful men out there may relate. Depression seems to be quite the taboo among men these days along the gay community because of how many men think they have to have the perfect body ( 6-pack, a certain height, certain eye color, being muscular, etc ). along being pressured to sleep around. For me being lonely, single, and never been on a date in my life, I try my best to not let it get to me and being the best me as I can be than changing my personality for a guy to fall in love with me. Btw, December is the worst month for my bipolar mood because of my traumatic past of being molested and not having any friends to hangout with for my birthday which is why I stopped giving a damn about birthdays lol. 

I had a long talk with an old close high school friend of mine ( he's straight btw ), on how we both relate to our struggles for loneliness, meltdowns, and even making it out everyday with our battles as we left high school. Sadly, I do care what other guys think of me which I'm currently working on myself as a person after having a little meltdown in public and still trying to push through after talking to a friend on the phone today. 

Depression shouldn't make a guy weak, feel demasculated if I spelt it correctly, a burden, or even a wuss for being human. Heck, I'm more on the feminine side, having a geeky personality, and cry easily depending on the situation. More guys need to be loved &amp; valued for who they are and not for the way they should act just because of their gender to be manly, being pressured to have sex if they aren't sexually active / asexual, and or emotional.

"I got a guy's number at a party!


I'm posting this here because it's probably the smoothest thing I've ever done and nobody saw it happen but my friend and she was too drunk to notice at the time. 

Anyway, on Saturday night I was at a work party (seasonal job, big goodbye party every year) and I was standing near the dance floor drinking a beer and talking when I noticed this guy dancing. We had worked together a few times so I knew him and I always thought he was extremely hot and friendly. Well, before I knew what I was doing I put my beer down, popped some gum in my mouth and walked up to him. 

I wasn't sure what I was planning, he's pretty masculine so I didn't know for sure whether he liked guys or not, so after a minute or so of talking I leaned in and just asked if he was straight. He made a kind of ""eh, not really"" gesture with his hand and said, ""why, you trying to hit me up?"" To which I said ""yeah, kind of."" He then took my phone and gave me his number.

I haven't spoken to him since the party but even if he doesn't hit me up I'm still kind of proud of myself for doing that since I had never actually gotten someones number like that before and I'm usually pretty shy (I reeeeally hope he gets back to me though).

Thanks for reading bros."

"There's a lot of depressed bros here. Wanna talk or at least have something nice said to you?


Noticed the overwhelming theme of loathing and depression, also massive trolling. Figured I might as well try and bring a bit of sunshine into your day if you're feeling down and want someone to listen or need something positive said about you. I'll reply to everyone as much as possible just in case it *actually* helps even one person feel a little better today.

**Edit:**  Wanted to let people know that if they don't get a snappy response it's cause I am doing irl stuff; I'm not ignoring anybody. I'll be checking this thread a lot to make sure I reply to everyone kind enough to open up and post. Cheers!

**Edit 2:** I'm still going through and responding to everyone. Got a lot of people commenting so it's taking awhile =) Want to make sure I put the effort in to give everyone the best response I can and not a half-hearted feedback because I'm getting tired!"
