"Jackpot! I have a slave cleaning my apartment right now.


Messaged a guy on grindr who likes to be treated like a literal slave. So I'm having him clean my apartment and there is no expectation of sex or anything. He just calls me sir and follows all of my orders. I love it. The kink community is a good resource guys. "
"Thank you, ASKGAYBROS


Last night I had a lengthy conversation with my brother about his bullies and he agreed to let me to talk to our parents about it. My brother was with me at the time and when I was talking my dad interrupted me and asked my brother if he was gay. My brother looked startled but admitted he was gay and started to cry. My dad hugged him and ensured him that he loved him and the fact he was gay changed nothing. 

We are still talking over what our course of action will be but my brother is so over the moon that we all accept him and love him and he knows that we will make the situation much better for him to handle. 

Thank you so much everyone who commented and those who upvoted my post. You all helped myself and my brother. "
"To Our Young Gay Bros Who Use Grindr/Scruff/Etc


I've been following a case out of California about a 19yo boy who went missing last week.  They found his body in a drainage pipe yesterday and it looks like it was a Grindr hook-up gone wrong.  

Details are sketchy at this point but he apparently called his friend to bring him to a park at 11pm for this hook-up.  He walked into a wooded area of the park and promptly disappeared only for his body to be discovered in the pipe several yards away from where he was last seen. 

I know what you're thinking ""Oh, that'll never happen to me.""  I bet he didn't think it would happen to him either.  He apparently talked to who he was meeting over Snapchat for a couple of hours before their fateful meeting.  He was a smart kid, a pre-med student at the Univ of Pennsylvania, well loved and involved at his school and home.  And he was brutally murdered. 

Please, BE CAREFUL with who you are meeting, leave a name or phone number some place where your friends or family will find it and for chrissakes, DO NOT meet up in dark public spaces just for a hook-up.  You're too valuable and loved and I personally don't want to see any more of our kids die because of that fucking app.  

EDIT: 

I've been following this case since the weekend, I've read tons of articles, watched press conferences, followed police reports, etc, etc, etc.  You're not going to get the entirety of the story from one or two articles.  Blaze was known to get on Grindr, media and law enforcement have referred to the driver as a ""friend"" but what exactly that means is questionable.  If you visit Blaze's instagram and Tumblr it's quite clear the boy was gay, his parents have pride shit all over their photos. 

The point here is that this was an innocent kid who POSSIBLY met up with someone from Grindr and got himself murdered and stuffed into a fucking drain pipe.  Stop trying to reason this down and play it off.  The point is too many of our young gay men are taking chances with hook-up apps and getting hurt in the process.  There is another case out of Houston, Texas of two cousins who lured gay men through the apps and murdered them.  There are two known victims currently, the police suspect MORE, as in these guys could be junior serial killers targeting gay men on Grindr.  I posted this as a warning to the young people to be fucking careful out there.  There are lots of bad people who still want to hurt them.  Before it was just homophobes, now it's gang bangers looking to rob and garden variety crazies. "
"I made the biggest mistake of my life by coming out to my parents. And got kicked out of the house. Clueless now.


I’m 15 and I honestly don’t know why I even told my parents I’m gay even though I live in one of the most homophobic countries in the world.  I was literally kicked out the house and my family  threatened to kill me if I ever go back home. Now I’m at a friend’s place. I told him and his family  that my parents are on vacation and I’d have to crash at their place for a few days. I can’t stay at my friends place forever. I honestly don’t know what to do.  I fucking wanna kill my self. My country has no resources for LGBTQ+ folks. I am still in high school (underage to work)  so I am not allowed to work anywhere. I honestly have no clue what to do. No friends I can to talk to about this.  I can’t go to my relatives either cause my parents must have told them about me being gay. 

I can’t believe one mistake has caused this. I am so done. 

Edit:
I think I might  be going to Dubai because I’ve got some distant family there and I told them about my situation. And they are okay with me staying with them for as long as I want. The goal is to move to a more gay friendly place like the US or Europe  but Dubai is probably my answer. Still pretty uncertain. "
"What is the whole point of the “gay prank”?


I noticed how some youtubers do gay pranks on their parents and their friends. What’s the whole point of that? It’s kind of disrespectful in a way. A lot of homosexuals go through a lot when they come and it’s like these youtubers are making fun of our pain and using it for entertainment. What are your thoughts?"
"My experience with gaybros and trans in prison, I would appreciate input from the gaybros (I'm straight)


Hi! I've written a few posts about prison life. I wrote one about books in prison last night and it BLEW up. 900 comments overnight! 9k upvotes! Then it was deleted because I said it was hard to read because black inmates tend to be extremely loud. Considering the post was about reading in prison I found this relevant. Alas, I guess I am a racist. A fellow redditor showed support and we have been texting. He suggested I post here about gay culture in prison. I am trying to compile all my writings onto a website or maybe book. I would appreciate any and all input on my piece below.

I am a straight male. I never gave a fuck about gay issues because I never knew any gay people. What I mean by this is that gay rights were never really an interest for me. I supported gay marriage because why the fuck would you care? But I never actively felt for the plight of gay men until I became friends with one in prison.

Gay Mike was a very effeminate dude in prison for Crystal Meth. This dude made Perez Hilton look like Stone Cold Steve Austin. In prison most people will not associate with gay people or else they will be viewed as gay. I don't subscribe to prison culture though so I didn't care. Gay Mike was one of the few educated and ""normal"" people I met in there so we hit it off. 

Gay Mike got took a lot of shit, but barely to his face. If people gave him too many problems he would pay to have them stabbed. Once he met his boyfriend this wasn't a problem as his boyfriend, Tweak, was a ""shooter"" (someone willing to stab people). It was funny, we would walk laps around the hard and people (usually gangster black guys) would mutter ""fag"" under their breath. Many of these same guys would pull their dick out at Gay Mike when no one was around though.

This was extremely common for him. Predators in prison tend to think that gay men are down for sex with anyone anytime. A lot of gay guys in prison told me they would never have sex in prison or date someone they met there. Gay Mike was this way before he met Tweak. They had a legit relationship and it was kind of cute. Unfortunately Tweak got taken to another prison but they still managed to stay in contact by rigging a phone system up with 3 way calling. 

People talk about standing up for gay rights... ol Valuum got hit with a baseball bat over gay rights! We were playing unit league softball against the sex offender unit. The soft ball diamond is surrounded by a track. Gay Mike was walking the track and a fly ball hit him in the leg.
""Hahaha, nail that faggot"" said one of the sex offenders.

Gay Mike was my DOG, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let a fuckin' Chomo (slang for child molester) say that shit to him. I'm not a tough guy at all but fuck sex offenders, they get what's coming to them.

""At least he has consensual sex with people his own age, bitch"" I yelled

If you call someone a ""bitch"" in prison, you're fighting them. I knew this, I'm not a great fighter but I had a lot of size on the kid. We ran up to each other and I was lucky enough to connect on my first punch and dropped him. I went down and started to T off on him when suddenly my back was in pain and the wind was knocked out of me. One of his sex offenders homeboys had hit me with the baseball bat. The kid I punched was black and black people tend to stick together in prison so that's why his friend did it. Before he could do anymore damage my friend choked him out from behind. As I lay there unable to breath I see Gay Mike sashaying across the yard...unaware of my predicament. 

I lost a lot of friends hanging out with Gay Mike, but they were all white trash anyways. 

Enough about Gay Mike though. I'll talk about Gay Men Vs Predators Vs Trans Vs Sissies.

Gay men in prison are VERY rare. By gay men I mean masculine homosexual men that are like... I dunno? You're average gay guy? This is viewed as being very weak.

Sissies are extremely effeminate gay men in prison. This is almost more acceptable. People are reluctant to mess with ""sissies"" because they usually have ""admirers"" so if you tease or try to extort a sissy often you will end up getting stabbed by a random black dude. 

A predator is someone that preys on guys, usually younger white males. Predators come in all races but the vast majority of the time they are older black men who are doing life. Most inmates dislike predators but for some reason they aren't really viewed as ""gay"", not in the way regular gay men or sissies are.

Trans people are kind of rare in prison. They tend to keep them all bunched up because of the problems they cause. 


Fun fact: I've never seen a gay person, sissy, or trans lose a fight. The worst ass beating I saw during my 2 years was ""Savannah"" the transwoman (they always have goofy names, Boyance, Poundcake, etc). Savannah was black, about 6'3"", had a weave made out of shoelaces, and had modified her MDOC pants to be skin tight (this was actually very impressive). A younger black gang banger called her a ""faggot"" ans Savannah just flipped. Ended up knocking the kids teeth out and didn't stop until the COs got involved.

If you lose a fight against a sissy in prison... you might as well just go to protective custody because people never forget. When I first got to prison I say ""Kalle"" the gay white man beat the hell out of another black gang banger who constantly bragged about being a UFC fighter. He was about 150lbs and claimed his ""fighting weight"" was 260lbs. Anyways Kalle beat the dog shit out of the kid, the only injury Kalle had was on his fists. The gang banger sucker punched him too. 

Fast forward almost 2 years later... The gang banger was discussing a recent fight and said ""neither of them could fight"". Without missing a beat my bunkie chimed in ""Shut up, you got beat up by da white sissy"". 2 years later and people still didn't forget. 

What are gay people in prison for? If they're white it's usually Meth. Credit card fraud and financial crimes are really common among gay people too for reasons I never understood. 


What other topics should I cover? Do you guys have any questions I could answer? Any critique at all is appreciated. "
"People in my schools gay community trying to dictate who I date.


So a little while ago I went to an lgbt event at my university where I met and socialized with other gay guys. One of the guys we'll call him Ben wanted to set me up with his friend let's call him dan I told Ben I wasn't interested in Dan because I already met him and he wasn't my type. Ben felt that he was entitled to know why Dan wasn't my type so after hours of pestering me about it I finally told him I was interested in guys who are more masculine.

So the next day I go to the Lgbt club for a meeting (I had decided I wanted to join) but as soon as I enter the door Ben and the entire lgbt club tell me they would prefer if i didn't join because me not being attracted to effeminate guys is a sign of close mindedness, mysoginy, and internalized homophobia. Next thing you know I'm defending my preference to the entire club as they're trying to psychoanalyze me telling me I was taught to have these preferences and to associate men with masculinity, I rebutt this by saying that I wasn't taught to associate men with masculinity it's just something I observed like old people having grey hair and humans having two hands.

So the crux of the conversation is me saying that human beings are a sexually dynorphic species meaning that men and women show differnet gendered traits masculinity being one of them and that I'm attracted to masculinity because it is what I  logically associate with men and no amount of mental gymnastics can change that. I also tell them that I am perfectly fine with feminine guys because it's how they were born and it is what's natural for them and no one has the right to tell anyone how to be or to get offended by how anyone lives their life (within reason). the club respnds by telling me i'll never be happy because on average most gay men are effeminate or just masc posturing (they also accuse me of posturing which i'm not)  I agree with them most gays are feminine but I also tell them that most bi men are  masculine and some gay  men are actually masculine. So I end the conversation by telling them that if this is what the gay community is like on the outside world I want no part of it because this gay community is just as opressive as the straight community telling people what to do and who to date and if they don't then they have internalized homophobia."
"Did you ever ask your boyfriend for a BJ when doing nothing in particular

"Shit, I’m bi


So after about a year of pondering and deliberating internally, I realized last night that I am for sure bi, after having previously always considered myself to be 100% straight. And what I was sort of struck by was how the moment I realized that, yeah, this was what being attracted to guys felt like, I had an intense mental reaction of “oh fuck no”. For as accepting as I’d like to think I am towards those around me, for whatever reason something about the idea of ME being bi really bothered me. I never would have imagined myself as being someone who would have this much internalized homophobia, but shit, I have a lot of internalized homophobia. And I feel kind of guilty now that I see how I have in my head so many ideas and worldviews that are extremely bigoted and messed up, even if I consciously fight and disagree with said ideas/worldviews and ultimately don’t push them onto anyone but myself. And the feeling that really especially sucks right now is not having anyone I can tell. Especially with my current girlfriend, who I’ve been making an active effort to be more honest with for the betterment of our relationship, I just can’t see a conversation in which I tell her about how one of my best guy friends is so cute going well. Even though she herself is actually bi and just generally about as progressive as a person can be, it just somehow feels to me like it would make me a little less attractive in her eyes, not to mention this raising the question of if I have any feelings for any guys right now. I’m not really sure what I’m hoping to get out of posting this, I realize I didn’t necessarily boil this down into one simple question for you guys. I just sort of needed to share these thoughts somewhere, and I would appreciate literally any input of any sort. "
"Went to a gay beach by accident, my friend was bugging out, we got into an argument afterwards, was he right?


Hey all,

So my friend and I went to Barcelona on holiday a few months ago. We're both straight guys. One day we decide to go to the beach. We chill on one beach for a bit, then decide to go for a walk down the rest of the beaches. We get hungry, so we stop at the sandwich cafe at the next beach over.

The name of the sandwich cafe was ""Be Gay"". I didn't really think anything of it, I was too hungry at the time. Halfway through our meal, my friend says ""I think we're at a gay beach"", I ask him why he thinks that. He says there are too many men, and that the name of the sandwich bar is ""Be Gay"". I'm like ""haha that's interesting, let me check on Google"". He then starts freaking out telling me not to check. And if I do check, not to tell him. I'm confused by his behaviour, like why does it matter if we're at a gay beach or not. And why does living in denial make any difference?

I Google anyway, and lo and behold, it was a gay beach. I laugh and tell my friend anyway, and he gets annoyed and says that we should leave ASAP. I am still confused, but we pay and leave anyway.

I tell him that it's a bit homophobic how he behaved, that it shouldn't matter if we were at a gay beach, we were just having sandwiches. He got offended at me calling him homophobic, and said that just because he doesn't want to hang out at a gay beach doesn't mean he dislikes gay people. He said he didn't want people getting the wrong idea of us at the beach. Also, he said that he would never go to a gay bar, because he wouldn't want to be hit on by gay dudes, and that he doesn't want to give gay people the wrong idea.

I really don't understand that logic, I feel like if you're straight and comfortable with your sexuality, it doesn't matter where you go. I personally don't see the issue of going to a gay bar or beach as a straight person.

What are your thoughts on this situation? If you think he did behave with some homophobia, how can I explain it to him? He's a close friend so I was quite shocked and disappointed about this whole ordeal."
"[ANNOUCEMENT] JUST HAD MY FIRST TIME HAND-FREE ORGASM IN THE SLUTTIEST SEX EVER


Because schools are all off for Mather Luther King Jr. Day, my buddy, who is both my best childhood friend and fwb, and I decided to go to Florida to have some warm sun and beaches. We discovered that there was a gay cruising spot near the place we stayed, and before we headed to the airport to go back our town, we decided to go there and enjoyed some naughty fun. Long short story, I ended up being fucked hard by my buddy while having couple audience watching us and it was such a big turn on for me because I felt both vulnerable and slutty at the same time. The mental and the physical pleasure was so much that I came without touching my thing, and this was my first time having a hand-free orgasm and it was so intense. I'm shaking while thinking and typing about it right now.
