"Hey guys, is it weird to go to a gay bar if I'm a tortoise?


I too would like to get out of my shell and go a little crazy."
"He didn't say yes


I'm really drunk, so forgive all mistakes. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 10 years. We have been living together for the past 4 years, and I'd like to say that we're pretty much integral to the other one's life at this point.

We went on a trip to visit a friend. We were going to stay for a week, and I decided to propose during a hiking trip. When we reached the top of the mountain, I pulled him aside, spent about 5 minutes on a memorized speech trying to sum up our relationship, got on one knee, and pulled out the ring. I could hear wooing from the crowd, some people even saying kiss kiss.

Heâ€¦ he didn't say yes. He nervously (?) laughed and he started walkingâ€¦ walking away. I was still holding the box and I tried to get up, but he then started running away. Running away from me. Someone screamed that I should run after him, but our friend came close and hugged me and didn't let me go.

I tried contacting him, but to no avail. When I got back to the hotel, his things weren't there. I called my friend and he told me that I should stay at his place. The week came and went. I couldn't put my mind on anything else, despite my friend trying to distract me.

When I finally returned home, all of his belongings were gone; only his keys were there. I still can't contact him. I've tried everything but I can't get him to talk to me.

What did I do wrong?"
"PSA: If the guy you're on a date with starts checking his online dating profile in front of you...


...get up and leave. 

And don't bother texting him the next day. 

He doesn't care.

Trust me.

"Do you think the gay community could be haunted?


Because there's so much ghosting"
"Omg some guy on Grindr is asking to see my cock, whilst sitting opposite me... At a SEXUAL HEALTH CLINIC!


Ahahahahaha ðŸ˜‚

Oh Grindr gays you so crazy ðŸ˜œ."

Because ""Daddy"" would be too obvious."
"what are the cutest things straight guys have said or done to/for you?


for me, they all involve my straight best friend who i was in love with for like 7 years but he's actually straight with no gay in him at all (but it's ok since i'm over him now). we used to live together at uni and he was the first one i came out to (actually he found out and helped me out of the closet).

i dunno if you guys would find it cute or not but it is for me.

- one time we had an argument over something (can't remember what it was) and i was mad and was going downstairs to go out (our bedrooms are upstairs) without saying anything to him. he said ""you off out?"" in a conciliatory tone and I said ""yep"" passive-aggressively and he replied ""you just gonna go without saying bye?"" in a slightly upset tone. i felt bad after that.

- all the gay jokes/teasing. once I said ""get it out"" referring to something innocent and he started unbuckling his belt as a joke and I laughed, and he said ""i see your eyes really lit up there"". once we were in a bar with some friends and everyone was drinking a whiskey but i had a JD&amp;coke and they asked why i didn't get a whiskey and i said ""i just don't like it straight"" and he said ""i bet"" and we laughed. it sounds silly but little things like that made me feel like one of them and really helped get over my repressed sexuality.

- all the pretend-fighting which involved physical contact that gave me instant boners (i know it sounds like i took advantage but it wasn't like that at all). a lot of times when we'd get so close to each other play-fighting or embracing he'd say ""i bet you're loving this"" and i'd always laugh and say no.

- one night we were watching a film in my bedroom and i got really into the film and without realising what i was doing i just held his hand for like 10 seconds and he let me. i realised what i'd done and said ""sorry I didn't mean to"" but he just laughed it off.

although sometimes i feel like i really miss those days, i also feel a bit sad for the person i was back then because i was hopelessly in love with 0% chance of it ever working out. but in the end things went ok."
"Ok, I just set a new high bar for weirdest Grindr date


We got flu shots together.

Then we both learned how to flip a kayak."
"Straight, had sex with a guy for the first time.


Overall, it was pretty good. I hooked up with a guy from my gym. He put on some straight porn and sucked me while I sat on the couch, then I topped him on the floor in front of the tv. 

He didn't expect anything from me, he just got me off, we each had a beer and talked about some random stuff and then I bounced. Is this normal? I wasn't into the guy much even thought he's in good shape and smooth skinned, but the situation was kinda hot and I could definitely see myself doing it again. I don't want to do any kissing or suck a dick, but if there are guys who down to just get me off, I don't see why not. 

I dunno, I just kinda feel weird about the whole thing and don't want to talk to anyone I know about it. Figured asking gay guys made sense... lol. "
"PSA: If you masturbate by lying on your stomach and humping the bed or your hands, STOP!!!!!


For those who don't know, [prone masturbation](http://www.healthystrokes.com/) is a horrible and cumulatively damaging method where you lay on your stomach and hump the bed, or your hands. It damages nerves, blood vessels, and erectile tissue by putting too much pressure on the base of the penis. This is how I discovered masturbation as an adolescent, and it wasn't until I was in my early 20s that I learned that it is unhealthy. 10% of men masturbate this way. So much for effective sex ed, right?

I always, ALWAYS had lots of trouble getting/staying hard during sex, and had all the shame and distress that comes with that. When when I bottomed (I had no choice but to be a bottom) I would look down at my dick all shriveled up wondering why it wasn't as aroused as I was. I thought it was just because I masturbated too much (once a day, sometimes twice - really not all that much). I often didn't even get hard to get off while masturbating, just press down on the fucker hard enough and eventually cum comes out.

Even after I learned a few years ago that the way I masturbated was the cause of this, I still couldn't stop. I would feel the need to get off and just do it again because I could never get off by jerking normally. It was a vicious cycle like this for like five years.

But now I'm pretty sure the cycle has been broken. I just got back from a month-long road trip, during which I very rarely had access to porn (mostly camping) and was also often too exhausted from that day's hike or driving to masturbate. I probably masturbated 2 times in the first three weeks, which is the least it has been, ever. I didn't even miss it either because I had so much going on.

Then my boyfriend (actually now my fiance, hooray) flew out and joined me for the last week of the trip, and over the course of the week I was blown the fuck out of the water by how hard I was getting with him ALL THE TIME. We average like maybe once a week and unless I had taken some viagra I'd ordered off the darknet I usually couldn't stay hard even then. During the trip it was every day, sometimes multiple times a day. It was like a switch had flipped.

I've been home for several days now and have been amazed at being able to get hard during masturbation, and easily get off from normal jerking. And something totally new to me - getting random boners throughout the day? This actually happens to people??? I'm lucky too; many men have reported it taking much longer to regain functionality after quitting. 

In short I'm very very VERY pleased and if there's anyone reading this who masturbates this way, **STOP! GIVE YOUR DICK A BREAK BEFORE YOU BREAK YOUR DICK!**"
"CDC Acknowledges No Transmission Risk for Undetectable HIV Viral Loads


Yesterday the CDC released a memo acknowledging that an HIV+ person with an undetectable viral load (&lt;200) carries no risk of transmitting the virus.

This is a huge moment, as it represents years of research and studies being confirmed by the lead infectious disease specialist in America. For years, a common argument against U=U has been that the studies results were not backed by the CDC.

Sadly they also acknowledge the barrier to making sure undetectability happens in all poz people is adequate health care. Nevertheless this is a milestone to celebrate.
