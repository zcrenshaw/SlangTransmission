"Just voted for Doug Jones. Voting Clerk saw me put my arm around my boyfriend and tried to keep me from voting.


As per usual, I drove from Birmingham to my small hometown to vote. This time, my boyfriend decided to accompany me. We get there, and it's the normal crowd: old white people coming straight from church to do their civic duty. I hand my ID to the clerk, who does take her time making sure that it's mine, but eventually ok's it. As I'm walking to get my ballot, I put my arm around my boyfriend, and she immediately calls me back. Apparently, she's not sure that the ID was in fact mine (even though she already gave it the go ahead). She tells me that I'm not going to be allowed to vote. I state that I grew up here, registered here, and drove here to vote and that I planned on keeping true to that. She eventually says that I would not be allowed to vote. I pull out every credit card and ID that I had. Eventually I even pulled up my Facebook page to prove it. With that, she let me vote, but I think it was more of the scene that I was causing. 

It is disgusting that the people in charge of maintaining the integrity of the voting process are the ones that are manipulating it. 


EDIT: I called and issued an official complaint. I also called my town's mayor's office (didn't know who else to call locally) and spoke to the mayor himself! I described the situation and the clerk and will be following up personally to see that this is handled.

Thank you so much for the support. I am definitely not the kind of person to really speak out, but my boyfriend is such an outspoken person, I felt like I could.

I don't think I'm going to contact any kind of journalist. I don't think I want to give my town this type of bad publicity. (C'mon guys, we just got our first Chik-fil-a. I can't ruin it now!) Some people are definitely shitty, but the entire town shouldn't have to pay for it."
"This is why I love him.


Yesterday we were headed out, he told me to wear a coat because it‚Äôs cold. I told him that I‚Äôm fine, and that it wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúthat‚Äù cold.

Fast forward 20 minutes later, I‚Äôm outside freezing my ass off and he pulls out my coat from his backpack and says ‚Äúhere you go, dumbass.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the little moments like those that remind me why I love him so much."
"For those gaybros living in Alabama, can you do us all a favor and NOT vote for Roy Moore? Better yet, don't sit out this election, but vote for Doug Jones.


Whatever your politics, Roy Moore is bad news for LGBT people and their struggle for equality under the law and civil rights. He seeks to criminalize our sexuality while he has his own baggage. Surprisingly, there is still a contingent of gay Republicans and conservatives who are so partisan that they think Trump is on our side even as he appoints and associates primarily with people who are virulently anti-LGBT rights. Please be informed, engaged, and vote! We thank you."
"I asked a guy out for the first time...(Update)


Everything went better than expected and I feel like an idiot now for worrying so much. We decided to go out to a coffee shop (lame, I know) At 12 PM. I woke up at 6 in the morning to shower, brush/floss, and get dressed. I think I may have brushed my teeth more than ten times..but anyway I showed up at the place about 20 minutes early. He arrived five minutes  late and apologized. It's snowing where we live so I  told him it was fine and that I was glad he was being careful.  It was a little awkward at first, but the more we talked the less awkward it was (if that makes any sense). I found out he's a bookworm, like me. :D We talked about our favorite books, movies, and bands. He also told me he has been playing soccer since he was five (as a hobby) no wonder he's so fit. Oh and he's a coffee addict, so I think I made the right choice. 

After we finished our drinks, we ordered a treat and shared it. When there was only a small piece left, he asked me if I wanted it and I told him to take it. It was really cute. We left after an hour and a half.  When we were out in the driveway we had a little snowball fight. neither of us were wearing gloves and he complained about his hands being cold, so I grabbed his hand and held it. He seemed really surprised and just smiled and squeezed my hand. Finally, he told me that he really enjoyed our date and that we should go out more often. :DD"
"How I converted a really good friend of mine


A couple months ago when I was at work, I met up with a coworker who I am really close to. I am already out to my circle of friends and so wanted to include him into my secret. When I had told him that I was gay, he was shocked and started insulting me and attacking me with threats. This was the very first time I have heard such language used on me. He said things like "" I wish your kind was burned"" and "" God created you to destroy mankind"". I resolved the issue by speaking to management but was quite frankly sad that the friendship was ""over"". After the next couple weeks, he contacted me apologizing and I willingly forgave him because our friendship was so valuable to me and I was curious as to what had made him call me back. When he apologized, we went out for dinner and watched a movie and that same night, he opened up to me and said how he was able to get past his homophobia during his time thinking about the conflict and that he has an older brother ( after 2 years, I honestly thought he was an only child) that is gay and his family chose to kick him out of the house and at such a young age, he was taught to hate homosexuals. He told me that after 10 years of losing his brother, he finally contacted him yesterday, finding out that the older brother now has a child, a loving husband, and successful career, and started crying as he was retelling me his story. 

People can change and everyone should be given a second chance. Please do some good in the world by changing each other for the better. Our friendship is only 2 years long and it only took around 3 months for him going from completely homophobic to completely accepting.

EDIT: We skyped his brother today and they saw each other for the first time after 10 years. I'd say I probably cried more than they did. The bigger brother also thanked me for helping him accept homosexuals :')"
"An army recruiter just hit me up on Grindr.... is he fr?


Like we were in the middle of talking about meeting up and he randomly asks if I‚Äôve thought about joining the army. I ask if he‚Äôs a recruiter. He admits it then admits he‚Äôs not even gay. I say it‚Äôs fucked up he‚Äôs making plans with guys he doesn‚Äôt even plan on meeting up with and that he can go fuck himself.

Not trying to disrespect them but this is ridiculous. I‚Äôve been getting harassed for months by recruiters so this is getting old."
"We just dodged the bullet...


The Constitutional Court of Indonesia has just decided to reject the petition of the Islamic-moralist group ""Family Love Alliance"" to criminalize gay sex and extramarital sex in a 5-4 decision. The scary thing is that there was an Islamist judge in the court who got kicked out because of bribery case. The guy who replaced him voted no. So had he still remained there, homosexuality would have been illegal in the world's fourth most populous country today..."
"So, I slept with a guy


Been curious but never actually acted on things until two nights ago. 

Long story short, I was out for drinks with friends, got separated as happens and get talking to someone out in the smoking area. Tell him I can't find my friends and we laugh and hang out back inside.

Pretty drunk and go back to his, and the rest is history. I mean, I was fairly tipsy but it was amazing! Didn't think getting fucked could feel that good - experimented with fingers before and wasn't too into it so I was very pleasantly surprised.

Sorry, had to tell someone as I got nobody to tell IRL. "

"Surprisingly good month post surgery with boyfriend


Hi all. This is a bit jumbled.

A little while ago I got very sick. I was at work, working my ass off, feeling like I was going to faint the entire time. My boss never returned when he was supposed to, as he knew I felt like shit. But the meetings he was in dragged on and on. I finally told a colleague I had to go. I went to my cardiologist office and was immediately hospitalized. The ER admitting doctor did an echocardiogram immediately and he didn't wait. They saw that part of my heart wasn't moving. I've been to the ER several times but by the time they did the test, I was feeling fine again. Thankfully this doctor made my test a STAT. 

So, now, I just had heart surgery earlier this week. I feel extremely nauseous, weak, and everything hurts. This was my fourth heart surgery. My boss has been amazing. They let me work from home for the last several weeks. They paid me for my missed time and in the hospital. 

When I got released from the hospital, I came home from LA and my boyfriend came over after school to see me and stayed the night. He was surprised how early I was released, the Doctor told me I'd recover better at home. Tonight, my boyfriend stayed the night with me again.

This is the first boy to ever stay the night. He's still in my bed. My parents found him and simply bought him dinner and said hi. They didn't even mention anything else.

I went by my company Christmas party just for a half-hour. Just to show up and say hi to everyone and thank them. I got really weak rather quickly. My CEO gave me a really nice personal card and a large cash bonus.

Right now my arm still hurts. It hurts to type, and play video games. But, my doctor said it's good that I move my arm (as long as I don't lift it above my head).

I never knew that a boy could be so gentle toward me. He slowly caresses me, he makes sure that I'm okay. He's been helping me get my shirts on/off. Hell, he even gave me an awesome blowjob last night.

He's asleep right now and I'm up early for medicine and the fact I'm a morning owl. 

I just feel so lucky right now. "
"8 MONTHS OF DATING MY FIRST GUY after GF broke up with me: My Experience so far


So about a year ago my GF of two years broke up with me. I was down in the dumps as a 22 year old with nobody. 

A few months after, I was starting to get over it, but still pretty lonely. For one reason or another, after the break up I had opened up a bit with my porn preferences and at times gay porn was my favorite. This opened me up the smallest amount to think ""maybe I would me into that""

Like any beginner Grinder was the answer and this is where I met my current BF. He, being a bit older then me (30), chatted me up and we agreed to meet. I nearly turned around twice on my way over but said fuck it what is there to loose. At first I really didn't look at him and think he was attractive. I was more interested in having my first gay sexual encounter. However after a couple months of sex, the attraction set in. 

To wrap it up, it has been great! There is no where near as much fighting and bitching and so far the sex has been an adjustment but it is mind blowing. He prefers to top so I (with a ton of practice and patience) have enjoyed bottoming. I never thought being penetrated would lead to such intimate feelings.  I am starting to think that everybody should have that experience. 

Right now (especially for me being so new) we are in that phase where it is just intense sex all the time and we love it. "
