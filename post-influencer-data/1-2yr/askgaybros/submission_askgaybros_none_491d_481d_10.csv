"Family found out I'm gay and have a BF due to our graduation pics. And they accept me!


So I'm a 27 yo black male from the southern US with a fairly religious family.  I was orphaned when I was younger and was raised by my aunt and uncle. I never told them I was gay but I'm sure somewhere they suspected it.

Anyhow I've been dating my BF for 2 years and just graduated with my doctorate degree. He really was my rock throughout school and I was tired of not posting pics of him online so I decided to post some pics of us on instagram. i figured it'd be fine since I don't have any family on it - wrong.

I get a call the next day from my family asking me who my ""special person"" is. I played dumb because I was honestly shocked. After some back and forth I told them about my boyfriend. They took it very well and actually seemed to be upset they didn't get to meet him at the graduation! I got asked all the overly intrusive relationship questions my cousins were asked (whether we've had sex, if he treats me right, blablabla). The conversation ended with them telling me they love me no matter what and all that jazz and that my mother would have been proud of me no matter what. They want to schedule a dinner date with us as well. 

Anyway I did some investigating and it turns out my cousin was the one that told them. I talked to him and he said they'd been suspecting/known for years and had talked to him about it. He showed them the picture to let them know what was going on. He said it wasn't out of anything malicious and he wouldn't have done it if he didn't think they wouldn't have been supportive.

"Great news! I am UNDETECTABLE!! üòçüëå


After six months of treatment I just got the news this morning. I'm so incredibly happy to know this, gives me a lot of hope and puts my mind at ease. Most days I don't even think about the fact that I have hiv, I just take my pills. But it has definitely affected my sex life with my partner to the point where I can't even get it up most of the time. Hopefully this will be the beginning of the end of that and I can start to have a bit more confidence in the bedroom rather than trying to have sex with him and just having a flashing neon sign in my head that says HIV. Anyways, just wanted to get this off my chest since I'm pretty happy right now. Stay safe out there! "
"So, odd story.


I got a boner in front of my entire family in a restaurant last night.

Let me explain. 

There were 6 of us. We all pile in the elevator. This very hot black dude was with two women. My parents being nice, held the door. Dude was saying ""it's fine, we'll wait."" My mom was like ""no, it's fine come on.""

So he literally backed his ass up right against my crotch. I was shocked, cause one, this is like some bad sketch comedy, and two cause usually people just don't do that.

Anyway, he smelled amazing and his ass was somewhat grinding on me as he shifted his weight. Instant hard on. He felt it too. I could see when it clicked with him, cause his shoulders flinched. Then he turned his head and winked at me.

Thank God I was wearing shorts with deep pockets. I used one hand and basically held my cock to the side until we could sit at our table. 

Happy mother's day, indeed.

Anyone else got any awkward boner stories? "
"A good life, but hard times now.


Forty-five years ago I was almost 20 years old and I placed an ad in the Berkeley Barb, an underground newspaper that was similar to craigslist, but lower technology.  I was really 19 and was looking for guys up to 30.  He was 31 and lied about his age.  He sent a letter and a picture to my PO Box.  Less than a month shy of forty-five years later and amost 5 years married I'm coming up on 65 and he's 77.  We've always been together and we only have each other.  No kids, he has no family and mine, who love him, aren't close.  It's just us.

I've gotten him through a removal of part of a lung and a quintuple bypass, with all that entails.  I've always been his husband at the hospital and there were times when I needed to climb into bed with him at the hospital to calm him down or help him sleep.  I am fierce when he's in the hospital.  Every day, all day, whatever he needs.  Neither of us ended up with HIV, but I am humbled by what those guys went through and now I can empathize. His health is failing now.  I've got a Barbara Bush on my hands.  Congestive heart failure, COPD, and recently pneumonia among other things.  Last Monday I signed a DNR on my husband.  

He's a horrible patient with me and won't do a thing I need, like eating.  After a week in critical condition at the hospital he's in a skilled nursing facility about sixty miles away.  All the fires are put out, but he's so weak he isn't eating.  He was fighting, but....I just don't know what to do.  One day I think I may actually bring home, the next day I think I'll be bringing him home in an urn.  I just hate to see him in this condition and how miserable he is.

I'm there at his side from after breakfast until after dinner.  The staff are wonderful.  My big, strong man is in diapers.  Last night when I left I prepared myself for a quick end.  Today I needed a break and only stayed a little while.  Everyone is telling me to make sure I take care of myself.  Yeah....thoughts and prayers.  

I know my life will go on one day without him.  That's not a problem. But I really hadn't prepared myself or even allowed myself to look at what the end of life would look like for us.  Kind of a tough time.  I've spent most of my life with this man.  For me, there has always been an ""us.""  I get ready to let him go and then some ray of hope shows up which may or may not work.

Thanks for letting me rant.  It's not your regular r/askgaybros post.  I just didn't know where else to post this and I wanted to get it off my chest.  They say if you want to make God laugh, just tell him about your fucking plans."
"Why are straight people so mean


From earlier Today:

My friend W: ""Me and J are going to the mall do you wanna come too?""

Me: ""Yeah sure""

We walk to meet J who's with T

T: ""I'm not having him in my car""

W and J: ""What do you mean?""

I didn't process what T said exactly but it was something like ""Don't really want homos...""

W and J half laughed and I cut it off saying ""Ok I'll just leave"" and then F said ""No wait.."" but I already walked away and didn't want to look back and then I guess they went. It's so embarrassing when people say things like that in front of your own friends

I haven't even spoken to T many times at all and it's not like I'm feminine or obviously gay but my town is full of homophobes. I hate college"

"For the guys who don't like themselves.


*Not that anyone asked, but...*

Yesterday afternoon I read a post in this sub from a guy, asking how he could get used to being ""ugly"".  He basically said that being unattractive was making his life really difficult, and wanted to know how he could come to terms with his appearance, which he perceived to be outside the bounds of conventional attractiveness.  I felt that same way for so long \- when I came out to myself in high school I was 320lbs \(145ish kg\), I had so many issues, and I didn't see my life going anywhere because I thought I was the farthest thing from attractive, and because of it I wouldn't ever meet anyone or go anywhere with my life.

I ended up making some changes, and now I'm a lot happier \(and, to be blunt, I get a lot of ass now\).  We all have different lives and situations, but theses are some things that helped me change.  I incorporated all of these steps over the last summer, so I'd be more confident and put together to start grad school.  For years I've been going to therapy and been on a medication for my depression, which have helped me find the drive to set realistic goals and work toward achieving them.

1. I started working at a supermarket, and they put me in the health/beauty section.  I saw all of these products I hadn't seen before \- I didn't really know the difference between a face wash and an exfoliating scrub.  At first I just used the 75 cent shampoo/conditioner from the bottom shelf at walmart and some water \- that was it.  I ended up purchasing the stuff that my very well put together fraternity brother used, and by the end of the summer I had a hygiene routine that made me look and feel really good.  I payed more attention to shaving, and my skin became really great when I took care of it \(crazy how that works!\)  I also kept my hair short and clean, rather than letting it grow until I couldn't manage it, and then getting it cut.
2. I paid a little more for the right clothes.  I'm 6'4"" \(193cm\) \- I have a really hard time finding certain things.  I saved some money, and bought some large\-tall shirts from amazon that I wear.  They are so well fitted to my body now.  I chose a few people in my life whose looks I really wanted to emulate, and went from there.  A change of wardrobe can really make a huge difference.  A whole bunch of people told me I looked like I lost weight, when all I did was change my clothes.  After wearing uniforms in high school and looking like a hot mess for undergrad, I had to learn what to wear, and that took time \- but I'm glad I did.
3. I got on grindr.  I put my real name and info, and had a real photo of myself.  This was the first time I had ever been open on grindr, as I was convinced I was so ugly people would be unkind and terrible.  I got so much more attention than I thought I would, and I had sex for the first time that summer.  I met up with a few guys.  One in particular I thought was WAY out of my league \- the best ass I've ever tasted!  haha  What I'm saying is, we're our own worst critics \- you can say you're ugly and no one wants you, but you won't really know until you give it an honest try.  My looks were not \(and still aren't\) where I want them to be, but a lot of guys do find me attractive, and I believe it's because of other qualities as well.  Also, I was always insecure about the size of my dick \- once I saw what other dudes were really packing, I was much more secure.  Despite my inexperience, the guys I was with told me how much they enjoyed our time together, which was awesome.  I still keep their numbers in my phone, just in case.  It's worth noting that I live in a place with a pretty small gay community, and people don't normally assume I'm gay at first glance, so apps were really helpful. 
4. I joined r/loseit, and with daily exercise and monitoring my diet with MyFitnessPal, I've been able to lose about 50lbs so far since January.  I'm about 15lbs away from my goal weight, and in a few weeks I start a weight lifting class.  For a lot of us, it's our weight that makes us feel ugly.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I compare myself to guys I'm into, and it can be disappointing and defeating.  I'm attracted to guys who look like they take care of themselves \- and when I was obese, I couldn't ask anyone out, because I didn't want to go out with someone who looked like me, so I couldn't blame anyone else \(then I joined grindr, see point #3\).  It's been quite a journey, but when I look in the mirror I see an attractive guy.  Diet trumps exercise, but both are very important.  

Funnily enough, I recently have had people ask me if I'm Polish \- according to my ethnicity DNA test, 64&amp;#37; of my DNA originates from Poland, and I have two grandparents who were ethnic Poles, and one more who was half.  I used to hate how I looked so much \- I grew up in a town that was mostly Mexican, so I got bullied for my pale skin and such.  I'm pretty tall, have a long face, a long nose, fair skin, bright blue eyes and dark blonde hair.  Turns out I look like my family, and I also look like people who share my ethnic background.  Looking at old photos of relatives helped me appreciate my features, which many of them shared.  As I lose fat and can see what I really look like under all of that, it's breathtaking.  This made me really proud of how I look, though this certainly isn't relevant for everyone.  In America we have a little obsession with our ethnicity, especially if we're not the typical WASP.  

At the moment I'm lighter at 24 than I was when I was 14.  My nice new clothes are too big, and I'm dealing with things I never thought \- like having hip bones and creepy veins popping out of my hands.  But I'm getting better.  This is a journey and it takes time, but you won't be able to see months of progress until you start.  The key is to be consistent, and to be patient with yourself.  Also \- there will always be haters.  People will always be ready and willing to tell you you're unattractive, poor, dumb, etc.  Once you start seeing your own potential and you build upon your strengths, it's so much easier not to take those comments to heart \- those people don't even know you or what you're working on.  

I might be full of crap and this might not be helpful.  But I'm hoping that isn't the case.  Especially for the dude whose post I read last night \- you can find confidence in what you have and where you're at, but change is always possible, and the sooner you begin the sooner you'll see results and feel amazing."
"Does anyone else find dirty talking just hilarious?


It's always been a problem of mine and I don't know why. If a guy starts dirty talking during sex, I have to completely block it out of my mind or I'll either start laughing uncontrollably or go limp, or both. I just find it hilarious that anyone is actually saying these things to me! I don't think my current boyfriend has realised because every time he starts dirty talking I do something like cover his mouth so he stops...

Is it just me?!"

"How can I make my teammate feel comfortable in a homophobic environment?


Hey guys! I‚Äôm just looking to get some advice on this situation. I have a teammate who was kinda forced out of the closet and I want to help but I don‚Äôt really know what approach I should take...

We live in a small conservative Southern town so it‚Äôs kinda acceptable to degrade people for not falling in line with any religious beliefs. In this case a few guys (Like 4 of them) on my team pick on this Freshmen and forced him to come out. He‚Äôs not stereotypically gay or anything but he‚Äôs really nice and doesn‚Äôt talk about girls with us so I guess they just assumed. I don‚Äôt really get why anyone would be mean to him because he kinda reminds me of a puppy and isn‚Äôt threatening what so ever lol. Anyway, I just feel a bit guilty because over the last few months I‚Äôve heard some of the guys make homophobic comments and I usually just change the subject rather than call them out on being asses. It‚Äôs got to a point where they‚Äôve started touching and making sexual gestures and it‚Äôs just really fucked up...And today another teammate and I walked into the locker room during practice and found the poor guy crying and we couldn‚Äôt get him to say anything. I can‚Äôt get my coach or any adult involved, but that‚Äôs a whole other story...

Has anyone been in a similar situation and what would‚Äôve made you feel better? I don‚Äôt know many gay people irl so I‚Äôd like to get perspective from people who may have had similar experiences with being bullied for being gay. It‚Äôs clear that coming out isn‚Äôt easy so I don‚Äôt want to make him feel like I‚Äôm treating him weird, because he didn‚Äôt really come out by choice. We have less than a month in our season so maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be so concerned since it‚Äôs almost over? Oh and sorry for the long post. I tried to shorten it as much as possible.

"To anyone that thinks gay men are ""sex addicts"" and ""whores""...


I made a profile for my female friend on Tinder using her photos, with her permission of course. We brainstormed a witty joke to put in her bio. Together we had fun sorting through profiles of straight men on there as she hadn't used a hookup app before. Our search was 18-22 years old, in a 10 mile radius. She's 19. Soo yeah, the results weren't surprising at all. We/she swiped right 81 times and 47 of them were instant matches! It took all of about 5 minutes to finish. We waited an hour, checked back, and we now had a total of 58. Statistically, 71% of our swipes were matches. That's 58 guys who are pretty much willing to come over at a moment's notice and fuck her. It just irritates me how much we're portrayed as horny freaks who will fuck anything while straight men do the *exact same thing*! Ugh, alright, rant over. "
