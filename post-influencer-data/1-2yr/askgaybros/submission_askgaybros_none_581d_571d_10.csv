"Idk about you guys, but ironically saying gayyyyyyy to my bf after having sex will never not be funny.


That's so gay of you!! "
"Update: I found out that the aggressively homophobic guy who has been harassing me for almost a year now is gay.


So instead of confronting him about it in person (would have been a lot more awkward...) I unblocked him on one of my social media accounts and sent him a friendly message. In my message I said that I knew his secret and that although he has been an asshole to me, I wouldn't mind introducing him to other gay people or helping him find LGBT support groups. He got overly defensive and told me to mind my own business. I told him I wouldn't be having this conversation with him if he also minded his business. He stopped replying after that. Then he messaged me a block of text at one in the morning, apologizing for being a dick. He said that he was insecure about his sexuality and that he was ""jealous"" of me because I was openly gay and confident about it. He also wrote that if his family found out, they would probably kick him out and his friends would never speak to him again. 

It really broke my heart. So I forgave him and once again offered helping him find an LGBT support group. Since we go to the same college, I told him he could hang out with me and my friends if he wanted. He said he would think about it and that this wasn't easy for him. "
"That thing you stick your dick in has feelings btw


We were fooling around, kissing etc and he took my shirt off and that was cool then he tried to take my pants off and I was like no I dont want to, he kept trying then eventually was like why are you here then? He asked me over to hang out, nowhere did we say we would have sex, I didn't prepare for sex so I wasnt going to. Anyway I dont like him anymore, I dont get where guys get off thinking they can treat people like a fucking fuck toy, I AM HUMAN YOU ASSHOLE. 

Read, reply or not its only a rant but I think I make a valid point. "
"14 year old me would be so excited....


Iâ€™m waking up in the Cayman Islands this amazing Friday, and I look at my husband next to me, even asleep, mouth agape snoring he is one of the most attractive men Iâ€™ve ever been with, and I got that ass on tap. 

If you had told me this before I came out, I would have thought you were on crack. Life is never perfect, but I find these little mental snapshots of perfect moments get me through all the bullshit. 

I guess my point is, I know Iâ€™m privileged in a lot of ways, and there are people who might feel it is dangerous to even dream of a scenario like the one I have found myself in. But know that it is possible and you are deserving of it too. "
"Does anyone else love getting to see babygays in public?


So recently I was walking around campus with my BF holding hands and such, and we come upon this family touring. One of the kids was obviously gay and when we were both wandering through a large courtyard the gay kid couldn't stop staring.  I kinda thought he was going to hurt his eyes straining so hard,lol. Evertime I get to see a gay middle/high school kid I feel blessed to be in a time where this is possible as well as being able to show a positive example of what being gay could be. What do you guys thinks about seeing babygays? Do you have a notable experience in the past? Were you ever the babygay?"

"Please steal my gay dating app idea


Here's my idea...

The picture pops up. If you want sex, you swipe left. If you want a date, you swipe right. If you're not interested, you swipe down. If you're only looking for one or the other (sex vs dates), you can indicate that and only allow one option (but let's be real, most of you thirsty, lonely motherfuckers are going to want both).

If you both swipe left (for sexy times), you get to see each other's list of what they're into. And maybe sexy pics, if you want to put those right out there (optional). You don't have to waste your time with ""What are you looking for? What are you into?"" The info's there. If it looks like a match, you message to find a time to meet up.

If you both swipe right (for dates), you see a list of date ideas that the other guy has already suggested from a list. You pick one that you're into. Now you can start chatting, but there's a clear goal in mind, so if there's chemistry, you can get right into working out the details.

If one swipes left and the other right, it goes right into a chat. You have 24 hours to agree to go into sexy mode or date mode, or your chat expires. 

You can have a limited number of active chats at once. Maybe a dozen. After that, you have to actually reject someone and delete the chat or exchange numbers and move it into real life if you want to keep swiping.

Someone please steal this idea. I don't even need a royalty. You're welcome. I am just so tired of spending so much time messaging and having it go nowhere."
"So, I found out that the aggressively homophobic guy who has been harassing me for almost a year now is gay.


I live in a middle eastern country in the more liberal and tolerant part I guess you could say. I'm out to all my friends and they don't care because none really take religion seriously. My parents were upset at first, but eventually got over it. Because of where I live, I haven't experienced much homophobia but it would probably be different if I was in a conservative village. Anyway....for the past year now this one guy at my college (who is supposedly a ""devout"" Muslim) has been harassing me. And unlike other homophobes I have encountered, he would always go out of his way to harass me. For example, instead of driving to college like he normally does he would walk just so he could verbally abuse me. 

He also found my social media accounts and started posting derogatory comments on my posts. He'd message me quotes from the Hadith that state gay people should be executed. Then when I blocked him, he would create another account and continue doing the same shit. When I confronted him about this and asked him to fuck off, he told me he was just trying to ""save me"" because if I continued practicing the ""gay lifestyle"" I would go to hell. Also that I was creating ""fitna"" (temptation) in society. Interestingly, I have other friends who are also openly gay and from Sunni Muslim families but he never said anything to them. 

So a few days ago one of my friends called me at like 2 in the morning, freaking out. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he found (insert name) on Grindr. I thought he was joking, but then decided to see for myself. Should I confront him about this? Would it to wrong if I (jokingly) sent him those Islamic videos and websites he sent me? 

Edit: I'll keep you guys updated."
"I talked to the guy in the gym


So as many of you advised me, I tried bringing gay politics up. The guy turned out to be a total homophobe but at least I won't have to wonder now. Thanks for the good advice guys :)"
"I am really dumb


I am a dumb idiot that leaves my account logged in on a public computer. If the person that found my account were a worse person, they would use my extensive post history against me. However, that person will settle for this post, detailing how stupid I am. "

"Do you ever notice a guy and sorta see good signs, but still tell yourself ""naw, he probably wouldn't be into me""


For whatever reason? But what if he happens to be playing the same thoughts in his head? That's the worst feeling ever.


Never known when one guy would actually be into me, but I always have these ""I'm probably not his type"" or ""he's seems straight/metrosexual, it's just wishful thinking / just hoping he is gay"" thoughts that undermine my confidence.

That, and the fact I don't know if I would drop the class because of it (rejection/having poor gaydar)"
