"TIFU by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client


I'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. So, a few days ago I was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and told me they had a problem: They had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

There's no way people were just finding this place on their own. It was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. So, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

Last night, I went there to get some food... for research, ya know... Anyway, I was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. The pizza was really good. The beer selection was varied. They had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. Pretty good stuff. Even if I wasn't writing for them, I would've given them 5 stars on Yelp, is what I mean.

When I was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

I wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""Where Wine Country Is Next Door!""), but I was determined to get something usable. 

Finally, it hit me: ""Go Somewhere."" It had nearly everything I wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

But, still, it wasn't quite there. It lacked the feel I wanted, felt a little too abstract. Customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. They needed to be pointed.

After another hour or so, I had it.

Eventually, the slogan I pitched these poor people was this:

""Go Somewhere Else""

Which, I believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""Get the fuck out of my face.""

They haven't emailed me back.

TL;DR: Today I fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan I wrote and I'm pretty sure I definitely lost a client because of it."
"TIFU by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.


This fuck up took place 15 years ago when I was around 11 years old.   I had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

Now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say ""No pain, no game.""   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.

I removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

TLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.

"TIFU by buying a house that wasn’t attached to the sewer and discovering this fact while crawling through my own plops [NSFW]


Obligatory this was a while ago.
So it's a known fact amongst friends and family that I always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. It's just who I am. You can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, I'll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. If you've shat your pants in public I want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it's not a sex thing I swear; I've just always been like that since I was a young child. There is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. That knowledge combined with the events I am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.
Some don't believe me when I tell them this tale but there's a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.
Here we go.
My wife and I bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a Home Depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. Sure enough the floor wasn't insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. I went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. It was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.
During this time we'd get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn't think much of it. I'd buy some Draino and the smell would go away. Ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we'd get a plumber in to take look.
It's the week before Thanksgiving and I finally get under the house to work on that insulation. It's cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. I've been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, Jesus fucking Christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer's market as a skin care product it was so evil. I knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn't visible during a tour it had not been fixed.
That week I found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from New Hampshire (we're in New York) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. Even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and I spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.
Anyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. 
If you're buying a home that's been flipped negotiate like you're fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because I guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. They don't give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it's buyer beware. They deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their ""trouble"" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. Then again I'm biased as you will come to find out.
So I'm under the house two days before Thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole I can barely fit through. My wife tells me she's going to take a shower and won't be able to help if I need anything. I crawl back under and figure I'll grab another bag or two and call it quits.
Then I hear the water. If you're a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn't be. That's better than never hearing the water but it still means there's a lot of water where it shouldn't be any and if you don't find it things get messy fast.I didn't know much but I knew that.
I hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. I've owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. It's even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn't get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.
I'm about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so I squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. Clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. I wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. I sigh and keep going. My nose is always clogged from the moment I get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though I make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.
The light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there's a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. I think to myself ""Great! The pipe broke?!"" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. I climb over a mound and down the other side onto what I thought was dirt but the moment I touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. I see the brown ripples spreading but it's too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later I realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. ""What the fuck!?"" this is more than a single shower. This is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. The water stops running and I decide it's time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. We put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won't be fun but whatever.
I'm moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there's a space behind the furnace I'll be able to slide through. I see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it's going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. The I hear it. A toilet flush. It didn't hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. I turned back to try to see where it's coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. A whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. Jesus, Buddha, Sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. Send me back to the womb, let me start over, I want to start over; we have to go back, Kate!
I'm sure you're thinking ""Why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?"" I thought same thing, to be honest I don't know, she married me; I livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, I guess she's going to be a little off, too.
The realization of how far up shit's creek I am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. The upstairs bathroom wasn't on the tax documents prior to the seller's ownership, it was part of the renovation. Someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn't occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. Holy shit I'm crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife's shit, my father in law's shit! Memories of every shit I'd taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. We had numerous taco nights, I had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad I was showering instead of wiping. All of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.
The panic set in and I scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that I was scrambling through.
Five minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. I could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.
Today we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? We had it fixed, we moved on. We still can't believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. We started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. We are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won't happen again.
As promised, video proof.
To answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no New York State does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.
TL;DR I bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. I learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops.

"TIFU by accidentally getting my dog super, super high and incurring a $2000 vet bill before I figured out what happened.


So, before I start I want to acknowledge that I am a terrible terrible person and an irresponsible pet parent. I'm pretty much posting here because I expect Reddit to tear me to pieces and I think I deserve it. Everyone I tell this story to IRL just laughs :(

This didn't actually happen today, it happened on Friday. I was in my pool throwing balls for one of my dogs, while the other watched (he doesn't like the pool, only smelly ponds will do for swimming). His name is Leo, and he is a one-year-old border collie. Bouncy and adorable and loving.

He lays down by the side of the pool and I swim over to pet him. He stays lying down. This is not normal for Leo. He is an EXCITABLE dog. Every moment is play time. If I twitch at 3am it's OMG PLAY TIME NOW?! No Leo go back to sleep. So I start calling his name and acting excited. Stays lying down. Barely opens his eyes. I start to worry, so I get out and walk back to the house. He can barely walk. Stumbling and falling to the side. I start freaking out. I get him inside and he lies down on the floor and doesn't move. He's CONSCIOUS, he hasn't collapsed, but all he'll do is open his eyes and look at me he won't get up willingly. So obviously at this point I'm freaking the fuck out. Could be heatstroke, it was a warm day. But there were no signs of it, he had plenty of water and shade, and he wasn't vomiting at all. 

So I take him to my vet. They agree he's not right and want to admit him over night. But they don't have staff there overnight and I'm worrying my brains out, so I take him to the emergency vet about 40 mins away where they have 24 hour staff. I get him settled there, and then they call me and tell me they really can't work out what's wrong, all his tests are normal. Not dehydrated, liver and kidney function are fine. Heart rate's a bit slow but not terribly. But he won't wake up and if he's forced to walk he falls.

So they say they're really worried about him, and they want me to take him to the specialists about an hour away. I inwardly cry, because my other dog has had a stay there before and it's expensive. But a pet parent's gotta do what a pet parents gotta do. So off we go.

We get to the specialist. It's about midnight by this point. I'm exhausted and tearful with worry. They admit him and send me home. Over the next few days, he has every test known to man. All normal. He has about 10 different neurological exams. Normal. He seems to be slowly improving day by day. On Monday they say I might as well take him home, he seems to be improving and they're waiting on some more tests results. Basically, there's nothing they can do right now that I can't do at home.

Over and over again they've asked if he could have gotten access to any toxins. And over and over again I say no. Nothing. He's been with me all day. I can't think of ANYTHING he could have gotten into.

Then on Monday it hit me. I had been cleaning out the outside freezer, and caught him with his head in the trash bag. I shooed him away and thought nothing of it. It was just old food with freezer burn. Nothing that could hurt him. Then I remember. I used to store edibles in that freezer. STRONG edibles. My first batch before I figured out doses. One chocolate would knock me on my ass for a day. My usual dose was 1/4 a chocolate.

He must have eaten one. The poor little fucker was high as a kite for three days.

Happy to say it's been five days now and he's right as rain. Currently demanding I throw balls for him in spite of a three hour walk this morning.

But ... fuck. I feel fucking terrible. I poisoned my dog :( poor little dude.

TL;DR dog ate edible, was high for three days, vet bill was very very expensive."
"TIFU by asking a girl to go for a ride in my truck


This fuck up happened last night.  I'm still dealing with the repercussions.

Background.  I'm 33 years old, married to my college sweetheart with 1 kid.  My wife stays at home with our daughter and she's 7 months pregnant with our son due in late August.

Last night, about 5pm she asked me if I'd run to Sonic and get her a drink.  I said sure, no biggie and headed out.

I make this run at least 4 times a week because my wife has cravings for these slushies at Sonic.

Here's where I fucked up.  

So I put my order in and a few minutes later this early 20s something waitress comes out to my truck (Brand new Dodge Ram, all blacked out on 22s jacked up, dark tinted windows).  She is smoking hot, in cutoff jeans and on roller skates, and a little sweaty cause it's boiling outside.  I must have some roller skate fetish as my mind kinda blacked out for a minute thinking about how hot this chick was.  And in my defense, I'm not exactly getting any at home cause my wife is pregnant and it's 100 degrees outside so she's miserable all the time.  

So she comes up to my window, and I roll it down and she says hi and hands me my drink.  She looks at me dead in my eyes and says ""OMG I love your truck, it's so fucking sexy"".  I was kinda dumbfounded for a second as I processed that she said ""fucking sexy"".  For some dumbass reason my response back was  ""Well maybe you should come for a ride sometime"".....and before the last word came out of my mouth I knew I had fucked up.

She says ""Sure, just come by sometime, I get off at 9pm Monday and Tuesday.""

I smile, say ""ok cutie"" and drive off thinking to myself ""Damn I still got it"", knowing full well that I'd never act on it because 1.  I'm not a cheater, 2.  My wife would literally murder me and dump my body in a river and 3. I'm not sure I'd even know what do with a 20 year old anymore.

Here comes the pain I'm still enduring as of this morning.

8:45pm last night, my wife comes out of the bedroom not in her normal PP's (Pregnant Pajama's) and says ""Do you want anything from Sonic, I'm going for a Slushi"".  I didn't really think anything about it at the time, and told her no.

As she leaves, I notice on our security camera that she took my truck.  Whatever, no big deal, it's more comfortable for her to drive.  30 minutes later she gets home and she's visibly pissed.  She comes into the Kitchen and tosses her Slushi into the sink and it splatters everywhere.  I'm still unaware of my impending doom.  I ask her innocently ""What's wrong babe, did they not have your flavor or something?""  She looks at me with the stare of 1000 burning suns and says ""No, but Sarah at Sonic was really sad I couldn't give her a ride in your truck.  You're sleeping on the couch asshole"".

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.  

TL;DR - I'm a moron and I'm probably getting divorced because my wife found out I was flirting at Sonic"
"TIFU by agreeing to take pictures with a girl I liked.


This actually just went down last night, so like the true redditor I am, I had to put it on TIFU pretty much immediately. 

Quick backstory, I do a decent amount of photography as a hobby, and am know around my high school for taking interesting long exposures, including start/night photography. 

 Anyways, a there’s a girl who I had been talking to for months. I had been pretty crazy about this girl for much longer, but we had only recently started talking in what seemed like a more flirty ways, as well as more frequently. She had even come to visit me in my retail job, listing no other reason other than “just to see you”. Obviously I thought that these interactions may be going somewhere more, so when she randomly told me she wanted to go “take artsy night photos together” I immediately said yes, picturing a slightly romantic star gazing night. Like I said, I was psyched not only about that fact that she had brought up this “date” idea, but also about the fact that she seemed interested and excited about a hobby of mine. As you have most definitely guessed, it did not go down like this at all. 

I texted her the day of and told her that I would pick her up around 9:00 (when it’s finally dark enough in the summer to see stars). That’s when things started to get bad. She replied that that was fine, but asked if she could bring along a guy who also goes to school with me (let’s call him David). I was immediately disappointed, but still hopeful because to my knowledge she was not dating anyone, and I still wanted to see her, so I said yes. I pick her and “David” up at her house, and they walk to my car together holding hands, and both get into the back. Not only did my heart drop at the realization that this guy was obviously going to be her “date” for the night, but also the fact that I was sitting alone up front like their taxi driver. 

Long story short (kind of), I drove them both to the location I had picked out while they chatted and flirted in the back and pretty much made minimal contact with me. We got out, and this girl had the nerve to ask me “where the best place to stand together is” (together meaning her and her “date”). I was dumbfounded. She was acting like it was totally normal for her to bring along a guy and have me take free “artsy star photos” for them as some kind of couple photo shoot. At this point I was pretty hurt and embarrassed, so I just tied to act normal. I took a few photos of them (not well done but I didn’t give a fuck at all), and then suggested we went back. We did the whole embarrassing taxi routine again, and when we got back to her house she actually asked me if I could drive “David” home. I was angry at this point, so I lied and told her that I really had to get home, and that he was going to have to find another way to his house. 

TL;DR
A girl I had a huge crush on set up a “photography date” with me, only to have me taxi her and her unexpected real date around to take free couple photos of them. "
"TIFU by getting caught pleasuring myself and throwing a buttplug at a stranger


This didn't happen today but ten years ago. 

At the time I was still living at home with my family and since someone was always at home and the doors didn't have keys to lock them privacy was rare. About two weeks before the fuck up happened I was out having a couple of drinks with some of my girl friends and on our way to the train station we saw an adult shop. Back then I was a bit shy, so my friends said I would never go in there and buy something. Being a little tipsy I thought I'd show them, went inside and bought a whole selection of dildos, vibrators and buttplugs, which I hid at home hoping no one would find them. 

Testing anything was out of question, because like I said, it was always someone at home and not even the bathroom had a key to lock it. So, I decided to just throw the sex toys away once I get the chance to do so. Fast forward to a day two weeks later. My sister was having classes and my grandma had an doctors appointment, to which I was supposed to take her, but my mom had offered to do it instead treating me to the rare occasion of having the house all to myself. At the time I was looking for a job to become a kindergarten teacher, which will become important later on in this specific fuck up. At first, I decided to take a long shower without being interrupted and then put on the music really loud and just danced around in my room shouting my favorite lyrics. 

After a while, I plopped down on my bed and remembered the bag of sex toys that was tucked into the small space between my bed and the wall. My first instinct was to just throw them out now, but then curiousity got the best of me. Now, at this point almost two hours had passed, meaning my mom and grandma could be home any minute. Still, I decided to give it a try thinking I could be done before they would be back home. If you think you know where this is going by now, believe me it gets worse. 

Five minutes later I'm on my bed, which is facing the door, naked and pleasuring myself with some of the toys. The music was still on and I was only seconds away from reaching my climax when the door opens and I freeze, staring in horror at my mother and the other woman I had never seen before that were gaping at me. In my shock I yelled at them to get out and just for good measure took the next thing I could reach to throw at them, which just so happened to be a butt plug, which nearly hit the other woman smack in the face if my mom wouldn't have pulled her out of the way before they both left. 

Needless to say that I was mortified and prayed to all that is holy for the ground to swallow me up. So, I stayed in my room, until eventually my mom came back about an hour later, this time knocking before she entered. Turns out the woman who was with her, was an old school friend of hers who just so happened to be the headmaster of the local kindergarten. They had met by chance and my mom had told her that I was looking for a job to become a kindergarten teacher. So, the good woman had decided to come to meet me and offer me an internship to see if I was a good fit for the job. 

Let's just say I never heard from her again and had look for a job/internship for another six months and of course, I never pleasured myself at home again until I moved out and made sure the place had keys to look the doors. But at least my mom gets a good laugh out of the story every time she thinks about it. 

TL;DR: Decided to pleasure myself eventhough I knew my family would be back soon and not just ended up completely embarrassed but also lost the chance of a internship in my dream job."
"TIFU by giving myself scurvy.


This is the first time I've fucked up royally enough that the internet deserves to know how I have been humbled. Let this serve as a cautionary tale to other broke students.

About two months ago, I finished my third year of college in a state about 1200 miles northwest from home. I had some work to do for my thesis and wanted to take a couple language classes for fun, so I stayed instead of going home. I was also really looking forward to having my own apartment after my roommate left for the summer. During the school year, I eat about half my meals at the dining hall on campus and the other half, I cook for myself. With this arrangement, I was pretty good with keeping a well-rounded diet and overall I felt great. Who needs a multivitamin, right? 

Wrong. 

Once the dining hall shut down, I was faced with the sudden realization that I had to feed myself 100% on my own. ""I've got this."" I thought to myself. ""I can cook and I'm pretty good at shopping frugally."" 

Wrong again. 

Somehow, within two weeks my diet consisted almost entirely of rice, beans, chicken, and the occasional salad or sandwhich. I was getting protein, not spending much, and not starving. A few weeks later, I noticed being more fatigued than normal. I could fall asleep at any time of day. I chalked it up to smoking too much weed, cut back, and moved on. A few more weeks later, I noticed that small scrapes and scratches wouldn't heal as quickly as usual and I was getting red spots and small rashes. I assumed it was my immune system fucking up thanks to allergies and excessive bug bites, took some meds, and went on with my carbohydrate-saturated life. Fast forward to half an hour ago. While brushing my teeth, I spit out blood. Now that, I couldn't ignore. I'm good about brushing and flossing so there's no reason for that. All of the above symptoms had continued as well. 

That's where the pieces came together. The diet of a 17th century privateer, the fatigue, rash, sore and bleeding gums... A quick google search confirmed it.  I know I'm sensitive to vitamin imbalances and I have multiple bottles of vitamins in my cupboard. I should have known better, but I didn't. And now I probably have scurvy. I am currently clinging to a bottle of orange juice for dear life, begging the vitamin gods to forgive my neglect of sweet, sweet Vitamin C. 

TL;DR : Tried to feed myself for two months. Failed so miserably that I got scurvy.

(And yes, I'm going to a doctor ASAP.)"
"TIFU by breaking 20,000 Apple and Android phones.


This FU just happened this morning, I'm sitting at my desk waiting for my boss to call me into his office.  I work at a company that runs an MDM service for customers.  For those who don't know what an MDM is, we manage our customers mobile devices, PC, etc using 3rd party services like AirWatch, Mobile Iron.

 

I'm a support engineer and it's my job to help customers when they call with issues, give them steps to resolve problems, etc.

 

So here comes the FU.  I got an emergency call last night from a customer who said none of their devices could get access to their corporate data.  They have 20000 iPhones and Android devices.  Something on the backend was broken and the device records in the service were broken.

 

I spoke to my developer, and he asked me to reproduce the customer's configuration and see if I could reproduce the problem.  Sure enough, a few hours later I had on my test environment.

 

The dev did some more investigation and had spoken to the MDM vendor on the phone and they told him to test out a script that would delete the device record but once the device checked back in it would recreate itself in the service and everything would be fine.

 

He gave me the script to test and I ran it on my account and everything worked fine, except one little thing, the script prompted you every time you deleted a device record and asked if you wanted to delete or retire the device.  After 20 seconds the script would automatically choose “Delete”.  Now deleting is fine, because when the device checks back in, it gets recreated.  Retiring is bad, because it unmanages the devices.

 

So me being a smart guy I figured I could modify the script to enter delete every 3 seconds.  I tested it out a couple times and it seemed to work ok on my test account with a few devices.

 

The customer said it was ok to run on their account and my dev also approved (without knowing I had modified it to run faster so I could save myself sometime.)

 

I take the script and kick it off, it's going great.  Plowed through about 200 devices when the script goes haywire, throwing errors all over the place.

 

I tried to close it out but my computer was acting up and it wouldn't close.  I finally just unplugged the computer.

 

After I booted back up I loaded the customer's account and found it had run 19590 device retire requests.  I couldn't breathe.  I called my dev and explained what happened and asked him what we could do.   He replies ""Get your resume ready, that's about it"".

 

So as I sit at my desk, probably for the last time I'm pondering how I could be so stupid.  The customer has 20000 devices that cannot access email or corporate data without completely re-enrolling every device.

TL;DR - Tried to save myself some time helping a customer and completely obliterated all their phones.  Probably getting fired.
