"Men in suits: how????


Every obscenely hot day, I look at a man in a suit walking about outside and I just can’t fathom how that’s possible in this weather.  I’m genuinely curious.  As a woman I’m thankful that skirts and dresses exist, or I would not be able to survive nyc summers.  So, are you all secretly dying on the inside or have you all just built up an immunity to heat?

"What are your 3 favorite dishes in NYC?


If you're only allowed to have 3 dishes from any NYC restaurant(s) for the rest of your life, which 3 dishes would you choose? They can be from the same restaurant or different ones."
"Do any teachers in Manhattan enjoy their school/job?


I have taught at two schools, one in East Harlem and one in the Bronx.  I can't do it anymore, man.  The kids don't care, the parents don't care, hell the administration doesn't care.  I know the locations aren't ideal and that's definitely half the problem, but it seems like 'good' schools aren't ever hiring and the Teach website is just trash.  I've gotten to the point that I've been thinking about leaving the teaching profession entirely.  Just looking for some motivation, or change, or maybe just venting."
"For those who are leaving / left, what was your breaking point?


First things first: I recognize the irony of asking this question in a NYC-centric sub. But I know there are people here who have left the city. I want to know why. I don't know what it is, but lately I feel like I'm at my wit's end with NY. 

I've been here for a long time now, but I've recently soured on the whole endeavor and I think I'd be better off somewhere else. I'm tired of the crazies, the third-world infrastructure, the cost of living, and the corrupt and ossified politics (Cuomo-Nixon last night was a disaster, to say nothing of the GOP candidates). Anywhere else, on the middle class salary I earn here, I could have a nice house and a car where I'm not exposed to lunatics and the smell of piss and garbage on a daily basis. 

I'm tired of the constant and predictable selfishness and awfulness exhibited by the typical Manhattanites, and having been here for years and dealt with the daily bullshit, the NYC ""Best City in the World"" braggadocio just doesn't do it for me. Also so sick of the pretentious transplants who will inevitably fuck off to some inland hellhole after 2-3 years. Anyways, maybe this whole thing is just me - but for those of you who left, what was your breaking point? I feel like I will miss a lot of the good things in the city but the negatives are outweighing the positives for me at this point. 

I don't know why I'm feeling this way after so many years but I feel like I can't bear this city any longer. Those who left or who are thinking of leaving, what caused you to finally bite the bullet?"
