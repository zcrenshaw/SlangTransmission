"""An asthma attack is a personal attack on the customer""


So this happened a few years back when I was working at your favorite, now defunct toy store. 

For some background, the store I worked in was very old, no air conditioning and the air flow was terrible. This specific day was a very humid and hot day (New England summers are HUMID)and I had been having issues with my asthma on and off. 

I had been working at the electronics desk, grabbing video games and just working as a general checkout. I grabbed some games from the lockup for a customer and headed back to my checkout desk. Two people were already waiting in line. I did my usual spiel. apologizing for the wait etc. Customer is visibly agitated already so I can tell this will be fun. She's pulling a bunch of stuff out of her cart, saying she no longer wants it. That's cool, at least she didn't shove it on a shelf somewhere. As I'm turning around to place her item she doesn't want on the counter, I can feel an asthma attack coming. I do that thing when you feel like you can't breathe so you try to inhale really hard. She assumed I was sighing at her for not wanting her items (for real, don't care, I'm not closing, not my problem).

This began the biggest freak out of the day. This woman starts yelling at me for being rude, saying it's my job to take her things she doesn't want and to be polite. As she's yelling I'm now start to stress out, making my asthma worse. As she's still yelling at me, I sit down. That was apparently the wrong move. She decides that it's the final straw and saying ""I'm not buying any of this, you need to learn how to treat customers!"".

She did call corporate, I was talked to by my manager about it and explained the whole thing (she knew about my asthma), which was on video. My manager actually apologized for the customer saying ""I never knew an asthma attack is a personal attack on a customer."" I will never forget that line or that manager. She was amazing.

"I have been yelled at twice this week because we are out of chocolate ice cream


I work part time in a small town grocery store. One of our suppliers recently got sold to a new owner/group/investors, the second time in a year, and...they don't have their act together. 

We have been out of everyones favorite Tillimook products for weeks. No plain chocolate ice cream. We have Udderly Chocolate, we have Chocolate Peanut Butter, we have Chocolate Cookie Dough, We have Chocolate Fudge, But No PLAIN CHOCOLATE ice cream! 

One customer called on the phone and lectured me. They would rather believe that we forgot to order the ice cream than our distributer fucked up. They want me to imediately tell the owners and want to know exactly when that ice cream will be available. This was four days ago. 

Yesterday a customer in line had to hold up the line to lecture me about our failing the community because there was no chocolate ice cream. Didnt I realize how far they had to drive and how much they have to do? 

A couple weeks ago I thought I might need to call the sheriff on a customer having a loud tearful meltdown in front of the freezers because we are out of his favorite ice  cream. 

Tillimook, what are you putting in the ice cream? 

Our supplier is non responsive to phone calls. 

It's the Chocolate Ice Cream Apocolypse
