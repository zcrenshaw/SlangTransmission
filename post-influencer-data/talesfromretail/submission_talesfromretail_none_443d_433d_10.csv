"She's having a seizure? Can you still ring me up?


Not much back story. As you can probably guess from the title, I'm epileptic and have seizures. Thankfully, my store was actually super understanding of my disability and did everything to help me. This is a mixture of what I remember, and what I was told by my managers what happened.  

There is only 1 register in the store where you can get cigarettes/lighters/certain more expensive liquor etc. And I happened to be the one working that register. Everything was going completely fine with the usual customer banter when an aura hit me and hit me hard.  

For those of you that are unfamiliar, an aura is kind of a warning sign before a seizure that only you can feel, but can do nothing about. It could be a funny smell, hallucinations, the feeling of slipping out of reality, a number of different things. Anyway, for me, this time, it was the feeling that everything was moving in slow motion.  

Last thing I remember was scanning a box of golf balls and the customer requesting Marlboro gold, Then feeling frozen in place (which apparently I actually was) I heard this right before I blacked out. 

Guy: Hello?  HELLO!?! HEEEEEELLLOOOOOO!?!  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? I SAID I WANTED A BOX OF MARLBORO GOLD! ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME??  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! MARLBORO GOLD! DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS?? ARE YOU AN IDIOT?  

Aaaaaand then I was gone. I woke up on the floor surrounded by my managers. (One customer was awesome enough to go run and get help.) From what I understand, the whole time I was on the floor having a seizure, the customers in line were watching this and *actually bitching* to the managers helping me about how I must be on drugs and they still expected to be rung up, despite them trying to explain I was having a seizure.  
They were telling the managers to ""just step over me"" to get their smokes and lighters for them and get to the register, then causing a huge scene when they were refused. They said they actually had to radio security to come and shoo people away.  

It just blows my mind that people can act this way. Look, I'm sorry I'm having a seizure and can't get your cigarettes for you, but I don't exactly have any control over this. I think you'll survive without your smokes and lighters for a few more minutes. Makes me sad this is the world we live in sometimes."
"Why didn't you call to tell me that the event you didn't know I was coming to was cancelled?!


I work in a bookstore that offers a weekly program to young children. It's usually a story/craft/snack. It's very popular with parents of young children. To keep the size of the crowd down and so we know how many are coming, we started requiring parents to sign up ahead of time. It also helps if the event is cancelled and we can just call/email the parents and let them know. 

Well last winter, we had a pretty bad snow storm. The owner of the bookstore decided we were going to close early that afternoon. The program was in the morning, but he didn't want parents bringing in little kids and getting stuck there so he decided to cancel the program. Now, we try to accommodate people who just show up if we have enough supplies. We intentionally prep enough extra. But we always remind the parents every week that they should sign up ahead of time. 

So in comes a mom with her two screaming kids 10 minutes into when the program would have started. We always try to start right on time. She'll be pissed off mom (PM) and I'll be me.

PM: Hello, you're doing a program here today.

Me (surprised because we contacted all the parents already): Not today. We cancelled it because of the weather. We called everyone to let them know not to come in. It isn't safe.

PM (gets very angry): Why wasn't I called? 

Me: Well we did call everyone m'am. Let me get our sign up list and make sure your contact info is correct. 

I grabbed the list and started looking at the names. 

Me: Okay, what's your name?

PM: I wasn't signed up.

I looked at her blankly.

Me: I'm sorry, but how were we supposed to call you if you didn't sign up ahead of time? We didn't know you were coming or have your number. We always ask you sign up for these programs in advanced as we only have limited supplies.

PM sighs: I've never had to sign up before!

Me (knowing that's not true): Well, it's to prevent incidents like this. I'm very sorry you were inconvenience. Whenever we have bad weather we put if the program is cancelled or not on our website. And here's our phone number if you ever have any questions about signing up. Have a nice day.

PM mutters under breath and grab's her child's arm and leaves.

Apparently one of the prerequisites to working in a bookstore is to be a clairvoyant. "
