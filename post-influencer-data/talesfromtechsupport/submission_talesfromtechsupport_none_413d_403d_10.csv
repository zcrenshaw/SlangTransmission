"I'd like to buy a used computer. Lightly used. Top of the line. You have those to sell for $100, right?


I do desktop support for a K-12 independent school.  We buy desktops and laptops on a four-year rotation, for about $800 a pop (yeah, I know, we're cheap).  For the past several years, we've been offering ""retired"" computers (i.e. they are 4+ years old and have been replaced) to employees for $100 each.  They have a clean install of Windows 10 and nothing else, and we make clear that they are offered with no warranty or support whatsoever and could last 5 years or could die in 30 days.  Nevertheless, we get a few takers because they're a lot better than what you can normally pick up for that price.  I'm sure it helps that I take the ones with the lightest use off the pile to recondition and sell.

Apparently one of our faculty members heard about this offer through the grapevine, because yesterday afternoon, she sent me this email:

&gt;Subject: Used Computer?

&gt;My husband would be very interested in my purchasing a used computer through \[school\], is there anything available?  If so he is thinking about the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;8th Generation i5 processor with 16 GB Memory and 1 TB of storage.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks,

I saw it this afternoon, and after I got my guffaws under control, I replied with this email:

&gt;Those specs are better than the ones we're buying new!  This year, we bought 8th gen i5s with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB SSDs for storage on laptops (7th gen i5s with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSDs for desktops).  Any computers we sell would be at least four years old, and would likely come with i5s from 2013 or 2014, 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM, and 320 GB hard drives.  If your husband wants something better than that, he's going to have to look elsewhere.

I bcc'ed my boss and texted him:

&gt;lol, check out the email I just bcc'ed you on.  it's amazing

He responded a few minutes ago:

&gt;Lol, do you have a junker you can sell me?  I'll take a Bugatti Veyron if you have any

Seems accurate."
