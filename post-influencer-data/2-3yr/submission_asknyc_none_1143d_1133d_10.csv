"Natives, What are somethings you wish you saw/did earlier?


I'm a native that has finally gotten her own apartment and real job.

I've been loving the freedom and anytime schedule. But really want to make the most of my current lifestyle.

What are some  NYC-centric things that you wish you did in your mid twenties or mid thirties? 

Cliche tourist things or just things you never got around to-- is there something you regret not doing yet?

I don't want to be 40 years old like, ""Yeah I'm a native and I've never once been to Staten Island!"" "
"What's your craziest ""ONLY IN NYC"" dating story?


I've got an hour till work is over.


What's your most NYC dating story?

Bonus for awfulness. "
