"How can I stop being attracted to high school girls? 28/m here


I have a serious problem and I need help. I am too attracted to girls from 16-18 and I can't understand why.

Two problems here.

1) I take part in beach activities often, and there are often bikini girls all around. Even when they are obviously of high school age, I can't help but ogle.

2) After activities When our groups exchange contacts(people of all age and gender; old, young, male, female etc), I would check out the prettier women on FB or Instagram. Even after I realize some of them are in high school, I continue to look through their pictures and profiles.

**I don't even know what's my bloody problem.** I am a 28 yo male with a 27-yo girlfriend and we have sex regularly, yet I keep ogling at girls TWELVE years my junior!

I haven't sunk to the depth of fapping to them, and I would never allow myself to hook up with one. But I want to stop being attracted to high school girls. I feel like a predator. Can anyone help me please?"

I hate that I can't wear ""long underwear"" or yogo pants for men. I wear them under pants but if I wear them under shorts, I get glaring looks."

"How clueless were you during your first relationship? What did you do? Or what didn't you do?


What were you most afraid of?


I told my guy friend of 3 years that I like him. He said he likes me too. Problem is, we both have zero relationship experience. He admitted that he is afraid and not sure how to be a good boyfriend. He is a little older, 28. I'm not quite as old, but this is still new to me as well. We decided to take things slow, there's no need to slap a label on us right this instant. As far as now, we are still just friends, who now know that we like each other. 


I think we are both really clueless right now as to what happens next... Is this normal? When you were once in my shoes, was this how you felt? "
"I see a lot of posts on here about bad traits in women to look out for. What are some good traits to look for in a woman?


I saw a posts here the other day about ""needy"" girls and their traits. I've been in a relationship like that before.

Rather than focusing on negative traits, what are some positive things to look for in a woman that'd prevent me from ending up dating another high maintenance/ needy/ narcissistic girl?"

"What's the biggest ""surprise"" you've had when sleeping or being with somebody for the first time?


I asked this question a few weeks ago on /r/AskWomen and was thinking it would be really interesting to see what /r/AskMen has to say.

What were your biggest surprises?"

"Would you take male contraception? Why?


Assuming that there's a non-hormonal, reversible, safe male contraceptive... (Projects like Vasalgel, Bimek, RISUG etc)

What's the main motivation behind taking it? 

Is it because you're in a relationship and don't want her to have to go through hormonal side effects from the pill?

Is it because you want more control in your sex life/relationship? Since now, in order for a pregnancy to happen, both parties have to agree. 

If it because you don't want to have to trust that someone else has been on the pill?

"Men of reddit, how should a girl ask if a guy wants a prostate massage during a BJ?


so I'm seeing someone and he seems to have trouble ejaculating and I read online that a man's g spot is his prostate, sounds great right?  But obviously all men fall into two categories, those who are ok with a finger in the butt and  those who aren't... not judging anyone it just seems the ones who are anti are super anti and unwilling to try it and the ones who are pro maybe don't talk about it.  So how do I ask if that is something he wants to try?  Do I just buy some lube and tell him I read about it online and was curious?  Should I wait a while?  it's only been  a few weeks of knowing each other.  Also I don't know why but I sort of get the sense he would be a yes.  Feel free to add other random advice too.

Edit:  Thank you guys for all the advice and yes I'm going to just wait for a good moment and talk to him and see if he wants to try it, I'm thinking when we are texting all sexy like is a good time, lol ty for all your advice.  And no I will not just randomly poke him.

Edit 2: lol who would have thought this would be my most upvoted post?  That said you guys were all really helpful and I greatly appreciate it, no I will not be updating you to his reaction because I feel like that would be a violation of his privacy.  You guys are the best!"
