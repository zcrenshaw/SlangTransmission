"TIFU by holding my breath and passing out during a lecture.


This happened earlier today. So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I'll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I'll rest for 3 minutes. I'll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I'm feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. ""I can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". So I go and I'm feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I'm feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I'm struggling. Like I'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but I'm going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I'm seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. Lecture still sucked after that. 

TL;DR Tried going for Olympic gold in breath holding. Failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall. 

EDIT: A word

"TIFU by joking with a date I was a serial killer.


So because of circumstances beyond my control this didn't happen today.

Cue my first date with a girl I met on Tinder, we meet up at a restaurant and get to talking. This are going great, she thinks I'm funnier in person (when does that ever happen?!), she actually invites me to the mall to hangout more with some of her friends when dinner is over.

So after the food arrives the conversation turns a little more towards how we met (pay close attention and you will spot my mistake). She states she's glad I'm normal and not some sort of serial killer.

Now I could have just laughed... I could have but I was funny remember? I replied with ""Oh thanks for thinking I'm normal! But I actually am a serial killer, bodies for days buried out at the farm.""

She laughed, I laughed, I thought I did great at making it sound sarcastic.

She excuses herself to the bathroom to do whatever girls do in bathrooms on dates. It was taking a questionably long time for her to return and I was slightly worried she bailed and stuck me with the bill, my luck right? Wrong.

So unbelievably wrong, my luck was worse as police officers suddenly appear out of nowhere and tell me to keep both of my hands visible on the table.

At this point I'm confused, this must be a joke. I see my date coming with a staff member and get ready for Ashton Kutcher to appear, no such luck.

The police ask if it's me and she says ya, the cops get me to stand up and handcuff me and walk me out, not a single person seems to want to answer any of my questions.

I'm in the car and the police are outside talking to my date for a few minutes when they get into the car with me and ask me if I told my date I was a serial killer, areyoufuckingkiddingme...

I tell them yes but I was joking.

LPT: Don't admit to police you told someone you were a serial killer.

So that derailed my plans, I spent the next 5-6 hours explaining myself over and over and over that I was kidding.

I guess eventually they either believed me or got tired of hearing me speak much to my lawyers disapproval (to me speaking) and let me go and reminded me that my jokes suck.

I'm not sure how date number two will go but I'm excited to find out, also a bright side is that I have no idea who paid for my food.

TL:DR: I made a joke I was a serial killer, date doesn't get sarcasm, I spend hours in the police station."
"TIFU by getting Rubik's cubes banned from school (taken from my story on /r/cubers)


I was homeschooled for 11 out of 12 years of school before college. While my education was good, I was left with a lot of free time. That free time is why is decided to learn the Rubik's cube in the first place. That one year that I wasn’t homeschool was my junior year and I went to a private Christian school. 


After the first quarter of the school year, I brought a rubik's cube to school for the first time. I only played with it during lunch and study hall because I didn’t want to distract other students or teachers. It didn’t take long and I had several people asking me to teach them. After a few days I taught a friend the beginners method and gave them a cheat sheet for basic OLL and PLL. Since I had several people asking me to teach them, I told about ten people that I would teach them if they brought their own cubes. Within the next week, five or six people had gone out and bought cubes from amazon and showed them to me. I taught three or four people over the course of the next month and one kid even bought a giant cube that was about 10x bigger than normal. (fun fact: he didn’t know how to solve it then and I asked him recently and he still has the cube and still doesn’t know how to solve it)


It wasn’t a very big school. We had maybe 150 students total. Needless to say, a trend like this reaches everyone’s ears quickly. Friends that I had taught were teaching other people who went out to buy cubes and the next thing I knew, lunch time was full of the sounds of crappy cubes twisting and turning as about 15 people had their own cubes. At this time, I was sub-45 and most other students where sub-2 or sub-3 at best. 


I thought it was a fun, little brain exercise that anyone could enjoy and wouldn’t cause any trouble with the school administration. I was wrong.


At this school, we had chapel every friday before lunch. Before the religious message, we’d have announcements that usually have things like birthdays or holidays, and occasionally if a large group of people were breaking rules like using their phones during class then it would be announced that this particular thing is a problem, this is a warning, and we’re about to start cracking down on this and giving out lots of detentions. 


The principal of the school got up to give announcements like always and said that recently there’s been an epidemic at the school that needs to be addressed. Apparently while I was following the rules and not pulling it out during class, some students weren’t so smart. It was officially banned from being pulled out in a classroom. Any violations would result in a detention. (the principal was very new and unprofessional and never gave out warnings or demerits. In the school of 150, there was about 20 detentions given out per week) 


I was proud that a trend that I had started had gotten so big that it had to be addressed to the whole school, and I wasn’t worried about getting in trouble because I never used it in class. (also; side note, you could only use a rubik's cube on campus if 1: Cafeteria, 2: Study Hall, or 3: the teacher says you can.) 


Apparently lots of students completely ignored the rule. Either that, or the principal just got jealous that he didn’t know how. Because it was announced that rubik’s cubes are officially banned from the school campus. If a cube was seen anywhere. In or out of a backpack. Cafeteria or classroom, the cube would be permanently confiscated and the culprit gets a detention. 


They made a section about it in the yearbook.

Rubik's cubes banned from school

https://imgur.com/gallery/YiAdV


The year after, I didn’t attend, but my brother did. The school got a new principal and cubes are allowed again. 


A few different things happened regarding this story, but this story is long enough. I’ve had this story on my mind for a while and decided it was time to post this here on /r/cubers (and now here to /r/TIFU).

TL : DR


-Brought Rubik's Cube to school, not in class

-Taught friend

-People thought it was cool

-Taught them

-Lots of people who later used them in class

-Warning was given that detentions will be given for using them in class

-People didn't listen

-Cubes were banned from the campus entirely"

"TIFU By getting caught exporting users from the active directory


This happened a couple minutes ago. A while ago I found out a way to gain full domain admin privileges at my high school. It involved taking advantage of partial domain admin privileges and combining it with the local laptop's admin privileges. Anyways, needless to say one of the first things I did was hop on the Active Directory(where all the Users and their data for the domain are stored) and started getting people's lunch numbers and names. I mainly used this to mess with close friends. Today I found out that I could also export admin and teachers data too, here's where the fuck up begins. I began doing this in Physics and there were a small group of students huddled around me interested in what I was doing. The teacher was walking by and saw that I had the active directory window right next to a Excel sheet. He understandably took my computer and probably knew what I was doing(He probably has a pretty good understanding of computers since he's also an IT admin). I just finished my quiz as of typing this and waiting till the end of class to ask for it. I'll provide a update in about an hour.

Tl;dr: I found a way to fuck with the active directory and got caught doing it, waiting to see what will happen.

Update: Still haven't heard anything about my laptop yet, will update if I hear anything.

Update 2: I'm not getting it by the end of the day, I'll post an update on Friday.

Update 3: People seem to be questioning the legitimacy of my post. I want to clarify what I meant by partial admin privileges. The domain account itself has full admin privileges, but the devices assigned to the students prevent the programs that admins would use the admin privileges from being accessed. They prevented certain methods of getting a local full admin account(you can't just go to the control panel and add a new admin account), but what I could do was reset the local admin account password to whatever I like. Then I just had to install [this service pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7887) and I was able to activate the Active Directory. I might just come clean on how I did it in hopes that they reduce my punishment. 

Update 4: Well, they definitively caught me. They arrange a disciplinary conference with me and my parents in the morning on Friday. I'll make sure to update again after that. I really thank you guys for the great advice. I decided to just come clean and be honest and tell them how I did it in hopes that they reduce the punishment. Also,       thanks for letting this hit the front page. 

On the bright side if I get in some deep shit at least I'll have some internet points to show for it!

Update 4.5: People are saying that I was already able to do it with other methods without the local admin account. When I tried it on the powershell it didn't work, but only after I set up RSAT(which I only recently figured out what you guys were referring too) and did the local admin thing I was able to access the AD.

[Last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5vz47e/tifu_by_getting_caught_exporting_users_from_the/?st=1Z141Z3&amp;sh=0ac85e4c): made a new thread since this update is a little lengthy."
"TIFU by turning a nice day paintballing into one of the most uncomfortable situations in my life (nsfw)


TIFU because quite a few years ago I went paintballing with my school and it was a fairly mediocre event but being the person I am I wanted to make it sound way cooler than it was. I then decided to put up a Facebook post saying ""good day paintballing but 2 shots to the arm, 3 to the chest, 1 to the head and 1 to the nuts made it rather painful!"" So when when i get home I am explaining to my parents how my fun the day was but the shots to my body are quite sore and the one to my nuts is really sore but the comment got my parents concerned so they said I should probably inspect myself to make sure there is no damage done. I agree so I go to my room wait a few minutes and come back to tell my family the good knows that I will not need castrated anytime soon so my family are relieved. However, me being the idiot I am I jokingly say ""I wouldn't know what to look for anyway!"" Thinking I was just cracking a funny little joke but my parents get really concerned by this so my dad thinks the best route of action is for him to inspect my genitals just to make sure everything was healthy. The worst part of it all is while I had my dad inspecting my genitals I knew fine well no one here needed to suffer through this because I had lied about the paintball shot to the dick just to make the day out seem funnier than it was but I was to deep into the lie that if I told them I would of had a lot of awkward explaining to everyone why I lied about it all and 12 year old me deemed it a worse situation than I was already in so I just had to endure one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life.

Note: The reason my family was wanting to inspect was we had a family friend a year older than me who had to get their testicles removed due to testicular contortion as he played rugby

TL;DR
My dad had to inspect my genitals because of a lie I made to make me paintballing sound cooler than i actually was"
"TIFU by being home alone and slipping, burning, and concussing myself within 10 minutes.


Obligatory: this was back in may when I moved in with my boyfriend in our new apartment.

Boyfriend is a fire fighter and left me alone in the apartment for the first time in order to head to fire fighting practice. I thought all was good and I went about my nightly routine. Boy that was a mistake.

So I began to unload the dishwasher, which I had filled to the brim with dishes and other assorted things that needed washing but that I was too lazy to wash, like the little knobs on the dials of the stove.

The dishwasher had been done for a couple minutes and when I opened it, a small amount of smoke and a horrible smell came out. To my surprise, one of the plastic knobs had fallen to the bottom where it was resting on the element of the dishwasher.

Now a normal person would see the plastic melting onto a hot object and think to themselves ""wow, that's a hot object!"" but instead I reached into the dishwasher and tried to grab the knob – my arms being short enough that I had to turn my head to reach it. I quickly realized it was not the knob I grabbed, but the scorching hot element. My skin made a sickening sizzle and I cried out in pain. Yikes.

So I immediately run my hand under cool water, which helps for only a moment. For lasting relief, I turn to the freezer for some ice (knowing full well that you aren't supposed to ice burns). It seemed like the only reasonable solution that would help the searing pain radiating up my arm. 

I open the upper door, reach into the frost and grab an ice cube tray. I pull it out, and (being my clumsy self) drop the tray so ice falls and scatters all over our floor. I cry out in anguish, and decide that the ice is still sanitary if I put it in something. So I go to open a drawer for a plastic ziploc bag, only to slip on a rogue ice cube and tumble to the ground, pulling the table cloth on the kitchen table in the process. This spills salt and pepper on the floor but luckily nothing else.

My hand is throbbing at this point and my ass is sore. I crouch down and start shovelling ice shards into the small baggie. I finally feel like I'm going to get the sweet sweet relief of cold on my burn, so I stand up straight... only to smash the back of my head on the freezer door still hanging open. I immediately fall to the ground, as bread and peas start raining down around me. Tears are silently rolling down my cheeks as I look over and see that my baggie of ice had split open and ice was now mixed with bread crumbs and peas on the floor.

After contemplating my life choices for a small while, I managed to clean all my mess, grab two frozen items (one for my head and one for my hand), and slowly shuffle my way to the couch, where I sat with my 'ice packs' until the door rattled and my boyfriend walks in, takes one look at me and says;

*""Holy shit. You're a mess!""*


TLDR: I forgot dishwashers had hot parts, burned myself, then concussed myself trying to treat the burn. 

Edit: Spelling! Got = Hot  

Edit: Got my first ever gold for being a mess! Hurray! Thank you stranger!

Edit: A lot of people didn't know about the exposed element thing, I didn't either until I asked boyfriend why there was a hot thing in the dishwasher. Derp. Also, a commenter posted a dishwasher manual and mine is virtually the same on the interior! 

Edit: yeah yeah yeah ""firefighting practice"" is funny. It's actually a training night! "
"TIFU by wearing acrylic nails and driving.


For context, I'm a 21 y/o female who once in a blue moon likes having cool nails. I got these cool nails that look [a lot like this](http://www.thepolishedmommy.com/wp-content/uploads/blogger/-_jBPMv1f28k/ULU5XPKHEWI/AAAAAAAAFeE/VCDDthOyLdU/s1600/kkcenterhk%2Bsilver%2Bnails.JPG). Super happy, looking super fly, whatever. 
So about a week and a half later I'm driving to class and feel that i have a massive, itchy booger so with my cool new handy booger pickers, i decide to extract that fucker with my pinky finger. Feels great. Until the car in front of me slams on their breaks causing me also to slam on my breaks, finger two knuckles deep in my schnoz, effectively ramming my pinky up my nose. 
I panic, lots of profanities happen. I call my mom, finger still in nose, who says to just pull it out, but I'm scared i'm going to pull out brains or something. 
So I decide to man up and just pull it out, but my finger is a tad bit stuck. So against any proper medical advice I'm sure is out there, I pull it out. 
/There is blood. 
/There is no acrylic nail still on pinky. 
Then I fully panic and drive to prompt care. 
They extracted acrylic nail which was lodged in there not as bad as I thought, but I still panicked.
Got a cool nose bandage out of it, though. 

TL;DR-- acrylic nail glue not too good, picked a boogie, slammed on breaks, wound up dislodging nail in nose causing a nasty bruise and brutal nose bleed. Looked pretty badass.

"TIFU by possibly starting a rumour that I received a handjob from a student. [NSFW]


So this happened on Monday in the school cafeteria. I'm an assistant English Language Teacher in Japan and I've been living and working over here for about 2 years. I'm not great at Japanese and the kids aren't great at English so miscommunication is more common than would be ideal.

So as anyone who has ever started learning a second language can attest, the first words you learn are the swear words, the sex terms and anything else your dirty little gutter mind can find. In preparation for my students doing this, I took some good advice from a friend and started misinterpreting what the kids would say to me.

Student: "" Sex!"" 
Me: ""Six? You're six years old? No wonder you're so short"" Boom. Shut that kid down and burned him so hard he won't be talking about sex again until he has to explain it to HIS kids.

Student: ""Penis!"" (Which they inexplicably pronounce as ""pen-nis"") 
Me: Tennis? You want to play tennis? But the racquet is bigger than you? Boom. Japanese kids are short. This is easy.

Student: ""Hand job!"" 
Me: Hard job? Yeah I have a hard job. I have to teach you *points at student*

Nuclear Explosion. All the kids start laughing as they think I said something along the lines of ""I got a hand job from you""

So that backfired spectacularly and I will now go back to hiding in the corner hoping that the kids don't try and kancho my butthole or spread rumours about my sex life.

TL;DR I teach English in Japan. I purposefully misinterpret rude words the kids say. I ""misheard"" hand job as hard job and pointed at a student that made my job hard which may have resulted in an unsavoury rumour involving me and the student sigh"
"TIFU by being too blue


My tale of woe actually happened a few hours ago. 

This year I decided to be more true to myself. More creative. More adventurous. I gently dipped my toe in the alternative waters and got my hair dyed bright purple at a salon. So edgy, I know. It looked so wonderful for about a week.

Unfortunately, my hair gets so oily I could open a fish &amp; chip shop and run the fryers off my follicles. So the colour washed out very quickly. It faded to that silvery lavender hue that appears *tres chic* on Kelly Osbourne and Lady Gaga. Somehow it made me appear minutes past the point of *livor mortis*. 

Unable to afford bi-monthly professional hair maintenance I went the DIY route instead. I bought a little stirring cup, hair paint brush thing, gloves, and most importantly the glorious black cape to make it very profesh. I found the drug-store hair dye was ok, but I wanted a BOLDER colour. I wanted to make a STATEMENT. I asked my neon-haired friends which brands they like. “Manic Panic”, they all said. Manic Panic indeed.

As the latest cheap hair colour faded I got some Manic Panic Rockabilly Blue. The whole tub went on. None of that wussy pastel-dilution for me thanks. 30 minutes later I entered the bathroom to rinse off the colour. The water ran a deep blue as the colour washed away. I rubbed shampoo through my hair, rinsed, and was greeted with smurf blue hands. Shit.

I look down and my feet were smurf blue. My calves. Upper thighs. Shit shit shit. At this point, the home-hair experts amongst you might be wondering, “How the hell did you get colour over yourself like that while rinsing your hair over the tub?”. Was I in the tub? WAS I? No.

Genius me did what I always do when rinsing my hair and I jumped into the shower. I let that hot water cascade from head to toe, carrying blue dye down my whole nekkid body. Did I just dip my head under a running tap like a smart person? Of course not. Instead, I’ve given myself the hue complement of a Golden Shower. 

As I surveyed the damage I realised I’ve flicked hair dye over the white shower curtain and shower mat. It’s soaked into the porous 70s terrazzo floor of the shower. Dangerously close our treasured decorative terrazzo fish. 

Did my troubles end here? No of course not. This is TIFU. And I committed.

Literally in a Manic Panic now, I maniacally tried scrubbing the dye off with a harsh exfoliator. It felt like I was stripping my fleshy bits with tradesman grade sand paper. 

It hurt. It was not super effective. I summoned Mum.

Mum entered the bathroom to find her brightest golden-child looking quite the opposite. Worse, I had my back turned to the water to rinse my hair so the colour got in all the parts I couldn’t reach like my back. And down my bum crack. 

Mum stepped up as contender for Mother Of the Year. She scrubbed the back and ass-crack of her 30-something daughter, who’s bent over ass up, and dyed blue.

Except the exfoliant wasn’t working. Mum is a domestic goddess and remembered orange oil is great for stain removal. So she started wiping orange oil over my blue bits. And holy jesus Christ on a stick, It worked! You guys, I'm declaring orange oil the new Windex. 

So now, I’m just mildly tinted blue, except my fingernails which are still blue. I smell like a citrus garden. But I have my nice blue hair. I also had to bleach and scrub the shower. And i’m pleased to report Mr terrazzo fish emerged unscathed. 

For proof, because pics or it didn't happen, here's my [blue](http://imgur.com/K78Kew7) [legs](http://imgur.com/y4oiCFC), [blue nails](http://imgur.com/0qZvbiB), [blue hair](http://imgur.com/2f1DCXB), and [Mr terrazzo fish] (http://imgur.com/BnQPeku).
I’m blue da ba dee da ba die ...

EDIT TL;DR: Feeling blue. Dyed hair blue. Accidentally blue myself instead.

"TIFU by branding myself a neo-nazi


Well this fuck up, as the tales usually go, didn't occur today. Technically it was around 10 years ago, but I've only realised today. So, from the top I guess.

I come from a fairly spiritual family with pagan beliefs. There's a lot of interesting stuff when it comes to paganism in its many different forms. The mythology of different cultures, the symbolism, you get the idea.

Anyway, my dad was married at the time and he had the inside of his wedding band engraved with runic symbols as a blessing from a friend. I was always pretty fascinated by this and thought it would be a great idea to get a tattoo of one of the runes on my chest, right by my heart. Sweet stuff, right? Just had to pick a rune to start with and find the cheapest tattooist nearby since I was (and still am) rather poor. The other runes could wait for now.

With the rune picked I went off to the tattooist, showed them the picture and £15 later the tattooist slapped on some kitchen roll with a bit of tape on my very hairy chest (thanks mate) and said ""good luck"". Until now I had no idea why he was so reluctant to talk to me all the way through.

Until recently I'd never be in a situation to be in public without my shirt on, but I've started taking my son swimming and going to the gym so now the tattoo is on display more than before. This wouldn't be a problem until I decided to look at the website that our beloved Pepe ended up on, where I found the rune of life took on a life of its own at some point. So yes, I unknowingly tattooed a neo-nazi symbol on my chest, by my heart, right where the National Alliance would probably love it.

Here's the link anyways http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/life-rune.html#.WK6wK8unxnE

TL:DR went for a nice, symbolic tattoo, am now accidentally a nazi. Always research your tattoos.

Edit: just wanted to say thanks so much for your responses to this. They've either had me chuckling or thinking and both are good in my book."
"TIFU by forgetting babies exist and making a circus crew dig through the trash for hours.


Not today, but a few months ago. 
I recently became part of a circus production that is well-known in my area. I joined a few months ago and got a really great part and I was super excited to meet people and hopefully make some friends. The only problem is that I can be pretty shy and awkward at times so meeting new people is difficult for me.

Anyway this FU happened in October. I hadn’t made many friends by the time our Halloween show rolled around. New recruits like myself are required to work shows doing things like ushering, concessions, tickets, etc. since we haven't had time to learn acts yet. I decide to do ushering since I can at least see the show and chill out. It's a Saturday night and the show has just ended. As I help usher people out I figure I would join in with the custodial crew because hey why not? I can maybe make some small talk and show that I am a team player. That's probably where the fuck up began.

I'm walking through the bleachers picking up trash when I come across a really small pair of pants. Like, really really small. I don't know why I thought it was funny but it just was. Who leaves tiny pants behind at a circus? Way too small for an adult and children aren’t this small, right?
I should have just put them back where I found them but I didn't. I should have given it to a crew member but I didn’t. 
Here is the real fuck up. I thought to myself, ""I bet if I just get rid of these tiny pants and pretend they were never here, everyone can go home early and I will be a hero!"" or something like that. (important to note that there is a huge checklist of things the cast and crew must do every night before going home. Cleaning the bleachers is one of them)

I can't explain why I did it but...I threw them away. I know it probably makes me an asshole for doing that but I just wanted those very small pants gone and out of my life. Well that obviously was a huge mistake.
The cast and crew are all gathered together about 20 minutes later in front of the circus directors who are all saying things like “Great show tonight! Everything is checked off the list tonight already! Fantastic!” I’ve totally forgotten about the pants at this point, already imagining myself snuggled at home (my feet were killing me from ushering shows all day long). Then the director says, “Just one more thing and I can set you all loose. A woman who attended our last show said she dropped her diaper bag and apparently a pair of baby pants fell out. Did anyone see a small pair of pants while cleaning the bleachers?”
My heart went to my throat. I couldn’t believe I threw away those damn pants. I couldn’t believe someone came back for them. I COULDN’T BELIEVE I FORGOT BABIES EXISTED. 
Everyone is looking around confused, waiting for someone to speak up. 
“Come on, guys, someone had to have seen them. Maybe someone put them in the lost and found?”

SHIT. SHIT. SHIT. Why did I forget we had a lost and found?? 

But wait, we could just go to the trash can and get them. Surely they would be near the top? Since I was in the back of the crowd I sort of muffled my voice but shouted “I think they got thrown away!” Everyone starts looking around for who said it but I look around confused too. 

The director is angry and tells us that no one is leaving until we find those pants. All the garbage cans have been emptied and put into the giant dumpster we have in the back.
So we all start slowly making our way to the dumpster meanwhile everyone is saying things like “FUCK the guy that threw away those pants.” “Yeah, who doesn’t just put them in lost and found?” “Whoever did it better hope I don’t find them, they are so dead.”

I try to join in with the bashing of this mysterious pants-thrower-away-er but I mostly just tried to keep my breathing steady and not look suspicious. 

We get to the dumpster and find that there are over 30 trash bags that have been thrown away over the course of the day and there was no way to know where it was. Cue the entire circus staff and crew climbing into this dumpster, throwing the garbage over the side and hand picking through the smelly and disgusting trash. It was mostly popcorn, peanuts and empty cups until one of the cast members chucked one of the bags over that hadn’t been tied properly and a blue-ish liquid completely soaked the 15 people standing underneath them, ruining their clothes and shoes. At this point it is 2 am, freezing cold, everyone is exhausted and just wants to be home. NOT sifting through trash for a tiny pair of pants.
Finally, someone shouted “I found them!” and we all cheered. The pants were returned to a grateful mother and everyone was allowed to go home.
While walking to the parking lot I halfheartedly said “At least this was sort of like a bonding experience huh?”
The only response was “Fuck off.”


TL;DR I was cleaning up after a circus show and found a small pair of pants. Assumed no normal sized human or child could fit into them so I threw them away. Turns out babies are a thing and the mom wanted the pants back. Entire circus cast and crew stayed until 2 a.m. searching through nasty garbage until we found them.

Edit: Just some quick points of clarity. A lot of people are asking why the mom would even want the tiny trash pants back. My wall of text was already really long so I didn't mention that 1) The director obviously didn't tell the woman that they had been thrown away, just that we would look for them and call her if we found them and 2) the director himself took them home to wash them so she wouldn't even know. They were not expensive but bossman was more concerned with our professional appearance so yeah.

Edit 2: To make this all worse, we are a university-run circus production which means that we donate all of our time and energy to these shows, we don't even get class credit haha yay. (Don't get me wrong, I love it to death and is by far my favorite extra curricular)"
"TIFU by calling the cops and getting my grandma detained


So currently I am staying with my grandma while I go to my local community college, she lives in a neighborhood with 24/7 security officers that patrol at night. Tonight I had class late and had planned to spend the night at a friends house since I don't have any Wednesday classes. However, my friend got called into work last minute so I decided to head home. Here is where the fuck up began, I completely forgot to let my grandma know that I'd be coming home and she didn't expect to see me until Wednesday night. So I drove home and her car was gone, and the lights all off. I was a little confused but thought maybe she ran to the store or something. As it turns out she had taken her car into the shop earlier today and had turned in for an early night. I let myself in and headed towards my room using only my phone for light, but when I turned the hall I saw a dark figure and panicked, turning and running to the front door. I quickly got in my car and drove a few blocks down, calling the cops and frantically explaining the situation. Since this neighborhood is pretty far from the station, they contacted the private security to respond first and said they'd be there for backup as soon as possible. Fast forward about 20 minutes and I'm standing with a security guard out front of my grandma's house while three others patrol the area. Another 15 minutes and the cops show up just in time to see the other security guards come out from a neighbors side yard with my handcuffed and very confused grandma.

Now from my grandma's perspective. She knew I wasn't coming home tonight and had settled in for an early night. She woke up not to long after and went to get a glass of water, god knows why she didn't turn on the light. Anyways, she opens up her door to see a tall intruder stumbling in and shining a flashlight at the floor. Still groggy from just waking up, she gets the hell out of there without a second thought. She runs out her backdoor into the yard and lets herself out the back gate, onto the hiking trail that runs behind all the houses. She then runs down two houses to a neighbor that she knows well and lets herself in their back gate, running to their house and frantically banging on their back door. Of course the stars had to align just right for this to happen, and they did. The neighbors weren't home. I guess then my grandma heard some voice and got incredibly scared that the intruder was coming after her, so she hid in this neighbor's dog house (good thinking grandma).  Of course the security followed the trail of open gates and made it to the backyard, my grandma saw the security and ran out thinking she was saved. Unfortunately these guys aren't exactly the best and brightest so they detained my grandma and didn't listen a word she was saying. 

After a lot of explaining from both of us, the cops laughed profusely, the security guys apologized profusely and everyone was on their way. Luckily, grammy is doing well, she wasn't hurt at all and thinks the whole mess is quite funny, but I still feel awful. This literally just happened and I'm still wound up so I hope I didn't leave out any essential details.  I guess at least the family will have something fun to laugh about at Easter brunch.


TL;DR Grandma and I both thought the other was an intruder, I called the police and she got detained."

My Ass Injury Story.
At the end of this story, I hope to all my fellow ballers out there, watch out for the pole...
Why you may ask? Well a while back, I was playing basketball at a local court. As this guy went for a classic right hand layup, I naturally went to attempt a block. As if in slow motion, we collided in the air and with me being a mere 160cm (5 feet 2 inches), I flew backwards and what awaited me at the landing was the most bizarre and worse injury I have ever experienced.
Though before we get into that. Let's first describe the setting of this basketball court. There are these metal poles which supports the basketball hoops, just as most basketball hoops are like, but what makes me question the design of this pole was this protruding metal piece that was about knee high. This is a picture. http://imgur.com/a/LckAQ

At this point you would've guessed that that was the fatal cause of what I am about to receive. I landed right on it... Ass first on this protruding metal branch and from the cushioning of my fat I bounced right off.

On the floor, I experiencing a split seconds of sharp pain, but without thinking twice I got back up and continued to play. Bare in mind at this point, I had no idea how sever my injury was and as the game continued, I felt some slight pain through my left thigh area, though believing it was from leg day a day before at the gym. If anyone watches jknews/party/films, I was thinking of what Bart said when he fractured his ankle and said to myself stop being a little bitch, it’s just a bruise.

As adrenalin keep me going for another 20 mins the game eventually came to an end. As I cooled down I subconsciously felt my ass, then and there I saw some blood printed on my hand. Of all days I decided not to drive, today was the day. I walked myself home, thinking I must have gotten a minor cut, but I did not find my pants ripped. Little did I know what awaits for me when I get my hands on a mirror.

When I finially reached home, I went straight to the bathroom to shower. As I was removing my clothing, I noticed something that looked like egg pudding where the injury should have been along with the blood staining my pants. Turning to the mirror for a better look, I realised it was the fat from my ass cheek. Yes, the pole had penetrated my ass cheek! Even a big cut was an understatement for what I was looking at. I had a giant, bleeding, fat missing hole on my ass.
My parents then took me to doctors to receive 7 stitches. I must add in that this injury couldn’t have come at a worser time either, as I had exams a week later. Imagine trying to study for the rest of the week while you can't even sit properly.

My luck when it comes to injury is about as good as davidso, if you know him, he's a youtuber XD

For those whose curiosity got the better of them, gory images, you have been warned. WARNING GORY. NSFW.

This was my girlfriend’s reaction to my ass injury. http://imgur.com/a/n1snt

Also it would be awesome if this made it to JKnews :D

TLDR fell ass first on a metal piece sticking out of a metal pole playing basketball and got badly injured.
