"[Update] My sister [23f] thinks that marrying her bf [27m] and having kids with him will make their relationship ""spark up"" again. How do I [14f] tell her this is a bad idea?


Hey again.

Link to the op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5d299h/my_sister_23f_thinks_that_marrying_her_bf_27m_and/

Just wanted to say that my sister and her boyfriend decided to break up. And also that she's not getting pregnant and marrying him anymore. As some people advised me, I called my brother and asked him to help me. He came over on Thursday and had a serious talk with her. 

He told her to think about the future. Don't think about right now. Think about your life in 10, 20, 30 years. Kids won't fix a broken relationship and heartbreak isn't the worst thing in the world, she doesn't own anything to that guy, but years down the line if she decides to marry him, she'll have to deal with her awful relationship and take care of other human beings with him.

At first she couldn't accept it but after thinking about it, she decided that they should break up. Her boyfriend didn't seem upset at all and even though she's sad now, she'll get better and keep focusing on her education, which is important.

Now I have to deal with my crazy family. My oldest brother from Europe is coming over on Thanksgiving... wish me luck. Haha

But thank you so much for helping me! People here are awesome (sometimes). :)

tl;dr: My sister broke up with her boyfriend and decided to keep going to college"
"I [59 M] recently lost my son [26] and don't know how to deal with potential speakers at the funeral (Update)


**Update** I'd like to thank everyone for all of the kind words and incredible advice that they have sent through both threads. I have not been able to respond to everyone, but please be assured that I have read every one of your comments, and I appreciate them all. Everyone is doing well on our end, and while the pain is still immense, sharing memories ad photos with his friends has helped a lot. I'm so proud of him and everything he did in his short time with us.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cuvee/i_59_m_recently_lost_my_son_26_and_dont_know_how/

 
I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my first thread. Your words were so kind and helped me out with a difficult situation. I'd also like to offer an apology, as I feel I misstated some things in my original post. My difficulty was not from finding out what kind of person my son was just before his death. Additionally, I got lots of posts giving advice to the likes of ""I would let them speak,"" which baffled me slightly, as I hadn't thought that that's what I was asking. I had never considered keeping them out of the funeral and letting them speak their words, however when I re-read my original post, I can see how I didn't make it clear that I was already working with them on delivering their speeches. For this lack of clarity, I sincerely apologize. However, I read all of the comments in full, and I greatly appreciate everyone's input.

To update, the funeral took place yesterday was was, perhaps fittingly, a weirdly wonderful affair. My wife his, younger sister and I spoke, as did 4 of his friends. We decided to hold the funeral in his adopted city rather than here for 2 reasons: First was because we all know he loved that city so much, and Second was to make it easier for his friends to attend. (I should state, pretty much everyone in our hometown was in a position to travel, but his friends aren't, as they are students and it's midterm season for them.) Although people had reached out to me, I was stunned by turnout. I didn't get a proper headcount, but the room that I though was relatively large was down to standing room only.


The family's speeches and 3 of his friends were relatively normal for a funeral, and recounted fond memories of his life and personality. The 4th friend to speak was not.

Quite simply, he wanted to roast my son, namely in the style of a comedy central roast. When he pitched the idea to me, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give him his moment. Part of it was one of the few aspects of my son that remained constant throughout his life: he hated tradition for tradition's sake. He was always someone who would question (sometimes at unfortunately inappropriate times) why everything is the way it is. Think along the lines of ""Why is the bride supposed to wear white?"" while acutaly at a wedding. A second part of my decision to allow it was because a common theme I found out through his friends was that he was quite a joker himself towards the end, and would do anything for a laugh, going as far as making himself the butt of the joke just to get a positive reaction from them. Finally, I agreed because he was completely upfront with me about what he wanted to say (he handed me his script) and said that if I was uncomfortable with it or the idea, that he would still be honoured if he could give a more traditional speech. 

This led me to the one difficult in the funeral, namely, where do I put this joker? Do I do it at the beginning to set a tone, or at the end to leave on a high? I discussed with my wife and his friend, and we agreed on a compromise, where he would give a short talk at the beginning to set the mood that wouldn't be all sad, and then he delivered his main set at the end, so we could all leave without tears in our eyes.

So, as weird as it might sound, I think we all had fun at the funeral, and I was incredibly touched to have met so many of his friends. While I still sort of feel that I' mourning 2 people, I was so proud that my son broke out of his shell when he left. I know his friends are wonderful people, and I can only imagine how happy my son was up to the end.

  **tl;dr**: The funeral went well, and I was touched by the support his friends showed."
"[UPDATE] to post from 2+ months ago: ""Me [34f] with my husband [40m] married 11 years w/ 2 kids: I told him I want to leave, but then he surprised me.""


[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50tf15/me_34f_with_my_husband_40m_married_11_years_w_2/)

It's been about 10 weeks since my post. Here's what happened. 

The evening after I made that post, I told my husband there is no way we will be able to work everything out on our own, and we need to go to counseling. He reluctantly agreed. 

We started couples counseling the very next week. It's realy quite strange how counseling has progressed. 

1. My husband made one change - stopping with the yelling - immediately and totally. He hasn't yelled at me over little things for weeks now. 

2. BUT I have progressively gotten more and more angry with, disappointed in, and disconnected from him because of everything he's said and done during these weeks in counseling.... which also caused me to sort of wake up to all that he has done in the past. I have an appointment with a lawyer next week. We are done. 

\#2 takes a bit of explanation, so here goes. 

I am quite stunned by how little effort this guy is willing to put into the relationship in spite of so desperately wanting to hold on to it. So he made one change - the end of all yelling. I was really, really relieved and grateful and impressed.... until he started complaining (about 4 days in!) that he was putting in all the effort and seeing ""negative returns"". This has remained his stance for all these 10-11 weeks. 

I am flabbergasted. Our couples counselor has straight up said to him: ""I am supposed to be neutral here but on this I am comfortable saying you are WRONG, she is making a huge effort at this relationship and you need to know that."" But in private my husband dismisses everything I'm doing as ""intangible"" or ""selfish"" and therefore not real. And he complains nonstop that I'm not my ""usual self"" i.e. the doormat who danced around managing his feelings and walking on eggshells all the time. ""This is not the person I fell in love with,"" he keeps saying. ""Why should I bother making all this effort?"" 


For my part, yes, I am not the person he fell in love with. The couples counselor told me to stop trying to manage his feelings for him and try to be myself - and I took that very seriously. I no longer try to read his mood all the time and tiptoe around him. I no longer try to intuit when he is angry or hurt and ask him what's wrong and try to cajole him into working things out. I leave it to him to bring it up with me if something is bothering him. If he's in a bad mood and sulking, I just leave him alone and go on with my own thing until he wants to talk. If he is stonewalling me, which he has started doing for a few days after every single counseling session, I no longer let it affect my mood. This seems to be making him feel completely unloved and abandoned - which I only know because he has broken down and cried and yelled at me after the stonewall. ""You don't care about me anymore."" And I've been saying, ""If something is bothering you, you need to tell me. I won't read your mind. And I won't cave to your freezeouts."" Cue his standard line, ""What effort are you making in this relationship? Why am I the only one who's doing anything here? Why should I continue to do this work when you are being so selfish?"" 

The stoppage of yelling was homework from the very first session. He did that. But subsequent sessions' homework has been things like, ""Go on a date this week"" and ""Make one show of affection as soon as you're home from work"" and ""Make time for conversation before bedtime"" etc. -- all of which have been spectacular failures. On our ""date"" he refused to so much as hold my hand and spent all his time wandering off on his own (we were at a museum) - and when I brought it up later he got massively pissed saying ""WE WENT ON A DATE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT"".  The  show of affection - well, he used to do it if he came home later than me, but if I come home from work later than him, he is always distracted and does not reciprocate my hug *even after I point it out*, and now since he started stonewalling me for days after each counseling session, I haven't even tried to do this homework because fuck it, who wants to hug a stonewaller (same goes for conversation before bedtime). 

This shit has really woken me up, y'all. I don't know what sort of fantasy I had constructed out of whole cloth that made me love this guy. He really doesn't want to lift a finger. He seems to lose it completely at the thought of my leaving - cries, seems desperate - but it translates into ZERO action. He really doesn't care about me at all. 

Anyway - I said as much to him early this week and told him I am leaving. Next week I have an appointment with an attorney to see what my options are. This shit is really happening. I am leaving. I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried but I have never been more sure of anything.

  **tl;dr**: 10 weeks of actually talking about our relationship for the first time in 11 years - that's all it took to wake me up to the reality that I married a ridiculously selfish man. Fuck. :(

"I [29F] took in my intellectually disabled sister [23F]. Parents accuse me of ""stealing their daughter"".


My sister was born with a severe intellectual disability. This caused a big strain on our family while I was growing up. At some point my parents gave up on her and decided that she just can't be helped anymore, despite the fact that doctors thought otherwise. After she turned 18 my parents tried to petition the courts to continue be her guardian but they weren't successful.

When she turned 19 I took her in with me and put her back under professional mental health care. She lived with me but spent a lot of time working with doctors, psychologists and various types of therapists to develop further. She wasn't growing to gain complete independence but that didn't mean she had no room for improvement. They helped her a lot. Last year she was able to get a simple part time job and she's held onto it until now, something our parents always believed is impossible. These past four years she's improved so much that she's a totally new person. She's still intellectually disabled and can't live independently but she's miles better than when she was with our parents, and miles happier.

This year I was able to obtain guardianship over her as that helps a lot with my involvement in her healthcare and finances. Before this, my parents always told me that I'm wasting my time with her. Now after they learned about the guardianship, they became incredibly upset and offended and they started to tell me how I stole my sister from them and I have no right to do what I'm doing and things like that. They've been trying to contact her to manipulate her I guess which I have so far blocked. This is all drama that my sister will not understand and does not need. But I suspect my parents aren't going to stop. They're some of the most stubborn people I've ever known.

So I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to deal with them without letting it affect my sister.

"My BF [26 M] got a text from his mom. It's her with a girl she met on vacation that she's trying to hook him up with. BF and I [25 F] have been together for 2 years. Help me /r/relationships, you're my only hope.


Throw away account. So my boyfriend's mom sent him a text with a picture of her hugging a young woman that she met on vacation. The message said how great this girl is, and how she likes things that my boyfriend likes. The girl apparently said she'd love to meet my boyfriend since he's so good looking. THIS GIRL LIVES 2,000 MILES AWAY. She also sent him a photo of the girls business card. 

She's trying to hook them up, when she knows we've been together for 2 years. Boyfriend just laughed the text off. 

But how do I sit at this woman's table next week for Thanksgiving, knowing that she's actively trying to break us up? She'll all love and hugs to my face. But seriously? 

Should I confront his mom and ask her why she's being so disrespectful to both my boyfriend and I?

Should I ask my boyfriend to tell his mom to knock it off? 

Or should I just file this away in my mind palace and never trust anything his mom says?


TL;DR Boyfriend's mom is trying to introduce him to other girls that live 2,000 miles away. "

He said he's been doing thanksgiving with them since he was a kid and that it would be weird if I came because it would mean our relationship is very serious. He said they might even ask him if we plan on getting married or having kid or something weird like that.

I already know his grandma, dad, brother and step mom, and they are not like that at all. However, he says that many of his cousins are married really young and have children.

"Me [30 F] with my fiancé [29 M] of 12 years, waiting for a package from the girl he cheated on me with UPDATE


So: I know this is ancient history, but we got an update, and I have several private messages asking me for an update if I something happened. So yes, we got the package. Last week. And it did not disappoint.
LINK TO ORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3siwui/me_30_f_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_29_m_of_12_years_waiting/
TL;DR: my boyfriend Oli had an affair with a friend, whom we will call Sarah. It wounded the relationship deeply, but with time, we managed to heal. He cut contact with her, and some time afterwards we moved to another place, renovated our lives, decided to finally get married, etc. One day, a common friend of Oli and Sarah, Ben, told us that he had given us our new address because she wanted to send him ""a package"". My husband freaked out. He had depression and anxiety so that was a factor. (These were the events of my first post.)

After reading the advice here, I sat down with him, we decided we did not want the fucking thing, so he wrote a message to Ben saying ""tell Sarah we do not want anything from her"", and them he blocked him. This all happened last year.

Meanwhile, life went on. He changed jobs (he is still in academy) and now he is way more happy and relaxed. My job is well paid and interesting, and I can keep some other projects on the side. We got married this summer, and our wedding was perfect for us: lively, bombastic, lots of food and alcohol, and our friends and family together. It was expensive but we did not give a damn.

This month, my husband is in a conference trip in another continent, so I am home alone. When I arrived home in the evening, there was a package adressed to him in the mailbox, with a stamp from a place where I know she lived, and a sender we don't know. I thought for a moment ""oh my, this may be her"", but then I thought that it would be pretty crazy of her to send it now.

That night, I was skyping with my husband, and made a comment about the parcel. I mentioned the name of the sender, and he did not know the name. So I proposed that I opened it with him on camera.

Aaaaand well, turns out I was right on the money. It contained several postcards, wishing him happy birthdays and merry christmasses, all unsigned. Also little notes such as ""dance in the rain"", ""look at the clouds"", ""walk barefoot"", that kind of platitudes. And it had a book, a young adult romance book. I remember saying aloud ""oh, for fucks sake"" when I saw it. Meanwhile, my husband had a face like he had seen a cockroad in his sandwich.

(The title of the novel is Stargirl. It is about a girl who arrives to a high school and she is very quirky and magical and she dances in the rain and plays the ukelele and she is Very Misunderstood by the normies. The narrator dates her, but realizes that he cannot be with her because deep down is afraid of not fitting in, so he dumps her and then regrets it forever. It is not a super bad book, I liked the prose, but, despite the intentions of the author, the heroine is too much of a Special Snowflake, and her behavior often delves into creepy territory.)

The book itself had a sad face in the dedication page and a small note saying ""read the sequel. you will understand"". It was crammed with notes in small script, and sometimes the letters had been traced several times over. All of the notes were very idealized descriptions of the heroin, about how magical and beautiful she was, about the things she did, etc. Some of the notes were also about the main character agonizing about staying with her or leaving her to ""fit in"", or descriptions about how they made out (yuck). There were also drawings of the heroine, who looked like an idealized version of Sarah.

I am not gonna lie, I laughed my ass off at this fucking Manic Pixie Dream Wannabe. My husband was less amused and more creeped out. He said that she was psycho and that he did not want that shit at home.

I kinda forgot about the book for the following days, because last week was my Week from Hell and I had to work 70 hours (I normally work thirty), because, apart from my job, I took a two-week project working in-house for a company, and I organized an art exhibition in the weekend. Also, I got pretty bad health news from a close friend (think ""incurable"" and ""degenerative""), so the topic of Sarah was out of my mind.

Yesterday I finally had time to think about it, and I got angry at that asshole (they have not met in three years! who the fuck does this dweeb think she is? Etc etc). I considered unblocking her briefly to tell her to stay the fuck away from us, but discarded the idea. Then I considered finding out her address and sending her a copy of Holes, by Louis Sachar, and 20 minimalist Pepes printed between the pages, with a note ""This is a riddle. If you solve it, I will leave my wife for you. Love, Fiancé"". Then I realized I would rather ignore her, so I threw the notes in the recycling bin and I put the book in a Freebox so somebody can take it home.

That is all. No threats, no pictures, no positive pregnancy tests. It was anticlimactic but honestly it was a welcome distraction in a heavy week. I don't like that she has our current address, but I do not think she will be sending more stuff. If she does, we will tell her to piss up a rope. The funny thing is that I don't hate her, she is an asshole but this is just too sad to hate. To mock ok, but not to hate.


TL:DR: got the package more than a year after, when Fiancé was not at home. I opened it with him on camera. It was pretty weird shit but ultimately harmless. Ignored and moved on. Thank you guys for the advice you gave in the previous post!

"My mother (58F) made very cruel comments about my brother's (28M) pregnant girlfriend (22F) and I (20F) am beyond mortified.


My brother's girlfriend (I'll call her Sara here) is 6 months pregnant right now. To make things short, my mother and brother have never had a good relationship to begin with and this pregnancy has made it 100% worse. That being said, I am also not very close with my mom and have lived out of the house since I was 17 (you will see why.)

She (my mother) has a lot of family money and my brother's girlfriend comes from a very average, blue collar background. This was strike one against her (from mom's perspective.) Strike two was that she is pregnant and refuses to get married. 

Sara and my brother do not have a stable relationship right now. They have fought badly in the past, and were on the verge of a breakup when they found out she was pregnant. Sara says she wants to have the baby first, establish a better foundation for them by herself (aka work and earn money) before just shotgunning it. My brother insisted he made enough money for both of them but Sara has been really stubborn about making her own money first (I believe she has a goal, but I don't know what the amount is) and he has respected that decision. But in general, they still don't get along very well and I don't see that marriage is something that will happen any time soon.

Our mother thinks that Sara is being uppity and her pride is too strong and will ultimately affect the baby's health. Meaning, she thinks Sara should stop trying to work for no reason and just take the money my mother has offered her and rest easy before she gives birth, and get married and rely on my brother's income when the baby does come.

The other day my brother and Sara and I were having dinner together at my apartment when our mother dropped by to bring me some things. Chaos ensued. 

Long story short, my brother and mother were inside yelling at each other about this whole ""when is she going to give up her ridiculous ideas"" and marriage thing, I suggested Sara and I go outside so we stood outside on the balcony. It sounded somewhat muffled except when they moved closer to the living room and at one point, my mother called her ""That white trash charity case"" and something very nasty about ""trailer parks"" really loudly. 
I shit you not. It's been burned into my brain. 

(She did at one time live in a trailer home when she was in high school and my mother knows this.)

Sara started crying very quietly and I just froze. I didn't even know how to comfort her. I just said, ""Sara, my mother is insane. I am so sorry"" and also started crying. My brother opened the door and took her away and they went home, and my mother vented by herself for a while and was like, why are YOU crying and also left a little bit later.

I don't know what I should say to her. I feel like I have a moral obligation to apologize to her, make this right somehow, try to tell her that I'm so sorry for my mother's behavior. It doesn't reflect upon my thoughts or my brother's about her, this is not how I feel, those aren't words I ever use, and I'm just so so sorry to have her go through that. I don't want her to turn away from me, but I also feel like I don't have a say in the matter. 

Sara and I have a good relationship (in my opinion). We are closer in age than she is with my brother and I always felt like we related in a lot of ways. (She also doesn't have a good relationship with her mom, btw.) I know my brother has apologized to her and is probably comforting her already but is it okay for me to reach out 
to her? If so, how should I talk to her? Am I overstepping?


***

TLDR- Mother called my brother's pregnant girlfriend white trash- I'm mortified. How do I salvage this? Should I reach out to her? What should I say to comfort her?"
"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my best friend [29F] and her boyfriend [27M]: She thinks she's getting engaged, but I doubt it. I'm supposed to help her boyfriend plan a proposal. Should I reach out to him?


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cxk2c/me_25f_with_my_best_friend_29f_and_her_boyfriend/

*TLDR of my original- My friend thinks a proposal is imminent. She also thought that last year, but it turned out that no and they had a huge fight. Should I tell her boyfriend she's expecting a proposal again this year?*

**Update:** I'm really appreciative of all the feedback I received. A lot of people told me to butt out, some people told me to contact my best friend's boyfriend. That's the road I chose. 

And it turns out he actually IS proposing to her!!!!!! I'm so relieved. He said he was just about to contact me. He said he's planning on proposing in less than a month's time, although he doesn't have the ring or a plan. But he has gotten the contact info of the aunt to try and get the ring, so that's a good step, and he asked my ideas for a holiday proposal. Although he said he might put of a holiday proposal since he has a conference he has to go to over the holidays. BUT he said yes, he's actually going to do it. 

Like I said, I'm very relieved. I know for a long time my friend has really wanted their relationship to progress to marriage (she told me maybe a month back that if he didn't propose soon she was just going to book her dream location and give him an ultimatum). Do I think they should get married? No. Do I think there's a chance they still might not get married? Yes. But that is truly not my business, this is my friend's decision to make, and I'm just going to be happy for her as long as she's happy. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Best friend's boyfriend IS proposing, and I'm glad I emailed him. Cheers to my friend, I'm there for the boyfriend to help with the proposal, but from this point forward I'm minding my own beeswax about their relationship. "

"[UPDATE] My (25F) boyfriend (28M) of 3 years wants me to plan, organize and book everything... Forever


[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vs1q3/my_25f_boyfriend_28m_of_3_years_wants_me_to_plan/)

Hi guys, well I got so much support and encouragement on my original post I really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me. It took a few months and a lot of tearful pleas on my part (not proud of that) and frustration on his, but I am moving back across the country by myself. 


I wanted to give it one last go, to tell him that I needed him to put more effort into the ""emotional labor"" in our relationship instead of me just doing everything and him showing up. He definitively told me that he did not have the energy or inclination to do that because he is working too much; that it wasn't forever but if I wasn't happy I was free to leave. I tried to stick it out but his work hours got longer and longer, he signed up for a sport on the one weekend day he didn't work, and I was just getting more lonely, resentful and miserable by the day. 


I finally just snapped, and agreed that I needed to go. He was pretty shocked to say the least, I believe his words were ""*wow, I didn't think you'd ever actually leave me*"", but he was supportive overall. He wants me to be happy, and I know he loves me very much, perhaps just not as much as he loves himself and his career. He is being friendly while I have to stay over here for a few weeks, and helping me move back across the country at the start of next month. 


I'm sad that I'm losing my best friend, partner and the future we had started to build, but I know it's the right decision. I'm scared to move back by myself, I feel like a bit of a failure, but I'm glad it ended now while I'm still relatively young. Plus, I'll only have to plan, book and organise things for myself from now on :)



To one user who said

I think I will :) looking at foster dogs as soon as I find a new place.

"My [24F] with my grandparents[81 M/F] told me they refuse to come to my wedding. [UPDATE]


Hey everyone, I got some great advice when I posted about my problems here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4usfhz/my_24f_grandparents_81_mf_told_me_they_refuse_to/

I just wanted to update everyone since I had a few people asking about it and I got such great advice. I decided to sit down and talk to them once more with my fiance present, and it went awful. There was screaming and crying on both sides and everyone said some awful things. We left in tears and I didn't look back and went ahead with the wedding planning.

 School started and I started a new job and I threw myself into everything I could to live with the hurt that happened. We slowly started talking again and things were looking up and they begun to slowly ask general questions about the wedding but when I showed them my dress they lost it and decided they wanted to be there to see me. 

Then, I lost my health insurance. My fiance and I sat down and decided to elope before our wedding for the insurance, and I told my grandparents that since his parents would be there that they were welcome. At first they refused, but then my grandmother said she wasn't sure she would live until the wedding and wanted to be there. My grandfather wouldn't budge and said no way in hell. I accepted where both were coming from and we went about planning an elopement in two weeks (which I would not recommend to anyone). The venue we picked out fell through and we had two days to find somewhere to get married, so we asked my grandparents if we could use their house. Their only caveat was that my father had to be present, but my stepdad was allowed there. 

The ceremony and following after-party was okay-my dad was an ass but my awesome HUSBAND (I like saying that now) told him that he was an awful person and to not start shit and he sulked like a child and watched football the entire time. My grandparents will be attending the wedding we had planned (and already paid for) in a few months and the relationship is relatively mended. 

I know a few people will probably think I am weak for still inviting them but they are so old I just want the end of their lives to be happy and filled with great memories of everyone, including my father and his new children. I'm adult enough to know that I will never have a relationship with my father once they pass away, but until them I'm okay being treated semi-poorly by my family. Thanks to everyone for the advice and solidarity that was given to me because it really helped me get through a difficult time in my life!

"My [20 F] boyfriend [24 M] invited some other girl instead to his family home for thanksgiving


My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for only about 5 months. Brian is really kind, cute, and we have a lot of common interests! I meet him on campus and we dated and instantly connected. I was definitely smitten. Then I learned that I had been accepted into Medical School in another city. We both committed to trying out a long distance relationship. I am currently living a few hours away from where he is working on completing his undergrad studies in arts.

Medical school have been really a shit ton of work. Please excuse my language. I hadn't quite expected the challenge since I always managed to cruise through undergrad with plenty of free time for all the extracurriculars I wanted. Brian and I have talked a few times on the phone and Skyped, but probably not nearly as much as we should have. My classmates in LDRs are also in the boat.

Brian and I had a call a weekend before thanksgiving. His family home is half way between my med school city and his undergrad campus. We talked about a lot of fun things that were happening and he asked about my thanksgiving plans. I told him that I was going to spend thanksgiving by myself in my new city because train tickets back to my family home was too expensive at this time. It was only practical. I asked what he had planned for thanksgiving. So it turned out the reason he's been sounding distracted (and the reason that he may have initiated the call in the first place that night) was because he told me he invited a good uni friend of his (lets call her Rowan) over to his home for thanksgiving. Immediately I was all like ? because I know Brian lived in a small town, and his thanksgiving celebrations with his family was a pretty small and private affair. In fact that was the reason why I didn't even expect to be invited (in addition to the fact that we haven't been dating long). Brain told me Rowan had just returned from an exchange trip overseas and was looking for a place to stay over thanksgiving weekend, so he offered to look after her.

The thing is, Rowan and I are not strangers. We were on the rugby team together two years ago. If Rowan was looking for a place to stay she could have stayed with her parents or siblings or any of the girls on the team because everyone was tight. I found it really weird how quickly Brian offered a spot for her in his family home, especially since his parents don't know her. But I honestly appreciate him being open with me that he invited her. 

But I still felt a little strange. I have a lot of questions. I wish Brian texted or called me first before inviting a girl over. I wish I could have spent thanksgiving with Brian. It just feels so weird that the only guest his parents had in their home was a girl that Brian brought from university. But that girl wasn't his girl friend. I was in fact in another city spending thanksgiving by myself. 

 BTW we live in Canada so this has all already happened. I didn't know what to say so I just told Brian I thought it was kind of him to help her out like that. I am posting now because because I am hoping someone can help sort out if I over or under reacted to the situation and if there is anything I can do to make it right.

He was telling people that his gf has bipolar and he loves her so he doesnt want to leave but he wants to know how to cope with it. The things he describes confirms that he was talking about me. He made this post more then a year ago by the looks of it


Heres the thing though, Im not bipolar. My mother has terminal cancer so while I can get depressed at times or just sad, I dont have the large mood swings he describes. Ive never been diagnosed or even suggested by doctors that I may have it. I dont have extreme emotions (no suicidal or impulsive hyperactive behavior) I dont have extreme mood swings either - he however describes it that way.  He thinks its odd that Im sometimes happy and sometimes sad- but isnt that just human emotions ? You cant be happy or sad 24-7, our emotions fluctuate!

"Me [26 M] with girl I wanted to date [25F] but she ended up sleeping with my best friend [26m] now upset with me because I don't want to date her


Wall of text incoming.  You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long.

This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is.

Back story is this.  A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years.  

A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day).  She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes.  She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly.  No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it.

We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table.  This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot.  Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip.  But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime.

We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting.  Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there.  Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good.

Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile.  Again I think things are going great.

I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this.

Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there.  Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime.

Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything.  She turns me down flat.  She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way.

Ouch.

I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again.  Hey you swing you miss, it happens.  I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life.

A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about.  But she was there for the second one.

This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"".  

Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life.  Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on.  I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this.

Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago.  Derrick as I knew he would dumped her.  It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone.

Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table.  It was very obvious that she traded off.  However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up.  I reply to her as I would any other time  and then I return to the game.

Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday.  I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"".

That was it or so I thought.  Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day.  Sometimes I don't even reply to her.  Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else.

Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me.

So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"".  At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"".

She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left.

It's over right?  Wrong.

The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing.

Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them.  She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple.  How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"".  

I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end.

I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it.  That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way.  

She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire.  

I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have.

This did not go over well so I blocked her phone.

Now WTF do I do about this sunday?  As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place.

So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location?

It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her.

tl;dr:  Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down.  No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month.  She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends.  This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

"Me [15f] with my adopted family [14-? M/F] of a week, i don't feel like i belong


Hi everyone! i hope this is the right place to post and that i end up getting a couple o replies...
... I am 15 years old and was just adopted. i've been living with the family for like a week now.everything is just so awkward. i don't feel like i fit in anywhere or into the family. its not that alicia or matt (my new parents) are mean or uncaring. they have been super nice and helpful and are pretty awesome but i don't know. i feel like i don't deserve being here. i feel like i don't deserve the early gifts we got for christmas but my adopted brothers and sisters do. does that make sense? i hate using things are causing too much trouble. like i don't want to do anything wrong or like be using the TV when someone else might want to or something like that. this all seems really dumb writing out but i don't know how else to explain it. i just feel like it can't be possible for me to ever actually become as equal to their biological children or that the other kids will see me as an actual sibling. i don't know what to do or how to bring this up with my new parents. they said i can talk to them about anything i feel like but i'm scared because i don't want them to think that they are not doing a good job or that i don't want to be here. i am super grateful for them , more than i can ever tell them.

edit: wow so many replies! everyone is so caring in their comments and i really appreciate you all taking the time to reply:) . it seems that i should talk  to my parents about this and that they would want to hear about how i'm feeling. i think i'll ask them if we can sit and talk tonight after dinner or something. in the mean time i tried to be more open and friendly with my siblings. i asked my older brother if he wanted to watch this movie on netflix with me. we had fun and made popcorn . we ended up not really watching the movie much and just talking/getting to know each other. my  older sister got home mid way through the movie and joined us on the couch and it was actually fun. we laughed a lot and they both are very nice and cool!i guess a lot of these feelings i have are inside my head and not really as big of problem . i think i'm just super nervous of doing something wrong but i think i'll be okay. i think my talk with my parents will go well too-i'm already feeling much better especially reading all these comments. it was especially nice to read the stories of people who have or have been adopted. its nice to see i'm not as alone as i thought:)

"My sister [23f] thinks that marrying her bf [27m] and having kids with him will make their relationship ""spark up"" again. How do I [14f] tell her this is a bad idea?


Hello Reddit.

My sister has been dating her bf for about 3 years I think. Recently they have been dealing with some relationship issues, I don't know a lot about it but they're having some problems. Basically my sister has been telling everyone that she's going to marry him and have babies and that things are going to be fine again.

This is such a bad idea I can't even. I mean, maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe he can put some sense into her by having a serious conversation, but this is absolutely crazy. Marriage won't make their relationship better. Even if you love someone and decide to marry them, if something happens and you have to divorce, divorce is just such a pain in the ass. Now having kids is a completely different thing. You DO NOT put human beings in this planet just to get your partner to love you again. That's bullshit, careless and inconsiderate. It's fucking stupid and I think it will create a lot of resentment. They'll both have to deal with a human being for 18 years. How do I approach this situation? Her partner knows about it btw and he seems very unhappy with the situation, but I honestly think the relationship is so doomed that he doesn't even care anymore. Help.

TL;DR: my sister is crazy and wants to procreate with her bf so their relationship can ""spark up"". I don't agree with that"

"My (28/F) sister's (35/F) husband (35/M) made inappropriate remarks about me when he was drunk. She doesn't think it's a big deal.


We were on a trip together. My sister, BIL, my boyfriend, some friends of ours and myself. It was for a week. On the second last night I couldn't sleep, so I got out of bed to make myself some chamomile tea, and I ran into my BIL in the hallway. Being that I had just gotten out of bed, I was in my pyjamas, no bra. It was chilly. I'm sure you can connect the dots here. I smiled hello and walked past, thinking nothing of it. 


The next night, we all had some drinks and shared stories. BIL went a little overboard and ended up saying some questionable things about me. He started by saying how much I've ""grown"" since he first met me (when I was underage and in high school) and then he just started talking about my body, shamelessly. Our friends went quiet and just stared between the four of us as if waiting for someone to blow up. I was in shock. My sister was trying to play it off as nothing, but she was still telling her SO to take it easy and desperately trying to shift the conversation elsewhere. BIL wasn't as drunk as he was acting (maybe two beers and a shot max) and we had been drinking for hours at that point. I strong suspected that he was sober and just talking shit for the sake of it. My boyfriend was getting very tense and I could see him clenching his fists. He's not really the fighting type, but I could tell he was a second away from losing his cool completely. 


BIL went on to say something about how he saw my nipples poking out through my shirt the other night in the hallway, and that's when my boyfriend lost it. He got up and demanded that BIL leave. Our other friends demanded the same. My sister was white in the face and totally speechless. BIL left, sobered up and tried to talk to me normally the next morning, but I wasn't in the mood to talk to him or even look at his face. On top of that, he kept staring at my boobs. I dress casually and comfortably, so there was nothing for him to look at really, but he did anyway. I feel gross just thinking about it. 


I've since talked to my sister about this and how I don't want to go anywhere near BIL until he gets his shit together. She thinks I'm overreacting and complicating the situation. Our friends are on my side, and so is my boyfriend. BIL didn't just make me feel uncomfortable, he made everyone feel that way including my sister but she's too deep into the relationship to see him for what he is. 


What should I do? She's my sister and I want to help her. She deserves better than to spend her life with a guy who sexualizes her younger sister and then blames it on the alcohol. This isn't the first time he's acted like this either. He ALWAYS stares. Even when I was a teenager. Even at our mother. They don't have kids but they're trying. 


I don't want to see her throw her life away. Ultimately it's her decision, but I'm sure I can help in some way. 


TL;DR - BIL made inappropriate comments about my body. My sister doesn't want to admit that it was a big deal. She's at the age where she thinks she's running out of time, but I *know* she can find someone better than him. He's always been a creep. They don't have kids but they're trying. I really don't want to see her throw her life away just so she can have kids before 40 with this tool. "
"My [31F] husbands [30M] old college fling [32F] moved into our neighbourhood recently.


I really need some outside opinions and thoughts right now. I feel like I'm not crazy, but there could be a chance I am in this situation.

My husband and I have been together for 6 years in total, but we have been married for over 2 years now. We have a very happy, yet simple life that I really appreciate living with him. Both of us have our day jobs, our hobbies, our friends, and we always enjoy traveling to a new place (once or twice) every year. We have talked about children in the past, but at this point, I'm not sure if we are actually going to go through with having kids. Either way, I'm happy, so I have no expectations on that front.

At the end of September, someone new moved in a couple houses down on our block. Funny enough, it was my husbands old college ""fling/FWB"" that he was with before we started dating exclusively. I know a lot about this woman from the early days of us dating, but I couldn't believe that she actually was moving into our neighbourhood. It was pretty clear that someone was moving in at the time, so me and my husband went over to introduce ourselves, which is how we found out. 

I have always felt a little insecure knowing that she lives only a couple houses down. Why? Well, not only did they have a ""thing"" for almost two years. But, my husband said at the time that he had feelings for her and he wanted a relationship. As time went on, he got disinterested in just hooking up with her, and that is when him and I ended meeting. So, for me, it worked out well! Not so much for her, and I could definitely tell that it bothered her the few meetings I had with her.

This past weekend, our neighbours next door had us and few other people over for drinks and appetizers. Funny enough, they actually invited over ""Judy"" (fake name for the story). The evening went well, but what bothered me the most was seeing Judy pretty much hang around my husband all night. She was always laughing a what he was saying, she was rubbing his back and touching him, and she even threw out some pretty exaggerated sexual jokes and comments about my husband. This bothered me all evening.. When my husband and I got home, I talked to him about what I saw, but he thought I was making a bigger deal out of a situation that had no leeway.

For some reason, there is something I just don't trust about this situation (Judy living on our street). Saturday night was a perfect example of my suspicions. I can totally tell that Judy wants to have a second chance with my husband, even though she had her chance for almost two years of hooking up with my husband in college. The touching, the flirting, and the sexual remarks from her just bothered me. To be frank, they *still* bother me..

How can I go about this situation? I really want to tell Judy completely off.. My interactions with her have been minuscule conversations, where when my husband has ran into her, she chats him up like there is no tomorrow. Is there something fishy going on between them? It doesn't seem like my husband is up to something? I just don't trust Judy.

"Me [42M] with my wife [36F], found out she is participating in clinical drug trials to make money for our sick son [3M]


I am still extremely shell-shocked about this all. We have been married for 10 years and she is a SAHM and I work as a chef. A year ago our son [3M] was diagnosed with a serious type of cancer and has been undergoing aggressive treatment since then.


His medication and treatment is extremely expensive. I work as a chef and regularly work 50-60 hour weeks, but that doesn't make enough to cover our living expenses and a fraction of his treatment. About 9 months ago, my wife said she had come into an inheritance of a few thousand dollars and we have been using that money towards our son's treatment. 


This morning, I was going through her planner to see what her plans were for next week, in order to plan a surprise date for us (to take her mind off the stress of our son's sickness). I noticed she had written down that she was going to a trial at X institute. I was curious and Googled it, and it turns out it's a clinical trial for Y drug. I did further research and found out my wife started the clinical trial the same time she came into her ""inheritance"". This drug is not on the market and they don't know any of the side effects, hence why they are testing it on willing participants, in exchange for a large sum of money.


I am now EXTREMELY worried that my wife is compromising her health to pay for our son's treatment costs and medications. Looking back, I have noticed that her health has deteriorated and she has been ill and lethargic. I attributed this to her chronic stress and worry about our son's health.


/r/Relationships, please help me. How do I approach this situation and discuss this with my wife? I absolutely do not want her to compromise her health for money but I am unsure how I can convey this to her since our son means the world to her.

"I [59 M] recently lost my son [26] and don't know how to deal with potential speakers at the funeral


I recently lost my son in an accident. my entire family and I are upset beyond belief and miss him dearly. We will of course hold a proper funeral service for him and I'm sure that more than a few tears will be shed.

With regards to speakers, I have found myself in a strange dilemma. He moved away in his early twenties to another city. Before he left, he was always something of a loner, with no real friends. Now, after his passing, I'm hearing from many friends of his in the city he moved to.

They all describe hm as being an incredibly open, outgoing, and incredibly sociable person. This is just not how anyone in the family has ever known him. He was a;ways incredibly quiet and meek among other people for as long as we've known him.
 
A coupe people have asked if they may say a few words during his funeral, and one person was so kind as to give a rough outline of the eulogy he intended to give. It was beautifully written, but in some ways, I can't help but feel that it's about a person I've never met. 

I don't want to disrespect the friends my son has immediately before his death, but I'm also having trouble identifying speakers for his funeral, because on top of his death, i'm only suddenly finding out about another side to his personality. 

I should mention, it's not possible that this is mistaken identity. Many of his friends have shared photos of him with me.
 
Now he funeral is approaching, and I don't know ow to handle the speakers. I love my son, and the people who have offered their condolences are wonderful, but finding out about a social life I ever knew about just breaks my heart. In a way, I don't think I can handle hearing about it right now. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My son had a much ore active social life just before he died than he did when he lived at home. Some of his friends have asked to deliver eulogies. I'm having trouble dealing with this second side of my son that I never knew about, and am worried tat the eulogies might hurt me more than I already do.

EDIT****
The reason I'm asking for help is that I fell a sort of double grief, for the quiet son I knew and the outgoing son I never knew. I want his friends to have a chance to speak. After what they've said, and as kind as they have been, I can't imagine leaving them out of the funeral."

"My [20 M] friend [20 F] lost her mom last week but she is not aware of her death.


So a very close family friend (lets call her Jess) of mine has lost her mother but due to her being away from home to focus on her studies at uni she has not found out about it. Her father also warned me not to tell her about it because she has an exam to prepare for and he didn't want her mothers death to affect her grades. One of Jess' friends sent her condolences about her mothers death because she assumed Jess had already found out. Jess then called home to find out if what her friend told her was true but her dad lied about it and she ended up believing him replying that she was on the verge of fainting.  
  
Today Jess has just finished her exams and it is also her birthday today, she hasn't spoken to her mom in weeks, she has not been eating regularly and she still thinks her mom is alive. To make matters worse her dad has postponed her return home to a later date than they had planned. When she arrives home her family plan to bury her mother the day after she comes home.  
  
I haven't lost my parents or anyone that i'm close with before but from what I have seen from Jess' little sister I know that going through this is going to be painful, emotional and very stressful for her. I feel like her dad is not handling the way to tell her about this in the best way and his relationship with her is already on a thin thread from what I have heard from Jess when talking to her.  
  
When Jess' mom died my family went to go and visit her family to support them and I feel like I didn't do a good job in doing that. When I arrived at their I could see that the family was grieving especially the younger sister but I had no idea what I could do to help, I'm not much of a talker so I couldn't think the right words to say and just watched my family comfort them. Jess who I have known practically all my life is coming home later this week and I know that the shock of losing her mom is going to hurt.  
  
She will hate her dad for not telling her about it when he had the chance to but then again it was for the sake of her passing her exams. My parents have told me that I need to take time out of university to support her through all of this which is what I want to do but I don't really know how I can do that since I too have exams and deadlines that I need to prepare for.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Very close friend has lost her mom. Her friend mistakenly told her that her mom had died so she called her dad to make sure but was lied to that her mom was still alive so that she could focus on her upcoming exam. She is coming home this week to find out she would be attending her funeral the following day. I want to support her but I don't know how I would be able to do that as I have exams to prepare for and deadlines to meet at my university."

"My [30m] wife [26f] of 2 years is inconsolable because the new lingerie she bought didn't fit.. could really use a woman's perspective on this one.


We've been together for 6 years, married for 2 of those. She's been really upset (like, locking herself in the bathroom to cry, refusing to talk to me, then coming out with red eyes pretending she's fine) since yesterday and I'm really at a loss here. I don't know what I can do or say to help her.

Basically, she went out and spent money on herself for the first time in months on some nice new lingerie. She bought the same size she always does without trying anything on, then got home and realized that it's all too small. I don't understand it and neither does she - I'm honestly convinced that the store changed their sizing sometime in the past year, because everything else she owns from that store in the same size fits perfectly. She hasn't gained weight, and she's a small person to begin with (only ~120lbs).

Since then, she's been practically inconsolable. She feels guilty for wasting ""my"" money (her job doesn't pay well) because the items she bought were expensive and can't be returned. She really hates her body and doesn't feel like she's normal, even though I personally think she's the sexiest woman alive. She's been struggling with symptoms that point toward MS (no diagnosis yet, we're still waiting for an MRI but all of the doctors have been preparing her for this diagnosis) and doesn't feel in control of her own body right now which I'm sure isn't helping matters. She was really excited to try the new stuff on but wouldn't even let me see her in it. Now she's been crying off and on all day, but she refuses to talk to me about it. She feels embarrassed and every time I try to talk to her I feel like I'm just making it worse.

I feel responsible for this because I've been encouraging her to be more active and work out with me. She's been very inactive for the last year and I'm concerned about her health. She virtually never exercises at all and spends ~8hrs a day sitting in front of a computer for work. It's not that she's gained weight or anything. I just know she'd feel healthier if she were more active.

I'm really at a loss here. I feel like she's having a meltdown over something relatively minor (she could just go buy the same stuff in the next size up if she wanted, we can afford it no problem.. and I personally think it's a problem with the store's sizing, not with her) and I just don't know how to help. It's obviously not just about the clothes, but I feel like it set off a chain reaction and she's really spiraling now. How can I be supportive and help her feel better?
  ---   
  **TL;DR - Wife has been crying since yesterday when she bought lingerie that didn't fit, but refuses to talk to me about it. I don't understand it because it feels so minor to me, but it's really affecting her. Can someone help me see things from her perspective so I can help her?**"

"Me [25F] with my best friend [29F] and her boyfriend [27M]: She thinks she's getting engaged, but I doubt it. I'm supposed to help her boyfriend plan a proposal. Should I reach out to him?


So I've been best friends with Callie for 7 years, and she's been with Mike for almost 5 years. She desperately wants them to get married, but I don't think it's anywhere on his radar. Due to some comedy of errors circumstances she thinks they're going to get engaged. This happened once before and it was a nightmare... should I reach out to her boyfriend to let him know what's up? 

So they've been dating for almost 5 years. She's wanted to get married since very early on in their relationship, but he's always told her that he would consider it after he finished his PhD (which I think he has 3+ years left on, I'm not sure). They live together and she moved to be with him, and had to take a minimum wage job that she does NOT enjoy. But I've never said anything because the most important thing for her is to be with him, and who am I to judge, yknow? 

So last Christmas she came home to her parents house, and through snooping, Callie found what she assumed to be an engagement ring. She was super excited about it and figured Mike was going to propose. Wrong. The ring ended up being part of like a holiday display her mom was making (which makes me question whether or not it actually looked like an engagement ring at all). She was DEVASTATED and it lead to her and Mike having one long extended fight about getting married for MONTHS. 

Fast-forward to this year. Callie's grandmother has recently passed away, and at the wake, her aunt Lucille got drunk and told Callie that the family ""had considered offering Mike one of Grandma's old rings to use as an engagement ring."" Callie interpreted this as that they are getting engaged (again) and wouldn't you know it it's almost the holiday season and she's just on cloud nine. 

The thing is, I feel like I would know if an engagement was actually going to happen. There has always been a deal that if Mike was going to propose, he would come to me for ideas, I think because Callie doesn't trust him to be romantic enough himself. Which is a whole other can of worms. I haven't heard a peep from him. Maybe he's just going to do it himself, but he's always seemed relieved about the fact that I'm here to help him with a proposal. That and the fact that Aunt Lucille only told her they had CONSIDERED offering him a ring makes me think that there is no proposal on the horizon. 

I know what a shitstorm it was last year when Callie was expecting a Christmas Day proposal and it didn't happen. It was a big step back for them in their relationship, and it was just months of simmering tension. I feel like I should warn Mike that Callie has it in her head again that they're going to get engaged this year. Maybe he'll pleasantly surprise me and tell me it's true, maybe I can help them avoid all the nastiness if he nips it in the bud and sits her down and tells her no proposal this year. 

But of course, as this sub always says, don't be a butt-in-ski about other peoples' affairs. And I don't particularly want to get in the middle of their relationship. I just also don't want to see them, BOTH my friends, in another fight about the state of their relationship. 

So, what do?

"I [27m] told my friend [30m] that his girlfriend [27f] was cheating on him and he didn't believe me.


This is a fucked up situation and I just want his friendship back.

I'm also going to use names so it gets less confusing.

Basically, I caught my friend's girlfriend, Candice, cheating on him. I went to a pub and she was there, making out with another guy. She saw me, looked scared as shit and ran away. I followed her and said that if she didn't tell him about what she did, I would. She begged me not to and that it was a ""misunderstanding"" but fuck it. They've been dating for 8 years now, my friend deserved to know.

Well, a week went by and nothing happened. Their relationship was the same and he had no clue about the betrayal. I knew she wasn't going to tell him so I did. I had a serious talk with him and I told him she had cheated on him

At first he thought it was a prank, but when he realized I was being serious he didn't believe me. He accused me of ""trying to destroy"" their relationship due to the fact I'm gay, saying I had feelings for him (?????????????????????????????????????????????????????). I was really hurt by what he said so I told him to fuck off and left. He didn't even try to stop me and apologize. I'm not waiting for an apologize, but seriously, what can I do in this situation?

He's planning on proposing. After 8 years, they're going to get married. And she fucking cheated on him. Is there any way I can make him believe me?

tl;dr: my girlfriend's friend cheated on him. I told her that if she didn't tell him I would. I ended up having to tell him and he didn't believe me and accused me of having feelings for him due to the fact I'm gay."

"My [26F] mom [60sF] is trying to guilt trip me into making a gift for her sick friend at an unreasonable price


Edit: title derp. Make her sick friend a gift. 

I run my own handmade business designing quilts and taking commissions to make quilts. Handmade quilts cost a lot more than people realize. Materials are expensive, and a lot of hours (15-50 hrs are my usual range for 1 large quilt) go into each product. My quilts generally start at $400 minimum. 


My mom knows all of this. She acts almost like a stage mom when it comes to my business. She's a creative person who has a not at all creative career. She got me into crafts and stuff when I was a kid and she always is looking for a creative outlet in her free time, which isn't much these days. She's super proud of me. She loves showing off my accomplishments to her friends and coworkers (quilts published in magazines, a catalog release, licensing deals with big brands, etc.). She will talk to people about my work at any chance she gets. It's great to have a hardcore hype-mom spreading the word about my business, but due to past relationships issues I kinda feel like it's a superficial act. 

She was frankly very neglectful during my childhood. My father abused me physically, mentally, and emotionally (but treated my mom like a queen) while she made no effort to protect me or end the abuse. (See my post history for more on that). 

The issue at hand is she has a friend, Sara, who has a serious illness. She has been going through treatment and her condition is neither improving nor declining at this point. She's well enough to work (low stress office job), if that gives some indication of her condition. 

My mom wants to give Sara one of my quilts as a get well/comfort/Xmas gift. She asked if I had any finished quilts I'd be willing to sell. I work on commission only so any finished quilts are from my personal collection. I happened to have a few that I'd been thinking of selling cheaply since I'm running out of storage space and I'm terribly not fond of these particular quilts. I offered her a few options at $250 each (deeply, deeply discounted). She didn't think they were Sara's style, so I showed her an unfinished quilt i had lying around (it has been a commission that got canceled). She said it was perfect, and said she'd pay me to finish it and give it to Sara. It needs about $200 in labor and materials to finish on top of the $250ish that has already been put in at this current state. I stated this and she said ok. 

Today my mom texted me that she was going to pay me (upfront as we agreed) my $200 today when we meet for dinner and asked if I want in cash or check. Apparently she thinks she only has to pay the $200 *additional* labor/material cost and that all prior work I've done on the quilt isn't her responsibility. I told her she was getting the price wrong and we'd discuss it tonight. She's making some guilt trippy comments related to Sara's illness, giving a discount to my ""dear mother"" etc. 

I'm offended by all this. My mom is wealthy and has no issue spending $450 on stuff for herself in an afternoon. She regularly spends that amount on Sara's Xmas and birthday gifts too. It's me she likes to be stingy with (clearance bin gifts, always trying to get me to give her costly handmade gifts beyond my budget, frequently asking for free/discounted products). I can't afford to give my work away so cheaply. Not to mention it seems so duplicitous of her to act so boastful to others about my work when she doesn't want to pay me fairly for it.

I'm preparing to tell her she needs to pay my standard rate or find another gift Sara, but I'm already hearing all the voices in my head going, ""She's your mother!! Do it for your mother!"" Etc. Am I being heartless or reasonable?

Been together 2 and a half years and we live together. He's very very sweet all the time. Obvious that he loves me and I love him. 

Basically though.. If I cry, he gets very mad. He says I'm too emotional and get sad and cry for absolutely no reason. I've resorted to saving all my crying for when  he isn't home, or when  I shower. If I'm sad, instead of comforting me or something, he gets mad at I'm upset because ""I have no logical reason to ever be sad because I have a good life"". Which yes I do.. But that doesn't mean I don't get sad. 

I am emotional and especially around period time. It's just who I am. But I could  cry because my dog died, and he'd get so mad at me. What's with this? It makes me feel like I have to pretend to be happy 24/7 to avoid anger. I lurk here all the time and figured I could get some answers :(
