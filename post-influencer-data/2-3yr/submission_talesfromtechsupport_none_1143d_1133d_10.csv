"Buddy, you picked the wrong people to try and strong-arm.


Greetings, all. This one is from way back when, about six years ago now, when I was in an entirely different career and halfway around the world. No salad dressing this time, and I'm sure you're all disappointed.

On a certain class of military warship, there is a place. The bridge may be in control of where the ship goes, but Damage Control Central is in charge of how fast it is getting there and whether or not it arrives in one piece. It's run by a high-ranking officer from Reactor Department (EW) and his two cronies, one that monitors the ship's water usage and one that monitors the ship's electrical usage (hi) These three people can bring 97K+ tons of steel and sadness to a halt. Behind them are a small pile of engineering folk, literally the ship's tech support branch. People could call DCC and report a problem (from an out light to a fire), and between all of us in there, we had the knowledge, skill, authority, and political clout to get a response team out. A lot of people didn't know what kind of authority DCC held, or exactly who they were talking to when they called down. This made for some very entertaining conversations.

One evening, the engineering folk get a call. One female sailor picks it up and naturally, we all listen in, because if it's a fire or something, we all need to respond as rapidly as possible. From our POV, this is how the conversation goes:

&gt;Eng: DCC, Eng speaking.  
&gt;Eng: The heater doesn't work?  
&gt;Eng: Oh, yeah, that's normal.  
&gt;Eng: No, we can't turn it up.  
&gt;Eng: What? No, we can't replace it, we're in the middle of the Persian Gulf, where are we going to get another one?  
&gt;Eng: Look, it works fine. Take shorter showers.  
&gt;Eng: Your division can put in a request for a bigger one when we get back to home port, but you're not getting one now.  
&gt;Eng: Yeah, no, I'm not ordering one. Replacing those things is beyond the scope of what we're allowed to do underway.  
&gt;Eng: Because policy.  
&gt;Eng: Okay. You do that. We'll be waiting. Make sure you request permission to enter.  

With that, she hangs up. Naturally, we're all staring. She grins at us.

&gt;Eng: Game faces on, this one is gonna be good. Sir, I am sorry in advance.  
&gt;EW: You kidding? This shit is what makes watch worth-while.  

We sit back and put on our best 'I hate everything' faces and wait.

Not fifteen minutes later, the door thuds open. In walks (with permission) the hero of this little story, a very low-ranking punk (LRP) who think's he's hot shit because he does maintenance on air planes instead of steam pipes. With him is his immediate supervisor (LPO) a gentleman of my rank, and their divisional officer (Divo) a wee young lieutenant. Divo is all fired up because how dare Engineering not fix his guy's problem, and he makes a bee-line for the engineering folk.

This path will, briefly, place him between EW and a panel that, by the order of people with a rank I could never hope to achieve in my life, the EW is not allowed to be obscured from. They HAVE to be able to see it, at all times. I wait until the merry little band is almost in front of the EW before I speak up.

&gt;Me: Sir, please go around, the EW needs to be able to see that panel.  
&gt;Divo: I will walk where I damn well-  

He stops. Because someone of approximately double his rank, four times his time-in-service and significantly crankier is staring him down. All of the fire leaves Divo in an instant. Which, honestly, is exactly what I wanted. When high-ranking people get fired up, it's usually for a good reason. When baby divos get fired up, everyone in their general vicinity is stupider for witnessing their temper tantrum. Baby divos get much more done when they're calm.

LPO realizes that a Commander is sitting there and nearly poops himself. LRP is completely oblivious.

They walk back around our desks, not nearly as grudgingly as they could have, and take the slightly longer route to the engineering folk. Who are having the time of their lives, because this shit circus is well underway and they haven't had to even do anything yet. Eng spins around, her hands on the arms of her chair, a very pleasant, blank smile on her face.

&gt;Divo: Are you the one that won't fix my guy's showers?  
&gt;Eng: The showers aren't broken, sir. Did he tell you what his complaint was?  

LPO nearly cringes out of his skin. Because, no, obviously what happened is that LRP went and bitched at LPO that 'those assholes in engineering said they won't fix the broken showers' and LPO immediately went to his office to find some back-up and grabbed Divo. By the way we're all grinning at him, LPO knows he is in for the ass-reaming of his life.

Divo, however, looks to LRP for an explanation. The little nematode puffs up, very pleased to have the floor, and an audience to boot. At least two Very Important Officers get to hear his sound reasoning for calling down to the tech line. I sit there wishing popcorn was allowed in DCC.

&gt;LRP: Well, the hot water heater in the head can't keep up with the entire division when we all shower in the morning.  
&gt;Eng: Does it put out hot water at all?  
&gt;LRP: Well, yeah, when we all get up it works just fine. But as everyone takes their showers, it gets colder and colder.  
&gt;Eng: Does it ever go completely cold?  
&gt;LRP: No, but with a bigger heater, we could all take as long of showers as we wanted without it running out.  
&gt;Water Control Guy: Showers should be limited to five minutes, you're wasting water.  
&gt;LRP: Well, yeah, morning showers are pretty short, who wants to wake up early and shower? But when I take my second, longer shower in the evening, to relax after a long day of working-  

Some teeny tiny sense of self-preservation kicks in and LRP shuts up and looks around. He is in a room full of people who play the 'food, shower, sleep - pick 2' game on a daily basis. Every single person in this room, including his back-up, is staring at him with either full derision or outright hostility.

Except Eng. She's still smiling her blank, polite, 'I have been in the retail trenches and am dead inside' smile. I may be in love.

&gt;Eng: Sir, you can see why I denied his request. LPO, you may want to remind your guys that, despite being surrounded with water, there is a limit on how much fresh water we can make in a day and that long showers should be saved for in port. Was there anything else I can help you all with?  
&gt;Divo: No, I think I've heard enough. You two, my office. *Now.*  

They leave. LPO looks close to tears or shoving LRP out a porthole. Divo is full of now-justified wrath. LRP still looks vaguely bemused as to why his excellent argument didn't sway us all to his side.

The door shuts. All of us immediately put our heads on our desk and cry with laughter. Someone hands Eng an IOU for drinks at the next port. 

Eng's supervisor drafts an email to the ship's mid-tier leadership that not waking up early enough to get a hot shower is not a reason to request a new hot water heater and that water on board is limited. No details are provided and everyone eagerly looks forward to the rumor mill as people try and figure out what spawned *that* particular reminder.

The engines turn. The ship chugs on.

Edit: Thanks to /u/RobAtSGH for the gold!"

I'm an IT Guy at a credit union. Employee calls me up wanting their account unlocked. Simple enough.

&gt; Me: IT, this is Xauric.

&gt; Them: Hi...my account is locked out, can you unlock it?

&gt; Me: Yeah, can I have your name?

&gt; Them: Why do you need my name? Don't you know who I am?

&gt; Me: There are over 200 people who work here, I don't know you by your voice. Now can I have your name?

&gt; Them: [gives employee number]

&gt; Me: No, your *name.*

&gt; Them: Oh, do you need my username, or...?

&gt; Me: No, just your name.

&gt; Them: Oh, okay. Uh..[name].

Active Directory tells me they aren't locked.

&gt; Me: You aren't locked out.

&gt; Them: Yes it is! I can't log in!

&gt; Me: Okay, log in, and tell me what the error says.

&gt; Them: I can't! It's locked!

&gt; Me: Humor me.

&gt; Them: Fine...[typing] There, see? Locked.

&gt; Me: Read what's on the screen to me.

&gt; Them: Why? It says it's locked! Can't I just get my account unlocked and my password reset?

&gt; Me: Your account *is not locked.* Now read what's on the screen to me.

&gt; Them: The error is that my account is locked.

&gt; Me: Read the error that's on the screen.

&gt; Them: [big exasperated sigh] Fiiiiiiine...""Your password has expired and must be changed."" ...oooohhh. [click]

Funnily enough, I've never gotten a call from them about a locked account after that."
