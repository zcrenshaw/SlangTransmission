"What's an overly specific turn-on of yours?


my example: when a girl realizes that she's gotten lipstick on her teeth, so she looks into a mirror, bares her teeth, and uses her finger (especially the side of the finger instead of the fingertip) to rub the lipstick off. "
"What's the sweetest thing an SO has done for you?


Just something that lets you know they care about you a lot."
"How would you want to be supported by a male stranger if you get harassed?


I have once or twice been in a situation where I have been a guy witnessing some harassment in a situation where a woman couldn't simply walk away, and have intervened - not in the most de-escalating or safe manner possible, though.

I recently read some advice about pretending to be a clueless friend of the woman being harassed, but I am worried that a woman already harassed by a man would not exactly feel *more* secure in the presence of one additional male stranger who suddenly pretends to be friends with her :/"

"What is the most vindictive thing you've done to a SO while still in love with him/her?


There are plenty of stories about vindictive revenge on an ex no longer in love with. I'm interested in hearing about instances you were purposely vindictive to someone you were still in love with.

doesnt have to be maniac level crazy, it could be something as simple as not pointing out dog poop in his/her path because he/she forgot to take out the trash or something lol.

"Who do you think is strikingly attractive or too attractive?


It doesn't have to be someone you're sexual attracted to and can be male or female. They just have to physically stand out in such a way that you have some visceral reaction when you see them, like ""whoa"". Your eyes linger a little longer on their pictures. You think, ""wtf. It should be illegal to look that good. That person can't be real.""

**It doesn't just have to be celebrities!** It can be a random image you saw somewhere. Or someone from Instagram! Or just someone you know personally. It can be about their face, body, or the way they carry themselves. 

If they're not extremely famous, feel free to post a picture, video, or Instagram link if they're a public figure!"
