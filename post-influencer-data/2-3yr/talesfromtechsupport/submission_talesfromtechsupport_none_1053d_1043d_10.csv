"You are costing the company HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars!!


I used to work for a MSP servicing a Fortune 500 manufacturer. One afternoon we got an Urgent, line down ticket for the onsite foundry. A Foundry Manager had decided to replace a system that stamped serial numbers in molds before they were cast for a new product that laser engraved them. I will be $Spam and Supervisor will be $SaveMe. 
I pull up to the Foundry and he meets me at the side entrance. He leads me to the computer and holds out both hands like he is showing me a prize on the Price is Right but with a very angry face.

$SaveMe: I need this computer working right now. It has stopped production.

$Spam: This is not an IT supported machine.

$SaveMe: What do you mean, it’s a computer. Can’t you fix it?

$Spam: I will definitely try but this purchase did not come through our office and I have no idea what it will take to fix

$SaveMe: Well, Can’t you just build me a new one?

$Spam: I have a brand new desktop in my truck that I would be happy to give you but it will not solve your problem.

$SaveMe: What’s that supposed to mean?

$Spam: You got this from a 3rd party vendor right?

$SaveMe: Yeah, so.

$Spam: I have no way of getting the software from this dead computer, to the working one I brought. I don’t even know if we can legally transfer the software if I could. Did you contact the vendor?

$SaveMe: Of course, they are overnighting a new machine as soon as they get it built but they said it would be 36 hours and another 4 for the tech to install it.  We can’t afford to lose that much production. I need this fixed.

$Spam: Well, can you go get the old one and get it running?

$SaveMe: No, we scrapped it after the new system was running without issues 8 months ago.

$Spam: Well, why didn’t you buy a backup unit for when this one went down.

$SaveMe: I don’t have time for this, can you fix it or not?

$Spam: Unfortunately, no.  

$SaveMe: Oh great! You are causing us to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in production. I have employees standing around doing nothing because we are not casting units fast enough. I am going to speak with your supervisor.

$Spam: That’s fine Sir. Please reference Ticket ###### as I will have to make a full write up on this issue since production was effected due to 3rd party equipment. Should I forward it to you?

$SaveMe: What?

$Spam: I have to do a full incident report. It’s required on these issues and I will have to include that you purchased 3rd party equipment without notifying Corporate IT (Strike1), disposed of company hardware without notifying Corporate IT (Strike 2), and did not have a contingency plan in place for when this new 3rd party unit failed as computers tend to do (You’re out!)

I left the company a couple months later for a better paying gig so I don’t know what happened to $SaveMe but the shop floor guys said it ended up costing over $500,000 in lost production and wages (paying 300 people to stand around waiting on slow castings for a day and half). Our corporate liaison said I was going to need to be at a couple meetings but they never happened before I left. 

Edit: Formatting 

Edit: Glad everyone enjoyed the story. It got more eyes on it than I had expected. "
"It's never done.


I was in my doctor's office after a routine checkup, waiting for the assistant to print out my paperwork when I overheard this conversation from behind me.  Another assistant was helping a third learn the computer system.

&gt; **$Veteran:** Now, take the info from that form and put it in over here.

&gt; **$Newbie:** I can't bring the mouse over there.  It just stops.

&gt; **$Veteran:** You have to move it all the way to the right, then it'll come in from the left side.

&gt; *I turn around.*

&gt; **$Newbie:** That is so stupid.  Why can't you just move the mouse over there?

&gt; **Me:** Um...

&gt; **$Veteran:** I don't know.  It's been like that ever since we upgraded to these laptops a few years ago.  That's what happens when you use a laptop with two screens.  You get used to it after a while. 

&gt; **Me:** Excuse me...

&gt; **$Newbie:** Can't we just move this screen over to the other side?  Aargh, I just did it again!  I'll never remember to bring my mouse to the other side.

&gt; **$Veteran:** No, there's only enough room on the desk to put the laptop here and the extra screen there.  We tried to fix it a while ago and nobody could figure it out.

&gt; **Me:** Hey, what operating system do you have?

&gt; *They finally look up.*

&gt; **$Veteran:** I'm sorry?

&gt; **Me:** I couldn't help but overhear.  I can fix your problem.  Can I just look at your machine for a few seconds?  I won't touch anything.

&gt; *They give me a strange look, but I walk over behind $Newbie.*

&gt; **Me:** Here, go to the desktop.

&gt; **$Newbie:** The what?

&gt; **Me:** Hold down the windows key and hit D.  Now right-click anywhere there and go to Display Properties.  Drag the thing that says ""2"" over to the other side of ""1"".  Now click OK.

&gt; **$Veteran:** OH MY GOD HOW DID YOU DO THAT? 

&gt; **Me:** It's my job.

&gt; **$Veteran:** Thank you so much!

&gt; **$CheckoutLady:** Here's your paperwork.

&gt; **Me:** Thanks.  Don't I have a copay?

&gt; **$CheckoutLady:** Nope, you're all set.

As I walked out of the building I wondered if I should find a phone booth so I could take off my cape and put back on my glasses."
