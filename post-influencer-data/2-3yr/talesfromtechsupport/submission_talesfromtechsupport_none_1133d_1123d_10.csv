"Get the scripts before you fire your IT


 I was working for a large warehouse and customization company under contract through another company and recently they had been talking about cutting people and shifts to make up for the lack of sales during the summer and wanted us to show our worth. 

 The IT manger asked me since I was the last hire to show my worth and why I should not be cut. 80% of what I had to do in the first 3 months I had gotten down to simple scripted fixes by talking to the software vendors and learning the fixes. Plus reduced turn around time on broken RF guns by actually looking at how to repair them and which of the parts from the old guns being replaced were compatible with the new models. 

 I presented all of this to him and the following week I was notified by my contract manager they were letting me go. Fine with that really as seasonal was coming up and the no drug test or background check hires were the worst each year. Two days later I get a call from the manager demanding the scripts I used. While at the job they never provided me with any tools and they told us to use our own if we needed it. I had never put the scripts on the server or on my work computer. I check my contracts for any clause for files or documents I create while on the job and then proceeded to tell him they were not worth me keeping my job, so I deleted them when requested to dormat my drive upon termination, but they could keep my screwdriver set in my drawer so they can have one in the office.

For those who cant keep up.
Scripts were made on my own time off the clock talking to software vendors cause they are closed during  my night shift. Never left my USB drive. Was deleted per request for my drive being formatted on termination. I was a contractor and the scripts would belong to my contract company and not the company I was sent to if any and they already said they dont want them I am safe. (They dont make money if I am not there)"

Ever try to tech support someone with their equally technologically challenged husband/wife behind them telling them what to do?

Cx - Customer
Wf - Customer's Wife

&gt; Me: Okay, click on the email I just sent you. Then click on the link inside it to reset your password.
&gt; 
&gt; Cx: Okay... let me see
&gt;      
&gt; Wf (in the background): Wait! stop! Go back!
&gt; 
&gt; Cx: what?
&gt;            
&gt; Wf: A free ipad!

Okay, a scam email. No big deal, just tell the Cx and we can move on.

&gt;Me: That's not real. It's most likely a virus.

&gt;Wf: No let's take a look

Please don't. 

&gt;Me: I really wouldn't do that

&gt;Cx: It's okay. We're just going to look and not download anything

&gt;Wf: Maybe it's from the mall!

No it's not.

&gt;Cx: okay we're just going to take a quick look

&gt;Wf: Wow a free ipad! I can't believe it! We won!

No you didn't.

&gt;Wf: Click on it!

No really please don't. Please.

&gt;Cx: okay let's see how to redeem our ipad from apple

It's not from apple. you're not getting the ipad. You're getting a virus.

*15 seconds later I hear the ""your computer has a virus"" message playing from their speaker*

&gt; Cx: Our computer just got a virus. Can you fix this? Can you remote in and fix this?

No.

&gt; Wf: I can't believe people would do that! 

And I can't believe people still falls for it.

*Cue two hours of babystepping them through running Malwarebyte because we aren't allowed to hang up on stupid.

Edit: it's the fake blue screen of death scareware piece of shit that auto plays the audio clip. It comes with pop ups. It tells you to call a number to get it fixed, you click on it and you get even more malware. That's what the free iPad linked them to. "
