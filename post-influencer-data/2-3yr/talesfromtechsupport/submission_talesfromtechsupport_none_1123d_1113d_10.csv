"I seriously hope I never have to do this again


I work in a call center for one of the major cell phone companies. This happened sometime yesterday. This is more of a vent than not.

A woman calls in, must have been at least 75 years old, she's looking to disconnect a line. I start my spiel about trying to save the line (required), but it just doesn't feel right. I ask her why she wants to disconnect the line, and she tells me that her son passed away. I'm obligated to tell her that if she doesn't back up her content before I disconnect the line and she trades it in, she would lose that content. She just responds with ""Oh... I guess I better do that then...""

I'm helping her connect this phone to her laptop, and she's going through pictures and videos and the music that her son helped her set up. I hear the videos in the background as she watches them again. She tells me all these wonderful stories about him, the trips he took, the things he did. I'm genuinely having a tough time keeping it together, because he sounds like a great person and she sounds so sad and lonely, but she kept her composure so well.

Call takes about two hours. We finally finish moving everything from her phone over to her laptop and I submit the disconnect. She thanks me for my time and for listening to the rambles of an old woman. I take a breath, and it comes back out as a sob. I didn't even realize that I had been crying for most of the call. Super has been listening in on the call for a while and he tells me to just go home early if I want, he'll cover if anyone asks what's going on.

I love my job. Really, I do. Sometimes it's hard. Calls like this make me wonder if I can keep doing it.

Edit: Thank you for the support, and thank you kind gilding strangers. I wish I could say this was a normal occurrence, but I can all but guarantee you - not counting supervisors (who are awesome and super supportive), there are not many people in my building who would have been that kind or accommodating for her.

Edit V2: Got a message from my super a few minutes ago, wanted me to check my surveys for the day and then call in. She left an absolutely glowing survey for me, asked if there was any way she could thank me personally or speak to me again directly. Called the super after and he said he would be submitting a personal recommendation that I be considered for a promotion because of the edit mentioned above. I feel like this kind of behavior should just be standard between customers and CS reps, regardless of what's going on in either party's life...

Edit V3: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up like it did. I really just wanted to get it written down and off my chest. Truly, thank you guys so much for being here, you're all awesome. ;w;

Edit V4: I'm back at work now. Boss and I caught much less flak over it than we anticipated, and his recommendation has been considered. I have two weeks to prepare a presentation going over why it's important to ""not be a robot"" (why it's okay, even good, to go off script sometimes, as well as how to stave off the ennui that comes from call center work) for HR and the site operations managers - if I do well, it will be looked at for use in future training, and I'll get the job I've been aiming for. Wish me luck! ;w;"
"Sir are you saying you'd like for me to overpower the SUN?


Link to my recent TFTS [All I wanted was sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4ymm4f/all_i_wanted_was_sleep/)

So a little info, I'm military, was in the middle of a desert. Prior to military I did help desk and network administration, joined up and got a job that involves: Networking, AD admin, radio communication, satellite communication, etc...

While out in Al Sandyland.  We had an 8ft satellite dish that was sitting on top of a 30ft tower, tow strapped down, with one of the legs of the base propped up on a cinder block. 

I don't know how many people here have experience with SatComm and RF Theory, but our look angle was below the horizon,  that's why we had to get creative. 

Come late September, early October, at about 6pm every day, we would lose signal, and this was while our Major had some meetings. 

Naturally he would get very upset, and came to me and would ask what the hell?

Me: Well sir, seeing as our dish is pointed at the horizon, the sun passes exactly where we point and it drowns out our signal. 

Maj: Well what can we try?

My Sgt: we can try changing out parts?

Me(Cpl): We have all of the *good* parts on already...

Maj: Just do what your Sgt says Cpl...

Me: Aye sir... 

Afterwards

Me: Sgt, you know that doesn't work like that...

Sgt: I know I just needed to get him off our backs...

*spend the next 2 hours pulling boxes out of storage containers that weigh close to 100lbs each to find parts, then restacking them, and changing parts*

Next day...

Maj: CPL I THOUGHT WE TOLD YOU TO CHANGE THE PARTS, I STILL LOST SIGNAL!!!

Me: Sir, our system is from at least 1994, I don't think it can out power the single largest source of EMI in the solar system... it's like I'm using a squirt gun  to fight a fire hose.

Lucky the contractor was sitting there and had my back, telling him that I was correct.

Edit: obligatory, wow this is my biggest post. Thanks everyone!!

Edit2: this has been fun reading and responding to. I'm working a night shift so I need to get some sleep. See you guys in a few hours."
"You control my internet, why didn't you stop this?


This will be a tale from my time as tech support for an ISP, sadly no good stories from my current. Though, with our phishing email test coming up i'm sure some will come!

It was a cold day and I just ran out of pumpkin spice coffee, when my headset goes DING!


&gt;me: Thanks for calling $ISP. Can I get your info?

BLAH BLAH BLAH  INFORMATION


&gt;me: Thanks for that, how can I help you?

&gt;customer: Yeah, I got a virus from some link on the internet.

&gt;me: I'm sorry to hear that, did you get it taken care of?

&gt;customer: Well no, That's why i'm calling, for YOU to fix it. How could you let this happen to me?

&gt;me: We don't do virus removal, sorry about the confusion. I would recommend taking it to a PC tech if you don't have any virus protection to run.

&gt;customer: NO, YOU CONTROL THE INTERNET. YOU SHOULD PROTECT ME FROM IT. YOU PROVIDE INTERNET, THEREFORE IT IS YOUR FAULT.

&gt;me: We provide you with the internet, however we don't control the internet or it's content.

&gt;customer: Yes you do. How dumb are you?

&gt;me: Not to toot my own horn, but not very. *Proceeds to explain how this process worked*

*Proceed to hear customer snort like a raging bull*

&gt;customer: I'll expect a tech at my house to fix this. Goodbye -click-

&gt;me: Wait - .......

And that is why my head has a big dent in it.

tl;dr - Customer forgot to put a condom on their Ethernet cord
