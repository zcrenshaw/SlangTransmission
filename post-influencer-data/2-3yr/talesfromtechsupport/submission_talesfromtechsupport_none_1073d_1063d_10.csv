"In which a doctor understands how IT works


Standard disclaimer, not IT, I just know how to google things.

I have a very good friend who is a doctor.  I sometimes ask him for tips on health related things, and he often comes to me for technical / mechanical advice.  It wasn't always this way, though.  Near the beginning of our friendship, an incident happened involving an iPhone 3GS (back when it first came out) that really helped pave the way for understanding between the two of us.

(Over the phone)  
&gt;Doc:  ""Hey I'm having some problems with my iPhone, can you help?""  
&gt;Me:  ""Sure, are you on it right now?""  
&gt;Doc:  ""No, I'm calling from my landline.""  
&gt;Me:  ""OK, great, what's the problem?""  
&gt;Doc:  ""It's not working.""  
&gt;Me:  ""....yes, go on.""  
&gt;Doc:  ""I just said.  It's not working.""  
&gt;Me:  ""Is it not turning on?  Is it not being responsive?""  
&gt;Doc:  ""It's on, just not working.  I thought you knew iPhones?""  

At this point, I was starting to lose my patience.

&gt;Me:  ""OK, imagine I called you up.  You can't see me, but you want to help me.  And all I'm willing to say is that it hurts.  But I refuse to tell you what hurts, where it hurts, how it hurts, and what I was doing before it started hurting.  All I'm telling you over the phone is that it hurts, and I'm getting impatient with YOU.  How would you feel?""  
&gt;Doc:  (Defensive)  ""I'd assume you didn't understand biology and and would ask a few diagnostic questions to narrow it down.""  
&gt;Me:  ""I just told you.  It hurts.  I thought you knew about medicine?""  
&gt;Doc:  ""How can I help you if you won't tell me what actually hurts?""  
&gt;Me:  ""EXACTLY MY POINT!""  

That was a ""come to Jesus"" moment for my friend, and he started being a bit more descriptive.  I also would later hear from him that he ended up being an ""IT Liaison"" at his hospital since he was able to more accurately describe problems to the IT help desk than his colleagues.

Edit:  First, thanks to /u/jakimfett for the Gold!

Second, a few of you mentioned this story sounds familiar.  There are a few reasons that might be:

- I've told this story in shortened form in the comments here and on other forums (likely on fark.com) in years past.

- Other people have also used very similar analogies.

- A combination of the above, AND I've stripped out a lot of the idiosyncratic parts of the conversation that only two friends would have but bears little relevance to the conversation (talking about cars, talking about hot miserably hot the weather was, talking about how jealous I was that he managed to get a 3GS so quickly, etc.)."

Me:  Retail I.T. This is Daniel.

DM:  Hey Daniel.  This is ******** district manager of ****.  I'm in a big bind here.  I'm doing a presentation in 15 minutes and my laptop crashed.  I'm kind of freaking out here and don't know what to do.

Me:  Oh no.  Well I'll have to have a desktop tech give you a call and help you with that. 

DM:  Well is there anyway you can help me?  Not to be that person, but I'm really freaking out here and I have no time left until my presentation....

Me:  Ok, well what's your laptop showing? 

DM:  It's not powering on.  It showed like a blue screen and just turned off on its own and now won't turn on.... 

Me:  Yeah.  That doesn't sound good.  We might have to replace your laptop....

DM:  Oh my god.... (starts crying)

Me:  Oh shoot..... 

DM:  I worked on this all week!  I can't believe this (starts sobbing)

Me:  Ok.  Please don't cry.  Let me see what I can do.  

DM: (continues crying)

Me:  Alright.  So when you worked on your presentation it was a powerpoint right?

DM:  Yes... (sniff)

Me:  Did you have it saved on a network drive or just on your computer?  

DM:  i'm not sure.  I think just on my computer... (sniff)

Me:  Ok, I'm willing to bet you saved it on the network drive and didn't know it. 

DM:  Ok.  

Me:  I have to search like a million folders.  Can you tell me the name of presentation?

DM:  Yeah.  It's  ********************

Me:  Ok.  Let's see.  2016 right?

DM:  Yeah  (sniff)

Me:  Got it!  

DM:  Shut up..... (sniff)

Me:  It's ***************** for 5/12/16 right?

DM:  Oh my god..... 

Me:  Ok so i'm going to save this.  Send it to your email.  You have a phone or ipad right?

DM:  I have both!  

Me:  Ok. Are you in a conference room? 

DM:  Yeah!  

Me:  Do they have wifi?  

DM:  Yeah... I think so.... 

Me:  Ok.  Try to find out the wifi and connect your ipad to it. 

DM:  Ok.  Emails are coming through.  I see yours...... Oh my god...... OH MY GOD!!! 

Me:  There ya go!  I don't know the connection of the conference room but there should be a way to airplay your powerpoint from your ipad to the tv or whatever they have.  If they're mac compatible..

DM:  Yeah if not this is fine.  Oh my god... (crying)  I can't believe it.  You saved me! 

Me:  haha.  not a problem.  Glad i was able to help

DM:  Next time I'm at the office, you're getting beer and a long hug! 

Me:  Sounds good.  Hope your meeting goes well. 

DM:  .........................

Me:  Ok Bye? 

DM:  hahahahahahah.   So.  My laptop just turned on.... It wasn't plugged in and I guess the battery was dead.  ha ha ha.....

Me:  ...................................

DM:  Hello? 

Me:  (crying)"
