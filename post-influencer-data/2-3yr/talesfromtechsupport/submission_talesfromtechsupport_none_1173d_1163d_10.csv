"I hate the word ""nothing"".


I've been in tech support for a long time. I've gotten used to a lot of things but use of the word ""nothing"" drives me insane. A call I had just this morning reminded me of this call from a few years ago when I worked for a home schooling program. I got calls from brats that were often kicked out of public school for some reason or another. So, the call went like this:

Kid: My computer won't do anything.

Me: Ok. What do you mean? Does it power...

Kid: Oh my god. I just told you. It does NOTHING. Just like I told the last person that I had to hang up on.

Me: I just need some more information. Is there an err...

Kid: Is everyone there stupid? I've told you it doesn't do anything, idiot. How hard is that to fucking unders...

Me: Oh, just fucking stop. Right now. I need you to understand I can't see what you see. I need you to be *descriptive*. Does the computer even turn on?

Kid: Yes?

Me: OK. That's *something* , then, isn't it? Not *nothing*. What *exactly* is happening? Use your words. Be *descriptive*.

Shortly after I found that his cable modem was unplugged. I later found out that call was recorded. I thought I was going to get fired for my language but my manager actually congratulated me and said it was great.


EDIT: WOW! I never would have thought this post would blow up like this. Nearing 4k points, TFTS quote of the day, and reddit gold? Thanks everyone!!"
"""Files are taking too long to transfer, still at 61%"".


Hello everyone, first time poster on this sub but I can assure you it won't be my last. Please enjoy today's pickings.

I had a person come up and say that they have been transferring some files for hours and it's only at 61%.

I have a look and find that they are not transferring files at all.

All they've done is plug their video camera in to the computer and the 61% is the level of battery remaining on the device.

The person has been watching the battery drain for hours."
