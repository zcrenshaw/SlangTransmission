"I didn't receive a warning - therefore I don't owe you any money!


As some of you may know, I work an out of hours service desk supporting multiple businesses. This particular business is an educational institute and this particular discussion took place between myself and a student;

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** I CAN'T PRINT!

**Me:** Okay, what actually happens?

**Caller:** I JUST TOLD YOU! I CAN'T PRINT...

*note - callers tone is very rude and I've reached my BS tolerance by this stage*

**Me:** Yes we've established you can't print- what actually happens? what errors are received? What does the printer do?

**Caller:** It tells me to top up my print credit as I have a negative balance of -$49 

**Me:**...

**Caller:** *HELLO!*

**Me:** I'm sorry, I don't see the issue here. You'll need to clear the $49 outstanding balance before you can print

**Caller:** But I don't owe you any money!

**Me:** Okay, are you saying this balance has been added to your account in error?

**Caller:** No

**Me:** Can you please explain what you mean?

**Caller:** I was photocopying loads of personal pictures yesterday and since then I have this balance. But I don't think I owe this as I didn't get any warnings when photocopying

**Me:**... But you're aware there's a charge for photocopying?

**Caller:** YES OF COURSE I AM!

**Me:** Okay, so I don't see why you're disputing the balance? You used a photocopier for a large job and as a result of this have a negative balance which will need to be cleared - regardless of ""warnings"" or not, you still used a service at the end of the day and need to pay for what you've used - you've just admitted you knew about the charge before using the service.

**Caller:** I JUST NEED TO PRINT NOW!

**Me:** Okay, you'll need to clear the balance on the account first by topping up

**Caller:** BUT THIS IS URGENT!

**Me:** It's 11 pm - I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. If you want to print you'll need to clear this balance by topping up your credit 

**Caller:** BUT I DON'T OWE YOU ANY MONEY!

**Me:** You said you used the photocopiers?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** Presumably you have the documents you photocopied?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** So you have photocopied documents that you haven't paid for. The photocopiers should not be used for personal use either. What is it that you need to ""urgently"" print right now?

**Caller:** I want to print a banner for a party

**Me:** So, again you're using the printing facilities for personal reasons - in clear breach of the policy you agreed to. You've also called an IT emergency line and claimed this was ""urgent"".

**Caller:** WELL I DIDN'T GET ANY WARNINGS!

**Me:** Thanks for calling. I'll report this to your school office for further investigation but I'm unable to deal with this on the emergency line. Goodbye *click*
