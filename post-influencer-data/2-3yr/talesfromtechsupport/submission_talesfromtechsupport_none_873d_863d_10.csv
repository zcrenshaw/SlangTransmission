"0 is a number.


So, I had to walk a client through setting up a printer over the phone. Which required her to set an IP address to the printer. Also she is not tech smart at all. 

Me: ""Ok, do you have a usb cable? Sometimes they come with the printer""

Her: ""No, im looking in the box now. Theres no usb cable. Only the printer and power""

*So it needs to me networked, great. I walk her through getting the printer on her network*

Me: ""Ok, do you see a place to enter 4 numbers?""

Her: ""Yep, its right here""

Me: ""Ok the number is 192.168.0.3""

Her: ""Ok, I put in 19216803. Whats the 2nd number?""

Me: ""No, lets start over. The first number is 192, second is 168, third is 0, and fourth is 3""

Her: ""Ok, so 192.168.03?""

Me: ""No, the third number is just 0, the fourth is 3""

Her: ""So, 0.0.0.3?""

Me: ""no, 192.168.0.3""

Her: ""But what about the 0?""

Me: ""What about it?""

Her: ""Shouldn't it be a number?""

Me: ""0 is a number""

Her: ""Look this it to complex for me, cant we just use the cable it came with?""

Me in my head: WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOU HAD A CABLE!?!??! YOU SAID YOU JUST HAD THE PRINTER AND POWER CABLE!

Me: "".....yes""

Edit: I should say, this is the shortened version. IRL this conversation went on for 30 min and this ticket lasted 2 days. 

Edit2: I said ""Zero"", NOT ""o"" and I said both ""period"" and ""dot"""
"Got to give a firearms lesson yesterday


So I go out to a call where the desktop is not powering on.  Go out there and the first thing I find is a Springfield XD 9mm sitting on top of the machine.  This client is kinda known for keeping random guns in random places and I know the lady who's computer this is knows jack shit about guns.

I point to it and say ""what do you want me to do with this?"" and she says ""is the safety on?""  I'm a gun guy but I've never handled an XD so I confuse the mag release with the safety and drop the magazine.  At this point I'm fairly sure it has a round in the tube so I tell her I'm going to work the slide to eject the bullet.

Sure enough, I eject one out on her desk and now she is asking me where the safety is.  I'm not seeing one other than the Glock type trigger so I tell her there isn't one and that keeping it hot like that is probably a bad idea.  I have to explain that you can put a mag in the gun without putting one in the chamber and all you have to do is jack the slide and it will be ready to shoot.

I'm an IT guy out on a computer call and I had to break down how a semi-automatic pistol works to a customer....fucking tuesdays."
