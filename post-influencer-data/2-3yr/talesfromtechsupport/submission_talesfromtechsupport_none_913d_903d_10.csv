"This one's a simple one, but I can't get it out of my head.


I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.

A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were ""Third-party software, hard of hearing.""

I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs ""yes"" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.

She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.

As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.

Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.

I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.

It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, ""fixing"" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.

Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.

Obligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words. Seeing the response I've gotten from all of you has made this experience even better! You guys are an amazing community."
"Will fix laptops for food


A few years ago I was sent to our Italian office where the 3 Italian IT guys were to train up their new IT Support Guy there on how to manage his help desk stuff.  Things were going really well and one day they decided that we should all go out for a traditional Italian meal - a Turkish Kebab.

We got to the kebab shop and I'm trying to read the menu and getting some help from the team.  The guy behind the counter can fortunately speak English and he wants to practise so we get talking and I place my order of 1xAwesomeKebab.    

He then asks me what an English speaking guy is doing in Italy so I make the mistake of telling him that I'm here doing ""IT Stuff"".

That was all he needed to hear.  About 15 seconds later I have this knackered old laptop running Windows 7 with a Turkish operating system that ""won't work"" and there's an error when he tries to do stuff with it.  

So I tried to help as he was preparing my food and I like helping people anyway.  My kebab turns up and I slowly ate it over the course of about 20minutes while I tried my hardest using context and experience to figure out what was wrong from the description he gave me that ""something was wrong with his internet connection and it didn't work"".

I managed to work out that it looked like his network card was broken and non-functioning and that he could maybe try re-installing it from the original disks he had or get a cabled connection so he could get the drivers if he didn't have the disks.  

He seemed happy with this and brought us our bill.  He went round the table collecting the money and when he got to me he said 

""Not you my friend, today, you eat for free!""

The kebab was totally worth the impromptu tech support."
