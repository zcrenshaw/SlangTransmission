"""I'm calling IT!""


I'm not personally in tech support
I work in the HVAC low voltage control industry. I do everything from pulling wire to programming and everything in the middle. I work with IT a lot due to our controllers needing port forwarding / VPN / etc.

I was working in an office building today, converting pneumatic fan powered boxes and vav boxes to DDC. This consists of removing air lines and replacing them with wire, adding transformer, controller, relays, etc. I rolled my cart into a new area and popped a ceiling tile to see what was next. Suddenly a woman in a cubical gasps. She slowly looks up at me and asks what I'm doing. I explain. 

Her: 
&gt; ""well, as soon as you did that my computer slowed down.""


It took me a minute to process... 

I assured there was nothing I did that would cause her computer to slow down. Her response?

&gt; ""You're letting the WiFi escape! I'm calling IT!!""

Guy from tech support shows up. Her computer is hardwired. Weekly server update. "
"Screaming at a user... and they loved it.


I am currently working from home as I recover from cancer.

My kitchen table is my Service Desk and my flat is my office.

It's nice!

My partner normally leaves the flat before I start, and returns after I leave, meaning I can happily work away on my own.

A few minutes ago I was helping a user with a DMS search issue.

My partner had come home early. And quietly. 

She whispered hello as she realized I was on a call...

I screamed straight into the receiver and fell off my chair. 

The user, when I explained what had happened, began laughing hysterically and telling those around him about the ""screamer from IT"".

Can't wait to return to the office now..."
