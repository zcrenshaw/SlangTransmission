"Grandpa doesn't take my advice, can't use a computer with $1500 AUD worth of photo editing software.


I'm not tech support, but am tech support for my family.

$Grandpa

&gt;My usbs won't work and I keep getting this error message.

$Me

&gt;I'll have a look at it for you.

*Does a Google Search of error message*

$Me

&gt;You have some PUP software. I'll install Malwarebytes and remove it for you.

$Grandpa

&gt;I don't want you installing anything on my computer.

$Me

&gt;Ok, I'll delete them from a Linux Live USB.

$Grandpa

&gt;But the usbs don't work.

$Me

&gt;No, they only don't work in Windows. I am going outside of Windows for this.

$Grandpa

&gt;No, I don't trust you, I'll take it to *insertelectricsstore*.

$Me

&gt;They're not IT, they're salesmen.

$Grandpa

&gt;You don't know what you're talking about.

Surprise, surprise, it was never fixed, more malware was downloaded by the PUP software to the point where it won't even boot into Windows. Won't let me wipe and reinstall.

Edit: Yay, top post."
"The server keeps going down at 6AM!


So, this isn't my story, but a friend told me this and I wanted to share it.


So, he goes into work one day, just the usual stuff, when someone contacts him about the servers at their work and how every morning, without fail, they completely shut down at 6AM for around 15 minutes. 


So, he goes over to the place (not at 6AM) to see what was happening and check it out. After about an hour, he can't find anything wrong with it (aside from the abysmal cable management of course), so decides to come back at 6AM. 


So, the next day, he is sitting in the their office, and it 5:58AM, when the cleaner walks into the building. She walks straight up to the power sockets for the servers, unplugs one of them, and plugs in her vaccuum cleaner."
