"Vladimir. ... Vladimir. ... *VLADIMIR!!*


When I started working for my current company there was a customer who was already infamous.  He was one of those people who was known only by his first name.  Everyone knew exactly who you were talking about when you said you'd had to take a call from Vladimir.  

They tried to protect me, as the newbie, from Vladimir as long as possible, but one day when I'd been at the company for maybe six months it just couldn't be avoided.  No one else was available but me, and he was in a royal fury.  The operator called me up, apologized to me (even she knew who he was) and told me that she had no one else to take him.  I reluctantly agreed to take the call.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, this is the exchange the operator had with him immediately before she passed him to me.

&gt; **Operator:** I'm going to pass you to Merkuri22.  She's new.

&gt; **Vladimir:** *(shouts)* I don't want somebody new!  I want somebody who knows something!

&gt; **Operator:** *(shouts back)* She knows a lot, Vladimir!! *(slams down receiver, passing him to me)*

Vladimir's no Bob.  He's a fairly intelligent guy, but he gets frustrated super quick, and has a very hot temper.  I swear, sometimes when he calls us he doesn't want his issue to be fixed, he just wants to let us know the torture our product is putting him through.  He calls us to be a martyr on the line, and shout at us about how terrible the product is.  And my first call with him was one of those.

Luckily, Operator was right.  I knew a lot.  I had picked up on our products super quick, and the issue he called me about was a piece of cake.  The hard part was getting him to shut up long enough to tell him the solution to his issue.  I managed to calm him down and fix his problem, and not long after that I had become his favorite tech.  It had very quickly gone from, ""I don't want to talk to her!!!"" to, ""Get me Merkuri22!  I need to speak to Merkuri22!  Nobody else can solve my problems, *nobody!!*""

I learned to read his moods like a medium reading tea leaves.  Sometimes it was best to meet his fire with a the cool exterior of a nurse at a mental hospital explaining why we don't hit other patients, and other times I could only get his attention by spitting flames back in his face.

Other techs could always tell when I was talking to Vladimir because they'd hear a one-sided conversation that went something like this:

&gt; **Me:** Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* *VLADIMIR!!* *Pause.* You know I'm trying to help you, right?  Do you want me to get this working for you, or not?  *Pause.* Okay, then let me explain what's happening here...

Many times in my career I've compared what I do to the TV show House.  Tech support is a lot like diagnosing a patient.  I frequently tell my techs, ""Customers lie,"" (playing on House's ""Patients lie"") and every time I say it I'm thinking of Vladimir.  This is why I swear sometimes he'd call up just to try to prove to me that our product is crap, because he'd frequently lie to me about what did and didn't work.  He'd tell me whatever would mean he needed to be in a panicked state, up against a deadline that he could not possibly meet, all because our products suck.

One time he called me up with an issue where I knew exactly what it was.  I'd just solved it for another customer the day before.  We were on a remote meeting and I could see his screen.

&gt; **Vladimir:** I tried *everything* and *nothing* works!

&gt; **Me:** Oh, I know what this is.  You need to do &lt;solution&gt;.

&gt; **Vladimir:** I *told* you!  I *tried* that and *it didn't work!*

&gt; **Me:** *(thinks) That's impossible, it has to work when you do that.*

&gt; **Me:** What exactly did you do?

&gt; **Vladimir:** I did &lt;exactly what I told him&gt; and *it didn't work!  Nothing works!  I told you!*

&gt; **Me:** Can you do it again so I can see the steps you took?

&gt; **Vladimir:** *I TOLD YOU I DID &lt;solution&gt; AND IT DIDN'T WORK!*

&gt; **Me:** Vladimir, calm down.  Can you do it one more time?  Do it for me?

&gt; **Vladimir:** *(calmer)* Fine.  I'll do it again for you.  See, I do this, and I click here, and I don't see-- oh, it's working this time!  You're the best!  I always know when I call you up that you'll fix it for me!

A few years later, Vladimir's favorite support grunt (me) was promoted to manager.  I was a working manager for a while, trying to manage my team and take calls at the same time, but that proved to not be very efficient, and after years of that I reduced the calls I directly took down to almost nothing.  Vladimir was *not* pleased.

One day he was having a hissy fit, and was demanding to speak to no one but me, even though he'd been told many times that I was now a manager and didn't take direct calls.  This particular day I was in and out of meetings about another customer who was legitimately having serious issues, and I couldn't make time for Vladimir.  There were times when the operator literally couldn't find me because I was bouncing between conference rooms and upper management offices.  

At one point the operator (now a different woman from earlier in this post) came and found me physically.  She was crying.  She told me about how upset Vladimir was, and how he was demanding to speak to me and wouldn't let her pass him to anyone else on the team, and she didn't know what to do.

I was *livid*.  I still didn't have time to call him back because that other customer's issue was far from over and there were political ramifications I had to juggle, but I took a few minutes to write Vladimir a scathing email.  I told him that it was not the operator's fault that I wasn't available, shouting at her wouldn't make me come to the phone any faster, and that he was sabotaging his own attempts to get a solution by refusing to speak with the available qualified techs who were happy to help him with his issue.  I made sure he knew the operator's name, and that he'd made her cry.  Then I went back to trying to keep my other customer from hemorrhaging blood.

Not long after I sent that email, the operator found me again, and told me that this had happened...

&gt; **Operator:** Thank you for calling &lt;company&gt;, how may I direct your call?

&gt; **Vladimir:** Is this &lt;operator's name&gt;?

&gt; **Operator:** *(recognizes his voice, tenses up)* Yes, it is.

&gt; **Vladimir:** This is Vladimir.  I just wanted to apologize.  I did not mean to yell at you.  That was completely unacceptable of me.

&gt; **Operator:** Wow... t-thank you!  That means a lot to me.  *Pause.* Do you want to talk to tech support?

&gt; **Vladimir:** No, thanks, I just called to apologize.  Have a nice day.  *Click.*

That was one of my proudest moments as a manager, making Vladimir call back just to apologize.

***

He still calls us up every once in a while.  I haven't talked to him in years.  He's found another favorite, but every once and a while he still tells her about the way Merkuri22 used to do things, and tells her to go ask me for answers.  He still lies to her.  Sometimes she comes to me and says:

&gt; **Tech:** Vladimir says the last time this happened you told him to do &lt;x&gt;.

&gt; **Me:** I absolutely did not.

&gt; **Tech:** I figured.

And sometimes I still hear from someone else's cube...

&gt; Vladimir... Vladimir... VLADIMIR!  Listen to me!..."
"USE YOUR EARS YOU IDIOT


Friendly(ish) neighbourhood ISP rep here, just got off the phone with this one and wow, I'm still kinda speechless. Me for me and cust for our beloved customer.

&gt;Me: Generic totallynotarobot greeting

&gt;Cust: MY INTERNET IS OUT FIX IT NOW!

&gt;Me: I'm doing well thank you how are you?

Typically if the customer starts off by yelling at me and not acknowledging my existence as a human, I will endeavour to fix your problem ASAP to get you off the phone, or fix it as slow and painfully as possible. Depends on my mood, I was only 1 coffee into the day at this point and in no mood for this kind of shit. 

&gt;Cust: ARE YOU LISTENING? USE YOUR EARS IDIOT I SAID HELP ME

&gt;Me: I'll certainly take a look for you, what was your account number?

&gt;Cust: I don't have time for this, just fix it, send someone out, I don't care, but do it fast or else.

&gt;Me: If you want a tech dispatched I'll need your account number or at least your address

&gt;Cust: STOP WASTING MY TIME AND GET SOMEONE HERE NOW

&gt;Me: Can I at least grab your name?

&gt;Cust: YOU DON'T NEED MY NAME, JUST FUCKING FIX IT YOU IDIOTS 

&gt;Me: Lady, you're asking me to send a tech out and refusing to give me an address to send him, and i don't even know your name. Give me something to work with...

&gt;Cust: YOU DON'T NEED MY INFORMATION I GAVE IT TO YOU WHEN YOU SIGNED UP WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO HARD &lt;inaudible screams&gt; 

&gt;Me: Is there anything else I can assist with today? I'm not wasting anymore time. You've made it clear you don't want to work with me so I'm going to terminate the call now.

&gt;Cust: WAIT! My name is Carol!

&gt;Me: Well you have yourself a wonderful day Carol. *click*

Told the supervisor just in case, shot me a cheeky grin and said to jeep up the good work. 

How hard is it to at least be respectful to ther person you want to help you?

EDIT: I will be uploading more of my interactions with these oh so wonderful customers when I get the time. I also have a pretty large backlog of stories that come to mind at my older job in the electricity industry. Stay tuned my dudes!

EDIT 2: ""Jeep it up"" stays. For good."
