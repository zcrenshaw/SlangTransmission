"We've tried nothing, and we're all out of ideas!


This happened a little while ago, when I was covering someone's vacation in the Help Desk.

The call comes in at 8:00 AM.  

    Me: Thank you for call-  

&gt;Her: I don't know what it's going to take to get someone down here.  The printer needs a technician, and no one's come to fix it.

Great way to start the morning and the call.

    Me: Oh?  What's wrong with the printer?
&gt;Her: It won't print. It hasn't printed for TWO MONTHS.  AND NO ONE HAS COME TO FIX IT.

I get the printer information (asset tag, display name in AD, location) and a cursory glance reveals no previous incident reports on the specific printer.

    Me: Sorry to hear that, has this issue been previously reported?

I don't want to issue a second ticket for the same problem, for obvious reasons.

&gt;Her: No, I don't think so.  But it hasn't been working since May, and someone needs to get down here immediately.  We can't work if we can't print.

I look up the printer in AD. There are 246 queued jobs, and the printer is reporting ""Out of Paper"".

Seriously.

    Me: Is the printer displaying any errors?
&gt;Her: Yes.

    Me: And?
&gt;Her: Let me go look.

So I wait about 5 minutes, then hear her shuffling back to her desk.

&gt;Her: Says ""Out of Paper""

    Me: Does it have paper in it?

&gt;Her: I didn't check.  Do you want me to go look?

        Me: Yes.  If there is paper in there, take it out and put it back in. Maybe the tray sensor is acting up.

Wait another 5 minutes.

&gt;Her: There wasn't any paper.

/facepalm

&gt;Her: How long is it going to take to get someone up here to refill the paper?

Wut.

    Me: Ma'am, we don't refill paper trays.  That's on you guys to do it.  Go fill it with paper, and call back if that doesn't resolve the issue.  There's some other things we can try.


&gt;Her: *long, exasperated sigh* I don't even know what we pay you people for if you won't come when we need help. *click*.

If some of you are wondering, no, I did not clear out the 246 jobs in queue.  The individual departments are responsible for ordering their own paper and toner cartridges, so it's a little bit of /r/pettyrevenge as well."
"No, that's not what we asked for...but thanks.


Hi guys, I'm loving this sub. Please keep up the good work. 

I'm a dev now, but I used to be part of the support team so I'm still friendly with the lads and ladies that work up there and I always say hello when I'm passing through. Today was no exception, and as I approached the helpdesk I noticed they were in unusually high spirits for a group of people who, as we all know, do a job that is both thankless and soul destroying.

&gt; What's all the giggling about?

I inquired, and they proceeded to tell me what had just happened. And now I'll tell you. 

We ($ourcompany) supply a large supermarket with tills (cash registers) for their  staff restaurants. Let's call them $bigshop to save them any embarrassment. We'd sent them a new till, to replace one with a fault, and as is standard, once the replacement was up and running, we'd ordered them to return the faulty till. The next day, via courier, we received a parcel containing a mobile phone. Something wasn't right, this was a mistake, so we got on the phone to $bigshop and told them what was up

&gt;$ourcompany: You were supposed to send us a till, but you've sent us a mobile phone instead.

&gt;$bigshop: Oh sorry, that must have been some kind of mistake, we'll put it right straight away.

The very next day, $bigshop sent us a chocolate fountain.

We're now trying to work out what we need to request from $bigshop for them to send us some skewers, a bag of marshmallows, and a selection of fresh fruits. "
