"Just because she looks good in a bikini does not mean she can't Tech.


About 14 years ago, with Christmas rush fast approaching, I worked at an executive gift company whose primary niche was laser marking their product with the corporate logo *and* personalizing each piece with the customer's name. And these items were shipping like mad. The company had grown 4X the first year and 3X the second year while I was there.

We were having our busiest Christmas ever. We had completely overloaded our primary laser marking service provider, but we were prepared. We had purchased two of our own machines, thinking that their six machines and our two machine should be able to handle the overflow of the season.

As Christmas was approaching, we hit full speed with a lot of serious-sized orders for some national brands. Lots of happy clients. Boss now has Two Porsches (no more Toyota!). We're screamin along, but the service supplier for the lasers is falling woefully behind. I mean, there's NO way we're going to make these deadlines.

So the boss takes me aside and asks me to do for the lasers what I did for the rest of the company: Tech it up so we can maximize everything. My GF had been working with our lasers, after I trained her ""quick"" and she took off with it. So I went back down to that department that I really had not needed to be involved in for some time to see what she thought we could do about ""full speed ahead!""

She did some quick calculations (X per minute ... hour ... day) and told me that if we hire on, she can make it happen with triple shifts and we can ""by far"" outpace the suppliers equipment speed and probably do the same amount with our two that he does with all six of his.

We hire on. The laser room never rests. They are always running. The cooling systems are good for the temp of the lasers, but the room they are in is *stupid* hot. They bring in cardboard cutouts of palm trees, and photos of beaches for the walls and start wearing bikinis while cutting with the lasers! Cute, but my only concern is: Are they getting it done? And yes. They are On Schedule. Cool. We're getting close to Christmas. A couple weeks away from ""last shipment possible"" at Fedex.

And then they died. In the middle of a shift. They just wouldn't mark reliably. They were tossing marks everywhere. Nothing helped. We called support (in CA, and we're in FL) and spent hours. We're a full day behind now. The boss gets on the phone with the manufacturer and spends $6k to get someone to fly down from Chicago who can Build the dang things ... right now. He arrives next morning with his little suitcase tool chests and a smile.

I meet him bright and early at the front getting out of his cab. He reassures me that he can fix anything that can be wrong with these bad boys, and he'll not leave without fixing them. He cleaned. He tweaked. He asked us for ideas and hints about what we observed before they died. I brough my GF in on the discussion because she was running them. Plus this is day three, and we're panicking, we've been down four days, deadline is in serious jeopardy.

Then the unspeakable happens: I see this guy heading for a taxi with his cases. Of course we had the conversation about ""But you can fix anything ..."". Then I demand a refund and he declines, since he 'cleaned this, and tweaked that'. Of course, I called American Express on the Boss's behalf and then AmEx called the owner of the Laser company, and the owner called the tech (who was not yet in the cab, that happened pretty freakin' fast) who informed me that we had just been refunded.

My GF sees this guy leaving, and heads back to her office and snags the manuals the guy left in the laser room. She didn't come home until ""stupid"" late (I was unconscious, after taking care of the kids while awaiting Mommy). In the morning, she goes to work with me after we drop off kids and asks me to meet her in the boss's office. He's there, she drops a circuit board on his desk and says ""I need permission to get three new, upgraded, copies of this board, cuz it's our problem.""

She had gone over the specs, checked the net for references on every component she could find, and centered on the software itself. Then she called the software company and *talked to the owner because he was freakin' there at Midnight*! He said that what she was describing (random markings after a heavy run with a system that's not very old), could be an unshielded circuit board. And that several manufacturers, over the years, had ""cheaped out"" on several of the boards. She should check to see if all the boards in this unit are shielded.

So she researched each of the boards in the boxes until she found it: The board that managed the automatic adjustment of the Power for the beam (how hard to hit each pop, which gets adjusted a lot during the cutting of a logo), was not shielded. So she took the board out and cut one of the logos ... manually adjusting the hit for each cut. Of course, instead of 12 seconds, it took several minutes to mark the item. But it was perfect. Without that board.

She said she had found a place we could order them from that could get them shipped out by messenger. We got them later that afternoon. And we got back to work.

That same day, one of our team members suffered a horrible car accident. He survived, but he looked seriously beat the crap out of. Good kid, too. His sister, who was also a team member, opted to stay by his side for a couple days. So we were down two operators. 

So I started taking graveyard shifts. We worked out butts off and got the last shipment to Fedex on the last day of ""if it doesn't go out today, it will be delivered after Christmas"". We got there at 4:59PM. They close at 5PM. I got the trolley set up and loaded up with stuff and headed inside. GF forgot her purse in the car and went back for it as I entered the door. A City Cop closed the door as I went through. And locked it. And stood guard. My GF and several other people bounced off the door shortly thereafter, and the Guard told all of them, in no uncertain terms ""Go Away, we're closed"". And continued to stand guard.

The line took almost 45 minutes to complete. The driver for the truck was literally standing by the desk awaiting the last product to get loaded on and head out.

But we made deadline.

And before you ask: *NO* The boss did not give her any of that $6k she saved us. He said ""thanks"" and moved on.

Oh: And she's *still* my GF, but he's not our boss, and she now has a degree and certifications.

TL;DR: Got our own marking lasers to supplement our vendor's capacity. Busiest season ever, they went down. Manufacturer charged us $6k to fix them, but couldn't. So my GF grabs the manuals and fixes them by doing proper research and finding out that the manufacturer ""cheaped out"" on one of the circuit boards. Got a $6k refund, though, and made deadline by about 5 seconds.
