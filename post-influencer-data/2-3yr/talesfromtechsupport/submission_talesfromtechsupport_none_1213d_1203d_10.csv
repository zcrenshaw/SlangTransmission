"This server is too critical to move it!


This is a story from my traineeship. We had an MS Project server that was actively used by many people from our company. Project leaders, sales, developers.. Everyone.  
So it happens that we finally got a new nice server room, with decent AC, redundant power lines, no carpet on the floor, etc. The last server that needed to be moved into this room was the MS Project server.  
The movement date got postponed again and again as, surprise!, it was too critical to move it. Each time we would schedule a movement appointment someone would say: ""Yeah, but I have my deadline on that day. I need it."" even when we switched the timeframe to weekends it was like: ""Yeah.. But.. You know.. I wanted to work on that weekend to finish something important.""  
So, our Head of IT got pissed, and here is how he solved the situation:  
  
&gt; **Head of IT:** /u/Barserver, follow me, take my phone. If it rings, answer the call and just say I'm on it.  
&gt; **Me:** Uh.. Huh? What? Err.. Okay.  
&gt; *Taking his phone, walking behind him to the old server room.*  
&gt; **Head of IT:** Ok, remember: Only say I'm on it. NOT what I'm doing. Understood?  
&gt; **Me:** Understood.  
&gt; *Head of IT starts to cleanly shutdown the MS Project server, removes all cables and starts putting it on our small transport cart.*  
&gt; Phone rings for the 1st time.  
&gt; **Me:** Hi, yes, we know the server is down. Head of IT is on it. No, no. I can't give him the phone he's busy fixing it. I'm taking his calls to let him work. Yes, we will notify you when it's working again. Bye.  
&gt; Repeat this for like 10 other calls.  
&gt; *Head of IT and me arrive at the new server room. He puts the server back into, connects all cables, powers it up, verifies that everything works.*  
&gt; **Head of IT:** Done. Finally. After 3 fucking months. Why can't these people accept a scheduled 30min maintenance window, but a 30min unscheduled downtime?  

And that's the way I learned how to move servers that are just ""too critical"" to be moved.  
Surprisingly no one asked ever again why we never scheduled another date to move the server. Not even after the old server room was renovated and used as the companies ""recreation room"" (kicker, food, comfy couch, etc.). I explained it to myself that people generally just don't care HOW it is done. They just want that it does what they need. This time we used this for our advantage."
"""Do you think I'm STUPID?""


This was years ago when I was still a support tech and people still used Overhead projectors.  The overheads were in the corner of every class room, and people would wheel them into the middle of the room and use them.

So, this lady has a bulb break on her mid class, I go up and change it.  She's kind of salty, but whatever.  6 or 7 minutes of downtime, tops, before she could continue.

Next week she calls again, fucking FURIOUS.  ""IT'S NOT WORKING AGAIN.""

""Uh...who is this?""

""I'm in E220 and the projector is broken again!""

""Ah, well it could be the bulb let me run up and check.""

""you just changed the bulb, and said it should be fixed!""

""Let me just come up and check.""

So I go up there and she is arms crossed PISSED at me.  ""Explain to me why this projector won't work, after you told me you'd fixed it!""  In front of her whole class.

""M'am, you have to plug it in.""

""It IS plugged in,"" she says, pointing out the surge protector, ""Do you think I'm stupid?!""

""M'am that's just a surge protector, you have to plug the other end into the wall.""

Entire class bursts into laughter. I plug it in, overhead comes on, and I head towards the door, ""Let me know if you have any more problems!""

She did not reply."
