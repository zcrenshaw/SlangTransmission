"""My data hasn't been working for 20 minutes and I want compensation.""


So I had a customer call me up in mobile tech support with the problem that his data wasn't working for 20 minutes, pretty quickly I find out why; he had accidentally turned off his data on the phone menu (which happens a lot but usually the customer goes ""oops silly me""). So this customer starts demanding that he want's compensation for his time without service and being very rude about it. After a couple of minutes he's not taking this is not something we did, but his mistake as a answer, so I get an idea, I tell him I'm going to go speak to my manager. I went up to my manager, explain what's happening, he says the customer's being ridiculous and I said, 

&gt;""Listen I have this idea for him, are you okay with this?"" then explain my idea.

&gt;""Are you kidding? Let me get on call listening before you go back, I wanna hear this.""

I go back to the phone, he gave me the thumbs up that he was ready to listen and I proceed.

&gt;""Right sir, I just had a word with my manager and I've managed to swing something for you, so let's break this down, you pay us 39.99 a month for 3 services; calls, texts and data, so let's divide your bill by 3 that give us 13.33, so let's divide further by 30 days to gives 44 pence for your daily data, now you had your data turned off for 20 minutes but for the purpose of this I'll round it up to an hour so we just need to divide that 44 pence by 24 hours so that means your looking at compensation of 1.8 pence so let's just say 2.""

I looked over at my manager during and he was covering his mouth laughing. Customer goes;

&gt;""Are you having a f@#king laugh?""

&gt;""No sir the math is there.""

&gt;""............Go on then I'll take it""

"Why usernames matter


Some university in Germany, around the turn of the century. The physics department had quite a nice setup for the students: two rooms with terminals, in one room all machines were HP-UX, the other room had a dual boot option: WindowsNT or Linux. All the userdata is stored on the server and accessible from all systems.

At the beginning of term the new students had their accounts created by one of the student supervisors on the Linux machines. $ME was the middle man between the student supervisors and the real techs who kept the system running. So I somehow got stuck with the support when the supervisors didn't know what to do.

One day a student---lets call her Samantha Melinda Butler---was send to me. She was quite into computing but had no idea why she had problems with her account. She was able to access her /home/ but she couldn't write to some files. On the other hand she had discovered that she could read nearly *all* the files in other peoples /home/---even in the accounts of some professors.

I asked her to log into her account and opened a terminal. I looked at her files, but everything seemed in order:

&gt; ls -als .vimrc

&gt;-rw-rw----   2 smb smb      1024 Jan 11 09:15 .vimrc

I tried to cd in my own /home/ and could access it. That shouldn't happen?!

&gt; ls -als .vimrc

&gt;-rw-rw----   2 cyrond cyrond      2048 Jan 19 07:42 .vimrc

She shouldn't be able to access this?!
Suddenly I looked at her username: she had asked for her initials. Samantha Melinda Butler---smb.

I su'ed in my own account:

&gt;groups

&gt;cyrond cdrom lpt smb

Samatha had become Samba and had all the rights of the ServerMessageBlock. And every user was a member of the group smb.

The student supervisor who had created Samantha's account didn't even get why this was his fault.

We later implemented this question into the test for new supervisors:

Richard Oot is a new student and wants a login created. As his username he wishes the first letter of his given name and his family name. How do you create his account on a Linux terminal?

Everybody who answered `adduser root` wasn't hired..."
