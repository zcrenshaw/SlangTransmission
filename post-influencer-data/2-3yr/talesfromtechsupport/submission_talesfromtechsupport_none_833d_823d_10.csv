"The derogatory term


A customer of ours has all their server and networking equipment support through us and the helpdesk  services from other company. I went on-site to investigate a network issue, when I was interrupted by a very aggravated employee of theirs. She insistent I would come fix some issue on her workstation like RIGHT NOW. I explain her I can't, we don't do their support. A following conversation unfolds:

    me: I'm sorry, but I don't do end-user cases
    her: WHAT did you just call me??!
    me: (puzzled) end-user?
    her: IS THAT SOME SORT OF A DEROGATORY TERM, HUH?

After that there's no calming her, she fumes on about being insulted and listens to no voice of reason. In the end I just ignore her and finish my work. The next day my boss comes to me about having received a complaint about my conduct. He says he's very surprised about the accusation as I'm normally pretty calm and professional about what I do. I explain him what had happened, my boss bursts into laughter and walks away."
