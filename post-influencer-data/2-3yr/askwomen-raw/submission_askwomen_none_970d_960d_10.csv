2,"Women who regularly go braless, how do people treat you?


So I'm just started to jump on the braless train, but I'm nervous. I feel like it's super obvious so I've only been braless under sweaters or multiple layers. When it starts to get warmer I'll probably get braver, but I'm curious about other women's experiences. Do most people notice? Do some people say things about it to you?"
3,"It's late night, dark outside, and you're walking on an empty sidewalk. I'm walking behind you for a pretty long time because I'm going in the same direction, do I speed up my pace to walk past you or slow down considerably?


I still haven't figured out the protocol here."
