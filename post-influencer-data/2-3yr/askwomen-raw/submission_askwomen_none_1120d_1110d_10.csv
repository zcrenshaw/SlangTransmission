0,"Why is it so common for women to say that they don't get along with ""other women""?


Over the years I've noticed that many women in my life have mentioned this to me, particularly my own mother who says it regularly. But also my stepmother, a few close friends and several acquaintances. I hear this a lot in passing too. It always strikes me as odd, I've never heard a guy say it except for a few times but it seems to be more of a ""thing"" for women.

I've also noticed some of the women who say this (from my experience anyway) often had other women friends which makes it extra confusing.

Can someone explain this ""phenomena""? I want to understand this issue better, any help would be appreciated. Have you ever said this? If so, what lead you to that line of thinking? Do you know women like this, what do you make of it? Thanks :)"

Things that bug you about men that you wouldn't normally speak out about. Here's your chance.

8,"2015 (yes you read that correctly) Askwomen Survey Results!


**Edit: It appears I have made a mistake in producing several of the charts, where rather than dividing by the number of *respondents* for a percentage, I divided by the number of *responses.* This will artificially lower the percentages in every chart where we allowed multiple answers. I hope to have this fixed this evening, but until then, it's worth noting the *shape* of the chart will not change. Apologies for the mix-up, I will remove this edit, or strike it out, when all is right with the world.**

Effected Results are:

* ~~Relationship Status~~

* ~~Pets~~

* ~~Employment Status~~

* ~~Peen length Preference~~

* ~~Peen Girth Preference~~

* Height Preference

* ~~Physique Preference~~

* ~~Facial Hair Preference~~

* ~~Sexual Assault Questions, Both Genders~~

Good afternoon, denizens of Askwomen!  Over a year ago (July 2015 to be exact), some of you may remember we put together a community survey for users to take part in.  At the time, we stated that the results would be released ""as soon as we could.""  While that's still *technically* true, that ambiguous time frame turned out to be longer than anyone expected.  

The moderator who was working on the survey output was kidnapped by aliens, and it was difficult to get started until a rescue mission involving the other moderators could be mounted for her rescue.  The government told us we aren't allowed to go into detail, but suffice it to say some of us will never be the same again.  On top of that, you can't exactly put a lot of pressure on someone who is doing the work on a volunteer basis (and just got kidnapped by aliens).  

Anyway, enough excuses, and there's an implicit promise when you fill out a user survey of this nature you will be able to see the results.  *However*, there are a couple things to keep in mind while combing through the following (very pretty, if I do say so myself) charts and graphs:

* This compilation of results was done with next to zero scientific rigor or method.  It was just for funsies, and one should not try to take from it any axiomatic proof of *anything*.  We had a total tyro who loved excel putting these together (me).

* In July, 2015 we had about 205,000 subscribers, or significantly less than we do now.  Not to mention, the subscribers themselves may have shifted over such a long time frame.  Much of the information within is likely unreliable *at best*.

And without further ado, the 2015 Askwomen demographic and preference survey!

**BASIC INFORMATION**

1\. [What type of contributor are you?](http://imgur.com/a/krCY3)

2\. [What gender were you assigned at birth?](http://imgur.com/a/2MAQS)

3\. [What gender do you identify as?](http://imgur.com/a/UcSWa)

4\. [How old are you?](http://imgur.com/a/XgIty)

6\. [What is your current country of residence?](http://imgur.com/a/FdW5o)

7a. [What is your ethnicity?](http://imgur.com/a/HeDKR)

This particular question was very difficult to work with.  Turns out, when you don't restrict people to check boxes and fill-ins they give you what you're asking for.  And people don't fit into neat boxes.  So rather than try and bully the responses into a pie chart, I've posted the full list, along with percentages.

7b\. [Is your ethnicity the majority where you live?](http://imgur.com/a/5YPWI)

8\. [What are your religious beliefs?](http://imgur.com/a/md5bb)

9\. [What is the highest level of education you've received?](http://imgur.com/a/EROb8)

**SEX AND RELATIONSHIPS**

10\. [What is your sexual orientation?](http://imgur.com/a/Fhngc)

18\. [What is your annual household income? USD](http://imgur.com/a/63j9r)

19\. [What is your relationship with feminism/egalitarianism/etc?](http://m.imgur.com/qjKLI2f) -- Edited. Originally I accidentally divided by total number of responses instead of total number of respondents. This artificially lowered the displayed percentages. It should be fixed now. 

20\. [FISCALLY, where do you fall on the political spectrum?](http://imgur.com/a/xqUL6)

21\. [SOCIALLY, where do you fall on the political spectrum?](http://imgur.com/a/mPeoB)

**MALE PREFERENCE QUESTIONS**

These questions had a gate in front of them, asking if the person taking the survey was interested in answering a few questions about preferences regarding men.  If the user was not a gay man or a straight/bisexual woman, they would have the option to say the topic did not interest them and they would skip past this section.  They would not be included in the percentages.

22\. [Ideal penis length, inches.](http://imgur.com/a/RFCzS)

23\. [Ideal penis girth, inches.](http://imgur.com/a/YHURt) -- [Refrence pictures (SFW)](http://m.imgur.com/a/JVIYj)

24\. [Circumcision preference.](http://imgur.com/a/C5ZWE)

25\. [Height of partner preference.](http://imgur.com/a/IJ16c) -- More than one answer allowed here. 

26\. [Body type preference.](http://imgur.com/a/RhJda) -- [Refrence pictures](http://m.imgur.com/a/cHmI5)

27\. [Facial hair preference.](http://imgur.com/a/HJgTk)

**SEXUAL ASSAULT EXPERIENCES**

The following questions were gated with a message asking if the user was okay answering questions about different types of sexual assault they had experienced. If the user did not wish to answer the question, they were automatically entered as ""no answer.""  Their reasons for not answering are their own. 

28\. [I have experienced the following -- Women.](http://imgur.com/a/TuOHv)

29\. [I have experienced the following -- Men.](http://imgur.com/a/N02hP)"
