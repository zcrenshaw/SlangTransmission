Thank you to everyone who contributed! I've read pretty much all the comments and your responses are very insightful. To summarize, the most common replies were as follows:

* Penis size and muscles, car, salary (provided you can support yourself) don't matter. Height, for the most part, also isn't important.
* Don't tell women* how to dress/present themselves, nor give your unsolicited opinion about their makeup etc. They don't want your validation/approval either.
* Never, and I mean never ever, tell a woman* ""Guys don't like it when girls...""

*obviously not representative of every single woman in the world."

13,"Women who have a cute ""kid name""? What is it like as an adult?


By ""kid name"" I mean any cute name that parents give to a child without thinking about how is has to be used as an adult. If I wasn't clear I mean a legal name.

Teddie would be an example of a cute kid name.
