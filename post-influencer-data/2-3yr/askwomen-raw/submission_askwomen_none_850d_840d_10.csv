0,"Hey ladies, when's the last time you laughed by yourself while eating a salad?


Stock photos and advertisements show it happening all the time, so it MUST be common!  When's the last time you sat around by yourself, laughing and eating salad?"
1,"Women who've been denied an abortion and made to carry an unwanted pregnancy: what was it like for you?

2,"Women who live abroad, what is something of that country you can't get accustomed to?


"
3,"What is your fuckboy story?


I'm kinda devastated right now, I really liked a guy and thought he liked me back too. He took my virginity now he's cold and distant. I just wanna hear your experiences with them. 

Edit: I appreciate all your replies and advices. Thank you so much they all made me feel so much better!"
4,"I see a lot of crazy ex stories on here, Askmen, relationships, etc. But does anyone have a story of ""The one that got away?""


This could be anything. Maybe distance messed it up, maybe you waited to long, maybe you didn't treat them right, maybe family sabotaged it. I'm just genuinely curious as to what might have happened. "
5,"Women who have placed their child for adoption, what was your experience like?


It's been 20 months since I placed my baby in her forever home, and while I almost always feel positively about my decision, some days (like today) are very hard for me. 
It can be very isolating being a birth mother, so I'd love to hear about other women's experiences :)"
6,"My cats are plainly tired of me asking them if they are silly cats. What kind of conversations do you hold with your pets?

7,"Women who chose to have a child without a partner through adoption, sperm donation, etc., can we hear your story?


I'd love to hear how you decided to do it, why you decided to do it, and how it's worked out for you!"

"
9,"Women who have masculine features (eg. broad shoulders, tall stature etc.), how do you deal with self acceptance/confidence?


Hi everyone. I hope this post doesnt offend anybody (i truly believe everybody is beautiful in their own way). Ever since I was young, people around me would point out my broad shoulders and height (im barely 5'6 guys) and made me feel awkward and unfeminine. Ive always wished I was born a petite and small lady but I guess genetics thought otherwise. So, ladies of reddit, what are your experiences like? Do you often feel unfeminine due to the way you look? "
10,"What's the weirdest compliment you've been given by a guy?


"
11,"Women who've dated both men and women, do you feel the beauty expectations were different? If so, how?


Sorry for that mess of a title.  Basically I'm asking if you feel that the men and women you've dated have had different expectations regarding things like hair removal, makeup, skin/hair care, etc.  And regardless of the explicit expectations, do you feel more compelled to meet a certain standard when you're dating one gender over the other?"
12,"What do you think about divorce parties? Tacky and inappropriate, or awesome?
