1,"Does anyone else feel like they are constantly buying clothes but still feel like they don't have anything to wear? What am I doing wrong in my shopping?


I feel like every season rolls around and I'm scrambling to buy items.  Its hot out now and all of a sudden its like all of my dress clothes for work are all long sleeved.  Do I suck at shopping or does this happen to everyone?"

5,"What do you think of this idea that there are ""no truly straight women""?


I've come across this a lot and it seems like a highly loaded assumption to me. I'm not invalidating the experiences of women who genuinely are attracted to women but this kind of absolutist talk rather frustrating. I find it hard to believe there aren't at least a lot of ""actually"" straight women - whatever ""actually"" means in context. Finding a woman a little attractive in a specific context doesn't invalidate being straight. I'm a straight man and I doubt I'llever have sex with another man but sometimes I find other men a little attractive. Not in a sexual way; just in an admiration kind of way.

What do you lot think?"

But I think there have to be some women out there who made a conscious choice not to have children. What brought you to making that decision? How has it impacted your life and relationships with others, especially family?"
