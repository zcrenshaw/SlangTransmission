13,"If your pet was a fully cognizant human for a week, what activities or experiences would you take them to do.


* They have all of the same language skills you have and are around the same age as you in all other motor/social development as well.
* We're talking activities experiences so you can't just sit them down for a week and tell them to stop peeing on the closet door, you have to actually *do* something with them (feel free to talk to them there though- but do it in your own time, not in this question)
* If you have more than one pet, you can have different answers for different pets- or you can have the same answer for all your pets. If you have a fishtank full of oscars and want to hop on a bus as a group to Saltzburg so y'all can sing Lonely Goatherd together- totally ok.  
* Your pet has fully human smell, taste digestion and all that. So Ethyl lady is going to be eating differently than Ethyl the boa constrictor. "
