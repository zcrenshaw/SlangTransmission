0,"Ladies, I'm a bit drunk. Is there anything you just want to vent about? I will read and respond appropriately.


Seriously, I will listen and respond sympathetically.

I should be working on my thesis, but whatever.  

EDIT: I'm falling a bit behind because of the number of responses but I'm trying to get to everyone! Sorry if it takes a bit but I will do my best to respond to everyone.

EDIT EDIT: Okay it's almost 1AM here and I'm getting a visual aura as a precursor to a migraine so I'm not going to be able to carry on much longer, sorry to those who come late. I'm hoping others will pass on some sympathy and love. I'll answer a few more people before signing off. This was a wonderful experience and I hope everyone feels better soon, I know it's a tough time of year with the holidays.

EDIT THE THIRD: Time for bed. Be excellent to each other. "

10,"What are your tips to smell good?


And by smelling good, I mean people tell you, you smell good.  I'm asking for advanced level tips here, not basics like wearing fresh clothes. 

I'd like to smell like Oprah, who I'm told smells gooooood. But you can tell she is the type of person to use essential oils and whatnot. 

I'm asking because I just smell kinda neutral. But not attractive. I've smelled people who smell attractive, and that's something else.

**sorry if this vague and confusing, but this smelling good business is hard to describe. But you know it when you smell it."
