0,"MEGATHREAD: New Hampshire State Representative Robert Fisher (R) revealed to be founder of The Red Pill


So we've been seeing a number of new submissions regarding this topic, which makes perfect sense considering how personal this topic is to a lot of the reddit community, so we decided to just go ahead and create a megathread.  To catch everyone up, [New Hampshire State Representative Robert Fisher (R) was discovered by The Daily Beast and reporter Bonnie Bacarisse to be the founder of The Red Pill subreddit](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/25/the-republican-lawmaker-who-secretly-created-reddit-s-women-hating-red-pill.html).  If you happen to be (blissfully) unaware, The Red Pill is a subreddit that has faced accusations of supporting misogynistic behavior, advice for rapist, and general/casual homophobia and transphobia.  The article goes on to detail multiple disturbing quotes from his online handle, regarding women's sub par intelligence, the ""good"" aspects of rape (for the rapist), his empire of a couple of computer repair stores, and the sexualization of 15 year old girl's breasts.  

UPDATE:  [Looks like both the House Speaker and Minority Leader are calling for his resignation](http://www.wmur.com/article/state-lawmaker-admits-saying-some-injudicious-things-about-women/9562347)
