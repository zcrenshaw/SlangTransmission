0,"Welcome to the Salty Spittoon, how tough are ya?


No weenies allowed. 
"
1,"What grooming habits do you keep secret from your SO?


My sister has thin, delicate eyebrows and her boyfriend/ father of her child has no idea she plucks the hell out of a thick black unibrow to get. My boyfriend has no idea I use an acne wash and sugar scrub on my butt every time I shower (I have no issues with zits on my butt but I have a huge fear of them) nor does he know that I shave my entire body. Anybody else have secrets?"
2,"Do any of you regret motherhood? Women 40-50+ with no children, how is your life?


Becoming a mother scares me. I'm afraid of losing myself, of the commitment, and the toll it will take on my relationship, and I've never been particularly maternal. But I'm also afraid of regretting a decision to never have children when I'm older.

So AskWomen, please tell me your stories honestly. You may love your children more than anything in this world, but do you regret it? Do you sometimes wish you had a different life?"
3,"Ladies, using only GIFs, can you describe your favorite way to get the attention of someone you're interested in?


Points for creativity. Have fun!"
4,"Deaf women, what do you wish more hearing people knew about living as a deaf person and/or deaf culture.


Follow up: do you think more hearing people should learn ASL (or whatever regional sign language pertains to them)?"
5,"What's with all the STEM worship on reddit?


[deleted]"
6,"How did your body change in your 20s?


This question hasn't been asked in a while (to my knowledge).

Did you go through a ""second puberty""? Body shape changes, face changes, etc. Around how old were you?

It's always interesting to hear what other ladies have gone through! (Personally, I'm hoping my hips get wider in the next few years.)"
7,"Women of Reddit, what was something your SO did that made you want to kiss them immediately after they did it?


"
8,"So, it looks like Britain has officially voted 'Leave' in the 'Brexit' referendum-- AskWomen, what do you think?


Pleased? Displeased? Why? Tell us your thoughts.


To be honest, I am quite surprised. But then, I'm also the girl who thought that there was no way Trump would ever be taken seriously as a US presidential candidate, so shame on me I guess. "
9,"What's that tidbit about yourself that always makes Reddit pounce on you like a rabid downvote dog?


"
10,"What's your favorite part of Disney's ""Mulan""?


We all know that Mulan is awesome, but what's the most awesome part in your opinion?"
11,"What's more of a turn off? A man who dances like an idiot or a man who doesn't dance at all. What are your thoughts on the matter?


"
12,"What game(s) should I get from the steam summer sale?


Interested in women's opinions of the best games to try!"
