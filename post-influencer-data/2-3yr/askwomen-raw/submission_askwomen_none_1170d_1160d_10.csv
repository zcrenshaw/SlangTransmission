0,"Let's talk GREEN flags. What are some early (1-3 dates) signs that the person is the real deal?


We talk about red flags a lot, but what about greens? What little things tip you off about a person that gives you the feeling that they're a good person, and it's not an act?"
1,"If a guy wants to be your lover, does he got to get with your friends? And why?

2,"What are some feel-good films I can watch that have little to no romantic story?


Films like Little Miss Sunshine, The Fundamentals of Caring... I can't think of any others right now but that sort of thing. Maybe films that focus on relationships between friends or family? 

My boyfriend and I are living in separate countries at the moment and I miss him/am generally down about other bits of my life. I can't handle too much romance in a film at the moment.

Edit: WOW thank you all so much for your suggestions! I wanted to reply to everyone but there are so many of you.  Thanks though! These films should keep me busy/wholesome-happy. Lots of amazing suggestions. Some films I have seen and loved, some films I will need to watch again, some films I've been meaning to watch and some I've never heard of. I hope other people find this list helpful too. 

Lots of love to everyone and anyone that needs lots of love right now xx"
3,"Ladies, tell us about a time you ran into an ex, and realized you ""lost"" the breakup.


I feel like the phrasing of the title's weird, but I'm essentially asking if anyone's ever run into an ex, and realized that they (seemingly) had their shit together, while you had stagnated/declined? 

We often hear about people running into exes who've accomplished nothing, or for whom their lives look unappealing, but we never hear about people realizing that they ARE those exes. Did you change your life after that encounter? Did you come to the conclusion that you're happy with your life as it is? What was your experience?"
4,"When have you run into an Ex and thought ""I won."" or ""I dodged a bullet.""?


What are you hindsight stories? The times you ran into an ex lover and thought ""what was I *thinking*?""

We all have those moments of validation. Give me yours."
5,"What's that one super embarrassing thing you did that keeps you up at 1am cringing about it years later?

6,"Muslim women, do you wear a hijab or burqa (or any other head garment)? And how does it make you feel?

7,"Women who have traveled, what was (if any) the biggest culture shock you've experienced or seen?


Edit: well damn! From my point of view, this thread blew up! Haha thanks for all your responses!"
8,"If you had an emotionally abusive mom, when was your breaking point that you stopped taking it?


Mine was when I got a good job like she always said she wanted me to and it still wasn't enough. She made fun of the job I'd gotten. I just....lost it. "
9,"Women who said ""no"" when their SO asked them to get married: how did they take it and did you tell them why?

10,"What is sex like when you and your partner are trying to get pregnant? Are you actively or sub-consciously thinking 'make a baby' ?


"
11,"Did anyone have kids for the purpose of making their parents happy? If so, how do you feel about your decision?


Edit: I want to add that I'm in no way looking to judge or criticize those who have gone through this. I'm very interested in other stories and the outcomes. I don't have kids myself since I just graduated, but when the topic comes up when talking to my parents, they feel so excited about the idea of having grandkids and when I let them know that this is something I might not want, they get pretty sad. I think about ""what if"" when they aren't ok with my decision, and of course I don't like to cause them this type of pain but while I don't know what will happen in the future, this was something that came up to my mind and I wanted to read other people's experiences.
