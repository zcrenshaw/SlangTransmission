0,"How do you command respect at work when you're also a friendly, bubbly person?


Follow-up: who are some highly respected women role models who also have this kind of personality?

I'm in the tech industry and I recently found out a few interns respect me a LOT less than other male engineers, and it's made me rethink the persona I've been apparently projecting at work. 

I do excellent work, but now I realize my coworkers are interpreting me as a nice girl but not someone competent to fulfill a leadership role or a demanding workload. 

I know the answer is ""be more confident, less bubbly, less self depreciating jokes"" but I don't want to turn entirely into the tough tech lady persona. "

I turn 25 this year and am in a committed relationship. Neither of us want children, now or ever. The thought of being pregnant makes me physically ill. I have ZERO plans to ever give birth to a child. And yet...everyone that learns I plan to have a tubal this year launches in to a speech about how I'll change my mind, what if you want kids later, don't do that to yourself, wait longer.
