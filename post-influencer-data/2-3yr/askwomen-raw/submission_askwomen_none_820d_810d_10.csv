4,"Ladies, what do you think are the biggest (physical) benefits of being a woman compared to being a man?


I've seen a question asking the opposite of this (aka what are the benefits of being a man) and the answers were interesting (being stronger, taller, peeing standing up, not having periods, ..), but now I wonder what do you think are the physical benefits of being a woman. I'm a guy and the most obvious one to me is that women live longer than men (on average anyway).. but since this is AskWomen what do you think are the biggest advantages?"
5,"What are the early signs of a one sided relationship?


Edit : thank you for all of your responses. I've been having a hard time dealing with past and current relationships and realizing which ones actually are good for me. I tend to think I'm being too pessimistic or needy or intense even while my gut tells me I deserve better. Your answers have been really eye opening and I appreciate them very much. Glad this also helped others realize that they deserve better too! We all do. "
