0,"What do you think a lot of people on Reddit are straight-up lying about?


"
1,"What is something single men don't own but they should in consideration of female guests?


"
2,"Ladies, what lies are your friends/acquaintances living on social media?


"
3,"What was your favorite AW post that was clearly a front for a fetish or sexual fantasy?


"
4,"Black women of Reddit, what should a white woman who is raising a black child know?


Assuming in the US, but I wanted to keep it broad. "
5,"Does the queer female gaze differ from the straight male gaze? If so, how?


I hope I'm using those terms correctly! What I mean is: do the things that cater to straight men (e.g. sexuality in games and movies; Playboy/page 3 girls; porn; Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition) tend to be appealing to queer women too? 

If not, how do they differ? (And do you have ideas about why?) "
6,"In what ways have you screwed up as a parent?

7,"What are your three biggest red flags for a new relationship/friendship?


"
8,"Single women 35+ who want children: How do you feel about your situation?


I realize that we live in 2016 and you don't need to be in a relationship to have a child. But this is more for people who want to have a family with a child and the child's biological father.
 "
9,"As a police officer, in day to day interactions how could I make you more comfortable?


I deal with different kinds of  people everyday.  I feel as though I do well, however I am wondering how I could improve day to day interactions in your eyes. 
 
I plan to cross post this to askmen as well.  

Also if you have any questions for me feel free to ask.

"
11,"What experience have you had with a health practitioner making an inappropriate comment to you?


"
12,"What are some female specific LPTs you have to share?


For instance, when the liners of your bra or swimsuit top fall out, replace them by accordion folding them to fit them through the annoyingly small hole, then once they are in the cup, they easily reform to their natural state.
