"What is up with the low quality AMAs recently?


This sub seems like it is really going down hill."
"Hey Reddit. I'm a cybersecurity professional. I've done pentests, and had pedophiles jailed. Ask me anything


Do it"
"30, Teacher, currently sitting a coffee shop and I'm 99% sure I'm going to be alone forever. AMA

"[AMA Request] Someone who has dropped everything, stopped being friends with people, and moved to somewhere completely new just to start a new life.


Title pretty much says it all. I've always wanted to do this, and was curious if anyone actually has.

Some questions:
1. Were you planning it for awhile?
2. Why did you do it?
3. Did you change your name or phone number, etc?
4. Did you tell your family?
5. Did you do it despite others' wishes?
6. Did you tell people once you got to the new place?
7. How did you get a job and make new friends?
8. Do you regret it?
9. How has it changed you?
10. Did you try to be a different person in the new place?

Thanks so much!"
"AMA request: Anyone who was a private/solider under Bob Ross when he was an officer


As fans know, Bob Ross is a ""master of relaxation"" which makes his history as a screaming officer in the Air Force unbelievable. I'd like to see if Reddit has any uncles/parents/grandparents that knew him back then. I'd love to learn some stories about one of my heros."
"I have just got back from a trip to north korea. Feel free to AMA.

Australian  who has just come back from a 3 day trip to North Korea.

Feel free to ask any questions if you have them.
