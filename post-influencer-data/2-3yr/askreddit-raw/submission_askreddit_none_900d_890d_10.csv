28,"[Mod Post] An important announcement about the future of AskReddit


Hello, everyone!

As some of you may be aware, we recently passed the 16 million subscriber mark here on /r/AskReddit.  In fact, just in the last few days, we passed 16,500,000!  We're very grateful for all of you who subscribe to /r/AskReddit and make this possible.

16,500,000 is a lot of people.  In fact, we decided to do some research on some things that have fewer people than there are subscribers to /r/AskReddit.  The obvious answer, of course, is lesser subreddits like those losers on /r/pics (jk &lt;3).  But what we didn't realize at first was that there are more subscribers to /r/AskReddit than there are people in most countries!  That's right, if /r/AskReddit were a country, it would be in the top 100 for population size.  In fact, we would be the 69th largest, as it so happens, according to [wikipedia's most recent population statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations\)).  And we'd have a few hundred thousand on the next largest, Ecuador, and we'd be closing in on number 68, Guatemala, in population before long, too.

When we discovered this, we got to thinking.  If there are only 68 countries with more people than the subreddit... why not make our own country?  All of this ""If /r/AskReddit were a country, it would be the 69th largest"" stuff is cool, but you know what's even cooler?  Being the 69th largest country!

This brings us to our important announcement for today.  We're proud to announce that we have declared the sovereignty of the [Yam Republic](http://imgur.com/a/lKpRS)!  We hope that all of you will join us in forging a glorious future for this young nation.  I know you probably have some questions, so I'll try to pre-emptively answer them.

**Why is it called the Yam Republic?**

Well, calling it the Yam Dictatorship would have been ~~too obvious~~ not very nice, wouldn't it?

Oh, you meant why is it the *Yam* Republic as opposed to some other kind of republic?  Well, simply put, [we like yams.](/yam)  And we think that you guys do, too, based on the response to [Yam Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3rxnot/happy_yam_day_here_is_an_album_of_yam_memes_to/)!

**Yam Day?  What was that?**

Way back when there were only a measly 10,000,000 subscribers, /r/AskReddit had a [Yam Day celebration](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3ry1m0/what_is_up_with_this_whole_yam_thing_going_on/) when the sub hit the 10 million mark.  Not everyone was thrilled about Yam Day, of course, but plenty of yam lovers embraced it.  We're hoping you'll all do the same with the Yam Republic!

**So... where *is* the Yam Republic, anyways?**

So, it turns out that buying enough land for an entire country is expensive, and takes a lot of time.  Conquering some land seemed like a bad idea since we don't have much of an army yet.  We were gonna all declare sovereignty in our back yards, but it turns out the countries we live in tend to frown upon that.

So the short answer is that the Yam Republic doesn't really have much of a physical location yet.  But thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we aren't going to let that stop us.

For the time being, until we can obtain suitable land, the Yam Republic will be headquartered on /r/YamRepublic.  There, we'll get the government set up so that once we have a physical location, we'll be ready to hit the ground running!  We choose to see this as a positive: anyone from anywhere in the world can join the Yam Republic in its early days without worrying about silly things like transportation.

**How do I join the Yam Republic?**

Just go to /r/YamRepublic and participate there!

**Are you guys [Serious] about this?**

Absolutely.  100%.  Why would you even need to ask?

---

**TL;DR:  AskReddit is making our own country!  Come join us on /r/YamRepublic and together, we can lead the Yam Republic to its rightful place in history!**"
