1,"What is the saddest detail about your life that no one knows?


Hello lovely people, so I've been going through as much of the comments that I possibly can and replying to all I come across. You've all been supportive and encouraging to each other which got me thinking. I'm wondering if I should start a YouTube channel where I can provide tips and advice to people across the world whether it's advice about school, clothes, family, relationships or to provide ways to cope with depression or anxiety... but I don't know, do you guys think it's a good idea? Also thank you all for the reddit gold wow it's soooo much. Thank you all so much it means a lot to me.

Edit: For those who said I should continue doing music, I released one of my older tracks which you can find here: https://soundcloud.com/lerick-2/shaq-thinking-bout-you-edit

Edit 2: I've been busy working on my relationship with my gf and rediscovering my passions such as: reading, music etc. I'm also responding to as much comments and messages as possible. I just want to thank you all for being supportive of each other and making this a wonderful thread."
