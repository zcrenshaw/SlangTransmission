Hey everyone!

We're already getting a lot of the same questions in /new so here's your megathread!

As the title suggests this particular debate will likely contain strong language and adult themes related to recent remarks by one of the candidates. Please remember to try keep discourse as civil as possible when you're discussing this debate, the polls, scandals involving sex, taxes, wikileaks, etc.

**Please keep all top level-comments as questions, to be answered by the child-comments.**

The purpose of the megathread is to serve as a sort of subreddit of its own—an /r/askreddit on the second US Presidential Debate.
