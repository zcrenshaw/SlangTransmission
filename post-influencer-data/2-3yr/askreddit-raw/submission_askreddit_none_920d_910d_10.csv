The link to the application can be found here. Most of the responses are limited to 500 characters, so please keep your responses concise. 

The application is composed of two parts: a questionnaire and a rules quiz. We will factor both parts into our decision but please don’t stress about the quiz. We don’t expect you to have a perfect understanding of the rules right now but this gives us a sense of where you are with the rules. You are welcome to refer to [the rules](/r/AskReddit/wiki/index), or any other resources, while completing the quiz.

Edit: This application was designed to work for most modern desktop and mobile browsers. If you are using internet explorer, or some obscure browser, I can't guarantee that it'll work. 

Edit 2: This application does not work with Reddit is Fun, as the app improperly detects part of the application to be a reddit post. Feel free to submit it from your mobile browser, or a desktop device, though.

Edit 3: The application period is now over, thanks to all that applied! If you are selected, you will receive a private message within a few weeks. "
