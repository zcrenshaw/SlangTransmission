11,"[Megathread] RIP 2016


[Carrie Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher) (60) has passed away after having a heart attack. She was best known for playing [Princess Leia Organa](http://static2.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Princess-Leia.jpg) in Star Wars. Last year she had a role in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  

We usually have a 2016 megathread and due to the recent celebrity passings, we have decided to include them in our 2016 reflection megathread. Please use this thread to ask questions from anything ranging from how your year has been, to outlook for the year ahead, to the celebrities we’ve lost this year.

All top-level comments (replies to the post rather than replies to comments) should contain a 2016 related question and the thread will function as a mini-subreddit. Non-question top-level comments will be removed, to keep the thread as easy to use and navigate as possible.

Here’s to a better 2017.

Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, and Yam Day are upon us.

With the holidays here, it's time for our holiday megathreads. They're a great place to discuss the holidays and they keep the sub normal for people who want to discuss things such as Pascal's principles of hydrostatics. Plus, one of our mods has a thing for [Disney](https://imgur.com/heYW2Hh). That mod prefers for the sub to be ready for a Disney post and too many holiday posts could impede that. 

All top-level comments (replies to the post rather than replies to comments) should contain a holiday related question and the thread will function as a mini-subreddit. Non-question top-level comments will be removed, to keep the thread as easy to use and navigate as possible.

While this thread is up, all other holiday posts will be removed.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays!
