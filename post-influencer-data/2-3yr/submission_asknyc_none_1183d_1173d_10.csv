"Best/worst IRL tourist questions?


This morning, I experienced a crap AskNYC question in real life. I had a tourist poke my shoulder (I had headphones on) and ask me where she should go on the subway map. When I asked where she was headed, she said ""nowhere, I don't care, anywhere"" and waved around East Harlem and the South Bronx, ""how about up here?"". While I was tempted to send her up there, we were on 8th Avenue and I didn't feel like going through the whole transfer spiel. She's lucky that laziness trumps cruel humor in the morning.

I asked her what her interests were. ""Nothing really"". I asked her what she did for fun when she's in her own area (she had an accent), and she had no answer. So I started shooting out ideas, and she decided that hiking sounded like a good one. I sent her up on the A to Fort Tryon and The Cloisters. I'd like to imagine where she would have ended up had she asked someone a little surlier than I."
"Bye.


Hi. I'm leaving after 10 years in the city to take care of a terminally ill family member. That said, I'm looking to make a bucket list of NYC stuff. My question is, if you were leaving, what would be on your NYC bucket list? "
