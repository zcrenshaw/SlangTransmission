"NSFW I used to work at brothels. AMA!


Several Brussels- and Antwerp-based brothels, actually, back in college, for 2 years."

"30 years old and have lost 230 pounds in 10 months thru diet/exercise. AMA


Someone on r/loseit made me aware that I could view all posts I've made on reddit by clicking on my user profile.

After seeing my first AMA 11 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/3k4uxt/im_30_years_old_and_435_pounds_ama/) and seeing comments about doing another AMA, I thought it would be a good time to do another one.

Nothing is out of bounds, so don't be afraid to ask.

Points of note:
- Have gone off all prescription maintenance medication
- Never had surgery or took supplements
- Did not follow a diet plan or specific exercise regimen
- Did join a gym
- Recently did my first 5K, finishing in under 31 minutes
- Learned a lot about myself and others"
"I recently found out I had a 12 year old son and met him! AMA


I just found out my girlfriend from 13 years ago had my son and now I'm learning to be a dad for the first time, it's scary business."
