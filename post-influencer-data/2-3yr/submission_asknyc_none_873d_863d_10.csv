"Biggest rip off in nyc?


Always asking about the best, but how about a list of what to avoid?  

I'll start:  I went to Shun Lee last weekend.  This is the place who allegedly invented Orange Beef back in the 70's.  They're in midtown.  Way over price for what you got.  Orange Beef was like $35.  I love me some dumpling but they were $12 for 4 fucking (prosperity quality) dumpling!  Waiters were pushy and not very buttoned up for the price you pay.  Definitely living on its reputation."
"You have $7. What would you order from a deli?


"
"Looking for the best authentic, ""hole in the wall"" restaurants for Ramen and Bahn Mi's. What are yours?


These are two of my favorite meals. Now that I'm back in NYC, I'm looking for the best authentic but inexpensive spots. Perhaps you know of some? If so, what are your favorite places to go?"
