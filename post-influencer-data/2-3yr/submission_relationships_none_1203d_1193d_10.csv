"[UPDATE] My [25F] professor [30M] asked me to go on a date after I graduate next month


[Here is the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lvz0t/my_25f_professor_30m_asked_me_to_go_on_a_date/)

Hi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go...

Anyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put ""next month"" in the title but realistically, I should have put ""next week."" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up.

First and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!!

So I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this:

""Mark,

First off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited. 

I just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :)

I wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all. 

Again, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. ""

(The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar)

Anyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there.

Saturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon.

We decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this.

Anyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now.

Thanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!
   
TLDR: Got a new job, graduated and went on a date with Mark. He's a good kisser. I'm happy."
"(Update) Both our parents [50s] have abandoned my [21M] sister [11F]. How do I give her peace of mind that I won't abandon her?


Thank you all. My OP from two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j12or/both_our_parents_50s_have_abandoned_my_21m_sister/

So besides reassuring her verbally continuously, making sure we do a lot of things together and being a good brother, I needed to get her into therapy and I found the right therapist for her. She's a psychologist who specializes in children's issues after divorce.

The only problem was money. I called both my parents and told them that I need to talk to them (separately) and told them that we need more money as she needs to get therapy and I want to do nice things for her and that's the least they owe us after everything. They were hesitant but eventually agreed. I'm now getting $500 more each month from my mother and $750 more from father and that is a real help. When we have extra money from what my parents give us I put it in a college fund for her and this extra money means that not only she can see a great therapist but now I can save more for her.

I also talked to a lawyer as a lot of you suggested to make sure we're getting the right amount of money and it seems that we do. Of course we could go on and get them to court and make everything happen through the legal system but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her. She's much safer and better off here than in their hands. Obviously the option is on the table if they decide to stop paying or reduce the amount.

And a couple of you suggested we do something symbolic which I liked a lot. So I bought two matching necklaces and had them engrave our names on them and told my sister that we're doing to wear these to remind ourselves that each of us will always be there for the other and we can count on each other.

We've already been to two sessions of therapy and I think things are good. The necklace has worked and she doesn't even want to take it off when she takes a shower.
   
**tl;dr**: I got her into therapy and got parents to pay for it. We're doing fun things together more often and we bought matching necklace with our names engraved to remind ourselves that we'll always be there for each other."
"I [18 F] left my laptop open and my sister [15 F] replaced everything in my ""Hobbies &amp; Passions"" section on my resumé with just ""garlic bread"" as a joke. I unknowingly sent it out to about 20-30 businesses and now I have no idea what to do about it.


Yes reddit, I know how hilarious this sounds and I promise you this is not a joke as I am genuinely freaking out right now. I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resumé I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others.

I (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies &amp; passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying ""garlic bread"".

Now, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resumé.

I came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resumé (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to ""garlic bread"" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total.

It was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resumé, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification.

My sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words ""I'm sorry"" definitely left her mouth.

Then she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like ""just a prank brah"" mentality but I'm having none of it.

I don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the ""garlic bread"" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob?

Technically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resumé-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resumé fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resumé? Should I just fucking move town at this point since I've clearly made a fool of myself already? Also, how do I talk to my parents or sister about her stupid spoilt bratty behavior?


   
TL;DR: My little sister changed my hobbies and passions section on my resumé to ""garlic bread"" as a joke and I sent it out to about 20/30 business in my town unknowingly. I have no idea how to fix this."
"UPDATE: I [27 F] want to propose to my boyfriend [27 M], but before that happens I want to give him something


[Link to the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kird3/i_27_f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_27_m_of/)

First off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread. 

I never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue.

Anyway.

I went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter. 

He was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great. 

Apparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect! 

Yeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it! 

I waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely. 

We were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift.

While he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future. 

The language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)   

So that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife!

God, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy! 

To all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks! 

**tl;dr: I proposed, he proposed back, we both said yes! He declined my offer of fully paid tuition fees for studying at university and the language course idea, and said he would much rather spend time with me abroad, just the two of us! Getting married in winter, so we're going to combine the honeymoon with the trip.**"
"[UPDATE] Me (21F) with my boyfriend (24M) he wants me to cut off contact with his brother because he defended me in an argument.


Original Post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lubms/my_21f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_he_wants_me_to_cut/]

Hi everyone. 

First of all, as I said in my edit on my original post I want to thank everyone who offered advice and support. I was amazed at the huge response I got, and while I couldn't reply to every comment I did read all of them. 

After R texted me, I replied to him asking if he had known my BF to behave like this with other girls in the past. 

Over the course of many texts it came out that he often yelled at and belittled his previous girlfriend in front of others, and some of his friends and family had suspicions about how far he was taking it. 

After the break up, the girlfriend posted some stuff on Facebook about how BF had hit her, said awful things to her and did other things like spying on her and deleting people from her phone behind her back. 

Initially when this happened R and his parents questioned BF, but he insisted that the physical abuse accusations where not true and that his EX was saying those things to cover up the fact that she had allegedly cheated on him. BF admitted to yelling at her but he told his family that she did the same and just as often. 

His family eventually accepted that, but R and his parents were always wary of BFs behaviour and R in particular had made a point to keep an eye on things. 

BFs ex apparently had also called R around 6 months after myself and BF had gotten together and asked him to help me if anything happened. At the time R was not quite ready to believe BF would physically abused anyone, but he told her all the same that he would watch out for me or any other girl in the future. 

R told me that after the way he saw BF behave at my party he became more convinced that BF was likely to get physical and that was why he chose to step in. He also told me that even if it didn't go that far, I should not put up with how BF treated me. 


I agreed, what R had told me, and all the information and support I recieved here had me pretty convinced that I was not in a good situation. I decided to go and stay with R and his roommates for a short time. 

I don't have too many other options for accomodation this urgently. My parents live too far away and the few friends I could stay with are other girls with enough on their plate, and I didn't want to risk bringing this drama to their doorsteps. In retrospect I'm glad I chose to go to R's, because I feel like what followed could have been even more frightening and dangerous if only myself and another girl had been present. 

I didn't have much time to get my stuff together before BF was due to arrive home, so I packed a few bags of essentials and valuables, along with my school things, and R picked me up. 

I left a note at the house for BF I was leaving and that I did not plan on returning, other than to retrieve the rest of my things. I didn't tell him where I would be staying and that I would rather he didn't contact me directly, suggesting he communicate through his mother instead. 


I got to R's and got settled in, while choosing to leave was difficult and I had a few bouts of crying, I also felt immensely relieved. 

R/BFs parents came around and brought some dinner. They were incredibly nice about everything and told me I had to do what was best for me. We always got along well but I never expected them to be so kind and supportive given the situation.

Half way through dinner, my phone rang. It was BF. I did not want to answer it and everyone else agreed that was probably a good idea. After my phone rang out, R/BFs Mum's phone began to ring. Predictably enough it was BF calling. His dad answered the phone, the phone was not on speaker but BF was loud enough that you could hear him yelling down the phone. 

I couldn't tell exactly what was said, but his dad was telling him to calm down, and not to do something. BF hung up on him, and R/BF's dad told us BF was coming to R's place, and saying this was all R's fault. 

R started to get a bunch of text messages from BF making threats and telling R that he knew I was there and ha was coming to get me. R replied to him saying that if BF came here and caused trouble he would be calling the police, but BF ignored him. 


BF showed up at R's probably 15 minutes later. He drove up the lawn and almost hit the letterbox, and got out of his car and started yelling. R and his dad went out while I stayed in the front room with his Mum. BF yelled for a while and was kicking at random parts of the garden. 

BF started to yell towards the house that he knew I was there and to come out. I wasn't planning on coming out at all and R told him to leave. 

BF ended up running around the side of the house to the back patio entry, the screen door was locked but the solid back door wasn't, and he started hitting the fly wire trying to break it. He kept yelling into the house that he knew I was there and that if I didn't come out, he would destroy all my stuff and log on to my school accounts and cause problems on there. 

R and his dad caught up to BF and started pulling him away from the door, BF started throwing punches and his Mum and I both went out to the inside of the back door, because we were worried someone would get hurt. 

BF saw me and started trying for the back door again, and saying if I didn't get in the car he would kill himself. His mum said she was going to call the police. 

BF/R's dad ended up hauling him out to the front yard and told him to leave. 

BF did eventually get into the car, he spun his wheels and tore up the grass and drove off. 

I felt pretty awful after all that. His mum and dad were both visibly really upset and R's rental property had been messed up and I felt responsible, they were still so nice about everything though. They really are wonderful people. 

I spoke to the police and they said they would be speaking to BF about what happened and I got some advice about obtaining a VRO and making sure I could find away of retrieving my stuff from the house, so that is all ok for the moment. 

The latest news is that BF has been all over Facebook saying that R and I had been having an affair and posting all these random cropped blurry porn pictures from the Internet saying it was us, and that he had caught us in the act. None of us are responding to any of it at this point, haven't really decided what to do there. 


My plan is to stay with R for now. It's still my best option and R has said he won't leave me alone at the house in case BF comes back. Either he or his male roomate would be there, we also spoke to a couple of the neighbours that R is friendly with and they said they would keep an eye out for his car or call us if they saw anything dodgy. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do next. I'm planning to talk to my uni about getting in to student housing, I'm planning to go out tomorrow to buy some pepper spray also. I'm tossing up about reaching out to BFs ex, but I'm not sure if that will cause more problems for everyone. 


So I suppose that's it, for now at least? I'm sorry that this was a bit of a novel- but I know a lot of people wanted an update and considering how nice everyone has been I wouldn't want anyone to worry that I had gone back/stayed with him. Rest assured that is totally out of the question, the more I think about things that happened within our relationship with this new perspective, the more I realise how fucked up some of those things were. 


Again a huge thank you to everyone, I'll do my best to keep up with the comments and respond to any PMs 



   
**tl;dr** left BF, staying at R's. Lawn traumatised as a result "
"My [30s] BIL [30s] tried to ruin my wedding. He is upset I cut the stupidity out of my wedding video.


I [34F] got married to my boyfriend Dan [35M]. We have been together for 5 years now. We have been married two months now.

Dan has two siblings. Moira [32F] is great, I love her like my own sister. Smith [30M] is kind of a weird character. He is fun, in small doses. I am not annoyed with him so much as perplexed. He seems stuck in middle school. 

My wedding had a lot of small problems. I had a kid throw up on my dress, so I wore my MOH's dress while she changed into her street clothes. I tripped going up the stairs. Dan dropped his ring down the vent. One of my cousin's children knocked over a pile of cupcakes. For the most part, no one did anything on purpose and we have it on tape, which is hilarious. 

There was one incident that felt intentionally done to make my day harder for me. It was done by Smith. During the actual vows, when the priest [60sM] asked if anyone protests, forever hold your peace, Smith stood up. He said he was in love with me and didn't think I should marry his brother. Then after a few seconds of silence, he said 'wrong wedding' and walked out. I could hear him laughing about it. 

I have a little brother [25M] who was prone to stupid shit like this when he was 11. I have learned not to take it personally, I work with kids. I am used to Smith. I just felt it was stupid and made him look bad more than me. I didn't want it in the video and asked the videographer to take it out. I didn't bring it up again, I let Dan handle his family like we have agreed. I think he spoke to Smith about it, I know my MIL [60s] gave him a stern once over.

I let it go. I didn't really think about it much until we got the video and pictures. Smith was over while my cousin Cindy [40F] was. Cindy asked to see the video and pictures. I turned it on, showed her the video. It was hilarious. It was loving and beautiful. It also didn't have Smith doing something stupid. 

Smith got upset about it and said we kept all the other bad stuff, why not him. He was part of the wedding excitement. He was funny. Why didn't we keep it in? 

I told him I didn't think it was very funny, he did it to piss us off, and I didn't want it in my video. I said no hard feelings, it wasn't funny is all. 

Smith left and is actually upset about this. He has been texting Dan saying how I changed him, blah blah.

I am just not sure how to go forward from this. I feel like I am dealing with a toddler. How do I explain to Smith that he could have ruined my wedding, and most women would have flayed him alive and told him to never come into their home? I feel he owes me an apology, but don't really care that Smith thinks he is funny. I just don't want to deal with hissy fits. So what do I do? 


**TL;DR** BIL made a stupid joke during my wedding vows and is upset the guy edited it out. NOt sure what is up?

"I [43F] invited my nephew [M14] to Disneyland but not my twin nieces [F14] and my family is in meltdown.

"My sister [32F] made a GIANT scene at my [26F] baby shower


My mom and my MIL threw me a surprise baby shower on Sunday and invited all of my family and most of my friends who are in my hometown. It was great, I don't usually get to see everyone when I visit so it was really nice to have them all there. My sister is also pregnant, she is 34 weeks and I am 36 weeks. My mom and I have been planning her baby shower with her that will be two weeks from now. 


At the shower, everyone kept complimenting me on how tiny I am and how good I look and I could see my sister was getting really jealous. It was really upsetting her so I tried to change the topic but after the first little bit she retreated to a table in the corner with her friend looking incredibly angry. I tried to ignore it and we started playing shower games. Later, her friend asked if any of us knew where she was since she hadn't seen her in a while. Everyone was extremely worried because she wasn't answering her phone and we thought she could have gone into labor or fallen or something terrible. The shower was in a party room at an arena so it's a huge building and everyone there (~70 of us) began searching the entire place up and down looking for her. Many people got into their cars to drive around the area and the different routes to the hospital to see if they saw her car. We also called her husband to see if he had heard from her and he left work to help look. 


My other sister found her sulking inside a timmies. She refused to come back to the shower because she was upset that she wasn't getting any attention and everyone was fawning over me. It took a while for everyone who left to get back and while we tried to carry on with the shower, the whole mood was soured and it was really awkward.


I'm so upset with her now. I suspect once the baby comes I won't go down to my hometown as much and I won't get to see many of those people as often as I did before, so that was my last chance to get together with everyone before the baby. It's not even the first time she's done something like this. At my wedding she complained to anyone who was willing to listen about how my husband is very touchy-feely with me. And now whenever he touches me in any way in front of her she'll grumble and roll her eyes like she is upset that he is attracted to me or something. He dropped me off at the shower and when we were talking to friends he was standing behind me holding my belly and she said ""that's disgusting"" and made a gagging noise. She also won't show up to something unless someone has called her to ask where she is and tell her were waiting for her, it's a little game that she likes to play. I don't know what her problem is but I'm so sick of it. 


She hasn't spoken to me since the incident and won't return my calls or texts but I think she owes me an apology. If she can't apologize I don't think I want to continue to plan and pay for her baby shower. Is that fair? My mom and my aunt think I just need to try to move past it because ""that's just how she is."" My husband feels differently and he thinks I should stop doing anything for her because she continuously disrespects* us and our marriage. 


**tl;dr**: My very pregnant sister left my baby shower without telling anyone which made everyone worry and go searching for her, only to find her sulking because she wasn't getting attention. She won't talk to me now and I think she should apologize or I will stop paying for and planning her shower but my mom says that's unfair. "
"UPDATE: I [22F] am getting married soon. My mom had an affair 5 years ago and destroyed our family. We are slowly rebuilding a relationship but it's not close. Dad just told me if she's at the wedding he can't come. Help me!


Hi everyone. Sorry I took so long to post but I got very busy, part of which was spent graduating college so I'm glad THAT's finally out of the way. Here is the link for those who need a recap:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j727c/i_22f_am_getting_married_soon_my_mom_had_an/

WARNING: This is a VERY long update. Also this post is probably going to get flamed. Judging how the comments went down as more time went on the longer my post was up, this is probably going to anger many people. But there were also lots of nice and helpful people too, especially u/RememberKoomValley.

So I was reading all the comments and the more time went on the more angry and upset I became. People eventually started saying why should parents always have to sacrifice for children, some said I was being a bridezilla and only caring about my day (of course I care! It's my wedding! It's supposed to be a once in a lifetime event that I want to share with everyone!), many people said my dad had depression and my mother's actions were so evil he was forever off the hook for good. Everyone was giving suggestions on how I could meticulously plan the days to rotate everyone and I felt like screaming.

Steve eventually told me to get off of Reddit because he hated seeing me so upset. I couldn't even say exactly WHY I was upset. I just was. Steve said maybe I should go back to my old therapist that I had when my parents got divorced and talk it out with her. To me, this seemed like a great idea. I called her up and asked to have an appointment, despite finals being right around the corner.

So I went and EVERYTHING came out. How much I hurt still from what Mom did and how we can never be close again. And honestly how ANGRY I am at my father. I never really realized it, but I've gotten so furious and resentful of him. How he never even TRIED to get out of his funk, how dejected he acted if mom somehow came up, how he never said anything DIRECTLY bad about her but subtly made me feel so guilty for loving her. Acting mopey, going from fine to depressed if she somehow came up, how I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him and how he gets a free pass because he got cheated on; Something that happens to tons of people every day.

I talked and talked and talked. I made a couple more appointments. I got through finals (I want to shout out to Steve here. He is the only reason I got through it all, passed, and got my degree. He is an incredible human being.)

The tipping point was my graduation day. Once again, my father made it clear Mom couldn't be sat near him and he couldn't be near her at all. I had to text her when she could come talk to me and had to text him once she left.

Her boyfriend was, of course, not invited. But it was so embarrassing having to contact the officials in charge of the ceremony and ask if my tickets could be changed so my parents could sit far away from each other. They were kind and understanding but that's when I began to get very very angry. My mom has no problem with my dad. She doesn't mind being near him even though she doesn't love him. I began to think how I'm going to have to rearrange ALL my milestones. My marriage, when I have children, my children's christenings and birthday parties...etc.

Graduation was miserable. I couldn't look in any one direction to see my family as I got my degree and walked the stage because they had to be spread out.

I had to make sure my phone was on me and fully charged so I could coordinate my mother and father's locations. It was so awkward mingling with one group and then my mother, knowing both groups were waiting to have their turn.

My brother interacted with my mother and he was kind of cold but cordial nonetheless. My mother made no complaints, didn't try to argue or force herself in there, and patiently waited for her ""turn"" even though I could tell she was dying to spend more time with me. Pictures had to be rotated. I couldn't have ONE with all my family in there. My father was constantly texting during my time with her asking if she had left yet and if he could come back now.

It seemed so...CHILDISH. Honestly, the rest of my family could tolerate my mother being around. After all, the divorce was YEARS ago. It's time to start getting over it and moving on with life. It was only because of my DAD that I couldn't relax and just be happy and enjoy my graduation with my family.

I was supposed to go to dinner with my dad, boyfriend and other family after graduation to celebrate. I told them I felt very sick and I needed to go home. I just didn't want to be around anyone anymore.

Steve just held me while I bawled my eyes out. I hadn't cried that hard in years.
I met with my therapist a couple more times. This is turning into a novel so I will summarize what I came to realize in therapy:

While the initial anger and hate I felt for my mom was real, I never stopped loving her. But, I felt like because my dad had been wronged, I had to take ""his side."" My dad has always made me feel guilty for loving my mother still. While his actions have never been overt, it has been very subtle manipulation. I felt like I had to give my dad cart blanche whatever he wanted because if I didn't I felt like I would lose him too. That he would reject and have nothing to do with me if I didn't practically ostracize my mother. My mother was at one point my best friend and that's gone. I couldn't stand losing BOTH my parents. So dad has gotten whatever he wanted. And I'm realizing that in a subtle way, Dad has been manipulating my brother and I to treat our mother terribly for years to punish her. My dad has always been a super passive aggressive guy. It's nothing new. He's always guilt tripped people and made these little comments that twist people up and hurt them. It's his form of control.

I love both my parents. My mother did a terrible horrible thing but my dad is no saint either. My mom was just more upfront about her awfulness.

My therapist and Steve also pointed out that if my dad IS truly depressed or emotionally damaged etc. he has never sought to get help for it. Instead he has projected his problems and pain onto everyone else and made it their burden instead of taking responsibility for himself and attempting to go on with life and that is not ok.

I called my mom and asked her over for tea.Steve left to give us privacy. I could list everything we said and talked about but it would make the post longer. Basically my mom never loved my dad and should never have agreed to marry him. My dad knew mom didn't love him but didn't care and insisted she would love him eventually. Some very eye opening things were said that made sense.

My mother never trash talked my dad (never has) but she gave insights as to why the affair happened. She says she understands it's no excuse for what she did and she is so very sorry for her own selfishness and weakness.

Basically both my parents are human and mistakes were made from both sides. My mom had the affair yes, but it's not like my dad was the perfect man either.

While I still will never again be close to my mom perhaps I don't need to be quite as harsh with her as I have been. We will still be low contact but I did decided I DO want her there for the wedding and for the birth of any children I have, etc. I love my mom. Always have and always will. She may not have been a good wife but she WAS an excellent mother and I don't want to cut her out completely. I think my kids lives will be more enriched having her in it.

My mother started crying when I told her she was invited to the wedding (even though I made it clear to her her boyfriend is not invited. She didn't argue with me on that at all) and said she thought I had asked her to my house to tell her I would NOT be inviting her and she had been prepared to accept that rejection and understand it. I did tell her that if dad was there she was to stay away from him and not try to mend any fences at my wedding. She says she understands completely and will mingle with my grandparents (her parents) and my aunts, uncles and cousins (her siblings and their children). I made it clear to my mother that if she even attempted to talk to dad or any of his family she would be thrown out. She agreed without question.

Steve and I had a final sit down before I called my dad. I asked him to please give me his honest opinion. Steve relented and said while he thought my mother had done the inexcusable, she actually seemed remorseful and willing to accept the consequences of her actions and to move on and that my dad, while a nice guy, came off as way too sensitive and just weak. He said that my dad didn't cheat but he had caused me a lot of pain and anxiety since the divorce and it made him very angry and it was getting hard to like or tolerate my dad and that his family felt the same way, that my dad was actually a master bully in disguise as a super nice guy.

I called my dad and asked to come over and that I needed to talk about something. I sat him down in his living room (so this talk was in his space where he could retreat if he needed to) and said basically
""Dad. I love you so so much. You mean the world to me. But after the fiasco of my graduation I've come to realize I have had enough of feeling like I have to pick sides for you and mom. I'm sorry what happened Dad. I really am. But that was 5 years ago. You lost a wife, but I didn't lose a mom. I'm sure you don't mean to, but you've been making me feel like I can't be close with you if I want to have any kind of relationship with mom.If it's still impossible to even be in the room with her dad, then maybe you need to talk to someone so you can start feeling better and not be in so much pain. Is there some kind of abuse that happened that you're not telling me about that makes this impossible?""

My dad seemed shocked and then started to get REALLY upset and basically said mom had never hit him or anything but that ""she cheated and broke his heart and that was reason enough to cut her out""

Dad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on, I didn't know what real love was and also implied it was MY fault and my brothers fault because ""if we weren't a part of their relationship he could move on"" but we always remind him of her and what they had, how because of us he can't make a clean break since she's in our lives etc.

I'm sure many redditors will disagree but this is my dad being typically passive. Insinuating that because my brother and I exist he can't get better because we are reminders of mother and it's our fault we exist so he can't cut her out totally. I realize that my dad thinks that if he can get me and my brother to cut my mom out, not only will he succeed in punishing her but he can have us all to himself and not have to share with her and deal with his hurt. He's getting us to do the dirty work for him so he doesn't have to take responsibility.

I told my dad that I loved him and wanted him at the wedding but Mother is invited. Her boyfriend isn't but she is. I told dad that I had talked to her and I promised him she would leave him alone and stay away from him and his family and could he not just put aside differences for a few hours to celebrate with me and Steve on our day?

He said absolutely not and that I was being unfair and insensitive and that my mom had poisoned me against him. That he wasn't the cheat and she needed to deal with what she had done and not come and by inviting her I was clearly supporting her cheating and that we couldn't be close if that was the case because I was being too much like her.

I had had enough. I stood up and said,
 ""Dad, Steve and I really want you there. You are free to come or not. I love you. But if you don't come, it will absolutely affect our relationship going forward. I am not doing anymore separate celebrations or events. People can either come or stay home for weddings, parties, births and whatever. It's getting ridiculous and I'm sick of being in the middle. The rest is up to you and Mom.""

Then I left. I haven't heard from my dad since. That's been hard, but I feel like I did the right thing.

I also called my brother and told him everything that happened. My brother was very quiet. He then said while he still hates our mom for what she did and thinks she's a whore that maybe there is more to this than he realized and that he thinks our dad is being a selfish jerk and needs to get over himself. He said it's fine mom is coming to the wedding and that he would be nice to her.

So that's that. I'm sure many will disagree and be angry with me but Steve and I feel we made the right call. Steve loves and supports me and that's all that matters. I talked to my therapist about it and she said it's possible I was harsh but that maybe my dad needed to hear that since he has been coddled and enabled for five years.

I am fully prepared for my dad to not show up. If he doesn't it's his loss. Thanks again to everyone who gave me input, some of your comments were very eye opening. I may post an update in the future after the wedding but I haven't decided yet.

**TL;DR Broke down and went to therapy. Realized my dad is very passive aggressive and manipulative. My graduation day was horrible but a catalyst to realize things can't continue this way and I'm tired of being in the middle. Had a heart to heart with mom, realized my parents relationship is not a case of saint vs. sinner but two people who are human and made mistakes. Told mom she's invited but boyfriend is not and she will be asked to leave if she approaches my dad or any of his family. Talked to dad and told him he's hurting me with his behavior and it needs to stop. My dad is not speaking to me and there's a good chance he will boycott the wedding. Talked to brother and he supports me and says dad is being unfair. I'm just happy I get to marry Steve and that I don't have to be stuck in bullshit drama anymore.**

EDIT: wow this blew up! Thank you everyone who commented and offered a POV. Except for the people sending PM's of death threats. I've gotten at least half a dozen of those, plus calling me a whore (ironic since I'm a virgin) and hoping Steve cheats. You sound like lovely warm people full of happiness.

I wanted to point out some things that keep coming up:

1. Remember I come from a religion and culture that is very different from most people here. Divorce is shameful for us. It is humiliating. The only justifiable reason for divorce is an affair for our people. Divorce ""because you're not happy"" is not an excusable reason. An affair is the only way out. However, that being said, the person who commits the affair has just crippled themselves. Sex is very holy and pure in our religion and culture. It is to be between husband and wife only. That's it. And if you break up a marriage because of it you are forever blacklisted. While my mother could/should have gotten a divorce without having an affair, she STILL would have had a scarlet letter on her chest for getting divorced for ""no reason"" which is an ultimate act of selfishness. Marriage is very holy in our culture. To divorce for any reason other than an affair is ""to be like an unbelieving sinner"" which is, quite simply, not acceptable. I don't necessarily agree with this as I'm a little more liberal than the rest of my family and most people but it is what it is

2. My mother did NOT get off Scott free. She is no longer welcome in her church and none of her friends associate with her anymore. Her family, her friends, her church, her entire community has shunned her. She also lost her job because dipping your pen in company ink is expressly frowned upon at her former work place. Both she and her lover lost their jobs and had to find new ones

3. Many are saying I need to start including my moms partner in things and saying the fact she has been with him this whole time shows they have something special. It actually does not. I didn't put this in my post but my mom and I actually talked about her boyfriend for the first time. They are on the verge of breaking up and their relationship has been rocky for awhile. ""P""'s family and friends have disowned him too. He is not of our religion or culture (double bogus for my mom for taking a lover outside the faith) but no one wants anything to do with P. His ex wife has made their lives hell and will not let him see his kids. When he does see them they treat my mother terribly and make their hatred known. P is also sick of being not invited to every family event on our side and says Mom needs to start demanding he be invited to things. Mom is of the view point that they brought misery on themselves and need to accept the consequences of their actions and furthermore knows that if she insisted on bringing P she would burn the last of the bridges she has with us and will not do that. P is sick of her ""not putting him first"" and their relationship is falling apart because of it. The only reason they have lasted this long is because my mom and P only have each other because no one else wants them. And they both know it. My mom actually does love her boyfriend but he does not love her anymore and she knows they aren't going to make it

4. Many are saying (even explicitly hoping) Steve cheats on me so I understand my dads pain because I clearly don't since I haven't been cheated on (hey that's what my dad said!). This experience has actually taught me the opposite. If Steve were to cheat I would be out of my mind with pain and hurt. I wouldn't be able to function. I don't blame my dad for being unable to be around my mother. At first. If I had children with Steve, as much as it would SUCK, I would put on my big girl pants and do what needed to be done for my kids. I've gotten plenty of comments and PM's from people who WERE cheated on and heartbroken and devastated...and they did what needed to be done. Since I now know what it's like to have parents that pick their pain over their kids I know I would NEVER want to put my kids through that. It's just basic human decency.

5. I am not on any parents side. I don't love either of my parents more nor do I think either should be demonized and bashed or out on a pedestal and coddled.My parents are human and imperfect. They are both great people. And they both have done some really shitty things. That's it and that's all"
"UPDATE: My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends.


Original Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m6oij/my_friends_1920m_just_humiliated_me_19m_with_a/

Hey guys, I just want to thank you for all the support you've given me in regard to this, so I thought I'd share an update.

I approached T and paid him back for the dinner, and explained to him how while he thought it was ""banter""; he was just generally being unacceptably dickish, and how I wasn't going to take that. While I was initially fighting the urge to give him a slap; he was pretty apologetic. I'm not gonna lie; I thought he was being sincere.

I didn't forgive him or anything like that; but I didn't block him either. A few days went by and I went on with my life, working, uni, etc. However, this evening when I was hanging out at home, they (T and the other ""mates"" in that group) began bombarding my Facebook page with posts like ""food thief"", ""povo"" (Aus slang for poor) and other generally egregious shit, all geo-tagged with the restaurant that we went to. This took me slightly off guard as being unprovoked, but it seemed they were satisfied engaging in their little circle jerk.

Guess my mind was made up for me. Deleted the posts, blocked them, and am now just pondering where to find some more friends 😂

I also tried going back to the restaurant and explaining the situation; but they were having none of it. Turns out they recognised T from his soccer career and decided to take his word over mine. He hadn't clarified with them it was ""a prank"" either it would seem, so I guess I'm never going back to that place 😂
Not a particularly bright and sunny update; still poor, lost more mates than I'd initially thought I would, and I'm barred from the restaurant. They're not my only friends however, and at least they were kind enough to make my decision easier.

Once again I can't thank you enough; without your support and input I honestly don't know if I'd have realised how toxic these people were.

Much love.

Tl;dr - even more mates turned out to be assholes, and I won't be eating at the restaurant anymore. Life goes on though."

"My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends.


Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset.

For some context, I'm living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can't go on benefits because my parents' income is too high, yet they won't offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene).

My friend, let's call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He's an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T).

T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I'm about to leave; he texts me and says that there's been a change of plan; that we're going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he'd love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can't afford it and that I'd catch up with them after. However; he begins to go ""oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X"" and insists that I come along; saying that he's shouting (paying for) the feed anyway.

After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I'll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal.

T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. ""Oh shit, I don't have my card with me"". He then goes on to show me that he's got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because ""you're up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal"". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I'll either have to dine and dash (which I'm not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I'm straight up fucked.

The whole time I'm trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn't have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there's an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they've paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can't pay for mine.

Manager comes up and says he'll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he'll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I've never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.)

So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of ""banter"" was.

I'm pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven't replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much.

Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming? This isn't the first joke at my expense and sadly I don't think it'll be the last.

Tl;dr - my rich friends publicly humiliated me for being broke, pls read the main text.

"My girlfriend [24F] of 1 year asked me [24M] for a $1000 loan. I said no.


My gf of 1 year asked me for a loan of $1000, I said no.

We've been together a year, we live separately though.  We each have our own apartments.

She currently doesn't have a job, although she claims to be looking for one.  She kind of has a hectic lifestyle, she spends a lot of money.  She goes out a lot, eats out a lot, buys many things she doesn't need such as expensive clothing, when she should be buying things more affordable.  She spends money on coffee at cafes every day.

She's borrowed money from her parents before and has never managed to pay them back, basically just squandered them.  Now its come to a point where even her parents refused to lend her money cause they know they'd be basically enabling her poor spending habits and they know they'd never see that money again.

Frankly, I feel the same. I feel if I lend it to her, its as good as gone.  I told her I feel there's a lot more she could do to save money, she could move out and live somewhere more affordable, she could intensify her job hunting and maybe work something that she might otherwise consider 'beneath her' until she makes enough money.  I mean, lots of restaurants always have spots available for waiters or kitchen staff, I don't see why she can't just pick up a minimum wage job for the time being instead of going out every day and going to clubs wasting her parents money.

I told her she could be better budgeting herself, i.e. on what she eats, what she wears, where she lives, how much she spends, and she wouldn't have as severe money problems.  She accused me of lecturing her and got angry, I told her she was the one who came to me for help with money.  She just wanted me to hand her over a $1000 to ""borrow"" which she'll definitely totes absolutely pay back (probably never).

I told her, honestly, I feel if I lend her the money, I don't think she'll be able to pay it back.  She told me she will, she has a plan, I should just trust her.  I also pointed out I don't like lending out money to family and friends because it causes a constraint on our relationship when they can't pay it back.

She was like ""oh but you lent $1000 to your sister in the past"".  I said yes, because then I knew I could trust her to properly budget herself, she had a job at the time, and I trusted her to be able to pay it back, which she did.

Its caused a lot of strain and resentment within our relationship, I'm really not sure what to do.  I don't want to pay her the money, I think she should make adjustments to her living style and stop living beyond her means.   The fact that her parents have now flat out refused to just hand her over money I think says a lot about their level of trust for her. Any advice on what I should do or how to handle this?


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants to borrow money, a thousand dollars.  I said no, I think she's living beyond her means and needs to make adjustments, and she should find a job, plus I don't think she'll be able to pay it back.  She says she's looking for a job but can't find one, even though there are basic jobs available.  Its caused a lot of fighting and strain in our relationship."

"My (21F) with my Boyfriend (24M) he wants me to cut off contact with his brother, after brother defended me in an argument.


Boyfriend and I have been together for two years. I have known his brother, who I will call ""R""  for most of that time. We have always gotten on well enough. 


The whole situation started with my 21st birthday party. We had a party at home with 20 or so friends of family, R was of course present at the party, along with a few other members of BFs family. 

The party was going reasonably well, as it started to get later I started to get a little tipsy, and most of the guests had started to go home. It eventually got down to a drunken little group made up of myself, boyfriend, R and a couple of my girlfriends. 

We were sitting outside and one of my girlfriends decided to get on the trampoline, she managed to execute a pretty cool flip, and I expressed that I wished I knew how to do one. 

My friend talked me into giving it a try. I got up on the tramp, stumbled drunkenly and fell down laughing. Everyone else (except for BF) was laughing also. It didn't seem like much of an event until BF got up, muttered ""fucking pathetic"" in an angry tone and then told me that we needed to speak in private. 


I was pretty confused as to what was going on, so I asked him ""why?""- he answered me with ""Just stop being a stupid cow for a second and come to the bedroom"" 

Both of my friends and R looked pretty shocked at this, but I before I followed BF to the bedroom I told them it was fine and BF was probably just messing around. He can have a real temper sometimes, particularly after a few drinks but I didn't think that would be the case in this instance as literally NOTHING upsetting had happened. 


Cut to me and BF in the bedroom. He shuts the door and starts really going off. He tells me that I'm a disgusting drunk idiot and that I was showing off like some kind of pathetic wannabe by messing around on the trampoline. That I was an embarrassment to him and that I was to go to bed now and not leave the room until morning so that I would be more of an idiot in front of company. 


As this is going on he is getting louder and louder and is slamming things around the room. I went to leave as I was quite upset at this point, but he blocks the door so I sit down on the bed. 


R is banging on the door and tells BF to open in. BF goes out into the hall and I can hear he and R arguing. Next thing I know it R comes into the room and says to go with him. I was sobbing like crazy at this point, because I hate confrontation in general, so I just nod and go with him. 

R makes sure my other friends have left and then we both get into a taxi. I don't know where BF has gone but he is still in the house sow where. 

I'm crying a bunch in the car and don't say much, but R calls his and BFs mother and gives her a brief rundown of what happened. 

We got to R's place, he lives with a couple and they were all really nice. The girl roomate leant me some stuff to sleep in and R told me to take his bed and he would sleep on the couch. I was kind of all over the place but eventually got some sleep. 

Next morning I got up and had coffee with R and one of his roommates. R asked if BF had behaved that way before and I let him know about BFs temper but explained that he had never blown up over something as insignificant as me mucking around on a trampoline. I asked R if he thought maybe I did or said something that might have upset BF and didn't realise due to being tipsy, but R said no, and that BFs behaviour was unacceptable. 


I felt silly and embarrassed, especially knowing that R and my friends had heard everything BF had said, and I told R I had better get home and try to sort things out. 

R said that he wanted to stay at his place for just a bit longer to calm down, and that he would really rather prefer that I didn't go home straight away as BF could still be angry. 

I gave in an hung out there with R and his roommates, we all just played video games and got some takeout, and I ended up feeling much better afterward- so I'm glad I stayed. 

Early evening a told R I should really go home, I didn't have any of my clothes and more importantly I needed my stuff for university the next day. He drove me over, but didn't really want me to go inside. I told him it would really be fine and promised I would call him if anything happened. 

He agreed but said he would wait outside for a few minutes just in case. 

I got inside and BF wasn't home so I told R to go and went about tidying up from the party. 

BF eventually rocked up and seemed calm enough. I told him I thought we needed to have a talk and he agreed. 

We sat down on the couch and I explained to him that I didn't think the way he spoke to me last night and asked for an explanation. 

His response was ""I will discuss that with you after you delete R's phone number, you won't be speaking to him again"" 

I was confused as all hell at this and asked what that had to do with the matter at hand. 

He told me that R disrespected him by interfering in our relationship, and that we were cutting ties with him. He told me he wouldn't discuss anything else about the night before until I did that. 

I told BF I thought that was pretty unnecessary, and that R had been trying to help me because BF was acting really threatening, and that I would have probably done the same in R's shoes. 

Well, BF did not like that. He yelled, called me some names and left the house. After a few hours he sent me a text 

""I am sorry for yelling, but you need to respect what I want if you want the same in return. This can't be one sided. Delete R's number and we will finish the conversation. Love you"" 


I replied that I needed a little time to think and said I would be sleeping in the spare room when he got home and to please leave me some for a while. 

I went to bed, heard BF come in very late. He opened the door to the spare room and turned the light on, but as I woke up he just walked out of the room and slammed the door. 

So this morning I've woken up, BF is at work and I have a text from R, it says- 

Hey **** , I hope you're ok. Look what BF did the other night is really not alright and I think you should get out of there for a while. I've talked to.  **** and **** and it's totally fine for you to crash here until you figure out what you want to do


So that leaves me where I am now. Don't know what to do about the situation- do as BF asks and cut contact with R, or take R's offer of some space away from BF to clear my head. My worry is that if I stay at R's that will destroy any chance of fixing things with BF. Advice very much appreciated.





   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriends brother spoke up and took me away when BF was blowing up about something fairly small. BF wants me to cut ties with his brother, because he thinks him helping me was disrespectful to him and outer relationship. 


**Edit** 

When I was able to come back and check on this post I was amazed at the enormous amount of comments and messages I recieved. There has been a lot to catch up on and I am reading everything, thank you to everyone has given their advice. It has cemented the decision I've already made about getting out, but quite a bit has happened in the last day so I will be doing an update for anyone who is curious. I will try to get it up in a few hours: 

Again, thank you to everyone who has commented or messaged me, I'm truly touched by all the helpful and caring responses I've recieved "
"My sister [20F] described to me a really weird and threatening encounter she had with my [18M] girlfriend [18F] of 6 months. I asked my girlfriend about it, she said it was just a ""joke"", but my sister is genuinely disturbed.


Like the title says, been together for 6 months.  She was at our house the other day, and my sister tells me this is what happened.

Apparently in the corridors upstairs, my girlfriend ambushed my sister and pretty much cornered her and started interrogating her.  From what my sister told me, she was saying ""back off, he's mine now, not yours"" ""he doesn't love you like he loves me""  ""you don't understand him like I do"" ""you'll never be able to please him the way I do, so just back off"" ""stay out of our way"" ""I don't care if you love him, he's mine"" ""I know what you two do, back off, he's mine now"" ""whatever you think you two have, its nothing compared to what me and him have"" and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember.

Apparently it was in a very aggressive and threatening manner, my sister said she was really scared, and felt totally threatened and creeped out.

I asked my girlfriend about it, she said it was just a joke and asked if my sister found it funny. I said no, she was really disturbed, she just said ""oh well"".

I'm genuinely scared.  I know my girlfriend can be a bit possessive and clingy at times, but its always kind of cute, never this creepy.  She can get a bit nasty and angry at other girls who get too ""close"" but this shit is way too far.  Does she have a mental illness? Is she crazy?  Should I just run or can I work with this?  How can I reassure my sister that she's safe cause she's kinda freaked out.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend threatened and cornered my sister, played it off as a ""joke"".  Sister genuinely creeped out."

"I [26F] just got off the phone with my sister [39F] she does not want her son [15M] anymore because she has a new love interest and wants to start a family with him


Yeah so I am about to kick pick my nephew up in half an hour. His mother does not want him anymore. Her exact words were "" He is from a failed relationship, I will sign him over to you or what ever I need to do. But I want a fresh start with _________ and start a new family""

She met this guy and he is moving in tomorrow. My Nephew Seth just finished his freshmen year on friday is on summer vacation. As I said I am going to go pick him up in half an hour because she told me too. 

Seth is a well behaved kid, it's not like he acts out or is disrespectful. Not once have a I heard my sister complain about that and he actually gets really good grades. 

I just don't know what to do, I am more than prepared to take Seth in. I have a good job and I recently single so I can devote time to him. It's just this whole situation is a cluster and I don't know what to do.

"UPDATE:Me [29 F] with my mother [58 F]- she cancelled my bridal shower


 Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hvoq6/me_28_f_with_my_mother_57_f_she_canceled_my/
 
  I know this is updating an extremely old situation but since I'm chilling at the beach for my brother's wedding, I remembered this post and wanted to thank everyone who commented. It helped more than you all will ever know. 

  I tried to talk to my mother, but she claimed that she didn't remember promising to throw the shower in July. She then added that she tried really hard to help me have a nice wedding and she wished I would focus on that instead. She also made a halfhearted attempt to throw a brunch when my husband and I went to visit in September, but it never really got off the ground. I found out I was pregnant shortly after that visit, and sadly it ended in a miscarriage in November. My mother told me she would fly down to be with me during the D&amp;C, but then cancelled because my grandmother's 90th birthday party was that weekend, and she didn't want to ""cancel on anybody.""

  Similar things happened with my aunts and the rest of my extended family. My cousin had a huge 36th birthday party, and my husband and I both got off of work to attend, and brought a nice gift. On my birthday, when I posted a picture of myself with my friends at the lake, the same cousin commented, ""where did you get that flamingo floatie I want one, too."" No happy birthday, no nothing, after we both took the day off and brought her an expensive gift. 

  I did throw my sister-in-law's bridal shower, which was really hard, but I'm glad I did it. I know that I did the right, hard thing, and I'm really proud of myself for that. One of my cousins did bring me a ""late bridal shower gift"", which she said she brought because she knew I had been fucked over. It made me cry. I think that was kind of the turning point when I realized that it really WAS unfair and I did have the right to be upset. 

  The comments on the original post caused me to be a little more critical of my family's behavior and I see now how selfish and thoughtless they can really be. My husband and I have really closed our ranks and focused way more on friends, and gradually begun to push my relatives out of our lives. It doesn't make the past year hurt any less, but I am more aware now and less likely to set myself up for getting my feelings hurt. 

  I'm also thirteen weeks pregnant. I managed to tell my mother to not bother even pretending that they're going to throw a baby shower- I don't want one from them. My mother keeps insisting that this time things will work out, and I definitely will get a baby shower. I'm pleasantly apathetic. We also won't be spending holidays with my family the way we have in the past. My husband and I have both made ""work families"" at our jobs, who are more than willing and eager to celebrate all our milestones with us, and I think we'll keep it that way from now on. 

**tl;dr**: Bridal Shower never came, realized I'm related to jerks, learned not to get my hopes up. "
"UPDATE: My [30F] sister [38F] is suddenly mad at me because her daughter [7F] likes the nickname I gave her more than her real name.


The original post is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4miqyj/my_30f_sister_38f_is_suddenly_mad_at_me_because/)

First, I want to thank everybody for their suggestions and opinions in my original post. They really helped me tangle with some difficult issues that had been on my mind for a week.

Second, I feel the need to direct attention to this comment thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4miqyj/my_30f_sister_38f_is_suddenly_mad_at_me_because/d3w75uc. I didn't go too in to detail about my sister's narcissism and how she tends to behave around Jordan because I didn't want to make the post too long. I should have been more clear.

And somebody asked where Jordan's father is. He works night shift six days a week, so he makes my niece dinner before he goes to work, then packs her lunch and sends her off to school in the morning when he gets home. They go to church with his family once or twice a month and they like to garden together. I don't talk to him a lot because he's usually sleeping during the day and I don't go to their house very much.

This update is going to need some back story that I should make clear from the start for a change. Jordan's father is black, and his family is very religious and very in to representing their culture and heritage. The church does a lot of spirituals, and his family likes singing them at home, too. Jordan loves them, her favorite is ""Go Down Moses."" She also likes a lot of songs from old musicals we watch togther, like Porgy and Bess and Show Boat, that reference the struggles of slavery. When she was about 4 or 5, my sister realized she loved those songs and would always sing them, and she tried telling her husband that Jordan was not allowed to listen to ""that type of music,"" or watch movies about slavery or read books about it, because my sister ""wasn't raised that way."" My brother in law is usually really passive, but this was one moment where he stood up to my sister and told her that their daughter is half-black and can trace her heritage back to the plantations, so ignoring her heritage wasn't going to happen. My sister will regularly pick this fight with her husband when Jordan starts liking something from African American culture that my sister doesn't like. (But if it's something my sister does like, like a Beyonce song? No complaints.)

After my sister yelled at me at the picnic (it was last Saturday, I'm sorry I wasn't clear), I didn't watch Jordan for a few days, partly because I was busy and partly because I thought I should give my sister some space. This was easy because it's summer and I'm not taking Jordan home from school right now. She spent a lot of time with my mother and her other grandmother instead. Shortly after I posted my original post, I sent my sister a few text messages to see how she was doing and what she'd been up to, and she sent back, ""Don't think I don't know what you're up. I haven't changed my mind about that stupid name."" I told her that was fine, she was Jordan's mother and I'd respect her wishes. She sent another message saying, ""Her name is Jordan, nothing else, because that's what I named her."" That text becomes relevant later.

Her other grandmother actually dropped Jordan off at my house this morning, and she said something like, ""Hey, Beezy, tell your aunt all about the bugs you found!"" I was so shocked to hear that name after it had been supposedly banned. My niece told me all about the grasshoppers she'd caught and everything, and then she ran to the back bedroom to get something. I asked her grandmother if my sister had spoken to her about her nickname and reminded her about the picnic, and she was like, ""Oh, she was serious about that? That doesn't make sense, we've been calling her Beezy all week, right in front of her mom, too."" I asked her what my sister had been calling her, and she gave me a weird look and said, ""Beezy and JP, like usual. Why?""

Before she left, my sister's mother in law mentioned that my sister had yelled at her this past week, too. Apparently, MIL and Jordan had been watching TV at my sister's house, and a black woman with corn rows came on screen. Jordan told her grandmother she loved her hair, MIL said her cousin could do her hair like that if she wanted, my sister got angry and said there was no way her hair was getting put in corn rows. MIL asked what was wrong, and my sister said she didn't know how to take care of corn rows, so it wasn't happening. MIL told her her son (my sister's husband) used to have corn rows and knew all about them, and she could teach my sister about how to take care of them. Then my sister said, ""Well, I don't like how they look."" Jordan said, ""Aunt Bebe has hair like that and she looks really pretty. Don't you think I'd look pretty?"" Apparently, my sister just said ""No, and don't you do her hair like that, it's hideous"" (you being the grandmother and her family). Jordan's grandmother said she didn't push the issue because she's not the girl's mother, but she knew it hurt Jordan's feelings, and she was pretty upset about it as well.

As soon as Jordan's grandmother left, I texted my sister and said, ""I'm only to call her Jordan, right?""

""Right.""

Well fuck. I was furious, but a few users made a good point. Living with a narcissistic parent is never easy. My niece and I are close and I don't want our relationship cut off. So I need to pick my battles. So once Jordan was all played out and relaxed, I said, ""Honey, we need to have a talk about your name. Mommy really wants me to call you Jordan, and I think it's important that we do what she says.""

My niece got really upset and said that wasn't fair, her mom called her Beezy herself and everybody else did, all of her friends call her Beezy, the name is special to her, she loves fairies and it's always reminded her of fairies (that got me right in the gut), she hates the name Jordan, it was a real mess. So finally I said, ""Well, what would happen if I stopped calling you Beezy?"" She said names like that are magical and special, so if I stopped calling her Beezy, she wouldn't be special or magical anymore.

I told her she's special no matter what, but she was still upset. I was scrambling for a minute and then I realized, well, if she wants her name to be magical, we can do that. I asked her if she wanted to make Jordan special, too. When she eventually agreed, we listened to some of her favorite songs that mention the River Jordan, and I said, ""See? Jordan is really special in these songs!"" That did the trick. She was thrilled. I think I heard Old Man River a dozen times, but it was worth it. Victory! I figured we were all done with this. I could safely call her Jordan, the battle was avoided, so on and so on.

Of course not. An hour ago I got a visit from a very pissed off sister. Apparently, Jordan told her mom all about the songs and how her name was special because of them, and *now my sister is telling me I can't call her Jordan.* I asked her why, and she said something like, ""She likes the name now because of those black people songs! I fucking hate that music!""

I said, ""I'm really sorry, but Jordan loves it, and it was the only way I could get her to accept me calling her Jordan instead of Beezy.""

She kept ranting on about how that was too bad, she hated that music, she wasn't raised with black culture, etc. At no point did she mention my niece's feelings. I finally asked her, if I can't call her the name she wants to be called and I can't call her her birth name, what am I supposed to call her? And she just stared at me, completely blank, for I don't know how long, and then she said in a real nasty voice, ""Just call her whatever you want, then."" Five minutes later, she's totally calm and asking me to watch my niece again in a few days so she can go shopping. And by the way, she called her Beezy almost the whole time she was there. It was bizarre.

I was a wreck about this comment at the picnic for almost a week and now things seem much more clear. For me, this confirms that the problem wasn't ""Beezy"" at all. My sister is picking fights like this because she's a first class narcissist. She is jealous that her daughter has a good relationship with other people, and she's mad that her daughter is becoming her own person. Jordan likes something her mom doesn't like? PISSED OFF. Picking a fight with the adults around makes her feel like she's in control of Jordan again, but doesn't directly come off as abusing or yelling at her daughter. When I look back, this fits a real pattern of behavior for her. The good thing (I don't know what else to call it) is that my sister will rarely watch her daughter for more than one full day at a stretch before she gets frustrated or bored, so I know she won't cut me off. She depends on me too much for child care. I'm just going to try and be there for Jordan as much as I can, and I won't say it out loud, but when she turns 18, she's welcome to move in with me. She can move in with corn rows and a Beezy name tag while she sings ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"" at the top of her fucking lungs. That feels like the right thing to do.



   
**tl;dr**: Jordan's grandmother revealed that everyone (including my sister) has been calling her Beezy and JP all week without any problems. Got my niece to accept the name Jordan and my sister picked a fight. Now realizing my sister picks fights to feel like she's in control of her daughter. I will allow my niece to move in with me if she wants when she turns 18."

"UPDATE: My [27F] Girlfriend of two years won't forgive me for cheating on my exfiance [28F] and I'm [28M] at a loss.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k4mpw/my_27f_girlfriend_of_two_years_wont_forgive_me/)


So I'm just going to sum things up because there's a lot of detail and its great for long stories with friends...maybe not reddit. Sasha told me she was going to visit her mother because there was a health emergency last week, I took her to the airport and immediately moved all essentials out of my place to a storage locker not far from it. I had my computer and phone scrubbed of key loggers and trackers, there were several on each. 


A good friend of mine offered me his spare room until a month is up as I had to leave a 30 day written notice for Sasha in the apartment. I decided it would be best to wait until she got home to let her know we broke up to not distract from her family. The day before Sasha was supposed to fly back I received and eerie Facebook message from Alma. Apparently for the past couple days her home had been messed with? Someone left gates open, tore through screen doors, broke a couple pots in yard, and she felt like she was being watched. She asked if there was any chance that I or Sasha was behind all of this. It pained me to say it but part of me thought Sasha or Danielle might be, as I had no idea where Alma currently lived. I informed her about the key logger, the trackers, and other issues. Alma asked what kind of car I drove as she had noticed the same car driving by several times and was now parked at the end of her block. It was not Sasha's vehicle or mine so I assumed Danielle might be stalking Alma on Sasha's behalf while I was gone. 



Alma asked if I would come deal with this as she was very upset to be involved involuntarily in this issue and to at least provide company so she wouldn't be home alone. She gave me her address and off I went. 



Come to find out... Sasha never boarded the plane. She bought a ticket, and turned around as soon as I did. She rented a car and went to stalk Alma probably in hopes to catch me going back to Alma... which in her eyes happened as soon as I showed up to Alma's place.


I arrived and Sasha came bulldozing out of her rented car towards me. She kept screaming at me for cheating on her, that she knew I'd run back to that sl-t, that the second she was gone I couldn't keep my dick in my pants. Alma came out of her house at the sound of the screams and Sasha tried to sprint at her. Thankfully Alma was able to get back into her home and lock the door in time, while Sasha began to hurl things around her yard. 



The police arrived and took everyone aside for statements. Alma showed pictures of prior damage, photos of the car parked at the end of the block, Facebook messages between me, and I did the same. Surprisingly it seemed that Sasha didn't deny any of it... she even admitted to stalking Alma's Facebook enough to determine where she lived based on photos. 



The worst moment was when they put Sasha into the police car. She looked me dead in they eye and told me that what she did she did for me and our love together, we will be together she swears. The police officer apologized and said I should start looking into a restraining order asap. So thats what I've been doing this week. I think I want to be single for some time now. 
   

**tl;dr**: Sasha installed several key loggers and trackers on my electronic devices. She then began to stalk Alma at her home. I came by and the police were called. Im going to be single for sometime. Thanks folks. Being able to write everything out last time and read it all in one place really made me realize how many red flags I waved away."
"UPDATE: My [25F] recent boyfriend [37M] gave me a book to read. It's really, really bad.

(Full text in comments)
The post was locked shortly after I put it up, so I wasn't able to comment back to most of you. I went through every comment through, and took them all into consideration. Thank you all for your thoughts!

We skyped the other night, and the topic came up. I started by saying I liked him a lot and really do appreciate how much he's willing to share with me. He caught on to where I was going with this, and started laughing. Then I started laughing. And I realized how silly small of a thing this all was. I guess I didn't want to risk hurting his feelings.

When the reason why I didn't like the book came up, I explained, and he totally understood. It's been at least a decade since he's read the book, and he can see where I would feel uncomfortable. He will still consider reading the first HP book, since I gave his book a chance. And being a single dad, his kids also like the series, so it would be a chance for him to connect more with them.

I ended by saying that I hope this doesn't discourage him from sharing more things he likes. 

""If anything, it encourages me to find more that you'll appreciate.""

Cue heart flutters.
   
tl;dr: Good talk. He's awesome."

"Update: Me [37 F] with my brother [20 M], he told my abusive mother where I was


Last post: [right here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jeu1o/me_37_f_with_my_brother_20_m_he_told_my_abusive/) 


Sorry for the late update. I wanted to get everything sorted out before I posted again. 


I didn't quit my job. I went back, as embarrassed as I was. My brother wasn't there. My manager said he quit, but she couldn't go into much detail. I'm assuming he did so to avoid getting in trouble or something. Everyone pretended like nothing was wrong and treated me as they normally do. It feels weird to be back, but otherwise okay.


All the calls were from my brother. None from my mom, thankfully. I  don't think he gave her my number, or else she would have called by now. She didn't come over to my house either. Jay left a few voicemails apologizing profusely and crying, but I deleted them. I looked into a restraining order for my mom and I'm getting into the process of getting it done. It's more complicated and expensive than I thought, but I think it's going to be worth it. 


Although many of the commenters from my last post would protest, I did reach out to my brother. I called him today and told him I wanted to talk. We met at a local cafe for lunch. I told him what he did was extremely disrespectful and that I had lost all trust in him. He cried, but he said he understood. We talked some more - not about mom or family or work. Just talk. I told him about the time I went half-way across the world to see a band, but had never went to some beach that was a couple hours away from my old apartment. He told me about the time he went to a movie theater and fell asleep during a particular movie. Then, we mostly sat in silence until I suggested that we go somewhere else. On my way to work, I pass by an expanse of flat land, with some hills in the distance. I've always wanted to watch the sunset from there, and I guessed that today would be a good enough day to try. 


So we went and sat there until the sun went down. It was a beautiful sight - the kind you can't accurately depict in words, paint, or pictures. Then I told my brother something like, ""I don't want to be your best friend or part of your family. I just want to be *my name* and Jay. Just two people, with the same mom, and be happy with who we are."" 


He nodded and said okay. I drove him back to his car. We said goodbye and I went home. For the first time since my mom showed up, I don't feel nervous or scared. I feel okay. I don't know if I really got through to Jay, but even if I didn't, at least I can say I tried. He's a good kid, but now he's got to decide whether to be a mommy's boy for the rest of his life or become truly independent. I can't make that decision for him. Maybe someday we'll be friends again, but right now we're just two people, connected by similar strands of DNA, who can watch the sky as the earth slowly rotates as it orbits the sun together in silence. I'm happy with just that. 


**tl;dr**: Went back to work, cleaned up things with my brother sorta. Feel at peace. "
"My girlfriend [23F] is raging angry because I [23M] slept with someone else when I thought we were broken up.


My girlfriend and I have been together as boyfriend and girlfriend since we were 15, 8 years now.  We were both the first people we'd ever slept with and have been together since then.

Since we kind of matured together along with our relationship, it was basically a high school romance that turned into a real serious relationship.

We were out for dinner on a date last weekend, and we started talking about things and about marriage.  I told her what I'd said before, that I don't really want marriage, at least not now, its not a thing for me. If I do go down that way, I'd at least want it in my thirties.  She started insisting that what she wants is a marriage and she wants it now or at least a promise that it will happen soon. I told her I couldn't promise that, its not for me, its not something I want.  She accused me of being selfish and we got into a big fight and argument.

I then got a text from my sister that my dad was in hospital; I told my girlfriend  I had to go.  She wanted to resolve the marriage thing now and for me to say I'll commit to a marriage some day now, I told her no I couldn't do that, and I had to go now it was urgent.  She said if you leave now, we're through, I told her sorry I had to go.  She was crying and very angry and the whole night was ruined but I had to go to the hospital to see my dad.

I got there and things weren't that serious, he was being discharged shortly after I got there, everything was fine.  I tried to call my girlfriend, she wouldn't answer.

Next morning I tried to call her again, but then I got some texts from her saying we're through and she never wants to see me again, our relationship is over, she doesn't want to have anything to do with me, we're done.  I called her and she answered this time and she pretty much reiterated what she said.

I was devastated and in a state of shock, I was really miserable.  I went to my friends house and my friends were comforting me, telling me everything's okay, I'm better off without her, I don't need her, she's not worth my time.  They told me they were gonna take me out and were gonna make sure I had a good time and could forget about her.  We ended up going to some bars and clubs, but I didn't really have it in me to hit on any girls, but I ended up sleeping with one of the female friends that had gone out with us.  The next morning I thanked her and all that and we said it was just a one night thing, we wouldn't let it impact our friendship.

Things were going okay for 2 days when I got another call from my girlfriend, we talked a bit and said she was sorry for our fight and for her shouting at me.  She said she didn't mean it when she said we were done, she was just caught up in the moment and was angry, she expected that I would have gotten that.  So our relationship resumed.

The next day after that I decided to open up to her about what happened on the day we talked on the phone and how I had slept with my female friend that day.  She was devastated and started crying, shouting at me.  She accused me of cheating and being an asshole, I told her I did nothing wrong I thought we were broken up, she said I should have known we weren't, as if I am supposed to somehow read her mind.

She's been basically trying to guilt me this entire time and has told me I HAVE to give up that close circle of friends I went out with that day, I told her I can't do that, but she's insisting on it.  She keeps saying ""you're the one who cheated, not me"" and keeps questioning if she can be with me after I cheated, even though its ridiculous to say that I cheated.

Am I in the wrong here? Is she right in saying I cheated and I'm an asshole? Or is she just being crazy and I should not get back with her? Or should I agree to what she's saying and try to make things work?

"My [25F] professor [30M] asked me to go on a date after I graduate next month.


I'm currently getting an MA in Communications, set to graduate next week. This past semester, I had a professor (lets call him Mark) who has been a great mentor and resource while I was completing my thesis. His class was quite difficult, but he was always willing to offer assistance to those who needed it.

I did well in his class, although he graded me pretty harshly in the beginning. I was going through a fairly stressful time then (found out my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer) and it definitely reflected in my assignments. He told me that he knew I had more potential than this and asked if there was anything else going on. I confided in him and he offered some words of comfort, but told me that if I needed extensions on any assignments, to tell him beforehand. I accepted the low grades but worked my ass off for the rest of the semester, which showed in my final grades.

Now, I will preface this next part by saying that Mark is incredibly attractive. Girls in the class, who normally would wear jeans and a tshirt to school, will come dressed to impress. Mark is a very good teacher, engaged and incredibly knowledgeable, but he refuses to join in on any social events, pub nights, etc. I figured he must be incredibly private.

I have a few interviews set up for positions within my field. I have a few references lined up and sent Mark and email asking if he could write me a letter of recommendation. We decided to meet at a Starbucks close to the school a week later (yesterday). We were chatting about summer plans, the jobs I've been applying to and other random things when he clears his throat and became really serious. He slid over the recommendation letter in a sealed envelope and told me that he would be interested in going out for dinner with me after my commencement. I asked if he meant as a date, to which he said that he tries to keep his professional life professional and not mix it with his personal life, but since I will be graduating and no longer a student at the college, he would like to take the opportunity to potentially pursue something romantic with me.

I'm pretty sure I was blushing but I just told him that I needed to think about it, to which he completely agreed and hoped he didn't make me uncomfortable. He seemed kind of withdrawn and flustered after that and we left separately shortly after.

This was yesterday and I haven't heard from him/responded to his offer. On one hand, I do really like him but never thought he would be interested in me. The idea of pursuing something more than a teacher/student relationship is definitely something I would enjoy, but would that impact my reputation, or his? I don't want to do anything that puts his job on the line, and even though I'm no longer his student (final grades were submitted two weeks ago), is this still too soon to pursue something?

And, if I do accept, I know I will no longer be able to use him as a character or academic reference, which is fine, but now I'm hesitant to submit the letter of recommendation he compiled for me.

Reddit, I need advice. Would this affect my professional life, or his? Have you had any relationships with former professors? Is this completely wrong? I didn't feel the slightest bit uncomfortable or creeped out by his proposition, but I'm not sure if my judgment is clouded by infatuation. Your advice would be appreciated!

TLDR: My college professor asked me to go on a date with him after I graduate. Is this wrong?

Tl;Dr of my original post: My ex boyfriend refused to introduce me to Indian his family because I am black, once he did, I found out they were racists that would never accept me or our son. When his father died, my ex boyfriend was guilted into leaving us. He came back claiming it was all a mistake and wanted a second chance. 

Ok, now on to the update. 

Hello again everyone! I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and kind words from my last post. It seemed that the consensus was that Raj was using his culture as an excuse to be a coward and not to trust him or take him back. Many also suggested that I talk to a lawyer to get sole custody of my son and get child support ironed out. So the day I posted, it was a day or two after Raj had just showed up. I was shocked to say the least and my mind was everywhere. The next day, Raj showed up again, with my knowledge this time, to discuss a few things. I had dropped my son off at my best friend's house for the time being so that we could talk with no interruptions. The conversation went well. I made it clear that for the foreseeable future, we will not be getting back together. I made sure he knew that I did not trust him and that at the moment, I didn't even like who he was as person. He asked if I still loved him and I answered honestly that I did, but at this point in time, it didn't matter. He didn't really remark on that, but seemed to take it at face value. He said that he understood why we couldn't be together but that he'd wait for me to be ready again. I told him not to hold his breath and that he needed to focus on being father and not a boyfriend. Which brings me to the next and most important part of the conversation. I told him that, again, for the foreseeable future, he would only be having supervised visits with our son under my discretion. We would be meeting at a specific place at a specific time and if he missed one meeting, then all bets were off. I also did not want my son to be in contact with anyone from his family. He agreed to all of that with a minor caveat to the last part. He said that when he left his family and cut contact with them, that his sister left too (the same sister that was at the dinner and looked to be sympathetic to me and my son). Apparently she realized what was happening was wrong and decided to take a stand. I was weary of his sister and told him that I'd have to meet her and speak with her a few times before I was comfortable with her being around my son. I informed Raj that I was going to see a lawyer to talk about custody and child support. He said ultimately, like in a few years, he'd like close to fifty fifty time, but for now he'd go with whatever I wanted. He also threw out a number for child support, more than what I was thinking, and we agreed to that number. Of course we will get this all legally taken care of because his word is shit. At the end of the conversation, I suggested he go and see someone about his family issues and the guilt he feels and he mentioned he had already looked into it. I'm not sure if that meant he has been going or what, but as of right now, I'm not going to push. 

So that initial conversation was great. I went and saw a lawyer and he said with our history, I would have no problem getting everything I asked for, especially since Raj isn't putting up a fight. We have an appointment with a mediator in the next few weeks to make it all legally binding. Ever since he's been back, Raj has been calling everyday to talk to our son. A few days after our second conversation, he brought a check for the back child support, something I hadn't yet asked for nor was expecting so quickly. He has been showing up for all of our meet-ups, early at that, and spends the entire with our son and not trying to get back with me. That was something I was worried about, but he's been trying to prove he can be a father. Before he left, I would've said he was an excellent, hands on dad and it looks like that guy is coming back. But again, it's only been like three weeks. I'll be more confident once he's been consistent for 6 months, a year, two years.

Yesterday I met with him and his sister without my son and she seems like a nice person. She was really apologetic and even cried. Apparently on top of thinking it was wrong the way his parents acted, she's a lesbian and her orientation is frowned upon by their mother. As an aside, I don't want anyone to think all Indian people are racist homophobes (especially since a lot of people of the same or similar culture were commenting on my last post saying they'd experienced something similar), but Raj's family are some seriously judgmental people. Together, they tried to show me proof that they had cut off their family. They showed me unanswered text messages, played me angry voicemails that weren't in English, but they sounded mad and Raj translated. He showed me an email that his mother sent that was in English basically telling him that if he came back now and married the girl they had lined up for him, all would be forgiven. But if he didn't, he was disowned and they would never talk to him again. His reply to that was that he was with his family and that he was not going to leave us again. It seemed to be legit, but I'm skeptical. Nothing but time will fix that. 

So there you have it. Raj is being a father, we are not getting back together anytime soon, if at all, and he has cut off his family for good (hopefully). I know many said that I shouldn't have even given him another chance to be in our son's life, but making that decision would not have been fair to my son. Raj knows this is his last chance and that he better not fuck up. 

**tl;dr**: Raj and I are not getting back together, but he is involved in our child's life. I went and saw a lawyer and things are getting straightened out. We are taking things slow as far as a friendship and I'm still leery. 

P.S- For shame, I fucked up on the title and it's in all caps. Sigh, lol. "
"[Updates] I [32M] need to exercise to manage chronic pain, my girlfriend [30F] of ~1 year is making this difficult


Update to: https://redd.it/4h1jxg

tl'dr of that post: I need to exercise regularly to stave off serious back pain, my gf of ~1 year, Debbie, guilts me into skipping my workouts.

It's been a few weeks since my first post, and I thought I'd let people know how it all panned out. Sorry, this gets long. I'm not good at telling stories, I don't know what's relevant or not.

The main thing I took away from the advice on that thread was that I need to grow a spine (haha) and not let Debbie pressure me into unhealthy habits. It also forced me to think more about how her behavior and neediness was more concerning than I had really appreciated.

So, a couple of days after that post I printed out a workout schedule (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and committed to getting up at 6am (I'm an early riser) to hit the gym. I showed the schedule to Debbie, and let her know that I'd be keeping to it as strictly as possible (barring emergencies). I tried to be non-accusatory, and she seemed supportive and understanding.

I make it to two morning workouts without incident, before she brings it up on Thursday night before we go to bed. She wants to know if I'll be going to the gym in the morning, and I tell her that of course I am. She tells me that she's missed me sooo much when I've been gone the two other mornings this week. I tell her that I'm really sorry about that, but we've spent every evening together, and she sleeps a couple of hours later than me anyway so I would just be hanging out to wait for her to wake up. I must have been too harsh with this, because she got very quiet and upset.

Unfortunately, I can be a bit of a people-pleaser, and I hate to see her unhappy, so I suggested that she come to the gym with me the next morning. Honestly, I did not want this, and I was hoping she would say no. It was dumb and weak of me to suggest it in the first place. But, she says she will come. I warn her that this means getting up at six and she just sort of laughs it off. The next morning, I wake up, and wake her up. She gets up and starts to get ready, but it's taking so long. After she's been in the bathroom for fifteen minutes I have to tell her that I'm leaving in ten minutes with or without her.

She comes out soon after and I see that she's been putting on her make-up. I'm flabbergasted. I understand that women live with a different set of expectations than men about appearance, but if she had planned to do make-up she should have planned her time ahead. (Is make-up before the gym even a good idea? Doesn't it sweat off? Never mind, this was weeks ago and I'm still a bit pissed.) I tell her that I'm twenty minutes behind schedule and I'm leaving. Her response is that it's okay, she doesn't need to be in the office until nine and there's plenty of time. I'm seething at this point, I have to go to the gym, and I have to be in the office by eight and I'm running out of time to get any of this done. The comment that _she_ has plenty of time so it's not a problem just makes me see red.

I count to ten, I focus on my breathing, I mostly calm down. We go to the gym, and I tell her that I'll be on the mats doing my exercise. She can join me if she wants, but it's pretty technical stuff and probably not that interesting to her. I'm probably being noticeably cold to her at this point as I'm irritated by the whole experience of the morning. I know it wasn't a mature way to handle it all, and I definitely could have been more accommodating of her feelings.

When I finish up, I can't find her. I try to call her, but it just rings out. I wait outside the changing rooms for a few minutes until I have to leave to go to work. I send her some messages to explain that I'm leaving the gym to go to work, and I assume she's done the same?

After that, I didn't hear from her for a couple of days. She made a couple of posts to Instagram so I knew she was alright, but she wouldn't respond to any of my direct messages/phonecalls. I send her an email to tell her I'm sorry I lost my temper, but I felt that she was disrespectful of my time and my health, and that we shouldn't try to go to the gym together again without a clear understanding of each other's timetables and needs. I assume that she's angry at me because I left the gym without her, which was shitty of me. I apologize for that as well.

Eventually, she calls me on Sunday afternoon. We meet to talk in a park (half way between her place and mine, neutral ground). Then I start to understand what she's thinking. Because my gym routine involves mostly stretches and light core work, I spend most of my time there in the ""female"" section of the gym (mats, swiss balls, yoga poses), and not the ""male"" part (heavy weights and intense cardio). I paraphrasing her thoughts, this isn't how I see the gym. Also, people who get to the gym early in the morning tend to look good because they're living healthily, exercising and all that. So, when she saw me saunter over to the corner populated by fit attractive women, it confirmed everything she was afraid of when we spent time apart.

Now she wanted me to quit that gym because she felt she couldn't trust me. I was distraught: I've never cheated on anyone and I don't think I've ever given her reason to think I would. I ask her if she can't trust me when I'm in the gym for less than an hour a day, how does she feel about me working all day, or hanging out with friends without her. Her view was that she couldn't change my work that so she just had to learn to live with it, and I don't see my friends often anyway so that's okay, but any extra activities should be restricted as much as possible. On the one hand, I can't believe that she honestly thinks we should spend every second of every day together, on the other hand that's exactly how she's shaped the relationship for months and I've let her.

We talked a lot more over a few days about jealousy and trust. At the end of it all, she won't budge. I have to quit the gym, or she can't see how she would ever trust me. For once, I don't just roll over and give her what she wants. It's not just about membership in an excellent gym (cheap, 24 hours, good facilities, great location). It's about her disregard for my health, disrespect of my time, and complete inability to show me any trust. In the end, I broke up with her. She didn't take it very well, first begging me not to, then getting angry and saying this proved that she was right about me. It was rough. After a few days of alternately abusive and begging texts/emails/facebook I ended up blocking her. ~~In a few months time I might unblock her and gently reach out to see how she is, but for now~~ I just can't have her in my life.

I definitely could have handled this all better. I think if I'd been more assertive early on then I wouldn't have gotten so quietly angry and maybe everything would have been cleaner.

**tl;dr**: ""Debbie"" revealed that she didn't trust me going to the gym (or doing anything else) alone. We broke up. :-(

edit: okay geez, guys, I get it. I'm not going to contact her in the future. :-) Thanks for all the feedback and support everyone."
"My [18F] stepdad [52m] is threatening to cut me off of paying for my college after he found out I was sexually active. He wants a signed contract saying I won't have sex or I lose he and my mom paying for anything. My mom is silent as usual.


Edit: lots of people are saying to look for key loggers or other programs he may habe installed. I have all Apple stuff, MacBook, iPhone and IPad...how do I check for these things? Espcially maybe the cameras ? Is there things he could install to see what my camera is showing?


Edit 2: so this just got a whole lot weirder. I'm freaked out about maybe he saw some Skype stuff that I had (won't go into details but it was very private and not like cam girl stuff) so he just left for work and I got onto his desktop which id done before for school and snooped a little bit and there was a folder called ""random"" and in the sub folders were lots of porn. Another sub folder had my initials and I opened it and it was all pics of me in swimsuits from all the summer vacations we'd taken. There's nothing bad and I've seen most of the pictures before but it is super creepy that they are in his porn folder. I feel like I'm going to throw up. He's never touched me, I mean no hug even when I graduated type thing but this is ducking gross. Now it's a whole new problem.

Edit 3: just called my mom and said I needed to talk to her, she said that she couldn't come home and then screamed at me that it this was about Roger, I've been trying to break she and him up since day one and I've never given him a fair chance and he would never ask anything that wasn't fair and that he was twice the husband and father my real dad was (was to stick the knife in by saying that--sheesh) and that if I didn't like it I could move out by the end of the day. She slammed the phone down before I could even bring up the folder. I am fucking lost and don't even know where to begin. I feel gross, I feel violated I feel like my back is against a wall.


Edit 4 and last one for a while. Two detectives with the sherrifs department came, I showed them the folder and he said he was going to have to consult his supervisors but he was pretty sure There is now enough evidence to get a search warrant. I have no idea of the timelines. I called around to a few people and came up with my HS boyfriends mom who always really liked me. He's in Europe for the simmer so I can stay with her and his dad with no weirdness while this gets sorted out. I am not telling my mom that I'm leaving as I don't want her to tip roger and have him delete anything before the detectives can get the warrant.
Thank you very much for the help I will update in a few weeks if possible.

Throwaway as ""Roger"" is a big time redditor, but even then he may recognize this but I have no idea where else to turn.

My real dad died when I was 11. He went in to Doctor with a stomach ache and came out with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and was gone in 4 months. It was and is heartbreaking. 

My mom, as can be expected, was a basket case but even then she and I did ok by ourselves. We became more like sisters navigating the trauma because she was out of it as far as being a mother went. It actually wasn't bad and I grew a ton and it allowed me to focus on something other than my own loss. 

About 1.5 years later she met Roger online. He creeped me out from day one. Not like he touched me creepy but just very nosy and attached himself to my mom really quickly. He also tried to pretend to be my dad really soon which I hated. He has his own daughter roughly my age who ive never met because they are estranged which just adds to the whole bad vibe of him.

Despite numerous red flags my mom married him about a year after meeting. I did my best to be supportive of my mom but I spent most of my teenage years either in my room or at friends houses. To his credit Roger is a good provider and always promised to pay for my college out of pocket. I felt like he was trying to buy my love but I'm not stupid and realize that this is a generous offer no matter how I look at it. 

I just got home from freshman year and have resumed spending most of my time in my room. Tonight when I came down to eat, Roger was sitting by himself at the table and said we needed to talk. I sat down and he basically said ""your mother and I know you were sexually active at school. We are paying for you to get an education, not drink, party, get pregnant or get an STD."" He slid a piece of paper over the table at me which says that I promise I will not have sex while I'm at college and even had a place for me to sign. He said if I don't sign than I need either find a way to pay myself or drop out and get a job and either move out or pay him rent. 

I told him I would think about it but was and am REALLY creeped out because this feels so intrusive. I did have sex a few times but have no idea how he would know so I'm thinking maybe he's guessing which seems even weirder. 

I tried to talk to my mom when she got home but her exact words were ""I'm too stressed out with work to even think about discussing this."" 

I'm lost...totally lost. I don't even really care about having sex but this just seems so intrusive and weird and controlling. I could sign and just do my own thing anyways but that just seems to be playing his weird game.

Should I even consider this? If I don't I will very likely be cut off from college.

   
**tl;dr**: Stepdad is threating to cut off paying for college unless I sign a contract promising not to have sex. Do I even consider it?"
"[UPDAT]: My parents [54F and 66M] want to give me a place to live, rent-free after graduation from university. I [21M] want to be independent.


[Original Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lpuoq/my_parents_54f_and_66m_want_to_give_me_a_place_to/)

So almost everybody in the comments wanted me to take my parents up on their offer. I got the realization that renting my own place in London wasn't as brilliant of an idea as I thought. I then looked for flat listings online. I've done it before a couple of times (very casually) and was always put off by the prices, but I'd just figured that I'd ""eventually find a cheaper place"". After hours of combing the listings, I realized how shitty my options were with my own budget. I eventually started to warm up to my parents' offer. 

I talked to my brother over the phone, and he asked me if I was still looking for my own place. I told him that I wasn't so sure anymore. He then said pretty much the same thing as the commenters in the thread: that independence didn't necessarily mean renting a place by myself. He told me that I would be gaining my independence quicker if I just saved my salary instead of spending most of it on rent. My brother also said that I shouldn't feel the need to be a martyr just to prove a point.

When my brother said it, it really made more sense to me. Plus, he said that it would be lonely living in such a big place without someone else. I hadn't considered that, and felt sort of guilty for making it seem like I didn't want to live with him or something. 

After my brother and I finished talking, I called my parents. They were delighted by my change of heart. I told them why I was so adamant before about finding my own place: that I was afraid of others judging me for being a typical rich kid who lived life on easy mode. It wasn't really all about the independence aspect. 

In university, people used to talk behind my back and say stuff about how I was only in the program because of who my father was. This happened when I was in high school too. It made me angry and I worked really hard just to prove that I got where I was because of my own merit. Even after I secured my trainee placement, some of my jealous classmates spread rumours that my father had arranged it for me. They never knew how many hours I spent on my application essays, preparing for the interview, etc. I guess I just wanted to prove to them that I can be self-sufficient without my family's money or connections.

My mother told me that I didn't have to prove myself to anybody. She told me that as long as I was convinced that I deserved to be where I was, then nothing else mattered. She said that I should be thankful of my privilege and take advantage of it without abusing it.

Also, I think my concerns about coworkers knowing my living conditions was a bit paranoid. They have their own lives to worry over and probably wouldn't care less. 

So in the end, I accepted their offer. My parents were very glad and assured me that they wouldn't make my brother monitor me or enforce curfews or anything. Best of all, they've hired a housekeeper to come and clean the place once in a while. They even considered hiring a cook but I shot down that suggestion pretty quick. My cooking is horrendous but I want to try and improve it. 

I thanked them and promised not to throw any wild parties in the flat. Once I start getting my salary, I'm thinking of getting them a nice present or vacation, just to show how grateful I am. I still feel guilty to some extent over my good fortune, but the guilt doesn't outweigh the prospect of having an awesome flat near St James' Park to look forward to.

Well, I've procrastinated enough. Gotta get back to studying for finals.

TL;DR: After reading through comments and talking with family members, I eventually warmed up to my parent's offer. I realized that independence didn't necessarily mean living my myself, and that I shouldn't have to feel guilty over my privilege.

"My [16, M] parents think all I do is masturbate, but I've really been playing 2048.


This is a little weird, sorry. Remember that game 2048 that was popular a couple of years ago? My friends and I were talking about it for some reason and I realized I had never beaten it. So over the past two weeks-ish I've been super into it (still haven't beaten it, btw, even though I know how to. so annoying).

Well I was playing a lot and I ended up spraining my hand. My parents think I did this masturbating. I tried to tell them that I was just playing a game on my phone but they kind of did the whole ""mhmm sure honey"" thing and since then my dad has talked to me twice about how it's okay to have these urges, but I should be careful about injuring myself. But I wasn't masturbating!

How do I convince my parents to stop giving me sex talks? How do I get them to believe that I was just playing way too much 2048?

   
**tl;dr**: I sprained my hand trying to beat 2048 but my parents think I've been spending all my time masturbating. They don't believe me when I tell them otherwise, and I don't want to sit through another sex talk.

"I [32M] am on holiday with my wife [32F], son [12M] and sister [29F]. My wife is demanding my sister apologise to our entire family because our son walked in on her in the bathroom, my sister is refusing and its causing a big rift.


My wife and I have been married for 8 years, we got married a while after we had our son.  He's the only kid we've had so far.

We've recently embarked on a holiday trip, currently staying in a hotel room, including me, my wife, our son, and my sister who has joined us on the trip.  We've been here 5 days and we have a bit more than a week left before we're scheduled to go back.

Now I wasn't there when this happened, so all I have are second hand accounts.   Apparently when my sister was in the bathroom, (there's only one in our hotel room)  having a shower or whatever, our son walked in there.  Reportedly he didn't even knock, he just walked in, and my sister was in there naked.  Apparently she saw him and they had a chat together and she didn't bother to cover up the entire time, she was washing and drying up or whatever.

Now when my wife found out she freaked out, and I heard both accounts of events from both my sister and my son since they were the only ones present and it seems to match up.  My son didn't knock, he walked right in when he knew a woman was in there, he didn't apologise or excuse himself.

My wife is demanding my sister make this big and meaningful formal apology to all of us, for apparently the crime of 'exposing' herself to him.  Even though she didn't do anything, it was our son that was in the wrong for just walking in there without knocking or excusing himself or anything.  If anyone should apologise, its our son.

My sister said its okay, she doesn't think he needs to apologise, she thinks he's a good boy and he didn't mean anything wrong by it, he didn't do anything wrong, he just wanted something from the bathroom and he asked politely and they had a meaningful conversation.  She said he's very adorable and we should be proud we raised a good boy, but I told them I still think he should apologise for not knocking.

My wife is insisting that my sister apologise to all of us.  My sister is having none of it, she's refusing to apologise and insisting she did nothing wrong.  I agreed with my sister and my wife got angry at me for siding with my sister instead of her.  She said I should always side with her since she's my wife, but I told her she's being ridiculous about this whole thing since my sister did nothing wrong, its our son who should apologise.

My wife has been since giving the silent treatment to my sister, refusing to talk to her until she apologises and has been angry with me.  Its creating this really sour situation and ruining the entire trip.  Any idea what I can do to fix this stupid and horrible situation?

   
**tl;dr**: While staying in a hotel, our son walked in on my sister in the bathroom without even knocking or apologising.  My wife things my sister was in the wrong and wants her to apologise, my sister refused.  I sided with my sister and said our son is the one who should apologise.  Wife got angry, is not speaking to my sister at all, its ruining the entire trip."
"My brother's [21M] girlfriend [19F] thinks I [22F] dress and act inappropriately around him. Does she have a point?


was told to repost. forgot the tldr for the first. 

My brother and I rent an apartment together. We attend the same university and are both in engineering courses. So we both rent an apartment that is close to the engineering faculty. Our rooms are next to each other but we use different bathrooms. My brother has been dating his girlfriend for 6 months and she comes over sometimes and stays over a few nights. She doesn't live with us permanently and pays no rent.


At home i wear shorts and tank tops or thin shift dresses. We live in a humid and hot country so i prefer to dress like that at home. The air conditioning in our apartment doesnt work properly and leaks if we leave it on too long. I have large breasts and have to wear bras with underwires and they can get very uncomfortable so i prefer not to wear a bra at home. Bro's girlfriend thinks i dress very inappropriately around my brother. She requested me to wear jeans or long pants in the house. I dont really think I'm doing anything wrong. Am I dressing too skimpy? She used the word 'skimpy' and revealing to describe it.


Bro and i share a balcony where we air dry our clothes. Sometimes i dry my underwear and bra there. My brother also dries his underwear there. His girlfriend freaked out about it and says i should not dry my underwear and bras around where my brother can see them. Is this inappropriate? Or weird?


Another thing is my brother does not wear a shirt around the house. This one i can see why she is upset over but this was how we were raised. My dad and brother often dont wear shirts around the house. I've seen my uncles shirtless in the house too. Its not a sexual thing in our family.

The last thing is that sometimes i pick up food for my brother on the way home and vice versa. Bro's girlfriend thinks this is something that we should only do for a boyfriend or girlfriend.
Personally i don't see anything wrong in the way I dress or behave around my brother. Its just two siblings sharing a living space. Do you think shes right?


**tl;dr**: my brothers girlfriend thinks I dress too skimpy and revealing and do other inappropriate stuff such as drying my bras and underwear where he can see them and buying food for each other which she sees as a boyfriend/girlfriend thing to do. Does she have a point?"
"My girlfriend (25F) of 6 months proposed to me (28M)


Not sure what to think about it. She proposed to me over the weekend with a ring and everything. Before this happened I thought that she might be ""the one"" if things kept going as well as they were but the whole thing was such a turn off. We've only been together 6 months and I don't think that's long enough to know you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. I've been married before (and have a 2 year old kid) so I'm trying to be pretty cautious with big life changing decisions like that. 


I said no and we're still together but things are very tense now. She's really depressed and is crying a lot. I feel bad for her. I'm unsure where to go from here. Her proposal was a huge turn off. 1 we have only been together for six months and 2 I'm not the kind of guy that wants to be proposed to. I know it's perfectly fine for women to propose to their boyfriends but that's not something I ever wanted and I'm surprised she thought I would go for that. 3rd reason is she barely even knows my son, they've met twice and I can't decide if she would be a good step mom based off of those two meetings. 


What happens now?

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4joi5e/my_23f_boyfriends_24m_ex_24f_just_had_a_baby_she/

First, thank you all that gave me real advice and didn't just insult me. I appreciate it. 

My boyfriend and I talked to a lawyer the day after I posted the post and we decided to fight to get DNA done and then fight to custody from there. 
I then called child services yet again and asked why she was allowed to keep the child with her in a mental hospital,we didn't get off the phone until We spoke to someone very high up. I have since found out a few things. 


1. The baby has been taken away from her. She is with her grandparents. The mother is allowed very strict access.  We aren't sure what happened exactly but we're told  she was about to intentionally harm the child and was going send me and my boyfriend photos of the harm and tell us it was our fault. 

2. We went to see this baby last week with our lawyer present and took a home DNA kit. It was negative and our lawyer told us she has since retracted her statement saying he is the father, we still need to get a proper DNA test but the child support payments have been stopped until then. 


3. we're engaged. His words were ""if you are willing to stick by me through all this then I know that we are prepared for living a life together"" so, yay :)

Thank you everyone who helped. We appreciate it. 


   
**tl;dr**: DNA says he is not the father. Baby is away from the mother. "
"Me [29f] with my fiance [29m] 3 years, he saw my Pinterest wedding board and now thinks I'm a vapid girl who ""wants a wedding, not a marriage.""


Marriage has been on the horizon for us for 6 months or so. We've talked about it, and he said he was going to start putting away money for a ring. I thought it would be smart to put together a range of rings that I liked, so I went on Pinterest and made an album with about 10-15 designs I liked. I erased the captions and put in what I liked about the designs. 

I shared the board with him and he was happy to have these options so he has an idea of what I might like without me being like, ""Buy me this one.""

Since knowing this was happening, I started another board for wedding ideas. There's about 150 pins, ranging from invitations to floral arrangements to dresses, checklists, etc. I just pin things I want to read later, ideas, images I like.

Now, I've always used Pinterest. I happen to love it and think it's great for recipes, crafts, etc. But my BF found that board the other day, and he went through it. It wasn't personal and private or anything, so I'm not mad about ""snooping"" or anything like that.

He started getting upset about it, and told me he thinks I'm ""one of those girls who wants a wedding, not a marriage."" I have no idea where he's gotten this idea. But he went on this whole rant about ""vapid women buying into the wedding industry."" We'd talked about eloping instead or just going to the courthouse, and I was on board, but he wasn't!

I don't understand what is going on. My pinboard is full of money-saving ideas, DIY this and that, how to get your dress cheaper, checklists, etc. I even showed him this and he said it made me look like a bridezilla.

To me, it's not much different than collecting wedding magazines or something like that. We've already set a hard budget at $10,000, and most of that was offered up by our parents.

I've tried to talk to him about it, ask him if he's nervous or something, and he just says ""Don't turn this around on me, this is about you being obsessed with weddings and wanting a party, not a marriage!""

Am I losing my mind? Is having a Pinterest board to organize all this stuff somehow indicative that I'm like this? Why does he keep repeating ""you want a wedding, not a marriage!""

**Edit: I seem to have left out the detail that he did in fact officially propose already!**
   
**tl;dr**: Fiance saw my pinterest board for our upcoming wedding and completely flipped out, thinking I'm a vapid girl who ""wants a wedding, not a marriage."" I don't know where this is coming from and I feel like I've lost my mind. What do I do?!"
"[UPDATE] My[26M] little sister[18F] sent this email and disappeared, where do I go from here?


[ORIGINAL POST CAN BE FOUND HERE](https://redd.it/4lsqa6)

I read all the comments in the last thread and I've thought long and hard. I thought about how it used to be me and my sister against the world and at some point, I became one of the enablers of her abuse when she trusted me to protect her. I walk into her room sometimes and see her cat sleeping on her bed. I keep thinking I'll wake up and hear her playing her shitty old keyboard that she kept all these years. But I realise, as much as I want her to be around, and I want her to love me again, more than anything, I want her to be happy, I want her to sit her exams at school so she can go to study what she wanted to study. I transferred some money into her account to help her find somewhere to stay. My parents don't even seem to care that she could be hurt. They only seem angry that everyone thinks they're bad parents now. I lived away from home between the ages of 20-22 but I moved back in when my mum's health started going downhill. If I can take my sister's cat, I'll consider leaving again, but I'm not sure. I will be attending therapy. I really will do whatever it takes to be a better big brother.

I sent her an email back. I know she said not to contact her again but I just want her to be safe. Tango is the name of the cat, for reference.

""[Sister],

I'm sorry for contacting you when you told me not to, I promise, this will be the last time I break your boundaries. I just wanted to let you know that I am truly ashamed and regretful of my part in everything that hurt you. I put some money into your account. You do not owe me anything for it, and it's not a loan, I just want you to be safe. Please remember to eat properly and pick up your medication. Please attend your exams. I promise, only I know when they are out of the family, and I won't tell anyone else. I'll take good care of Tango.

I know there will be a day where you will be whole again and healed. I know that depression is a horrible demon that you have fought every day of your life for years, I know that now, but you are so much stronger than it. But when that day comes, I know you do not owe me anything and I don't deserve it, but I hope you'll be generous enough to give me another chance.

I love you and stay safe,

[sisterless2016]""

**tldr:** I realised I was making it about me, reevaluated what was really important, and sent her some money and a single email.

**Additional Update because she responded:**

""[Sisterless2016],

Maybe I'm weak for giving in and replying, but I don't care. For once, I'm going to do what I want regardless of what anyone thinks. I keep wanting to consult someone about what I should do but that someone was always you until a few years ago. I want to be strong on my own, I don't want to rely on you or anyone else anymore. I don't want everything mum and [oldest brother] said about me to be true. I'm not going to be a burden to you or anyone else. I'm doing fine, I have a place to stay, I'm still doing my freelance work.

If what you want is any kind of relationship between us, maybe one day, when you have fixed yourself, and I don't have a million other problems on my plate, I'll give it a shot, but we will never be a family again. It will never be us, mum and dad, and [oldest brother] again.""

I'm not going to respond to this one, I don't want her to feel like I'm trying to get the last word. It's only been a few days and maybe I'm imagining it but she seems so much more confident. I'm really glad she made it clear what she wants. I've been trying to get my parents to go to therapy as well, but they insist that they didn't do anything wrong and it's all in her head.

She sort of confirmed what I thought was the case. When she was younger I supported her through everything, and she always came to me when she needed help, then I let her down. I don't think I can begin to understand how much that hurt her. I was an idiot. When she started getting really depressed and not talking to me and hiding in her room I made it about me, I took it as a personal attack instead of realising she was unwell.

But I am so overwhelmingly happy that she's doing fine. I'm just so happy that she made it out okay. I'm going to miss her but she's fine, and that's what matters.

"UPDATE:My [24F] sister [31/F] just ruined our relationship because of her boyfriend [27/M] who she doesn't even like and cheats on.


Here is the link to the [original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j6mq1/my_24_f_sister_31f_just_ruined_our_relationship/)

First, I would like to thank you guys. There was a lot of advice (and insightful criticisms) given in the original post of this situation. 

A lot has happened since that time.

Last Friday, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread with the looming prospect of telling Greg about the cheating. I texted Greg that I wanted to hang out before he left and he happily agreed. After I got off work that day we went to get some food. I wanted a couple of hours having a nice lunch and talking about completely unrelated topics. 

I did happen to thank him for letting me stay at his place while in school for all this time. He said it was no problem and that it was nice having me in the apartment with him and Ashley. After leaving on the way back to my new apartment, I felt even more sick and started second guessing myself. There was a moment that I didn't even want to go through with it because of how he would react.

I asked him to come into my place and sit on the bed (I don't have any other chairs at the moment). He looked confused but patiently sat down. It was quiet for a moment before I again thanked him for everything and told him I was so incredibly proud of his accomplishments. As per the suggestion of a commenter on the last thread, I started off with telling him that I hadn't been as good as a friend (or sister since we consider each other family) as I should have been. He looked confused. 

I started off by asking him to please not sign a lease with Ashley yet. He asked why. I decided to tell him about the sock in the laundry incident and the way Ashley blew up at me the past week. I then showed him the horrible text message that Ashley sent me. He quietly looked over it and there was an awful pause before I simply told him that she was cheating.

I then started uncontrollably crying, shaking, and apologizing. It was like...verbal diarrhea. I couldn't stop. I unloaded everything that I had been keeping and hinting at for the past year. I told him about the multiple men, and how she fell in love with one. I also mentioned her past sexual/verbal abuse I had experienced at her hands. I told him that she was an awful person and that I was so sorry that someone from my family had betrayed and hurt him like this.

The hardest part was admitting that I had known for a year and had said nothing because I was financially strapped and weirdly loyal to my sister. I told him I take responsibility for knowing this and that I acknowledge this could mean he never wants to talk to me again.

It was awful watching Greg's face go from content happiness to seeing his shoulders fall and his head hang low. He was quiet for a moment thinking. Greg then told me that he wasn't surprised. A part of him had lots of suspicion but didn't want to believe it. He then told me that he had known the relationship was deteriorating for a while  but wasn't ready to let it go.

He then gave me a hug and told me he wasn't mad at me, and said that he understands how I handled the situation. Greg was very sympathetic and told me that he still considers me his sister. I cried even more at this point.

After all this, I told him that I couldn't wait for him to find someone who loves him over where he would be working. He assured me that he had gotten a gym membership and would be working on himself. 
I have no doubt that he will be an amazing catch for the right person.

After this, I mentioned that if he wanted to stay with either myself or my boyfriend the next couple of days that would be fine. He declined the offer. He then sat on the bed for a minute before getting up.

Greg told me that this wasn't the first time a woman had cheated on him. He said he just has bad luck picking them.  

After he left, I lay in bed for a while-emotionally taxed and exhausted.

At around 11:30 pm I get a call from my mother. She is hysterical and asking me what happened (she lives in another state). I asked her what was wrong and she told me that a woman had called her and left a message asking to speak to the mother of Ashley. My Mom called back but the line was busy each time. She also tried to call Ashley-who's phone went to voicemail. She begged me to call the police to make sure everything was okay. 

At this point I was worried so I then called Greg but his phone went immediately to voice mail. Greg had reassured me he was calm and collected earlier so I decided to wait until the next morning for any feedback.

Greg calls me in the morning and tells me what happened. He had gone to the apartment and confronted Ashley before she left for the gym. He threw down a framed letter/poem he had written for her and it broke. He told her he knew everything.

Ashley then runs into the bathroom crying. She then starts saying really weird, morbid things and threatens to kill herself. Greg, being a good guy and not wanting that to happen calls the police. The police come and instead arrest Greg on charges of domestic violence. Apparently the police didn't want to, but because of the broken frames-they had to take him in anyway.

Ashley was taken for psychiatric evaluation but was released the following day. I was numb hearing all this and felt terrible. Greg still was in impossibly positive spirits despite everything. He was released the next day as well and would have to appear for a later court date. Ashley had told him she would do everything in her power to convince the court he was innocent/non-violent. Greg thanked her but said it changed nothing. 

So, after this Reddit, I went on a week long vacation (thus-the late update). I called Greg who said he was doing well. He is now trying to find a place near his new job and is trying to put this mess behind him. Greg is worried about this being on his record (it's squeaky clean) and doesn't want this to reflect negatively on him.

I offered any legal assistance I could and will wait to see how this turns out.

Despite everything...I'm relieved that I told him. I'm happy he is free to live the life he deserves-away from her. I realize that Greg still wanting to be in my life is more than I deserve-but this has been a huge lesson for me.

tl;dr: I told Greg everything, shit went down. Everyone is trying to move on now."
"(UPDATE) My coworker (30M) comes up to me (27F) and tickles me regularly. I've asked him to stop a lot and he won't.


[removed]"
"(22F)My flatmate (22F) wants me to cover up when I'm around her boyfriend (25M)


I've been friends with this girl for EVER, since we were toddlers probably, she was always carefree and fun to be around. 

We've been sharing an apartment for the past 6 months and at first it was amazing, but now her insecurities are starting to drive me INSANE.

She's been with her boyfriend since she was 15, and she's kinda controlling- for example;

She doesn't let him watch porn, she thinks watching porn is cheating, looking at photos of girls online is also cheating.

He's not allowed to make friends with women or talk to any women unless they're her friends, if they're attractive then she thinks it's a form of cheating too

He's not allowed to go to the beach without her cause there's skinny girls and he might ogle them (seriously, she said that) she doesn't go with him either cause she's insecure about her weight

We can't ever watch movies together cause when she sees an attractive actress she accuses him of ''thinking of fucking her'' (I've witnessed too many of these arguments, it's embarrassing)

She doesn't let him friend women on social media

She won't let him hang out with friends cause they're single and ''attract women'' and will ''brainwash him'' into cheating on her. 

Now, I don't really care what she does in her relationship, I mean if the guy enjoys being isolated and emotionally abused then it's not my place to tell him otherwise, but lately she's trying to control how I live MY life. 

Her boyfriend is usually there when I get home from work, which is around 6PM then he leaves late at night.. I don't always chill with them, so most of the time, I shower, change into some comfty clothes (sweatpants/shorts and a Tshirt) and go to my room to read or watch something or pass out. 

Yesterday she started complaining that my shorts are too short for me to wear around her boyfriend, and I'm ''putting on a show''

I told her that this is MY apartment too and I'm allowed to change into comfortable clothes after work, and there is no way in hell she's going to dictate what I wear and what I don't wear, she yelled at me and said I'm insensitive to her feelings, that I'm just as bad as the girls in porn (lol wtf) and that I'm doing it on purpose to show off how thin I am and make HER feel fat. 

??????????????????????

I tried to explain that I'm not doing any of those things cause that's just RIDICULOUS, I'm just trying to feel comfortable in my own HOME. She threw a fit. She wasn;t even listening to what I was saying, just talking over me and yelling about stupid shit. 

I got really angry so before saying something that I'll probably regret, I shut up and went back to my room. 

This already happened twice before, the first time she complained that my dress was too tight, and I told her that it's none of her business what I wear.. (another tantrum) and the second time she was complaining that I don't wear a bra at home and I should have some decency around her boyfriend.. I started wearing a bra after that to keep the peace. 

Should I bother with this girl or just leave and try and find another roommate? I'm really getting sick of her flipping out and being completely delusional, I feel like she doesn't respect me at all. 

Is there any hope?

TL;DR - Best friend is very controlling with boyfriend and now is trying to control what I wear around him, not sure if I should try and fix things or just leave. "
"[UPDATE] I (28F) have been seeing a co-worker (31M) for three months. We are meant to go away tomorrow for the weekend and he's ignoring me


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l7gvl/i_28f_have_been_seeing_a_coworker_31m_for_three/

Well that got dramatic fast. I was really upset about Andy's behaviour so I confided in another co-worker that has been friends with him for a long time. 

Turn out he has a girlfriend! Of ELEVEN years!!! He never mentioned her in work and she's never come to staff night out or visited the office. He's not on Facebook and she's not on Twitter so she's never popped up on my social media. I was FLOORED.

I confronted him and he said they are very unhappy and have a dead bedroom, but he felt too guilty about cheating to go away to a hotel with me- she was away that weekend at a bachelorette party. However we have been physically intimate loads of times in the past so he's cheated on her with me already. He keeps swearing he loves me but can't leave her immediately because she would be too hurt. He wants to leave her eventually and be with me. I didn't even know what to say to that so I walked out of his office and have been avoiding him.

I'm devastated and I don't know how to react at all. I feel like I can't talk to any of my friends about it because I was evidentially the other woman and I'll be judged. I'm an absolute mess of emotions right now and my heart is completely broken. I really had fallen hard for him and I thought he would be the one.

I want to tell her but it could ruin my career. I don't know how to let her find out without him knowing it was me because nobody else knows, but if he knew it was me he could ruin my career.  I know she's suspected something was going on between us before because he said she caught him texting me late at night, although it was a work related conversation.

**TL:DR;** He had a girlfriend the whole time and I'm completely heartbroken. I was just his bit on the side but I had fallen totally in love and feel like crap now. I want to tell her but I have no idea how to let her know without ruining my career. "
"Me [26F], my SO [30M] and his sister [24F]. Sister thinks I was disrespectful to her, demands an apology. But from my pov, she's the disrespectful one and I don't want to apologize.


SO and I are not married, but I'm going to call his relatives MIL/SIL because it's easier. 

My SO and I met in college six years ago and we have a wonderful relationship, he is very supportive of everything I do. We do want to have children eventually, but there are a bunch of other things we'd like to do first (career-wise, financially, holidays, etc.). At the moment, we are both very invested in our careers but it has never been a problem. He says it's something he admires about me. What I love about our relationship is that we are equal partners. We split all the housework 50/50. We even make about the same amount of money. We make all decisions together. It's great. 

Except for my SO's family who seem to be stuck in another century. We don't visit them often, 2-3 times a year, but it's always awful. They ask my SO at length about his work projects, coworkers and career path. When they talk to me, it's about when we will ""finally"" marry and become parents. They ask me if there's something wrong ""down there"" and tell me about different treatments to cure my (nonexistent) infertility. They have also (jokingly) implied that with all the time I spend at work, how will we ever have time to make a baby? It's like an obsession with his family. My SO has two younger sisters who both have kids. One is 28 and has one toddler, and his youngest sister is 24, has two kids and is currently pregnant with the third. Not judging here. Up until now, I have always politely told them that ""We don't want to have kids yet."" and ""I'm currently focusing on my career."" and that ""everything is perfectly fine with my uterus"". 

Anyway, last weekend was my MIL's 50th birthday and we spent the weekend there. The big party was nice enough, there were a lot of people and I got to know some of the more extended family. I talked to MIL briefly who told me that at my age, she already had three kids. I just said: ""And here I am, with nothing but a PhD."" but I think the sarcasm was lost on her. She just said ""better late than never, you know you could start your family today"" (wink wink) - wtf? The next day, we had breakfast/ brunch at the in-laws place. It was them, my SO and me and his youngest sister with her family. Lo and behold, as soon as we sit together the questioning starts again. When will MIL finally get grandkids from her oldest? Isn't it time for me to search for a family-friendly job? Now that we ""made her wait"" for grandkids, we have to make up for it with getting many children (???). SIL chimed in backing her mom up on everything. SO just said vague stuff like ""not yet"", ""we'll see"" and so on (he's very non-confrontational with his family, he says that's the best strategy to avoid drama). Then this conversation happened:

When SIL said: Now that I have a baby bump, don't you want to have a baby too? It's a mother's instinct!, 

I finally snapped and said calmly but firmly: No, I don't, and I would appreciate it if we could put the marriage and baby talk on hold for a while.

MIL: Well, honey, we tried to give you time, but you don't seem to be doing anything about it on your own. You're not getting any younger, you know.

SO: Mom, please. 

MIL: Well, it's the truth. How long do you expect me to wait?

Me: I expect you to wait until we are ready for this discussion. This will not happen in the next five years. You are welcome to ask us again in 2021. 

(awkward silence)

SIL: Well, unfortunately, you can't always plan it like that teehee.

Me: Fortunately, you can. 

At that point, everyone looked around embarassed and then someone started to talk about the weather. The rest of the brunch was a little weird. As soon as SO and I got in our car, SIL called him (in tears) demanding an apology. He just told her he'd call her back. He then told me she was super upset because all three of her children were ""happy accidents"" and not planned and maybe it's best to apologize to ""keep the peace"" but he also ""doesn't care if I don't"". Honestly, I don't want to. Do I have to do something here? Or just keep going to those 2-3 meetings a year and swallow my pride? Smile and nod? My SO is pretty unopinionated on this whole thing. A disadvantage of being equal partners is that he says he's not going to fight my battles for me like a white knight. Ok, I get that. But it's his family!? Or am I just overreacting and should be a little more understanding? Also, I think I should think about setting boundaries with these people once we do decide to have children. 
   
**tl;dr**: I told my SO's family we're not ready for kids for another five years after them pestering me about it all the time. SIL said it'S something you can't plan, I disagreed, found out afterwards that all her 3 kids were not planned. Apologize, yes or no?"
"I [27/f] found some letters that my husband [30/m] wrote while unpacking boxes. They are made up of things he dislikes about me. I'm not sure what to do.



Sorry if there are typos. I’m typing this quickly.
 
Jake and I have been married for a year- together for a total of 5 years. IMO, we’ve had a healthy relationship. We rarely argue/fight, but if we do, we are pretty good about communicating with each other in order to solve problems. I’ve always thought this was something that we didn’t need to work on. But now, I think I might be wrong…
 
A month ago, we bought our first house together. We just moved in last Friday so I took this week off to unpack all of the boxes. I’ll admit that we weren’t very organized and threw a lot of things into random boxes as we got more anxious about moving in. So, some boxes are a mixture of random things from both of us.
 
Yesterday, as I was finishing up the remaining boxes, I opened one and found pages and pages of what looked like letters. I thought it was weird since I had never seen them before. The one on top was dated for March 2011 and had my name on it. I’m not sure if this is wrong but I read it. And I kept reading them. Now, I’m not sure if there is anything he even loves about me….Here are a few excerpts from 2015-2016 (with some of my comments):
 
-”Today Bailey made some recipe that belonged to her grandmother. It was absolutely disgusting” Not that bad but…ouch.  
 
-“…it’s a good thing she’s good in bed because she talks too damn much”
 
-“It’s weird how close she is with her parents”
 
-“Sometimes the amount of kisses that she gives me turns me off.”
 
-“ I’m planning on proposing to Bailey but her lack of interest in exercising worries me that she can become fat or unmotivated”  I exercise 3 days a week, am 5’9” and weigh 135 pounds. I’m not sure where this came from and I don’t think I’m unhealthy?
 
-“..I wish she’d just get a better paying job…” We’re financially sound with little debt and I make 55k. That seems average for our area. I love my job.
 
-“Yesterday Bailey asked if I could clean the litterbox while she was gone. What I really wanted to tell her was to shove it up her ass...”
 
-“…sometimes she can be so clueless…”
 
-“She’s got a great sense of humor and her smile is beautiful. But that laugh is just awful”
 
-“I’ve always said I want kids but I don’t know anymore. Can’t really see myself being helpful with them.” probably the biggest blow to me since raising a family is something that I want and something that he’s always expressed that he wants.  
 
-“I don’t think I could live without that woman but sometimes I just can’t stand to be around her.”
 
Note: the letters weren’t always about me but I made up the majority of them. Everything about me is negative or passive aggressive. 
 
I’m honestly not sure what I just read. Is he venting? Some of these are pretty hurtful and I had no idea he felt that way. He’s always been sweet and caring toward me but these seem hateful. He has these from back in 2011. Is this normal behavior? 5 years worth of letters about things you dislike about your SO? When Jake got home, I asked him if there was anything that was bothering him or he wanted to talk about but he just looked at me confused and said no. I asked if he wanted chicken for dinner (the recipe he said he hated in the first quote) and he smiled and said yes.
 
So…
 
Should I let this go? Or bring it up? I can’t help but to feel so hurt about this. It’s almost like he hates me. I feel like I’m in shock- he has never said anything negative about/toward me. It seems like he’s a different man. I’m not sure what to do. I understand that these are his private thoughts but why would you marry someone if you dislike these things about them?  


EDIT: formatting 

   
**tl;dr**: I came across some letters that my husband wrote while unpacking boxes. In them, he explains things I do that annoy him or that he doesn't like. I've never heard him express these feelings before and I'm hurt by them. "
"Boyfriend [25M] and his sister-in-law [28F?] sneaked out to the beach at 3am.


OK so last night that happened. We've been together for a year.

We were visiting his parent's house (who live by the beach) and his brother was also there with his wife. We stayed there last night and at around 3am I was half sleep and noticed that he's leaving the room. I thought he's probably going to the bathroom or something. I heard some noises from downstairs and I wasn't paying attention until I saw from the window that he's going out to the beach with his brother's wife!

They came back about an hour later.

I still haven't confronted him and was wondering what this could mean. What was it that they needed to do? I don't know what to think. Is it something that I can be upset about? Sneaking around at night isn't cool in my opinion.

"My [35M] girlfriend [34F] of 4 years wants me to move out my dad [74M] out of my house and put him in a home when we get married and she moves in. I told her its not happening.


My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, we've been talking about our future and marriage prospects for a long time.

My father is quite old and not very abled.  He can walk with a frame, but he's very old and tired and has bad hips.  He needs help with many things, has poor vision, needs help with his medication.  I've spent a lot of money making my house safe and suitable for him to ensure he's safe in it.  I have a carer who comes daily and helps out with certain things, such as in taking care of my father and housework and other things.

My wife has said that when we get married and live together, she'll move in (my house is more than big enough for all of us), she wants me to move my dad out and put him in an aged care home.  She said she doesn't want him to be in the way of our relationship and family and she doesn't want to have to constantly worry about an old man when we're together.

I told her its not happening, he's my father. I've seen the state of some aged care facilities, they really neglect their patients, it can be a really depressing environment and from what I've seen (I've been around them a lot), it seems sub optimal and I think my father would be much better off with me.  Not to mention we have extended relatives nearby and its within short and easy travel distance, and he's much more comfortable here and at home with me.

It seems to be a major obstacle when dealing and discussing our future plans together, she seems to really think its the best idea but I've said I'm not budging on it, my dad stays with me.

What should I do? How can I convince her to see my side of this, or is this relationship really not worth it?  To be honest, its made me see her in a much darker light and I think her insistence on it has made me harbour some resentment.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants me to move my dad out and put him in a home, I told her its not happening.  Major stumbling block in our future plans together."
"My [24 F] unemployed boyfriend [26 M] gets angry when I have to wake up early to go to work. I'm becoming resentful and I hate it.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years and we have been living together for two. We met while I was still in school for my undergrad degree and he was in a masters program. He has been looking for work since he graduated last summer, but was only able to find temp positions and a job selling cars. Currently he is unemployed and looking for work while trying to make some money freelancing. I should mention that he isn't as bad off as most people, as he owns his home outright and pays the utility bills using some investments.

I love him, but one of the things that makes me upset is how he treats me in the early mornings. I have to wake up early to be at work by 7:00 am and he will get angry at me for making noise. I've tried explaining to him again and again that I have to go to work, otherwise we won't have any money for food or random expenses and he will apologize before going to sleep. Then the next day it will repeat when I wake up to get ready for work again. It's like he's still asleep when he's angry at me and then when he wakes up later he has forgotten all the nasty things he's said to me.

It's exhausting, because I've never once gotten a break from working and I have to wake up early while he sleeps in until 10 or 11 am. On the weekends, I've tried to get him to do fun things with me but he won't wake up before 11 am. I've explained to him that I only get these two days a week to hang out with him, but nothing seems to change. I come home from work each day, clean up, cook dinner, and then go to bed while he's still up watching tv. We haven't had sex in weeks because I have to go to bed at 10 pm and he stays up past midnight.

I love him, but I hate how our lives operate. I wish we were a team where he would pick up the cleaning duties while I work so I don't have to come home exhausted. I don't want to break up with him, but I don't know how much longer I can stand this. He didn't use to be like this and I know he hates it too, but nothing seems to change.



   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is unemployed and stays up late and sleeps in. When I wake up for work in the mornings, he gets angry at me for waking him up then goes back to sleep. I feel like I don't have a relationship anymore and I hate our situation because I love him."
"My [30F] sister [38F] is suddenly mad at me because her daughter [7F] likes the nickname I gave her more than her real name.


Let me say from the beginning that I do not think I have a right to tell my sister how to parent. If she wants her kid to be called name a instead of name b, that's her decision, not mine. However, this situation is a little odd, and I'm not sure how to feel or how to proceed.

I feel I should point out that I love my sister, but she is a narcissist. It was terrible to grow up with her, and she made our lives difficult until she finished college and moved out. Our family is well aware that she originally had a child to ""snag"" her husband (who is very passive and co-dependent) and to get attention. Although she definitely loves her daughter, Jordan, and takes decent care of her, my sister is not an empathetic person and isn't the most attentive mom, so her daughter has become attached to a few other people in the family. That seems to be how Jordan's emotional needs are met. For some reason, kids like me, and she has gotten very attached to me in particular. (My mom says it's because I do things for her her parents don't usually do, like read to her and let her play with my makeup.)

Now, when Jordan was a baby, she could be very mischievous and goofy, so I would sometimes say, ""Aren't you just a little Beelzebub?"" *At no point did this offend my sister or brother-in-law, even when my sister asked what ""Beelzebub"" meant and I told her.* When Jordan began taking, she'd repeat the word back as ""Beezy,"" and it stuck. From then on, she was ""my Beezy,"" ""Beezy-boo,"" ""Beezy Wheezy has a Sneezey,"" all of the ridiculous shit you say to toddlers.

Then Jordan got a little older and went to kindergarten, and she started telling people to call her Beezy instead of Jordan. *Again, nobody in the family had a problem with this.* The teachers and other students all called her Beezy without issue.

Jordan is finishing first grade, and we were having a little party to celebrate the summer last week. At the party, Jordan asked if she could out on some lipgloss, and I said, ""Go ask your mom, Beezy."" My sister suddenly snapped and started yelling at me to stop calling her daughter that ""ridiculous"" name, because I was calling her the devil and all of the other kids make fun of her for it. Jordan got mad and said she didn't want to be called Jordan, she hated that name, and my sister told her that was her name and that was what she was going to be called. Nobody in immediate earshot knew what to do then, so we all kind of sat around uncomfortably and ate our food.

I later asked my sister why she didn't want me using a nickname for her daughter, especially since her daughter liked it a lot and felt it suited her. She came up with two excuses that I think are complete bullshit:

**It comes from ""Beelzebub,"" which means the devil.** I would get this if my sister was really religious, but she's what I call ""conveniently religious."" She doesn't go to church, has never read the Bible, and knows next to nothing about the religion. She just mentions God and Jesus whenever it's convenient for her, especially if she's trying to shame somebody. (For instance, we had a fight about something completely unrelated, and suddenly I'm a ""terrible atheist"" who needs to ""find Jesus"" because I believe in evolution.) My sister had *zero problems* with this nickname until this moment. Also, she is now claiming she named Jordan for the river Jordan, but that's a complete lie. She got the name out of a book of baby names that just listed names by letter. Honestly, the only Bible stories she really knows are Noah's ark, Exodus, and the virgin birth; the rest is just her parroting what other people say.

**The other kids are making fun of her for the ""stupid"" name.** I know this isn't true because I work at the school my niece attends. We live in a diverse area, so the kids have names from a huge range of cultures and languages, and nobody bats an eye at ""Beezy."" The teachers and other students have called her Beezy for two years now without issue. She is very popular at her school, too, and gets along well with a lot of the other children.

Really, I'm just not sure what to do or what to make of this. I can't force my niece to use her birth name, can I? And I get the feeling this isn't about the name, but is more about my sister's possessiveness and jealousy.

   
**tl;dr**: I gave my niece Jordan a nickname (Beezy) when she was born, it stuck, and now lots of people call her that and she likes it more than her birth name. My sister was fine with it until this last year. I'm not sure what to do, since her daughter is the one who tells people to call her Beezy and I think my sister is maybe more upset over my relationship with my niece."
"My exwife [39F] wants to attend my [39M] wedding. My girlfriend [29F] and I don't want her there.


I married my ex wife at 22. We were high school sweethearts and got together at 16. I've known since a very young age that children were not going to be in my future. I had no interest in becoming a father at any point in my life. I know some people change their minds but for me it was a sure thing. My ex claimed she also didnt want children. We had a blissful marriage until we were 30 when she said she wanted children. I still didnt want children. This led to a lot of fighting and we eventually divorced at 32. 

Even after we divorced she still had quite close relations with my family. I think everyone was shocked that we got divorced as we seemed to be happy. Eventually i told my parents and siblings i was uncomfortable having her around after the divorce and the relations faded away. 3 years later I met my current girlfriend and we are getting married soon. My girlfriend is sterilised and doesn't want children so we're much more compatible. My ex wife has contact with some of my cousins on social media so I assume thats how she found out. She congratulated me and asked for invitations to the wedding. Is it wrong of me to not want her there? She's not a bad or crazy ex and I know she won't cause any trouble or do anything spiteful. I just don't want her there. I want her completely out of my life. I kind of want to pretend she doesn't exist at all. Is that childish or petty? My girlfriend supports my decision to not invite her. I just want some some validation from reddit. Thanks. 
   
**tl;dr**: ex wife wants to attend my wedding. She's not a crazy ex or a bad person. I still don't want her there. "
"I [26F] missed an important funeral and now I think my 5 year relationship with my partner [28M] might be over.


Before everything happened between us we were solid, I thought this guy was my forever. We’ve lived together for the past 3 years and I always loved him and the way we supported and helped each other. He used to say we were family, and we would always look after each other.

This year was my final year in Uni, to get my MArch and my Part II exemption to become an architect. In March this year, the final printed copy of my research project was due, basically a culmination of the past 7 years of my education. 

Unfortunately in this time my partner's grandmother passed away; this woman basically raised him when both his parents couldn’t deal, they were incredibly close, in her final years she got dementia but she always remembered him and their little inside jokes, he loved her so much, probably more than anyone else in the whole world.  

Over those few weeks after she passed away, I tried to spend a lot of time with him. I took him to the archdiocese and we lit candles and walked through the gardens and talked about his grandmother. His friends came up for a visit that weekend and I spent the weekend with them to keep him happy, even though I should have been working on finishing my research project. I took care of him all that week, letting him rest and try to mourn, unfortunately his boss is a huge prick and it was a struggle for him to get any time off to properly rest and take care of himself.  

His Grandmother’s funeral was schedule to be 4 days before my research project hand in date; the problem with this is that I still needed to get everything printed and do final editing and the funeral was happening on the other side of the country, This was a 200 page research project; I worked my ass off to get everything together beforehand, so that I could go with him, but in the end I didn’t have the time and the reality was that I was editing and adding to the project up until 2 days before my hand in. I did skype with him in the mornings and evenings so we could talk about how he was doing. 

After the funeral he returned home, but he was incredibly sad. After my hand in I tried to talk with him about it, he showed me some pictures and I read the eulogy that his sister read at the funeral, I cried a bit after reading the eulogy, and that’s when my boyfriend got angry, he said that I didn’t have a right to cry or be upset because it was his grandmother and because I had chosen to forego the funeral. 

Things have just gone down hill since then; it’s been 2 months. On top of my research project, I also had my regular work to finish over the past 2 months; it’s just been a very busy time in my life. My boyfriend went through a similar experience the year before, where I helped and supported him through his work, and he tried to help me and support me through mine, but the entire time he was cold and distant, and at one point he even admitted to me that he didn’t want to help me, and he couldn’t be bothered. 

So this all came to a head recently, when I confronted him about how he’s been distant and the way he has been treating me (ignoring me all day, being rude, distant and sometime downright nasty to me) He basically said he can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, and he doesn’t think he ever will. At this point I will admit that I lost it, I was put in a situation where I had to choose between my relationship and my education and it’s only in hindsight that I see it. I was so overwhelmed and upset that I hit my head against the wall, hard and screamed, but only because I’ve never been in so much emotional pain in my life, I didn’t know how to handle it so I handled it poorly. 

Since then things have not gotten better; we’ve tried to talk it over calmly, but a few days ago he lost it and went on this rant about how terrible his life is and how hurt he is. There is a lot more going on with his family than I knew, including that his father used to beat him badly and his grandmother would protect him, I never knew this about his father, though I knew they had an incredibly strained relationship. I’ve suggested therapy but he had said he’s not up for it. 

We talked about a solution and he thinks I need to go back to my home country by myself for a few weeks and be with my family, and to leave him alone for that time so that he can think and mourn alone. He also said that he is thinking about moving out of our flat at the end of the summer, to go live with some friends, but he said that he wants us to stay together. 

I think at this point that the relationship might be over; I don’t know how to show him that I’m sorry I missed the funeral, but there was no other option for me. I love this guy so much, but if this is how our relationship is going to be, I don't think I can do it. I need perspective on this issue; maybe some advice on how to apologise properly? and if not maybe some advice on how to end a long term relationship? 


EDIT: A lot of people have been mentioning this; I did ask for an extension from my academic advisor, and he told me that the school does not grant extensions under any circumstances. The way my University handles mitigating circumstances for graduate projects is that they expect you to turn in whatever work you have completed by the deadline, and then they allow you to resubmit the completed project at the next grading cycle, however this would mean that I would not be allowed to graduate this year, and would have to wait until the next graduation cycle.

Also I should mention that we usually return to my home country for a few weeks in the summer to visit my family, a trip wasn't planned or set for this summer but we had discussed a possibility of it, that's why it's not a completely unreasonable request that I go home for a while. 


TLDR; my boyfriend can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?"
"Mother [47F] wants my forgiveness now for sending me [24M] to boarding school since her new husband wouldn't have me when she remarried.


So when I was 15 my mom decided to marry a rich man. At that time it was me, my sister (11 at the time) and my mom. Sadly one of his conditions was that he did not want to have me around. Eventually my mother agreed that they would send me to boarding school in a different city and when I wasn't at school I will stay with my grandparents. I never knew why he didn't want to have me around. He had a son and a daughter around my age and more than enough space since he had a very large house.

It was a very good school, but I hated it. I was removed from all my friends and from my family, especially my little sister and was shipped to a new city with new people and no friends or family. Everytime I came back I had to stay with my grandparents who were nice, but really old and it was lonely as well. I couldn't even visit my sister, she and her mother had to come to me. I could always see that she was not happy with this arrangement but she didn't do anything to change that. I was never involved in celebrations, holidays, etc. 

When I went to college I started having less and less contact. It was just natural. I felt unwelcome so I stayed away. I hated it since I basically lost the chance to be in my sister's life in any meaningful way during her teen years. Now she doesn't feel much about me, I'm a stranger to her. This whole thing made me lose all my family.

So my mom called me last week after almost a year of no contact and told me that she is divorcing her husband and wants to talk. I met her and she told me that she regrets everything and wants me to forgive her for all that she did to me.

I don't know what to think now. Whether to give her a chance or not. She can't give back what was taken from me. Is there any point doing this? I had moved on from it all. 


**tl;dr**: Mom sent me to boarding school when she remarried her husband and kept me away from the family. Now she's divorcing him and wants my forgiveness."

Scroll to bottom for update. 

Hi /r/relationships. Thank you for helping me in [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l7nfu/i_28_f_widow_need_advice_on_going_public_with_my/). I came back to give an update.        


Bad news first: Mark and I went ahead with the plan I mentioned in the comments of my first post. Mark met up Steve's brother (Nick) and I made plans to meet Steve's mom for late breakfast. On Saturday morning Mark told me that things with Nick didn't go well. I was surprised because I didn't think Nick would care much about Mark and I dating. Nick and Steve weren't actually *that* close. Nick's 2 years younger than Steve and Mark. Growing up Steve and Mark teased him a lot and basically treated him like a little pest. That dynamic changed over the years, and Mark is ""close"" to him but they aren't anywhere near as close as Mark and Steve were.  Mark said he was pretty straight forward in telling Nick that we've been dating. Apparently Nick was confused and thought Mark was asking for his permission, and told him that he didn't approve. I'm not sure how the miscommunication happened, but it probably had to do with the fact that they were drinking. By the time Nick realized that Mark was telling him we are already dating, they'd both exchanged unpleasantries. Mark walked away thinking Nick felt like he was my ""keeper"" and that I should be ""off limits"".  End result: Nick's mad (at both of us I presume) and Mark's mad.                



The good news is that my breakfast with Steve's mom went really well. I was super nervous because I already knew that Nick hadn't taken it well, but she and I actually chatted a bit about that too. She had no clue that Mark and I have been seeing each other, so she literally paused  and took a long moment to digest it when I told her. She asked some questions about whether anyone else knew, how long, etc. Apparently Anna talks about Mark a lot, because Steve's mom said that she knows how much Anna likes him from the way she talks about him when she's slept over their house. All in all the conversation went much better than I could have expected. She was warm, sweet and welcoming. She even told me that she would tell her husband and assured me that I had made a big deal out of nothing.        




At the BBQ Steve's mom was so sweet - she basically took care of everything for us. She told the rest of the family, one by one, in a way that made me feel like she's proud that we're together. I couldn't have wished for his parents to be sweeter about it. I felt like Nick was avoiding us. He disappeared somewhere during the BBQ - I went looking for him hoping to talk to him (at his mom's suggestion) and realized he'd left.  I'm thinking of trying to chat with his this week. We usually text several times each week, so it wouldn't be odd for me to reach out to him. Mark doesn't think I should, but I actually feel like I'm a lot closer to Nick than Mark is. I'm actually starting to feel like I should have been the one to tell Nick instead of Mark. I wasn't close to Nick when Steve was alive; they weren't all that close. Nick was stationed overseas when Steve died; he's only been home for a year now and I think he's only recently coming to terms with the fact that Steve is gone. We talked a lot on the phone and over text after Steve passed and I actually got to know Nick more as his own person - I think he's a lot more sensitive than Steve or Mark have ever given him credit for. Since he's been home he's spent a lot of time with Anna and I, so I feel like it's my responsibility to make sure this is alright for him. I'm not sure that I *can* do that, but I think that if Mark and I dating is making it harder for Nick to come to terms with Steve's death -   I owe it to him to be there for him to help him understand that I really do think Steve would be okay with this. Mark disagrees, and thinks we should leave Nick to get over it on his own. He keeps saying ""This isn't about Steve, it's about Nick"", so I'm guessing Nick may be having some issues dealing with the fact that he and Steve weren't as close as he would have liked. I'm guessing that maybe he feels like this is his way of being a good brother? That's why I feel like I can help him with that and let him know that Steve wouldn't require this of him. I'm still not sure - advice is welcome (and wanted).           


**Thanks again!**



   
**tl;dr**: Told the family. Mom &amp; dad received the news well. Brother did not and seems to be giving us the cold shoulder. Not sure if I should reach out and try to fix things.


**Update**: I'm posting an update for everyone who asked. I've spoken with Nick and we're in a better place. We had a really nice discussion. All in all I think he's still coming to terms with losing his brother. Mark &amp; I dating has pushed Steve's passing to the forefront for him. He said that he didn't expect me to be single forever and doesn't feel that I'm wrong for dating Mark. He even made some jokes about it all.  He did acknowledge that it will take him time to acclimate. He said that I shouldn't be shy about reaching out to him if he isn't around as much as he was before, and not to take it as him being angry or upset. I suggested grief counseling because it was a huge help to me, but he wasn't receptive. For now, I'm giving him space but still inviting him to spend time with us. I hope he'll do what he needs to do. For all of us, I've realized that I need to take some steps back, so I'm giving him room. Everything else is going well. Thanks again /r/relationships for your help! You guys are golden!"
"My[36m] ex-wife[38f] fought hard to deny me joint custody, but now complains that I am having too much fun being divorced with my girlfriend[26f] and tells our children[8m] [6f] that I never loved her



There is a lot to this, and the short essay that I post here won't be able to describe what lead to all of this, but I will clarify whatever you guys want in the comment section. 

So here is the story, my ex-wife and I were together for eight years. We had two children together. I work as a software engineer and my ex-wife works in HR for a large company. 

We had a lot of problems in our marriage  and they really weren't apparent until the stresses of child rearing made them. From my side, my wife would do a lot of things that made me upset. She would compare me to other men, saying so and so makes a lot of money. Would often deny me  ability to meet up with my friends. I guess the worst of it was when I declined taking a higher paying position in the company because I didn't want to go into management. That really just got her furious. 

So we divorced, I fought hard to get joint custody, however because I worked 60 hour weeks, and was required to be ready to work from home if something went wrong, I wasn't given custody. Plus my ex-wife did everything she could to prevent me from that. 

I was really upset, just the idea of not being able to see my kids grow up was a sad thought. However, I did what I could with the time. When I got off work, I would go to the gym regularly, I would prepare meals for the week. And not to sound to vain, but I got a lot better looking. And from there ended up meeting a beautiful woman who now I am in a relationship with. 

So, until my ex-wife met my new girlfriend, she was okay with the divorce. She was friendly, would often give me  extra time with the kids if I asked. And our relationship was fine. But since me and my girlfriend were getting serious, I wanted her to meet my wife first, because this would be a woman that would be interacting with our children, so I did it out of respect. 

I think my ex-wife was shocked at first because she first thought it was a joke when I introduced her to my girlfriend. She kept saying there is no way a beautiful young woman like (my girlfriend) would want to be with a nerdy dad with two kids. 

Since then my ex-wife has gotten more and more hostile.  When it comes to just arranging time for me to have the kids she will try to do it  whenever possible to ruin my plans. It is just insane how hateful and bitter she has gotten. She told me that it is my fault that I robbed her of her ability to have a big family. 

Just everything possible. She has told our children that daddy just likes having fun instead of being a real man and raising a family. . When she knows damn well that I fought to have joint custody. She has said that my girlfriend will leave me soon when she realizes how much of a loser I am. When I bought a BMW she told our kids that they won't have enough money for college, because daddy likes to buy flashy cars. 

And she gets upset when my girlfriend and I do things for example, the I took my girlfriend out to music festivals, she will be upset saying that when we were together, ""I never took her out for anything fun."" It is just constant complaning. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like my ex-wife is just upset that my life has turned around for the better after the divorce. I just want her to be civil and not talk poorly about me to our children. Do you guys have any advice? 

**tl;dr- divorced my ex-wife she became a hateful person after I started dating my girlfriend.**

"My [39F] husband [42M] has lost all interest in our son [15M] after the doctor recommended for his own health he stops playing sports for a while.


Hi so I have never used Reddit before, I just don't know what to do right now. My husband as I have tried to talk to him completely blows me off. 

My husband and I live in California with our 2 kids. Cody 15M and Stephanie 13F, Cody has just finished his freshmen year. He made a promise to me that he would get high marks as he plays alot of sport. His father pressures him to play every sport imaginable Football, Soccer, Track, Swimming you name it he has played it. 

I have told my husband to lay off of the sports and he thinks         ""sports will make him a man"". I was always concerned about his grades and he proved to me he can play sport and get good grades. So I decided if it's a bonding experience between the two I did not see a problem with it, and Cody was enjoying it. 

Cody also studied hard, he would spend at least 2 hours on a weekday and 4 hours on a Saturday and Sunday studying and doing homework. 

3 weeks ago Cody started to complain of neck pain, he would be in pain getting up and sitting down. He was dry heaving and just felt really sick in general. My husband who is a nurse by the way told me our son was dehydrated and slept wrong. 2 weeks ago I decided enough is enough I am taking him to the doctor and thankfully I did. 

They did a whole bunch of tests on Cody and there was a problem with his neck/back and shoulders. He told me luckily we found it because if he continued to push himself it could have been alot worse, like needed surgery bad. He said contact sports will likely aggravate his condition so he told Cody to cut those out completely. He asked Cody to take a long break from sports as he heals. 

When I got home I explained the situation to my husband and he was not happy. I explained to him Cody can be treated without surgery and it's the best thing for him. To Cody credit he making the best of it, myself and him looked at activities he can do that were not sport. 

We don't know how long the treatment will take apart from it will be several months. Cody has been relaxing and taking it easy, he feels a little better.  He has even decided and I am proud of him for this to listen to the doctor and stop playing football and all other contact sports. 

My husband since then has been really short with Cody. If Cody is in the lounge he will go sit outside. It's not like he feels bad, he keeps asking me "" when will Cody be ready to play baseball"". I told him not for a long time. 

My husband pretty much ignores him, Cody can ask him a question and it will be a short "" hmmm"" as a response. My husband has leached onto his sisters kid and now is taking him to sports game. He is taking the kid to baseball and he even goes to her house to throw a football with the kid. 

My husband has just lost complete interest in Cody. I have spoken to him about it but, as I said he blows me off and does not listen to me.  
   
**tl;dr**: My son has to take a brake from sports for his own health and my husband has lost complete interest in him"
