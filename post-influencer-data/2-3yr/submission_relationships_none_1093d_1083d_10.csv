"Me [41 M] with my wife [ 38F] of ten years. A guy past away in a car accident and it has come forward that my wife was having an affair with him. She is in a deep depression regarding his death and I am angry and pissed and don't know what to do.


Um. Throwaway because of stuff.

This has been a nightmare I didn't think I'd face. I don't think all of our friends know, but I suspect some do but I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them.

There was a bad accident in our city that I barely registered (big city, traffic accidents happen all the time). When it came out who had died (two people hurt, different vehicles, only one fatality) my wife was really, really sobbing sad and asked to go to the funeral and she ""used to work with the guy."" Sure, absolutely, I'm so sorry this happened. 

But it has since come out from (from her) that they actually had a two year physical affair. I don't know how long they were just thinking about it.

She is a mess. She is devastated. She said she never meant to leave me, but that he was was a ""really special, remarkable person"" who meant a lot to her. She won't interact with our kids, stays in bed. I mean she's in mourning.

But FUCK! How long can I stand her moping around about the man she was having a fucking affair with?? I mean, I want her to get therapy and deal with it but I feel like there is a limit to how supportive I can be.

We have three kids, 8, 5 and 3 and she is a stay-at-home-mother, though I've had to take time off since this happened. It's a fucking mess. I feel like I can't leave because I don't think she could care for the kids on her own, and I hate and love her right now because she's done this.

What the fuck do I do?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wife is massively depressed after the man she was having an affair with died. How do I support her grief while also laying down the line that I am pissed as fuck?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice. The vast majority of you all good folks have told me exactly what I need to hear. I think it coming from strangers makes it easier to hear. I'm running off to grab the youngest kidlet from preschool but will be back to respond. Thanks all."
"My husband [44/M] told me he wished I [37/F] was dead instead of his first wife. I'm devastated.


My husband ""Nick"" was married to his first wife ""Vanessa"" for 5 years and they had two amazing kids, ""Luke"" (15/M) and ""Lila"" (13/F). Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. 

After 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. 

I have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son ""Casey"" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. 

But Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. 

Last week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's ""real"" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd ""keep busy and leave him alone.""

I'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids. Any advice is desperately needed right now.

"My [32F] husband [33M] doesn't want our nanny to teach our daughter Spanish. Feel like I'm seeing an ugly side of him.


My husband Eric and I have been married for 5 years. We have one child, a four-year-old little lady named Katherine. We both work busy jobs but I'm a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she's honestly become part of the family.


The other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, ""Want to hear me talk like Ella?"" And she started speaking Spanish! I'm not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn't really respond but I didn't think anything of it at the time. 


Then tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn't like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it's a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it's a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine. 


Ella has gone back to our house for the night, but I'm still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he's damaged our relationship with Ella, who's been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it's a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she'll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn't be married; that's a dealbreaker for me), but I can't see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work. 


A) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?


and B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?

"My [27m] fiancee [26f] and I are finally in a place where we can get a dog. She just admitted that she doesn't want a dog, and never has. Considering ending things over this.


Hi reddit. My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals. 

To give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted. 

When I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit. 

When Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day.

Throughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog. 

About 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house. 

On top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog. 

Since we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be ""no"" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog. 

I'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot. 

Is there a way to compromise on this? 

TL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has. She gave me an ultimatum - either her or a dog.

"UPDATE: How do me and my friends [20sF] tell our other friend [25F] we don't want her toddler to come on our vacation?


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t0r8j/how_do_me_and_my_friends_20sf_tell_our_other/

First of all I’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who posted something helpful and constructive . Every comment was read, even the negative (unfortunately). I’ve gotten quite a few messages to post an update over the past month. I initially held off because I was nervous about the surprising amount of attention it got and didn’t know whether Lily was an avid redditor or not.

So, despite our protests, Lily ended up bringing her toddler Elle on our cottage getaway.

Just kidding!

Within 24 hours of me posting, three of us got together and read over all the messages (now my friends know my reddit username….hiii guysss :/ ). We realized that we needed to get down to business and nip this situation in bud, before things escalated/we felt anymore resentment.

While this situation was happening, another one was going on on the side. My friend Ivy had made comments in the past about her and Lily drifting apart, as they are best friends. Quite understandably, Lily is SUPER busy being an awesome mom/fulltime employee so its hard getting friend time in. However, Ivy commented that they had only seen each other twice in past two and some months, and how she seemed like the only one ever making plans to hang out. She’s also the best communicator out of the group, so she decided that she would take it upon herself to speak with Lily directly that night. We didn't want to approach Lily as a group because it would have felt like we were attacking her, so we were more than happy with this approach.

From what I was told, she started off by casually bringing up the cottage and how much she was looking forward to it. Lily mentioned that she was excited to spend some time with all of us and that she couldn’t wait. Ivy then led the conversation in the direction of how she really loves spending time with Lily, that she wished it could happen more often, and even though she understood that Lily was a very busy gal, she felt like she was losing touch with Ivy somewhat.

Lily agreed, but reiterated that it is hard to find time for all the things that are important to her. So, Ivy continued and said something like, “Hey, I am SO excited to be spending time with you at the cottage this summer. However, it kind of hurt my feelings that it took your fiancée to be leaving for the weekend for you to decide to come and spend the weekend with us. (Not sure if I mentioned this in the first post, but initially Lily said no to the cottage because she wanted to focus on her family all summer. However, her fiancee wanted his own mini vacation, and when she found out it was on the same weekend as ours, she finally decided to come). But that’s okay, I understand that family time is very important to you. I just feel that since we haven’t been getting a lot of time to see you lately, the cottage weekend would be a great place for us all to reconnect. I feel like you need a break from life for just a couple days, since you’ve got so much going for you, and having Elle stay with your family friend while your fiancée is away is the perfect opportunity for you to get some one on one time with us. What do you think?”

So I’m excited to say that Lily finally saw the light and realized that yeah, this was a great opportunity to kick her feet back, relax, and made plans for Elle to stay with her family friend.

So some of you may be upset that we didn’t take the direct route that many of you were advising, demanding that Elle couldn’t come to the weekend getaway. However, we wanted to keep things calm/courteous and Ivy did a great job managing it. It might have been indirect, but it solved two problems in one.

All in all, the cottage was even more fun than last year! It was filled with many two-fours, midnight swims, silly truth or dares questions, and too many bags of sour cream and onion chips.

tl;dr: Elle didn't come and we had a blast :)"
"My [23F] best friend [26F] of 10+ year's boyfriend [26M] of three years has admitted to having strong feelings for me. Previously, best friend has told me if anything like this happened she wouldn't want to know. Need help. [UPDATE]


[Here's a link to the original post!
](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/527au8/my_23f_best_friend_26f_of_10_years_boyfriend_26m/?st=it476tbn&amp;sh=6fb50c91)

Sorry, this'll probably get long!

SO, there were lots of conflicting opinions on what to do, and a lot of you had really good reasons behind those - however, there were consensus' which seemed to be that 1. This sucks and there's no ideal solution, and 2. Everyone seemed on board with the letter idea which was suggested by a few people.

The gist of it was that I should write a letter and put the screen caps, etc I took into it, and then offer the information to her again. That way, she would have some more agency to choose whether or not she wanted to know. I have to say letting her know there was something to know kind of felt like I was forcing her to choose to open it, but... well, here's what happened:

I made the envelope and went to her place while Guy was working just to hang out, pretty usual stuff. Reddit, I'm not a terrible actress but this woman knows me so well. She opened the door to let me in and immediately asked what was wrong, and to my ever lasting shame I immediately burst into tears. Super pathetic of me, and not ideal. Urgh.

After I'd composed myself I started saying what I'd been practicing in my head. Pretty much, that there was something we'd talked about a lot in our scenarios that had happened, and she had always said she wouldn't want to know, but I wanted to give her the option. I gave her the letter.

Then without even opening it she also started to cry, which made me start up again, which was kind of okay because the ridiculousness of us both just standing in her living room sobbing all over each other made us laugh a little bit.

A lot of people had guessed she had noticed or had some kind of idea of Guy's feelings, and they were absolutely right. But it's weirder than even that. I genuinely can't believe I'm explaining this, it's just... weird. I don't know.

Best Friend had thought Guy had a harmless little crush on me. The kind people in relationships just *get* sometimes. But when he didn't talk to her about it she started to feel uncomfortable, and she did something she shouldn't have, but you know how it goes. She snooped. She snooped on his laptop months ago, and found a file with my initials on it buried amongst a bunch of other stuff. She went and got his laptop and gave it to me to read while she read my letter.

Inside it were stories he had written, like fanfiction? about the three of us living like a kind of poly relationship lifestyle where we were his wives? Some of it was sexual stuff which... you know, I think I could understand it better if it had just been sexual fantasies, but there were also really long documents about our lives together. And it goes deep too, there was a whole plot line about him trying to convince me to have kids (love them, but I'm childfree and everyone around me knows it)?? There were loads of stories, all different lengths, I didn't read all of it, just kind of like skim read them with my mouth hanging open. It's so hard to explain, it was really bizarre to read about myself like that. There were newer documents Best Friend hadn't read, too.

Best Friend goes on to tell me that she hadn't minded because she was in all the stories as well, so she's reassured in his love for her, but obviously me being part of their life in that way isn't her ideal and she was disturbed by the way he'd spoken to me in the messages from the other day (and the ones he's sent since). I asked her *loads* of questions, including if she felt safe, and she said she does. I asked her what she wanted to do, and she said she wanted to leave him.

She also apologised for not telling me, and while it doesn't sit well with me that she didn't, because of what happened after this, I've basically forgiven her/put any talk of that on hold. She doesn't need that now, and I've been so relieved she wasn't mad at me for bursting her bubble, and concerned for her, that it seems very secondary. 

Of all the things I expected to happen during my visit, it was none of that. So then the conversation switched to me being worried about her safety because while he doesn't seem dangerous this is very obsessive, and he's clearly been upset by his fantasy becoming further from reality with Max in the picture, and now this. (I'm a little anxious about Max's safety, too. I can't tell if I'm being reasonable or paranoid). She assured me *ten fold* that she feels completely safe, he's never done anything other than this that's red flaggish, but that she still wants to leave, and she's very cautious by nature so she's taking some precautions. 

She got up and went to pack her bags, and started giving me typical her, business like instructions on the things she wanted me to grab from around the house. She filled up her suit cases, and I filled up a box of her personal stuff. Then, she wrote a note for Guy explaining that she didn't think they should be together anymore, and she would only talk with him about it over messages or in person a few days from now (in a public place, she assured me).

So, this is when I did something I maybe shouldn't have, I don't know. I carry a pen drive on my key chain. I told her that I wanted to take copies of the stories because if anything happens, even if she doesn't think it will, it's important that there's something we can use to prove his obsessive behaviour. She said fine, so I now have a pen drive full of fanfiction (and *playlists?!*) about myself, my best friend and her ex. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not tempted to read them. Sheer morbid curiosity. But I've resisted so far.

We went to my place first while we thought of what to do next, and her emotions were understandably all over the place. After I got a call from Max and filled him in he said to come stay with him since Guy doesn't know where he lives. Best Friend preferred to stay at a nearby hotel, which we used my card to pay for, and after I hovered over her anxiously as she settled in she eventually said she wanted to be alone (which isn't unusual for her when she's upset). I've been to visit her and she's been sending me messages the whole time, so I'm feeling pretty confident about where her head's at (sad, but coping well considering) but still just general worriedness. I'm staying with Max until things settle down.

I've gotten (and am still getting) messages from Guy. I have been since about 5pm that night, and it's been two nights since since then. They're very ""I just want to talk"" messages. Not aggressive or anything like that, I was going to block him on everything but Best Friend asked me not to because she's worried about his mental state.

As a side note: I'm not bashing poly relationships by any means in this post. That is most definitely not the thing about this I find weird and bizarre. You do you. 
  
  ---   

  **tl;dr: I gave her the option of the letter. Turns out Best Friend knew the whole time because she snooped on Guy's laptop months ago and found loads of stories he wrote of the three of us living some kind of fictional paradise where we're his wives (I know, what?). She doesn't feel unsafe but decided to leave him, and because of the weirdness of the situation she's taking the appropriate precautions. I put her up at a hotel using my card because she's not sure what Guy has access to, etc.  - she seems as good as can be expected, wants to be alone but is still talking to me over messenger about everything.**

**I'm staying at Maxs just in case. Guy is trying to talk to me and to her, but the only responses he's gotten are to read the note she left him again.**

Lastly, thank you so much to the people who commented, especially the ones who wrote a lot and gave me such good advice and just sent general good feelings my way. or PM'd me. You guys were amazing. I'm super grateful for all the comments!"
"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 5 years, is he treating me poorly or am I just too picky


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m5gwp/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_of_5_years_is_he/

This is an update to a post I made about three and a half months ago. I apologize that I am updating under a new username; I can't remember the password for the other throwaway I was using and never registered it to an email. Oops. I'm sorry it took so long to update; a lot has happened and I've done my best to keep busy.



I want to extend my thanks to everyone who took the time to read my post, especially those who replied. I guess I kind of always knew in the back of my mind that my relationship was abusive, but felt that I needed permission to leave. I know that doesn't make sense. I guess I was just feeling so beat down by that point that I didn't even feel like I had enough agency to make my own decisions.



Several of you expressed genuine fear for my safety, and a few suggested that I just up and leave while he was at work one day. That particular scenario didn't end up happening, but here's the story of what did happen.



I managed to hold out for about another week or so after my original post. It was such a big decision, I wanted to make sure that I had all my bases covered before talking to him (apartment, possessions, cat, etc). I became more and more visibly depressed with each passing day - not sadness due to leaving, but just... a sad person. He eventually ended up asking me what was wrong when we were lying in bed one night, and I told him I was not happy in this relationship and that I wanted to end things. He took it quite well at first, and we managed to have some remarkably productive and civil discussions about how to proceed with belongings/living situation/etc, but of course that didn't last. He moved out about a week after our relationship ended (he insisted he be the one to leave). I had nowhere else to go at the time, otherwise I would not have dealt with his bullshit for as long as I did after the breakup.



He spent the next couple of days after the breakup basically sobbing and trying to convince me to take him back and give him another chance, but I stood my ground and refused to do so. Then, he devolved into insulting me, harassing me, and blaming me for perceived problems in his life.



I'll spare you all of the ridiculous dramatic details, but there came a point where he was incessantly asking me to have sex with him 'one last time for closure.' I told him no, kept telling him no, and he said that if I wouldn't do it, then our breakup would no longer be civil, that I ruined that for myself, and that my decision to say no didn't deserve to be respected. I still said no. He slammed his fists down on the arms of the chair he was sitting on, and got up and came at me. We were the only two people in the house at the time, and I fled. I spent most of the night in my car in a grocery store parking lot a few towns away, only returning home when several roommates were around and awake. I feared for my safety otherwise. In retrospect, calling the cops would absolutely have been the best route to take, but I was so fucking horrified and exhausted that it didn't even cross my mind at the time. The next day was his move-out date, and I was so happy. While he was getting all of his shit out of the house, I went shopping. I bought a new bedding set, new curtains, some minor decor, and rearranged my whole bedroom as a mini fresh start. I really had a new outlook on things.



My roommates ended up kicking me out a couple weeks later so they could move him back in. He roped them in with his stories of how much he was suffering after I left him, how he was having such a hard time, how they're his only friends in the world, and how awful I am. These roommates were some of the best friends I ever had - lifelong friends, like since childhood... Having nowhere else to go, I pulled some pretty big strings and moved in with a relative in a nearby town and started to build my life back up. My ex started dating one of our mutual friends from uni about 2 weeks after we broke up - someone I was always suspicious of, but he always told me to never worry about her. So, there's that. Hope they're having fun or whatever. A mutual acquaintance has told me that he treats her the same way he always treated me.



Things are much better now. I have since saved up some money, quit my soul-sucking job, and now live and work in a different city fairly far away. It is really nice to not have to worry about running into my ex or my ex-roommates/friends. I've also started seeing someone else. He's been in a very similar situation to what I experienced. So, we are making sure to pace ourselves and we always try our best to be mindful of each others' needs and feelings, as well as our own needs and feelings. He treats me with genuine respect, and while things are still pretty new, I am optimistic about this, as well as my future in general. I'm pretty busy these days, but once I get health insurance from my new job, I am going to set up regular therapy appointments to help process all of these changes in my life, as well as my attitudes about healthy relationships and about my own self-worth.



Random internet strangers, thank you so much for being so kind and caring to a scared, tired, just plain beat-down woman. Your words gave me the boost of momentum I needed to solidify my decision to get the fuck out. I am so glad I did.



tl;dr:  Left his ass, he got dramatic and somewhat scary, after some changes in life circumstances things are really looking up!"
"My(26M) girlfriend(27M) of a year didn't tell me she had a kid (7F).

"I [24 M] was born without my left arm, or so I thought... While housesitting for my parents (58 M and 55 F) I decided to watch some home videos. One of those videos was me with both arms as a baby...

"My (32F) wife (30F) of 4 years is ""over-teaching"" our kids (2 and 4M). EVERYTHING is either a learning experience or an opportunity to learn a ""skill"". I feel like I'm living in a children's workbook and I can't anymore.


No, my wife is not actually a teacher.  

So our kids are to the ages where they're becoming little people and it's awesome.  Our older LOVES being a big brother, and the younger is growing by leaps and bounds.  Life is pretty damned good.  

Except we can't go out of the house without it being a completely out of control ""learning experience"" or an opportunity for ""skill building"". 

The best way to illustrate this is through examples.

The other day we're at the grocery store.  The older boy is walking, the younger is in the shopping cart.  We have like 10 or so things to buy.

And there's my wife to our older son, who we'll call John, I guess.

""John, can you count how many items are in the cart?  What line should we go in?  Do we need to wait our turn?  Is it our turn yet?  Oh look, it's our turn!  What do we do with our things?  No, we don't put them on the desk, that's not called a desk, it's called a ""checkstand"".  Can you say that word honey?  *Checkstand*  What's the person we pay called?  Can you read his name?  This thing is called a credit card, do you know how it works?""

On and on and on and ON.  Everyone in that damn line was rolling their eyes and giving me sympathetic looks.

Sometimes my wife will let the younger, ""Bill"" help or be present during chores and meal prep or things like that.  It's more of the same.  ""Bill, this is a spoon.  This is a knife.  This is called a ladel and this is what we do with it.  This is a cup.  These are noodles, we need to put them in water that's boiling, and you know water is boiling when you see bubbles, to make them soft enough to eat.  This is dish soap, it makes the dishes clean!""  HE'S TWO FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!

It's just everything is ""learned"" to death.  The other night we were out for a walk and a little kitten darted across the street.  Now, a normal parent might ask the kid what animal that was.  If he says a cat or a kitten, she'd say ""Good job"" and move on.

John said it was a cat.  My wife said ""Yes it's a cat, but it's a baby cat!  Do you know what a baby cat is called?  Is a cat a mammal or a reptile?  How do you know?  How do mammals raise their young?  Do all mammals have fur?""

I told her I was getting a headache, she could finish the walk with the kids and meet me at home.  It wasn't a lie, really.

Something similar happened at the fair too.  I'm not exaggerating when I say the kids never got to go on ONE ride and never got to eat ONE treat because they were so busy learning and ""building skills"" and I can't even deal with that phrase anymore.  It makes me want to scream.

Any time I bring it up, like ""Honey, just let them have fun.  We can talk about what they learned on the way home"" I'll get ""But this is such a great opportunity for them to build skills!  They won't remember in 2 hours!""  If I want to get them a simple, stupid toy that's just for fun, like something they can throw around or a stuffed toy or something, nope, that doesn't help them build any skills!  Or a ball is ""great for helping them build coordination skills!""

Everything, EVERYTHING in our lives in a learning experience.  It's either skill building (OAOIHFAWFIOWEHFAOAHIIOFWEAH I CAN'T ANYMORE!!!) or we/the kids never get to DO the activity because we have to learn about it.

I've talked to her.  God knows I've talked to her.  I've said it great she wants to give our kids such a head start, and make sure they have good life skills *for when they need them* but *everything* doesn't need to be a learning activity.  They can't just color random designs on paper, they have to build skills!  Then we have to go through the primary colors and learn about crayons and then do some skill building or ""enrichment"" activity.  

They can't just have fun.  They can't just PLAY.  

After the fair, I lost my shit that night.  She was getting undressed and remarked how much fun the kids had.  I am not proud to say I blew my stack.  This was after AT LEAST 100 conversations with various approaches about this, and I ended up shouting ""No, they did NOT have fun!  They didn't get to ride the Ferris wheel, they got a physics lesson.  They didn't get to eat deep fried anything, they got a nutrition lesson.  They didn't get to play games, they got a counting lesson.  They didn't get to try to win a goldfish, they got a zoology lesson.  NOTHING THE KIDS DID COULD POSSIBLY CONSIDERED FUN IN ANY UNIVERSE!!!""

And now I'm an ""apathetic"" father leaving her to ""do all the teaching"" when they're ""my kids too"".

I'm at the end of my rope.  It's not like I NEVER want them to have learning experiences.  It's not like I NEVER want them to do anything educational.  But they need to just *be fucking kids* sometimes too, and she thinks she's ""making learning fun"" when nothing is fun anymore.

And I can't listen to anymore of these buzzwords like skill building and enrichment and everything repeated 50 times to the kids or I'm going to lose my ever loving mind.

HELP ME REDDIT!!!

tl;dr My life is an elemetary school classroom, my kids never get to just have fun because they always have to learn.  Apparently that makes me a terrible father.  Wife won't even entertain my opinions on the matter, who do I do?"
"Me [27F] and my fiancé [28M]; we were being robbed at knifepoint, and he ran away and left me


This happened about eight months ago, and I’ve tried to be reasonable and put it past me but I’m really struggling. I’ve been told what he did was reasonable, makes sense, etc, but I keep coming back to that moment of total abandonment and fear when I realised he’d run. I just feel completely alone around him now.

We were walking home from a work function at a bar at around 1am. Neither of us had drunk that evening so we weren’t even slightly tipsy. Two guys across the street from us crossed over and approached us asking if we knew where such-and-such a street was. As fiancé turned around to point out where the street was, one of the guys pulled out a knife and told us to stop moving and to give him all our shit (phone, wallet, etc). I was surprised by how calm I was in the moment, and told them I needed to reach into my coat pocket to get my phone. As I was doing that, the guy pressed the knife against my ribs as warning because I guess he was worried I had a gun (even though that’s pretty unlikely in my country). When this happened, my fiancé bolted. It took me a bit to even realise he’d left me, and when I realised that he’d run I was certain I was about to get badly hurt or die.

Fortunately, the thieves seemed to get kind of spooked by him getting away and just hurried me up. They took my phone, bag (with my purse with all my money, cards, personal effects), necklace (worth like ten bucks) and legged it. The whole ordeal from start to finish took maybe five minutes.

I was kind of in shock and wandered off back up the street, heading back towards the bar, not even really thinking. A few minutes later my fiancé found me and told me he called the police, who arrived about ten minutes later.

I found out that fiancé had run about a block away, calling emergency services as he ran. We were both okay physically, except for a tiny bit of broken skin on my ribs where they’d pressed the knife.

My fiancé says what he does makes sense – that if he’d hung around and it turns out they’d wanted to hurt us or worse, we’d both be fucked because no one else would be around to call the cops or an ambulance. That he wanted to be alive and able to help in case something happened to me. He also says that by running away, the thieves didn’t want to hang around any longer than necessary (which is true), which might have saved me. His mum agrees and has praised him for not being an idiot, but my own mother has quietly told me she thinks he’s a coward for abandoning his wife-to-be (but she also has very oldschool beliefs about gender roles). Fiancé asked me not to tell our friends exactly what happened, because he says they wouldn’t understand his actions unless they were there.

My own thoughts are that, by running away, he potentially significantly decreased my chance of survival. I’m only about 157cm (5’2”) and 51kgs (110lbs). He’s 178cm (5’10”) and 75kg (165lbs). The two guys were about his size. They would have been able to easily overpower/subdue me, but my fiancé there would have made it 2v2 (although we would have still been at a disadvantage, them still having a knife and size advantage) and not left me completely at the mercy of two criminals who mug couples at night. I also wonder, what would have happened if him leaving me had given them the courage to do something worse? I mean, I don't think they would have - they seemed pretty strung out, interested in valuables and cash only - but what if?

I look at him and wonder, do I even want kids with him? If I did have a child with him, would he abandon him or her in a dangerous situation because it was the ‘smart’ thing to do?

I’ve lost a lot of attraction to him. He accuses me of wanting to use him as a meatshield just because he’s a man, and that what he did was smart and not the machismo stupidity I ‘wanted’ that could have gotten us both killed. I didn’t want him to try to fight them… I just wanted him by my side. Which I guess is selfish, because it was a dangerous situation. I don’t feel safe around him anymore, which I used to. I’m even scared of the dark again, despite him lying in bed right next to me.

As I'm typing this, I kind of feel like Lex in Jurassic Park, after being ditched by the lawyer - ""He left us! He left us!"". Stupid thing to add, but I keep thinking of that scene!

I don’t know what to think. He doesn’t want to see a counsellor because, again, he says they wouldn’t understand the situation unless they’d experienced it themselves. We fortunately don’t have a wedding date set, so there’s no immediate pressure of marriage. Please help!

tl;dr: My fiancé ran away and left me to face two muggers by myself. He says it was the smart, logical thing to do, but I can’t get over how abandoned I felt in the moment and I’ve lost a lot of regard for him."

"My (29F) best friend (30F) and her husband (28M) visited for the weekend. My girlfriend (28F) and I don’t want him in our house ever again.


**Background:** I’ve known my best friend, Nicole, since freshmen year of college (10 years ago). She met Mike her senior year. They married two years ago and have a son together. 

Nicole is incredibly laid back, incredibly go-with-the-flow. She’s friendly, bubbly, has never been high maintenance or demanding of attention. I was initially wary of Mike because he came off as undeservedly cocky and self-centered. One of those people that walks into the room while blasting his own personal WWE entrance song in his head. But he made her happy and he was utterly devoted to her, so I figured that was good enough. We’ve lived in different cities since we’ve graduated, so I only see Nicole and Mike a few times a year.

As additional background, my girlfriend and I have been together a year, and we just got a house together. She and Nicole clicked immediately, but she has spent minimal time around Mike.

**The rest:** Nicole and Mike stayed at our house this weekend because the college football team they support was playing our local team, and they had tickets to the game. 

The gf and I were bracing for Mike’s tendency to dominate the conversation this weekend, but we weren’t anticipating just how insufferable he would become. It was a painful two days, and I was glad to see them leave this morning.

 Some examples of his behavior:

* **His football team lost, and his whiney attitude put a damper on the entire night.** I’m a football fan. I get it. I’m a bit mopey when my team loses, too, especially the way his team lost (They were highly ranked and favored and lost in a big way - if you follow college football, you can probably guess what game I’m talking about). But he pouted about it - loudly and often - the entire night. The gf and I were watching the other games on TV when Mike and Nicole got back from theirs. He stormed in the door, immediately grabbed two beers from the fridge, flopped down on the entire length of the couch and ranted about the loss for a good 15 minutes. He’d then flip between ranting about the loss during every lull in the conversation to sulking quietly while he sprawled across the couch, forcing Nicole and my gf to sit on the floor (We just moved in, so we’re still short on furniture). The conversation could never last for more than five minutes without Mike interjecting his disgust with his team’s loss. Funny enough, every time he’d leave to pout in the other room, Nicole, my gf and I would get super chatty and have a great time laughing and joking. Then he’d come back in, stamping around petulantly, interrupting whatever we had been talking about, and the general mood would immediately sour. He’d talk about how inconsolable he was each time he tipped back a new beer or smoked another bowl. He told us a half-dozen times the exact scenario that could play out for his team to still make the playoffs. He even started ranting about the game to strangers next to us at dinner. Five hours later.


* **He was abrasive towards all three of us, but most of all his own wife.** Whenever we ladies would tease each other, we'd all share in the laughter, but the moment anyone would say anything resembling teasing towards him, he'd get super loud and defensive. He'd throw a tantrum and Nicole would have to continually apologize or explain what ""we really meant"" and how it wasn't meant to be offensive. For example, Mike was raving about his peach cobbler old-fashioned at dinner - which was a welcome break from his boo-hooing about the game. I told him I'm glad he found a happy place, and Nicole mumbled something in agreement. He stared her down and said, ""BETTER? What do you MEAN I'm 'BETTER'?"" She looked a bit taken aback and clarified that she meant he must be feeling better. Later in the night, Nicole sat on Mike's lap on the couch and invited me to sit on her lap so my girlfriend could take a picture of all three of us. As I was attempting to position myself for the photo, Mike said, ""You're covering my face."" As I continued to adjust, he yelled: ""YOU'RE COVERING MY FACE!"" then shoved me off of them.



* **He made inappropriate and embarrassing comments about his and Nicole’s sex life.** The more Mike drank, the more he'd switch between making passive-aggressive comments about his sex life and feeling up on Nicole. He'd talk about blue balls and needing sex and how he wished Nicole would wear sundresses because girls look good in them. It's like he took advantage of every opening he had to make a quip about their sex life. He also took every opportunity he could to grope Nicole, even going so far as to putting his hand down her shirt collar mid-conversation. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to take out her contacts, she overheard him begging Nicole for sex in the guest bedroom. My girlfriend said the more Nicole pushed back, the whinier Mike got. 


* **He’d lash out if we didn’t react to something he said the way he wanted us to.** Whether it was a crude comment or a so-called sarcastic quip he'd make or his demand to go play Pokemon Go! the entire night (We played it to and from dinner both nights) or his inability to handle losing rounds in Cards Against Humanitiy, he'd make a scene every time something didn't go his way. He asked if we could go back to the Slushee shop we stopped at on Friday to get more alcoholic Slushees, and then added only if I ""stopped being such a *bi-atch*"" and drank with them since I didn't the night before (I declined, though I encouraged them to drink, and he still looked personally offended that I didn't want to). When we were all sharing bites of the side dishes we all ordered at dinner, he made fun of my braised kale (it was braised with bacon, for goodness sakes) and told me he'd stick with his ""shitty mac and cheese."" As if me ordering kale instead of make and cheese was a personal affront to him. 
 

* **He single-handedly smashed the weekend’s worth of beer and snacks meant for all of us.** I bought two bags of chips and a 24 pack of beer for the weekend. He slammed 18 of those beers and left nothing but crumbs from the two bags of chips. This complaint might be petty - after all, I did buy those things for our consumption - but I can’t imagine being a guest in someone’s home and cleaning out the entire weekend’s supply of snacks/drinks by myself. The cherry on top came when he he polished off his second drink at dinner (his 12th drink of the day) and suggested that I might need to go out and get some more beer because “we” were almost out. 

I realize there’s probably nothing truly damning here. He didn’t trash the house. He didn’t clean out our whole pantry - just the snacks we bought. In fact, he actually fixed a leak that sprung under the kitchen sink while the gf and I were out for a walk Saturday morning. 

But added up all together, it was an exhausting and frustrating weekend.

It got to a point on Saturday night where the gf excused herself to run to an ATM. When she had been gone a half hour, I texted her to make sure she was OK. She responded, “I can’t stand Mike. I just need a minute to myself.” For context, my girlfriend has one of the most easy-going personalities I’ve ever known. She also works in a customer service industry where she manages dozens of employees with different personality types in a high-stress environment. So it’s pretty hard to faze her. 

Last night when we laid down for bed, we agreed neither of us would be comfortable with him in our home again.

Which brings us to the crux of the situation: How do I begin to approach my best friend about this? If she wants to come visit again, how do I possibly tell her her husband is not welcome? She would come to our defense whenever he’d channel one of his micro-aggressions towards us, but it’s not like they’re getting a divorce over it. So this problem won’t be going away.

Are my girlfriend and I overreacting? We aren’t in college anymore. We’re all either 30 or approaching it. In fact, their relationship in general seems pretty unhealthy, but that’s an entirely different conversation. (Though I’d welcome advice on that, too, if it comes to that.) 

**tl;dr:** Girlfriend and I hosted my best friend and her husband this weekend. Husband acted like all of the rotten children from Willy Wonka combined. We don’t want him back in the house. Asking for advice on how to navigate what will eventually be a difficult conversation.

--------------------------------------

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, everyone. I appreciate the advice and the support. It looks like the concern here is less about addressing this weekend and more addressing this type of behavior in their relationship in general. I know from past nights of drinking with them that this wasn't a one-time behavior. He's acted like this before, only in smaller, less intense doses. 

I want to make sure she's OK and happy (if that's possible after what I observed?!). Nicole kind of opened the door when she texted me, ""Sorry Mike was so abrasive and obnoxious last night...I didn't realize he drank as much as he had,"" earlier this afternoon. My girlfriend uses reddit and has also been monitoring this thread, and we decided that I'm going to start that conversation with Nicole tomorrow morning - during work hours so I know he won't be lurking over her shoulder. 

I know that^ ^ ^ response might have seemed obvious from the get-go, but as I said to one of the commenters: Because Nicole is so laid-back, we've had a relatively breezy friendship and have never had to confront a tricky subject like this one. So as odd as it might sound, this is pretty unfamiliar territory for us.

--------------------------------------

**UPDATE:** I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to offer your thoughts and advice. I read every comment. Some of you thought my girlfriend and I could have done a better job standing up to Mike. While there were definitely some situations we could have handled better or firmer, I wanted to clarify that, overall, we didn't just let him roll over us. Every time he blatantly disrespected one of us, someone (whether it was me or Nicole) stood up to him. 

We also tried to make the weekend as inclusive for everyone as possible. I'm aware that Mike was, literally, the odd man out, so we tried to accommodate what everyone wanted to a reasonable degree. Mike wanted to get alcohol Slushees on Friday, so we got alcohol Slushees. Mike wanted to play Pokemon Go!, so we made sure to play to and from our walks to dinner both nights. Other times, he wanted to do something that no one else wanted to do (like have dinner at 4 p.m. or go back for more alcohol Slushees on Saturday), so we wouldn't. 

Also for the record, neither my girlfriend nor I hate men. It's just one man's actions in particular that rubbed us the wrong way. I got a good laugh out of that accusation, though. 

On to the update:

After spending Sunday evening talking with my gf about how to address this tactfully, I messaged Nicole this morning. I wanted to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't want to jump to any conclusions about the nature of their relationship, but I wanted to be sure Nicole knew the door would be open if she ever felt uncomfortable with the way he talks to her when he's drunk (or sober, for all I know!)

I wish I had a more interesting update, but the talk went how I thought it'd go. No earth-shattering revelations.

Like I said in my edit, Nicole had texted me the night before apologizing for Mike's behavior. So I used that as an opening.

**Me:** Sorry I didn't get back to you last night. But I just wanted you to know... You shouldn’t feel the need to apologize for Mike. I do have to admit he made both of us pretty uncomfortable this weekend, but that is not your fault nor is it something you should be apologizing for. It was important to us you both had a good time, and I hope you did. I was worried if you were happy the whole time. I want you to know you can talk to me if he ever makes you unhappy or uncomfortable because some of the things he said to you this weekend makes me worry he isn't treating you correctly. I love you and I miss seeing you, and I want you to know that the door is always open if you need to talk.

**Nicole:** What did he say that made you concerned for me?  Because I promise I couldn't be happier.  I think he just really wants you to like him, but he gets weird and awkward and tried too hard. Plus the alcohol didn't help anything.

Based on that response, I didn't see a point in belaboring the issue. Even *if* there are deeper issues in their relationship, it's clear that talk wouldn't be happening now. But hopefully, there aren't. Hopefully, she's being honest with me and herself. 

**So I said:** Well that's a relief! I guess there were a few moments where it seemed like he made you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I'm glad you are as happy as you could be. That's all I was worried about.

She went quiet for a half hour, and I feared that I had upset her. But she eventually responded.

**Nicole:** Yea there were a few times where I knew what he was saying was coming out totally offensive, so it made me cringe because he has the worst foot in mouth syndrome and doesn't realize what he's saying is coming out wrong.  I don't know why he gets so weird and feels like he needs to make jokes but it always makes things weird.  But you don't have anything to worry about with me.

I didn't want to push her, though I was tempted to say, ""If Mike was really sorry, why are you the one apologizing to us?"" But I didn't. So there you have it. We ended up exchanging ""It was good to see you!"" messages, and the convo kind of died there. 

Best case scenario, it was just a really, really bad weekend for Mike, but Nicole is otherwise happy, healthy and whole. Worst case scenario... well, at least she knows the door is open. So if it gets to that point, I hope she talks to me.

"My [40F] brother [50M] passed away and he left his two children [13F&amp;14M]. He was a very, very wealthy man and he left everything to his son and nothing to his daughter. My nephew wants to split it 50/50 with his sister but my brothers [40'sM] are against it


Hi Reddit I am hoping you can help me out. My brother passes away from cancer over the summer and they have come to live with me. I live in a small town in the midwest and they are adjusting OK. My nephew has his first little girlfriend and it's an adjustment for them. 

They grew up in the lap of luxury pretty much, I am talking private jet level wealthy. They are close and my niece and nephew really do have each others backs. My brother for some ungodly reason left his fortune and everything that comes with it to his son.

My nephew wants to split everything between him and his sister when they turn 18. He does not think it's fair that he gets everything and really neither of them will have to work a day in their lives. 

My brothers/his uncles are against the idea and they think it's wrong to go against the will. How do I get through to them

"I [25f] have recently been diagnosed with an medical condition, my SO [29m] of 2 years thinks I am HIV positive and is being a jerk


Basically I have recently been diagnosed (like in the past week) with an auto immune condition (am willing to PM people the name of the condition, just don’t want to say it publicly because SO knows I reddit, and I can’t imagine that this is a common situation). In the grand scheme of auto immune conditions it’s on the low end. It’s completely non-contagious and I am in the process of working with my immunologist to treat the condition via a combination of steroids and immunosuppressants. It’s not going to kill me or lower my life expectancy, it’s just a chronic thing that will flare up throughout my life. 


SO and I have been together for almost 2 years now, and up until my diagnosis it has been smooth sailing. When I got the diagnosis, my boyfriend completely freaked out and now thinks that because I have an autoimmune condition, I must be HIV positive. In the last week, I have started a huge dose of immunosuppresents to get the condition under control. Of course this means it has wreaked havoc on my immune system – something my family dr, the immunologist and pharmacist have advised me on – and I am more susceptible to certain illnesses.. Last week I developed a pretty nasty flu and had an outbreak of cold sores. SO was livid, and thinks that is a sign of HIV. He started yelling at me, accused me of cheating on him and left our home to stay with his family. 


I don’t have HIV. I have had multiple blood work and tests in the past couple of months. I’ve offered for SO to come with me to speak to my doctor. He is insisting that I must have HIV, and he is not coming home until I admit that I lied/cheated on him.


I honestly don’t know what more I can do. I am exhausted, sick and now dealing with a long term (and expensive) health condition. I don’t want to fight him, but I want him on my side.  We haven’t spoken in 2 days, but he is still texting me. What can I do to convince him I am not cheating/HIV positive?

His wife and daughters [40F, 16F, 14F,10F] refuse to believe this was an accident. His wife divorced him and nothing could change her mind about it.

"My wife [34F] of 10 years is completely smothering our daughter [18F] after she left for college. I [33M] can't get her to see how she's harming her daughter and herself.


So as is evident by the title, my wife had her daughter very young. The father is not in the picture. I met my wife when she was 22 and her daughter, Rachel, was 6. We got married two years later, I officially adopted Rachel, and we've been very happy ever since. 

Rachel went off to college this year. She ended up taking a few summer courses and getting involved in some organizations, so she actually moved up to school in June instead of the traditional August. Rachel was extremely excited about going off to school, and I was excited for her, too. She's going to my alma mater and those 4 years were some of the best in my life; I have no doubt she's going to be very happy there, too. Her mom was not so excited. My wife has always been a bit on the protective side, and she and Rachel are incredibly close. 

But she's taking it to all new levels lately. I personally am taking the same approach my parents took with me when I went off to school: I text Rachel 2-3 times during the week just to see what she's up to, and I call and talk to her for about 30 minutes on Friday afternoons and maybe another 10 minute call on Sunday evenings. I think this is pretty normal. Rachel is an outgoing, fun, kind young lady. I know what college is like. I call her at times when I know she won't be out partying or on dates or whatever. I try to text her at times that I think she'd just be chilling in her dorm or just walking across campus. Calls before 11 am on Saturdays or Sundays don't happen. 

My wife, on the other hand...she is constantly texting Rachel. She calls her every evening and wants to have hour long chats. She practically begs her to come home every weekend (she goes to school about 3 hours away), and when Rachel says she can't, my wife offers to come up and visit her. Rachel has come home an average of 2 weekends a month since she's been at school, and my wife has been up there for ""girls' weekends"" three other times. About a month ago we went to visit Rachel. I booked a hotel for my wife and I and told Rachel we would take her and a friend, if she wanted, out to dinner. Maybe do a bit of shopping, walk around town, but nothing too crazy. Since it was a Friday night I figured we'd be done by 8 pm so Rachel could go out with her friends, and then we could grab lunch on Saturday (after the hangover wears off, hah) before heading home. My wife brought a sleeping bag and stayed in Rachel's room, and spent all evening with her as well as all day Saturday. 

This isn't healthy for either of them. I've spoken to Rachel about it and she says she wishes she had some more freedom, but doesn't want to hurt her mom. I get that. But Rachel is a young lady and she needs to be cut loose a bit. I don't want her being that weird girl who is always going home for the weekend, or who's mom spends weekends on her floor. She can't go out, have fun, do the stuff college kids are supposed to do. She can't gain her own identity. And my wife. This is her chance to have the bit of youth she never had because she was raising a kid. She needs to learn to cope with the empty nest syndrome. Eventually Rachel isn't going to come home twice a month or for the summer. She'll actually be *gone*, living her own life. College is supposed to be that transitional period and my wife is ruining that.

"My [21F] best friend [21F] drunk drove and totalled her car last night, but not before burning me over text.


**EDIT this blew up more than I expected, so clarification on a few recurring comments. The text I received this morning is as follows: ""Omg I'm so awful I totalled my car drunk driving I don't even remember saying that shit I'm so sorry. Idk how I'm not arrested"".**

**I haven't responded. Her nonchalant last remark indicates to me that no police were involved - she would have mentioned it. I am very definitely cutting ties, I've given her more than enough chances. Some of these events happened over the course of years, which is why I haven't reported anything earlier. They seemed like isolated incidents. Since she turned 21, they have gotten much more common because she has access to more alcohol.**

**I appreciate every comment, even the harsh ones.**

**EDIT 2: On my way to the police station now. I'll fill y'all in when I have a full update to give.**

**UPDATE: I spoke to a police officer this morning. While he was very understanding, he stressed that they could not do anything about this incident. A police report hadn't been filed on the crash because it did not happen in our hometown. They also can't charge her with anything, as they'd need a BAC test done on-scene. There is no special ""list"" for habitual drunk drivers as I had naively hoped, but he said he'd make a call to her parents for me. He would let them know that one of their daughter's concerned friends stopped by to talk about her drinking problems, let them know that the drunk driving is a recurring event, and that the recent car crash was due to her driving while intoxicated. He then sent me on my way with some resources. Hopefully her parents (who financially support her) will finally realize how serious this issue is.**

**I also just got off the phone with a police officer in the town where the crash took place. It was no simple fender-bender. Friend drunkenly smashed into a row of parked vehicles, then left the scene of the accident. The details are fuzzy, but somehow, she got brought into the station and refused to speak with the officers. She only said that she had not been driving the car, and that some random guy that she met at the bar had been. The officer on the phone asked me for the text she sent me, word for word, as well as the time it was sent and the phone number it was sent from. According to the officer, she is only being charged with leaving the scene of an accident. They really do not want her to stick with her story of ""someone else was driving the car"" because that leads into insurance fraud, which is a much more serious deal.**

**I don't know if I'll have much more information than this, unless I hear it through the grapevine. I doubt she's allowed to have a phone anymore. It sounds like she's getting off pretty easy, considering. Hello, rock bottom.**


I use the term ""best friend"" loosely. In high school, maybe. She's done a lot of things that have pushed me away over the years; for example:

- She drove us to a party, immediately got wasted, and wouldn't let me drive her car ""because it's hers"" when it was time to go home. She convinced me she was sober (basic denial, I assumed I hadn't seen her drinking as much as I thought I had) and she drove us home without incident. A couple days later, she made a comment off-hand about how I shouldn't have let her drive because she was so drunk.

- She came to pick me up with a beer in her hand. Gave me a ""please don't fight with me"" face. I figured she couldn't possibly be that stupid, so I assumed it was her first beer. We drove to a friend's house and got lost. She blamed it on being drunk. It was not her first beer.

- Went out to a diner for food. When it came time to pay, I had cash and she had card. She took my money + my tip and charged her card. she was supposed to leave her tip + mine. She was being weirdly secretive as she signed the slip, so I went back a few hours later to ask the waiter if she left a tip (side note, she pulled some shit that night that made me very angry so I wanted to follow-up about her shady behavior from earlier). She left no tip, and used my tip to pay for a portion of her meal.

- She has the same relationship with her parents that I had with mine when I was 16 and going through a rebel phase. Her parents are good people, but she acts like they're so unreasonable for asking her to pay for her car insurance, phone bill, and to not have boys in their home when they're away.

- More on that - she decided to take a year off of school ""because she has been working so hard and deserved it"" without telling her parents, thus forcing them to support her for another year. She is 4 years through a 6 year program. She also didn't know her program was 6 years long (she thought it was 5) until halfway through her senior year.

- She failed one of her classes that is only available in the spring, so she didn't even pass her 4th year. Before she knew she failed, she just kept wondering aloud about it, and ignoring my advice to call a guidance counsellor or email her peofessor. Granted, all of that should have been done during the school year. She just waited for her diploma to come in the mail, and it never did.

- I admit I am envious of her parents completely paying for her college. I am 46000 in debt (not a huge deal, I'll have it paid off in 3 years) and she has no student debt because her father paid for it all. But it's the level of entitlement that gets me - letting her parents support her financially, and thinking she ""deserves"" time off school.


Sorry that this is rambling. There's so much more. The drunk driving thing is a pattern. She told me she got blackout at her nephews SECOND birthday party and had to get dragged home while swearing. She then said she snagged a spare pair of keys and drunk drove to her loser boyfriends house, and stayed there for a few days ignoring her parents.

I can't handle this level of emotional immaturity. I've already decided to cut ties. She got blackout last night and texted me a bunch of nasty things because I chose to go to my boyfriend of 2 years' house instead of hanging out with her. She threw in a few low blows. This morning, I woke up to an apology text telling me that she had drunk driven and totalled her car. I haven't responded.


Please, please help me figure out how to handle this. My gameplan right now is to go to the police and show them the text message of her admitting to drunk driving. I hope to get her on some kind of ""list"" so that they look out for her on the road. Can this legally get her in trouble? I'm not looking to do that, because I know her parents will have to foot the bill. Should I say something to her parents? They know about the drunk driving incident from her nephews birthday, but I don't think they know the extent of it.

Any and all advice appreciated.

TL;DR: Friend from high school is generally shitty and unreliable, has recently gotten into the habit of drinking and driving, and totalled her car. What steps should I take to protect others from her? Should her parents know all of this, some of this, or is that just mean of me?"
"[UPDATE] Me [23M] with my Girlfriend [22F] of 6 years. She cheated on me.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52f0hf/me_23m_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_6_years_she/)


turns out that she lied to my face when I gave her the opportunity to tell me the truth. It was not that one drunk mistake as she tried to make me believe. She fucked the guy five times over the three day trip. The sister of one of my best friends was with her on the trip and he knew all the time but did not say anything as he wanted to give her the opportunity to tell me the truth. 


I confronted her and she confessed. She said that she lied to me to save our relationship. I think that shows how mentally fucked up you have to be in that kind of situation. As if lying would safe a relationship... 


Afterwards I completely passed out for the first time in my life. Probably because my mind could not handle it. Luckily, I had a friend who took care of me. 


I still cannot believe how a human you think you know better than yourself can change that drastically over such a short period of time. Something like that can really fuck with your worldview. I started to question everything but I hope that I will be able to fix this in the future. Time will tell.


I'm definitely done with this shit. I actually thought that there might be a chance to make this work again but now I know that this is not going to happen. I cut all contact.

So I turned 18 about a week ago and a bit has happened since my last post.


Things I've done.


1.) Moved out, my parents refused to understand me or my line of work, I haven't worked a second at the fast food restaurant, I've spent the last 3 weeks or so without any access to a computer, apparently it was my parents way of punishing me for disobeying them. Right now I'm on rocky terms with them, they don't support me moving out, and moving in with my friend who is a sophomore in college who has his own apartment.

2.) I lost about half of my reoccurring clients due to dropping off the map for 3 weeks, I'm in the process of restoring some of them, others don't want to work with me anymore, by the end of this week I should have around 75% of my original client base so I'm low on money for a bit.

3.) **I did my taxes** thanks for all that, my friend's parents were lifesavers here, took way long than I thought, but since I kept throughout records it could have been far worse. It's all been sorted out now, but glad that was pointed out to me.

So basically now my family fucking hates me. They think I abandoned my family to go off and do gods knows what. I've called my grandparents, uncles, aunts, even my cousins refuse to talk to me. As previously stated in my family, family is important, so I'm not really surprised at that. The only people who will talk to me is my brother, who _secrectly_ supports my decision, his wife and my one cousin who also was excommunicated from the family.

Right now I live at my friends apartment with another guy, I pay for 1/4th the rent and personal tutoring for their computer science courses. I started senior year _technically_. I am not going to the high school I was earlier. Turns out I only really needed to take one more class before I could graduate from my high school, I'm taking that class online now and will technically graduate in October. Its slightly convoluted, but it was enough for the college that accepted me to grand me early enterence, so I start there in January with my full ride still in tact. Like I said I lost around half my reoccuring clients, but the money is still there, I'm not nearly as busy as I was before, but I still have stuff to do. So my finacial status is alright, my family is what's killing me.


I decided to move out about a month ago and made plans with it with my friend, but only told my parents the night before. In hindsight it was a dick move, but I was afraid what might have happened if I told them earlier. When I left with my suitcase the next day, my parents physically attempted to stop me, I ended up having to leave with nothing. No clothes, no computer, no nothing. I was unable to move my stuff out. Since then my parents have refused to let me in the house to get it, I'm not sure what has happened to my stuff, most importantly my computer, luckily all of my stuff has been backed up and been restored to my new setup which is a bit more portable. 


It's tough, but I think I made the right descsion.

"My [17f] loser older brother [26m] flushed our step-brother's [12m] fish down the toilet on purpose. My parents are acting like it isn't a big deal and I'm ANGRY about it.


My oldest brother....we'll call him Dick has always been a spoiled jerk but he's worst to our little brother Duvall because he's jealous of him. Duvall is sweet and smart so everyone has always liked him better. Duvall is our step-mom's kid but he's been our brother since he was five. 


Duvall is really shy and his best friend is his pet fish Marco. His Instagram is just pictures of Marco and us. Our rooms share a wall and I hear him talking to Marco sometimes. 


My parents pretty much let Dick get his way all the time because of his temper. He's immature and rude. It's so stupid I think they should just kick him out so we could have some peace for once. 


The other day when I was at soccer practice Dick's laptop wasn't working and he wanted to use Duvall's. Duvall was working on a school project so he ran in our dad's office and locked it so Dick couldn't take it. Dick went upstairs and flushed Marco. Then he went downstairs and told Duvall through the door what he did. Duvall ran to see if Dick was telling the truth and Dick took his laptop. 


I screamed at Dick when I got home and found out and he just laughed at me. Duvall was making himself sick he was crying so hard. He kept asking me if Marco suffered and if I thought he was scared when he died and if he hated Duvall for not taking care of him. I called my parents but both their secretaries said they were busy. Dick wouldn't stop making fun of Duvall for crying so I called Dick's girlfriend and told her about all the girls Dick's been talking to so he'd have to go to her place to convince her not to break up again. Whatever he said didn't work, she kicked him out in time to be home for dinner. 


When I told my parents what Dick had done my mom yelled ""Goddamn it (Dick), you're buying him another one!"" and then left the room to get changed for dinner. Then my dad yelled ""And leave his computer alone!"" That was it. That's his punishment. Dick told on me about ratting him out to his girlfriend but my parents hate her and didn't care so I didn't get in trouble either. 


I was really angry about their non reaction and fought with my parents during dinner until my Dad told me to shut up. He said not everything has to be a big deal, it was just a fish, and I'm just being a seventeen year old drama queen. 


Dad gave Duvall his ""brave little soldier"" speech which is dad speak for ""shut up, I don't want to hear about it anymore"". Duvall is putting on a brave face but he has cried himself to sleep every night since and it makes me cry hearing him. I hate Dick and think about setting his room on fire (I won't) a LOT. 


I'm really mad and wish I could call the cops on Dick. This isn't fair and I don't know how to make it better. Duvall doesn't want another fish. 


tl;dr: I'm upset my parents aren't taking my older brother flushing our little brother's pet down the toilet seriously. Dad told me I'm being a drama queen and it isn't my business but he's the one who told me looking out for my brother is my business in the first place! How do I get them to understand how cruel my older brother is? "

"My [42 M] wife [39 F] ""refuses to be my emotional cheerleader."" But yet...


Years ago, at the very beginning of the relationship, she told me that she refused to be my emotional cheerleader. When I would try to open up to her, share my fears or concerns, she would reinforce her stance in no uncertain terms. Negative reinforcement. Anger, frustration, name calling -- calling me a stunted teenager, an emotional cripple. Over a short time, I learned my lesson. If I have something troubling me, keep it inside. 

I found a therapist for several key issues over the years; got treatment for my own depression. Cool. Getting my head straight is always a good idea. But the marriage has suffered.

Now, she says she can never trust me because I'm not emotionally honest with her. In therapy, she mentioned this lack of trust and my lack of openness as a problem in our relationship. I looked at her, reminded her of the way she trained me at the beginning of the relationship, and she smiled and deflected. ""I never told you that..."" Laughed it off right in front of the therapist. Boy, I caught hell for that later that evening.

Why am I sharing this? I've started thinking that my wife may be a narcissist. I'm not sure. Half the time she has me thinking that I'm a narcissist! Odd how every time I bring up something about the relationship that troubles me, it always gets twisted around and ends up being my fault. I don't often bring up my issues.

As a disclaimer, I've always been faithful, a solid and consistent provider, a present and hands-on father. Working from home most days, I do most of the cooking, child-rearing, and cleaning, working after the children are put to bed most nights. She almost certainly has anxiety and depression issues, but refuses treatment. Nothing is her fault. Her perception of reality is correct. Mine is not.

"[UPDATE] My boyfriend's [26M] optimism and immaturity almost destroyed me [25F] financially. I cut him off and now he feels abandoned. Is there any hope he'll grow up or am I being the immature optimist now?


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x9fu0/my_boyfriends_26m_optimism_and_immaturity_almost/

Well a lot has happened since I made my first post. I guess I'll address it sequentially, since that's how I'm operating right now, moment to moment.

After I made that post, I decided to truly cut him off. I changed the wifi password, froze the credit card I gave him, applied to close our joint accounts, and threw out any gifts I ever gave him. We were planning on attending a dork convention over Labor Day (in Atlanta, for those familiar with the con scene) that I had budgeted paying for both of us over a year ago. I told him he couldn't go unless he paid for his half of the hotel and tickets, $600. Not sure why I did this instead of shooting straight and admitting he was out of his gourd if he thought he could go... shouldn't have played any games but I'm kinda glad I did because he told me he'd have $1000 to me by the end of August. Over text too, in writing.

I was floored. Suddenly he can come up with money for a weekend of partying and a chance to reel me back in? I said I would apply that to August's bills, then he could start paying down the rest of the ~$25k he owed me for supporting him this past year before he could spend his money on luxuries like out of state vacations. This was over text, and he never responded, and slept on the couch again that night.

That was a Friday. Saturday morning, he left the house around 9am with his dog, leaving all of his crap in my house. I piled all of his and his dog's stuff under his desk and got rid of any pictures of him around the house. I blocked him everywhere but Facebook and text. I went to two rental house showings, loved one of them and the landlord, put a deposit down that day, went on multiple walks with my dog as well as a long trip to the dog park, and celebrated/vented/drank wine through Twizzlers with my next door neighbour and her boyfriend. Ex-BF never returned that night.

Sunday, I spent the day working on cosplays and outfits for the convention as well as goofing off with my neighbour and dog. It was lovely. I kept waiting for this wave of sadness and regret to hit me, but it never did. He had been out for 24 hours and his name wasn't on the lease - I texted him that his claim to residency was gone, and he needed to come get his things with 24 hours notice. He said he was coming that night. I said 24 hours notice. He agreed to Monday evening.

Monday, he picks up his stuff in his father's truck and gives me back the key. Hours after he left, he added a song to our shared YouTube playlist - ""Say Something"" by A Great Big World. I added ""Gravity"" by Sara Bareilles and ""Too Good"" by Drake, then removed his access to the playlist the next morning. Yay middle school communication methods.

Wednesday his best friend texts me like nothing is wrong. Thursday, I text my ex about when I can expect his check in the mail. He doesn't respond. Friday morning, I email him. At this point, as far as I can tell, he's gone no contact with me. I send him one last email a day later basically stating that, and he asks me to coffee Sunday night.

We met up for coffee. He never mentions repayment at all but in the discussion about our feelings, we both felt the same way about this: betrayed, abandoned, hurt, and distrustful of the other person. He felt I had lied when I said I was fine supporting him and basically insinuated that I wouldn't want to be repaid if I believed in us because otherwise I was actually loaning him money under the guise of love and setting him up to fail. When I realized he felt just as used as me because I cut him off from my money, I knew I was done. My stomach sank like a weight. I let him finish talking, then we parted ways. He asked if he could contact me, I said I needed a break.

The next day I emailed him about the $1000 he promised me and reminded him he never discussed repayment at our meeting. He didn't respond for days, then the day I was set to leave town for the convention, he replies saying the money was on the way. Cool, it can sit in my mailbox for 5 days while I'm out of state. Also, during this time he was telling mutual friends we were ""going through a rough patch"" yet my friends were finding him on Tinder and OKC.

I partied my tail off for the entire convention and when I came back, the check was in an un-postmarked envelope in my mailbox. I cashed it and sent him an email telling him such and asked that he use snail mail for future repayments instead of trespassing on my property when he knows I won't be home. I seriously wonder if he was looking for the spare key I left with the dog sitter... so creepy.

He replied to that email with some mushy ""I love you and I know I fucked up"" things claiming he is too nice and can't say no and his urge to help others makes him neglect himself and he needs to work on that. It was the most laughable apology on earth. ""I was so nice and helpful that I couldn't stop myself from draining you of all your money and energy! My bad.""

I replied ""You broke my heart and my bank account. It will be a long time before they're both fixed, and my then I hope I won't be stupid enough to trust you with them a third time. I will be responding to emails about repayment, otherwise good luck with everything.""

He replied, ""If I could take everything back that I did, I would. I love you (name). With all my heart. I could have prevented it all. I could have taken action. But I let you slip away. And that'll be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I'm truly truly sorry for hurting you. I just want you to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted.""

I moved out of the house we lived in to a similar one a few streets away. Moving helped keep me busy enough to not think about this. I threw out all our mementos and pictures and shit in the process so everything in the new place is all me. Just me.
Now I'm settled in and it feels like it hasn't hit me that it's over. I thought I would be crushed, and there were some lonely moments at the convention that caught me up enough to need a cigarette, but I just feel humiliated. I don't even have the urge to check his Instagram, every time I see a picture of him it just reminds me of how stupid and naive I am for thinking he was my One. I'm also super distrustful of my feelings now because of that... it wasn't a question in my mind when I met him that we'd be together forever. I knew I wanted to spend my life with him, like my name, like a fact. I see cute people out or have great conversations but I have no desire for anything more because I feel like my feelings aren't trustworthy enough to merit acting on them. They led me so far astray last time...

But that's it I guess. It's over and life is going on.

This is so ridiculous but I have almost had enough of my son. I have enough going on with work, without having to listen to him moan. I could use some advice. 

My daughter just started high school as a freshmen and my son Cody is in his last year of middle school. There schools are near each other and there is a mall not to far away. My son went to the mall after school to buy himself something and he ran into my daughter. They decided to walk home together so he hung out with her and her friends. 

They were walking home and there is this short cut through the park you can take. However there is this hill that can be difficult to make your way down sometimes. You're cutting through the garden so there is rocks, branches and plants. My daughter tripped and she started to cry. 

My son told her not to worry and he picked her up and carried her home. I am a paramedic so I could tell right away her ankle was more than likely broken. I took her to the hospital and everything was sorted out. My daughters [19F,21F] go to college but live in a city near us. They drive down every second weekend to visit. 

They and I told my son Cody (13M) that we are proud of him. My son Finn (20M0 on the other hand is mad because he did not call 911 and how in his mind she was in longer pain that necessary. After a long argument my daughters and I just ignored him. 

My son and daughters are ignoring Finn attitude. Finn keeps messaging me about it, he keeps tweeting about it, he made a Facebook post about it, he keeps calling. I know it's easy to ignore him, but how can I get him to stop embarrassing himself?

"My [26F] boyfriend [27M] doesn't like how I spend my money, thinks I'm wasting OUR money


**A slight update located after the first part of my post**

I’m a computer engineer and with the help of my parents, the government and scholarships, I was able to graduate with little debt.

During college and for the first two and a half years of working for a private firm, I lived at home so I was able to save what I made for the future. When I finally moved out into an apartment, I was talking to a guy (Dave) I meet from an online dating app. We went on our first date late January and it went smoothly from there.
 
A little background on Dave and his family. Dave graduated from the same college as me (he got some kind of Art/Science Degree) but he gone back to college to get a degree in Business since he couldn’t find a job that he wanted to work. He lives with three other guys and works part time at a nice steak restaurant. Dave’s parents seem nice but they’re the kind of people that try to keep up with the Joneses even if it’s out of their means. 

Fast forward about 18 months. I’ve been promoted within the company so I’m making more. Dave is still in college, living in the same place, working at the same restaurant. Not much has changed on his front. 

I don’t know what changed but Dave started getting more irritated whenever I gift my family little things or pay for family dinners. He would just make a face like he swallow a gnat and just sit unhappily.

Things came to ahead when he found out that I loaned my older sister some money to help her pay for her wedding.

I don’t remember how it started but we ended up arguing about my so call uncontrollable spending habit. Heated words were exchange, the jist of it was that he didn’t like that I was spending so much money on my family. I told him it wasn’t his place to tell me how I spent my money because it’s my money, not his. His reply was that since we’re together, it’s our money and that I was wasting it. This went on for a while until I told him to leave which he did with the slam of the door.

I haven’t talked to him since we fought which was a couple of days ago.

So I’m looking for some advice on how I should proceed with this relationship.
  ---   
**A slight update, but not yet the resolution I'm looking for..**

**Hey guys, I just wanted to say thanks to all of the comments and advice. It really put a lot of things into perspective for me. That and I talked to my sister last night during dinner about what's going on with Dave and I.** 

**There are a couple of reoccurring comments and things that I want to address. Sorry for not replying to them in the first post.**   

1) We haven't really talked about having a future together. There haven't been any talks about moving in together or getting a house or marriage, nothing. And it's on both of us because I think we're not ready for that next step. He's still in school and I just started my professional career. He's not sure where he’s gonna end up after school whether he's gonna stay in city or even in the state. I like where I work and most of my family is here so I don't see myself moving to follow him if he chooses to leave.

2) As for who pays for our dates, we don't really go out too often simple because it doesn't jive with our schedules. Dave works most weekends since it's the most profitable for him and I like to cook dinner during the weekday so I can eat the leftovers for lunch the next day. Most of the time we eat together at my place. We do go out for special occasions like birthdays and anniversary and he does pay for those (unless it’s his birthday then I pay). And if we go to see a movie (which is not too often, we usually watch stuff on Netflix), we usually split the cost, like he pays for the tickets and I pay for the drinks and snacks.

3) I realized that our relationship has taken a slight sour tone. I've started looking down on him simply because I got a good job and he's still in school. Part of that I think is because we don't spend time together. I work during the day, he goes to school and works most evenings, so that doesn't leave a lot of time for us to spend together. I think I've become a little bitter/resentful and that's bleeding into my personality.  I'm gonna stop that train of thought right now before it consumes my entire personality.

4) As for what degree Dave got before, he never talked about it, all he told me was that he messed around and choose what he thought was the easiest degree to get at the time. I never pushed him to tell me since he got that degree before we started dating. Going on the same thread, we never really talked about his parents or what his family life is like. Every once in a while, we would go to his parents’ house for dinner but he never invited me to any of his family gatherings on the holidays. I invited him to a couple of my family gatherings and he went sometimes and sometimes he was busy which was okay.

5) I have a big extended family and I love being around them. I have lots of cousins and there's usually a couple of birthdays every month. I don't get them expensive things, maybe a board game (I try to avoid buying them electronics since that can be expensive and make other family members jealous) or some nice chocolate. I enjoy spending money on them. That doesn't mean I don't spend money on him. We celebrated his birthday twice during our relationship, nice restaurant and a gift. I don't want our relationship to be based off finances, we haven't reach that stage yet.

6) We haven't talk in four days. And that made me realize we don't see each other too often because of our schedules. I work during the day and most of his classes are during the afternoon. Some evenings he goes to work so sometimes we don't see each for a couple of days. And that seemed fine until I realize how much of our relationships is based off texts.

7) **WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN FOUR DAYS.** We fought on Thursday and neither of us contacted the other. And that's on both of us. We're both acting like high schoolers, not adults and I think that reflects on how we view our relationship

After reading through the comments and talking to my sister, I realize that I really need to talk to Dave about our relationship. I contacted him this morning, asking to talk to him face to face. He hasn't responded but I'm hoping to talk to him in person rather than on the phone via call or text. I do like him and I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I don't want somebody dictating how I should live my life.

Wish me luck, hopefully we talk tomorrow (Dave doesn't work tomorrow evening). I don't want to end, if it comes to that, this relationship on a bitter note.

**Thanks again for taking the time to help.**

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend doesn’t like me spending MY money on my family, thinks I’m wasting OUR money even though we're only been together less than a year and a half."
"Me and my fiancée [27M / 25F] cut all ties with my rude, abusive younger sister [24F] and my parents are giving us hell for not wanting her at our wedding.


So a little context to why this has happened.

I have two younger sisters [26F &amp; 24F] and the youngest one was always difficult to deal with (let's call her ""Amy""). Me and the middle one always got along great, but Amy always caused problems in the house. Growing up, she was the one who threw the fits, screamed and cried, and for some reason my parents allowed this to carry on to her adult life, maybe because they were tired, maybe because she was the baby, I don't know. But pretty quickly she found out that if she screams loud enough, she will get her way. And that shows as an adult, since she can't get any point across or have a civilized argument about anything without the volume going from 1 to 100 in a second. 

That started to wear me down as I got to 17-18. My parents would do what she wanted just so she could stop her fits, but that never worked with me, so we would be fighting all the damn time, and that really drove me away from her. She would turn into a truly nasty person when angry, saying anything she could to insult you and hurt if you went against her. For example, I was born with a lazy eye (strabismus) that got corrected with surgery when I was 17,but up until that point she would always use that to insult me when we got into a fight, calling me names like ugly, alien, cross-eyed and things like that. 

She would get physical too, as she tried to slap me and punch me several times. Once she threw a mug with burning hot coffee at my face that would've severely fucked me up had I not got out of the way. I've never laid I finger on her not even to defend myself, but that never stopped her. I didn't feel like talking to her or know anything about her life for 10 years now, just to left alone and have her not bother me. We were just two people living in the same house. My parents were always trying to be peace makers but the nasty and manipulative way she would go about when someone got in her way was disgusting to me. She knew if she started enough shit she would get what she wanted and she would take plenty advantage of it. The last time I saw her was 3 years ago when I moved out and we only talk when she picks up the phone when I call my parents house.

My fiancée can't stand her, my friends never liked coming over when she was there, my exes never liked her either. I've grown to truly dislike her as a person, and I wish her the best but I don't want anything to do with her anymore. Now I'm getting married, and we don't want her there at all. My parents are mortified over this, saying that ""she is your sister and family should stick together no matter what"", and ""how can you invite some random co-worker and not your own sister"" but that doesn't cut it for me anymore. I told them that just because we were born from the same people doen't mean that she has a free pass to be shitty to everyone for years and I should just ignore it. 

My mom's been crying ever since, bombarding me with texts and calls over this for weeks now and even saying that ""if her whole family isn't there she doesn't feel like going either"". I don't know what to say anymore. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for reading this :)


tl;dr - my younger sister was an all around horrible person to me growing up, we don't speak anymore and I'm not inviting her to my wedding, and my parents are devastated over this."
"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] of one year has been told she's just the funny one her entire life and made to feel as though she isn't as pretty as her older sister.


This is primarily her aunts' and mother's doing. Pretty much every female relative she has, as well as some female friends from when she was in high school, have very openly praised her sister's looks and told her she's ugly compared to her sister. 

Her sister doesn't say anything when this happens. She doesn't agree or disagree. But silence speaks volumes IMO. 

So I met my gf a couple of years ago at a work related gig. We became friends, and a year later we started dating. While we were friends, I'll admit I had a huge crush on her. Not only was she smart, hilarious and the life of the party. She was (and still is) very beautiful. When she said yes to going out with me, I was the happiest guy in the world. And I've been happy with her everyday since. 

The thing is, I recently met her family, as in her immediate and extended family, and it was a very strange experience for two reasons:

1. She prepped me on all her family members, but the one thing she kept saying about her sister was ""she's really pretty"" as if giving me a heads up? Weird. 

2. One of her aunts joked that they were shocked my gf found a solid boyfriend before her sister did, implying her sister is prettier and should therefore have less trouble finding a guy. Also weird. 

On the way home, I asked my girlfriend about what was said, and she then told me ""Oh, it's normal. She's the pretty one. I'm the funny one."" Worried that it would come off corny and white knight-ish, I held back for a second but I eventually told her, ""You do realize you're funny *and* beautiful, right?"" 

She playfully rolled her eyes at that and we didn't speak of what happened the rest of the night. 

I figured maybe that's the way she and her family rib each other. Every family has their own weird way of expressing love. Mine is a little weird like that, too. 

Then I hung out with her family again and it was the same shit. Except this time one of her aunt's asked me to stand beside her sister for a second, after which she said, ""Wow, *they* look like a couple."" 

What the fuck.

Everyone laughed. Everyone except for me and my gf's dad. He didn't seem amused, and I guess he could tell I wasn't amused either. He pulled me aside later and told me his wife and sisters/sister-in-laws are crazy when it comes to looks. They have a fucked up sense of humour, don't take it personally, etc. 

A few days later I asked my girlfriend if it makes her uncomfortable when her family goes after her looks like that, and she said she's used to it. Basically it does make her uncomfortable but it's been a constant for so long, she doesn't feel she can stand up for herself. 

That's when she opened up to me about her girlfriends in high school all saying the same shit. They would always call her sister pretty but never call *her* pretty and always look at her like, ""What happened to you?""

She eventually accepted that she was just ""the funny one"" and decided to own it. 

That's great and all, but she's more than just funny, and it quite honestly pisses me the fuck off to know she's been made to feel less than for basically her entire life. Fuck that noise.

I really want to say something the next time her aunts talk shit, but she told me to just leave it alone. It also really pisses me off that her sister doesn't stand up for her. What the fuck is that about? 

Oh and my gf later told me an ex of hers once asked why she doesn't look more like her sister during a fight. 

I ended up asking her if she thinks she's pretty and she just shrugged passively. To be honest I'm shocked. She's hot, you guys. Beautiful, hot, pretty, all the words. And she's hilarious. 

This whole situation makes my blood boil. 

Am I overreacting or is this really fucked up? 

TL;DR My girlfriend's female relatives all make her feel as though she's just ""the funny one"" and nowhere near as pretty as her sister. This has been going on her entire life. She doesn't find herself pretty. An ex once used this against her in a fight. The next time her aunt's say something rude, I want to stand up for her but she told me to let it go. Should I? 

Update: She went to her parents' house to wish her mother a happy birthday this afternoon (I couldn't go because I had to work) and she came home with zero energy. I asked her what happened and at first she didn't want to say, but she eventually told me her mother and sister took it upon themselves to tell her to hold on to me tight because I'm already way out of her league. It wasn't said in a playful, joking way like, ""damn, your SO is a keeper!"" It was said to hurt her and it did. I am sure they said more on top of that. She went into the bathroom and cried. The door was locked so I gave her space. When she finally came out she very seriously asked me, ""What do you see in me?"" 

I'm about two seconds away from going off on them. 

I really don't think humour will work on these people. Seeing her so upset, I think it might benefit her to either (1) go no contact for a while or (2) sit back and let me handle it. 

I'm actually in shock that her own family is responsible for making her feel this way. And as a guy, I can safely say she is easily the most interesting, beautiful person in any room on any day. At this point I feel like maybe her female relatives are jealous that she has so many things going for her and doesn't feel the need to obsess over the state of her makeup at all times. "
"Our [14M&amp;16F] sister [22F] keeps getting skinnier and skinnier. She looks like a walking skeleton and no one is listening to us that this is bad.


Hi this is Brit talking and my brother max is with me. Our sister Jade is beyond skinny, like it's actually getting to the point where you can see almost all of her bones properly. She's not normal weight like you or I. Type in anorexic on google and she looks so close to some of the pictures that come up. 

We have spoken to her about this and she's told us to shut up, we're only kids what do we know. She is so tiny. my brother max has more meat on his bones than she does. Our parents and friends think this is OK and tell her she looks beautiful. Brutally honest she did, she did look beautiful but something happened and she dropped a massive ton of weight. She looks so frail 

We both feel like we are losing our minds because we are trying to tell people that this is a problem. Is there anything we can do?

"My [21F] fiance's [23/M] father [48?M] married his mistress after tearing apart the family - Now she wants to be invited to our wedding


My fiance's father cheated on his mother several years ago with this woman, ""Sarah"". They recently got married - like a few weeks ago, recently. She's a stone cold bitch to me. Physically turns her body at dinner tables so she doesn't have to look at me, talks down to me, always exclaims ""Oh I went there!"" any time I mention where I go to college as if I haven't mentioned it a hundred times. They also drink like there's no tomorrow - everything they do involves going to a bar and drinking more than even I would dare to attempt.

She has two young daughters of her own, and my fiance's father and her dote on them all the time. Mind you, my fiance is one of 3 siblings, and his father never thinks to try and include them. My fiance hasn't received a birthday gift in 2 or 3 years (it's not about the gift, but a card would've been nice). 

Any time we talk about wedding plans in front of his father and his wife, they always talk about how much fun they're going to have, how much they can't wait for the open bar, etc. I can already tell it will be all about them, like it always is. And for once in my life, I want something to actually be about me. I want to enjoy this day. I am afraid that I am biased because my abusive father cheated on my mom and then married his mistress too - whose name is also ""Sarah"". Keep in mind that my scorned mother will also be at this wedding - and this woman looks very similar to my father's mistress. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting this woman at our wedding? Or am I just going to have to get over it and invite her and try to steer clear of her? 
  
 TL;DR: My fiance's father and his wife are both cheating scumbags who just want to party and get drunk; I don't want them (or at least her) at our wedding. Am I being unreasonable?"
"Me [32M] with my wife [30F] of 4 years. She's a crappy friend.


Throwaway because my wife knows my main account and I'm trying to tread lightly. Married 4 years, together over 6. No kids.

My wife is a bad friend. Not to me. She's good to me. But she's a terrible friend to her friends. It's coming back to bite her now and I don't know what to say to her.

For context, my wife has had the same friend group for many years. There are about 6 of them total and they all live in our metro area and they make plans often. My wife blows them off constantly. She doesn't want to listen to them vent or complain on the phone. From what I've observed, she doesn't want to 'give' anything for her part in the friendship.

Some examples from the last couple months (there are many, many more going back years, but these are fresh):

We made reservations at a trendy (and hard to get in to) restaurant with one of her friends and the friend's husband. Friends arrange child care for their kids. The afternoon of the reservation, my wife cancels on them because she ""doesn't feel like eating anything on the menu."" This had been planned for weeks. 

Another friend breaks up with her longtime BF and calls my wife for a shoulder to cry on. My wife doesn't answer the call, saying ""I can't listen to Jane and her drama right now."" Calls many more times. Wife texts back that she can't talk right now.

Friends throw a baby shower for one of them. Wife skips it. Says she doesn't feel like going.

Friend hosts memorial dinner for her dead brother (whom my wife had known since high school). Wife doesn't go (I was going to go with her). Says she ""doesn't feel well.""

These are literally all from the past 3 months, and there are other ones I'm not listing. Personally, I don't care. They're her friends. She doesn't do this with my friends, but my group is more spread around the country so visits are rare. If she wants to be a shitty friend, then I'm not going to get in the middle of it.

But now chickens have come home to roost.

My wife recently suffered a great personal loss - her mom died unexpectedly. I've been there for her, but I'm just one person. Her sister is going through the same grief and is not a great source of support right now. She's reached out to her friends, but it seems they've noticed my wife's treatment of them. She texted one, the same one who wanted a shoulder to cry on about her BF, and the friend responded with, ""that sucks"" and nothing more. Wife wanted to get together with another (also from high school) to go through the mom's things and the friend said she couldn't anytime soon because she couldn't get a sitter. 

She's getting blown off in her time of need. I feel terrible for her, but I'm also not surprised. 

Wife is despairing (even more) because her friends aren't being there for her. So adding onto her grief is the idea that she ""has no friends.""

I have no idea what to say. Telling her to take this as a sign to be a better friend in the future seems crass. Agreeing that her friends are shitty will just make the divide even greater and then she will have no friends.

What should I tell her?

"I (29M) am considering leaving my wife (30F) because we haven't had sex in 3 years


Tl;Dr haven't had sex in about 3 years

My wife and I met when I was 19. we dated and got married when I was 24. Our sex life was amazing and we'd have sex a lot. Then around 3 years ago we just stopped having sex. My wife didn't want to do anything anymore other than kiss and cuddle. I tried asking her many times what's wrong and she'd insist it was nothing. I pleaded with her to go to therapy with me and she'd say nothing is wrong. 

She's right, sort of. We don't have financial issues hanging over our heads, we both have good jobs and outside of the lack of sex she's very affectionate and kind. Which is why I feel like a massive piece of crap. I've never cheated and have no plans to cheat but I can't go on in a marriage without having sex anymore, it's frustrating. I'm 29 and my own wife hasn't wanted sex in 3 years. The last time I got a blow job was maybe a little over 2 years ago. 


2 of my best friends are trying for babies with their spouses,  another is single and living it up and I'm just here trying to make do with masturbation every now and then. I'm not unattractive and my wife isn't either, we both exercise quite a bit and are in fairly good shape. 


I really don't know what to do anymore, she'd be devastated to know the thought of divorcing her even crossed my mind but what more can I do? I hate myself because here I am, seeming like a huge dick for thinking of divorcing my wife because I'm not getting laid. 

I really don't see any other options at this point but if anyone could recommend anything that'd be great

"I [26F] went to a friend's wedding with my BF[30M] and he jokingly ran away when I caught the bouquet, I am secretly hurt by this



UPDATE: we've talked, everything's good. He told me he was only joking. He said he wont be proposing anytime soon but we could try convincing our parents to let us live together. Where I am from it is the norm to live with our parents until we get married no matter the age (for those of you who questioned). Thanks for the help and opinions!

Throwaway because BF also reddits

I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 years and I'm pretty sure he knows I'm into the 'getting married' thing, we've talked about it more than once and although he never expressed any interest in getting married to me he also has never expressed any thoughts against it. 

This past week we both went to a friend's wedding and I caught the bouquet, everyone was clapping at me but that quickly turned into laughter when my boyfriend pretended to be running away. I sort of played along and laughed.

Needless to say and as I mentioned in the tittle I am sort of hurt at his actions. We didn't talk about the wedding or his 'joke' ever since the wedding day. 

I wanted to ask him why he did that, but I'm afraid to be reading to into this? I really want to get married, and move out of my parent's home (we both still live with our parents), I'm afraid to make him angry or uncomfortable for being hurt and sad over his joke.

Am I being unfair/irrational over this? Am I sad over nothing?

"My [20F] boyfriend [23M] announced my mental condition to a party full of people against my will, should I leave him?


I have a well controlled mental condition that I am very private about. I take two separate medications twice a day (every 12 hours) and for the most part it does not affect my daily life. Luckily I have a fantastic doctor who worked with me to experiment with medications until I found a combination that worked for me with minimal side effects. I'm just saying this to demonstrate that this is not a significant issue in my life anymore and it is not necessary for many people to know.


I started dating my boyfriend almost a year ago and he has been great, just a little dopey. He is not a subtle person and can't keep a secret to save his life. So even though I told him before we started dating that I have this condition that is well controlled and I don't really like people to know about it, he went ahead and told his parents. I was pissed but told him not to tell anyone else and we got through it. 


Well last weekend we went to a friend his' party and while they all got drunk, I sipped on a soda. Many of his friends were concerned that I wasn't drinking and kept saying stuff like: ""it's ok that you're underage. You can still have a beer. Want me to make you a cocktail?"" I was starting to become uncomfortable with the comments when my boyfriend, in his infinite wisdom, decides to announce: ""Oh she's not drinking because it affects her medication."" Okay..well now I'm pretty pissed but whatever, no one really mentioned it further. 


Well then a little but later my alarm goes off and my boyfriend, who is drunk by now, literally yells to me: ""Hey babe, it's time to take your crazy pills."" He turns to the other people and goes, ""yeah she has (condition) and has to take pills for it.""  I just stared at him. 

I could not believe that he would do this to me. I just met some of these people and now they all know something incredibly personal about me that is nobody's damn business! I hate, I *hate* the way people treat me after they find out. Like I'm unhinged or damaged or something. I don't want anybody's pity. Its fucking well controlled for christs sake! 

I grabbed his keys and went to the car, and he followed me, asking what was wrong. I didn't say anything, just drove us home and I haven't really talked to him since even though he's been apologizing profusely. Is this something I can even forgive him for? Should I? What should I do here? Seriously I'm so upset and angry. He had no right.

"I [24F] took my [50sM] CEO a coffee after hours and am now being told it was inappropriate.



Edit:

Just to clarify:

- CEO's door was not closed, it was open, but I knocked because his back was turned to his computer and I didn't want to barge in there
- CEO's office is on the second floor, I'm on the sixth. No, i don't directly pass by his office when going up but I saw 
the light was still on in the office so I went to give it to him 
- this was the first time I had ever given him something or ""ass kissed"" or whatever. Usually we just say hi and pass by each other 
- my friend is upper management, but in a different department -- he has asked me out on numerous occasions 
- I guess it's weird to people that my CEO is friendly to me? He's just a genuinely nice guy and although I'm sure he doesn't know everybody by name, he's super approachable and has an open door policy (email or drop by anytime to talk about whatever) 
- we didn't even small talk... The conversation went something like, ""Hi, how are you, I was bringing someone else a coffee and had an extra, thought you might want it. Have a nice night"" 
- I understand both sides, my ""innocent and naive"" one and the one from the other side of the desk. Hopefully it doesn't come back to bite me in the ass :) 

Thanks for all the insight everybody! 


----

I work at a company with about 1,000 employees and I'm not anybody important (lower level staff). However, the CEO does know me by name and often makes a point to say hi or hello to me whenever we run into each other. 

Work ends at 5. I had some errands to run nearby work so I was in the area until about 7. My friend texted me complaining that he was still at work, so I stopped by Starbucks to drop some off to him. We also have security staff that work overnight (24HR facility) so I figured it would be nice to bring them some coffee as well. I wasn't sure how many security people were on staff so I bought an extra coffee. On the way up, I noticed our CEO was still in the office, so I knocked, said hello, and we chatted briefly. I told him I had an extra coffee and gave it to him, not thinking much of it. 

I told my friend about the encounter and he's telling me that it was wildly inappropriate of me to do. Was what I did ok???? I'm super paranoid and panicking about it now. 

TL;DR: dropped off a coffee to my boss after hours, now I'm worried that I stepped out of line. "

"I [23,F] lied to my boyfriend [25,M] about something embarrassing and now he's thinking about leaving- nsfw


I've been dating ""John"" for a little over a year. long story short, I've never had an orgasm. Ever. I've had multiple partners, tried all sorts of things, read online looking for something to help, but it just never happened for me. I'm honestly very insecure about it- I've never told anyone before, not even my doctor, because i'm really insecure about it. I feel like if my partner knew, then sex just wouldn't be entertaining since he'd be the only one.. ya know.. so I've faked it since I was 16. about 6 months ago, John had asked me if I had faked one, so i said yes, apologized, and then up-ed my faking game since I wasn't ready to tell him. 

Fast forward to last night, I told him. I really do see a future with this guy, and for once I felt like I could tell someone. So I did, and I explained how I was too embarrassed to tell anyone before, and I was still embarrassed to say it out loud, but that I wanted him to know. 

He's now thinking about leaving me. He says that I lied to him (which is true) and that who knows what else I'm hiding (nothing at all). I tried to explain to him that I was sorry for lying, I never thought in a million years I would ever tell someone, but that I trusted him and saw a future with him. He said he needs to think about all this and re-think what kind of relationship he's in.. I don't know what to do. I understand it was wrong to lie in the first place, but I didn't think it would ever come to this, and it's especially not the way I wanted this talk to go when admitting it to someone for the fist time. Any advice?

TL;DR! I admitted to my bf that I've never had an orgasm, he said that he needs to re-think things since I lied.

*EDIT* My inbox is flooded with some advice and some real crappy comments, so I think I should give a little update. To the ones that think I deserve to get dumped and think I'm terrible- I'm sorry you feel that way. I've admitted in my post that yes, I lied, and it was wrong- I was more so looking for advice on moving forward- not to be shamed.. I think some of you need a little insight to what it's like in my shoes- I've always felt pressured to climax, there are plenty of times that I haven't faked it with past boyfriends, and the reaction has always been the same: They tell me somethings wrong with me, or that I'm doing something wrong, and they always get disappointed when it doesn't happen all the way back to when I was 16 and had sex for the first time. I felt terrible, and that I wasn't good enough or that something really was wrong with me. I'm sure to a lot of you, it doesn't seem like something to be embarrassed about, but I was/am. I'm ashamed of it. It's the only big thing in my life that I am truly embarrassed about- so no, it wasn't easy to say, and had I known this was the guy I wanted to spend my life with, I probably would have thought about saying something sooner, but I never felt comfortable sharing that with anyone. I will absolutely support my boyfriend in whatever he wants to do, the ball is in his court now, but to accuse me of lying of other things when I've never so much as said a white lie to him before this, I think is wrong given the circumstances, and If that's how he feels, then I don't think I'm with the right person either. For the few that sent supporting messages and/or actual advice on how to move forward or make things better- thank you."

We dated for 2 years before getting married.  Normal relationship, save for one thing:  he lived with Mom.  Now, this isn't a case of ""gamer never grows up and lives in mom's basement"", he was her caregiver, she had cancer.  I know this as a fact, I met her many times and in a way, she felt like my family too.  I was in the room with Alex and his family when she passed (she did at home hospice).  

This is relevant because it wasn't the best situation for me to stay over at his place.  She would wake up in pain some night, have delusions and get agitated, he would have to do incontinence care, that sort of thing.  That didn't really bother me at all, I worked in a nursing home for 5 years after college, I am now a nurse myself, I'm used to death and sickness and poop, but it just wasn't the sort of situation that made an overnight houseguest ideal at all.  Alex did stay at my place, during which times his brother ""Bill"" would stay with their mom, and they did have a caregiver come in certain days of the week for a 12 hour shift.  Maybe a red flag is that Bill and his wife ""Cathy"" only lived about a mile away from Mom, but plenty of completely healthy families live close to one another.  They didn't seem overly enmeshed, and Alex and Bill are close despite being very different people.

During this time, Alex had a good job.  He was a sysadmin, and made very good money.  Some days he worked from home, when he couldn't, the caregiver or Bill came.  

Mom eventually passed, Alex and I moved in together, and got married about 6 months later.  This is also important.  Our apartment was always sort of chaotic, but between settling his mom's estate, both our jobs, and planning a smallish wedding, we didn't have tons of time to organize and stuff like we would have liked.  I was confident things would settle down after the wedding. 

Oh. How. Wrong. I. Was.

I have accidentally married a 10 year old.

He has NO household skills.  He doesn't know how to clean a bathroom.  Like *legitimately does not know how*.  Not even ""Well, it's clean, not as clean as I would like it, but still completely good enough.""  He doesn't know what cleaning products to buy or use.  When I buy them he doesn't know how to use them.  Eventually I settled on ""OK, I'll clean the bathroom.  You do the kitchen and vacuum.""  I'm a bit particular about bathrooms anyway, for some reason, the bathroom needs to be EXTRA clean because I just can't with a gross bathroom.  That's my quirk so fine - I'll clean it and I'll clean it up to my standards, he can do everything else that I'm not as picky about.

*He didn't know how to mop a floor*.  He does it now, but I had to show him how I do it - slop it once really wet, let it sit a couple minutes, then wring the mop out as you go to get it more dry and cleaner than just running a dampish mop over it.  It wasn't that he didn't know how *I* wanted it done, he *didn't know how to do it*.  

He can't cook.  I'm not asking for gourmet meals, but he *doesn't know how measuring cups/spoons and kitchen utensils work*.  

He'll do chores if I ask him to do them.  Like vacuuming the floor.  But he will ONLY do it if I ask.  He can't just see dirt, go ""this needs to be vacuumed"" and do it.  And he does such a god awful job, any reasonable person would go over it and do it again anyway.  

Other than bathrooms, I'm really not a clean freak.  I don't care if there's dust around the baseboards.  Do those once a month. Or whenever.  Maybe.  A few crumbs under the toaster?  BFD, just wipe down the cooking surfaces.  

But he needs just EVERYTHING spelled out.  If I don't ask him to do it, then show him how it's done, it doesn't GET done.  

Then there's the job.  His company downsized a year after we were married.  He is currently working for minimum wage at a Halloween supply store.  His skills are so obsolete it would be laughable to anyone in the industry.  I know nothing about computers/tech/networking but from people that do, he should have been updating his skills, taking training/classes for YEARS now and apparently he never did.  And that's rung true.  I've helped him search for jobs, I'll say ""What about this one?  You know SQL, right?""  and he'll say ""Yeah, but they want [other thing] and I don't know that"".  It's like he's fixated on doing ONE THING that's out of date, won't consider doing anything else, or going in a different direction with other skills he has.  I mean SHIT!  As I said I'm a nurse.  I currently work as a nurse.  I've been an RN for 18 years.  But during times when I moved, got laid off, had a temp contract, whatever the reason was, and couldn't get a nursing job immediately, I've done other things.  I've been a phlebotomist.  I've been a medical transcriptionist.  I've been a billing coder.  I was even a sample accessioner for a while.  Yes, I've stayed in the medical field, but I didn't say ""I am a nurse.  I am only a nurse.  Nursing Activities are the only thing I am able to do, therefore I can only work as a nurse.""  NO!  I'm sure he could parlay his skills into SOMETHING else.  Technical writing, maybe.  IDK, just anything other than a job mainly for high schoolers.

We can make it on my salary, that's not the point.  We're lucky to not have many expenses or debt, but *that's not the point*.  The point is he's content to do nothing.

I'm reaching my limit with it.  I even asked Bill, roundabout, if Alex has always been like this.  He said he's always been a little ""unmotivated"" but hell - he did go to school for his computer science degree, and was damn good at what he did.  When he lost a job or one got stagnant, he would always get headhunted for something else in very short order.  Maybe that's it?  Maybe he's so used to having everything handed to him that he can't take initiative? 

But how in HELL does a grown ass man not know how to clean a house to basic standards of hygiene?  This is both of our second marriages, maybe his ex just did it all?  Maybe this is why she's an ex?  He said they just got married too young, which I believed because that was very much my story.  I was in loooooooove at 19, and had no idea what the demands of adult life and a marriage were, nor did my then-husband.  We didn't grow together, we grew apart.  It definitely can happen.

I'm thinking about at least separating.  I feel like I'm living life for 2 people.  I feel like I'm raising a child.  I don't mind helping a partner, supporting them during rough patches, showing anyone anything if they don't know how to do it, but everything all the time?  Especially when I don't get any of that back?  Alex is a good *person*.  He's very considerate, loving, sensitive, funny, intelligent, caring, and honest.  But I just can't take on all the Real Life Responsibilities for both of us anymore.  I've brought this up to him and he's said he'll ""try"" or ""do better"" but there's never really a plan. We tried counseling, but that had pretty much the same result - I had to lead all the ""homework"" and suggestions when we got home.  

On a good day, I feel like he's a good man with some sort of social/cognitive impairment.  On a bad day, I feel taken advantage of, that he just wants the maximum benefit for the minimum amount of effort, or maybe he's playing dumb on purpose.

I never questioned it because I just assumed a man in his 40s caring for another human being was a fucking adult.  Now I have no real idea who cooked his meals or cleaned the house, come to think of it, I never SAW him do it.  Then again, I never questioned if he knew basic cooking and cleaning because I didn't think one would have to. 

I've talked, I've explained, I have on occasion screamed, that I can't take care of MY internal and external life if I'm always dragging him through life for both of us.  Just once, I'd like to come home from a bad day and have a meal ready.  Even burgers on the grill and frozen fries would be fine.  Just once, I'd like to not come home from cleaning up blood, guts, and entrails at work (did I mention I'm a trauma nurse?) to have to come home and show him how to sweep a floor. I would like to spend one weekend not searching for jobs for HIM because he ""doesn't know where to look"".  

I know the alternative is ""don't"".  Cook my own meals and leave him to figure something out.  Don't search for jobs for him.  Don't clean anything other than what is ""my"" portion of the chores.  *But he wouldn't care*.  He'd just say ""I don't know how to do that* and pretend it doesn't exist.  

Is there any help for this?  Are there any disorders he should be evaluated for?  Could this honestly be a psych/behavioral/processing deficiency or is he just a lazy user? 
  
  ---   
 tl;dr Husband has no basic life skills whatsoever.  This was camouflaged by the fact that he was his mother's end of life caregiver.  I cannot continue to drag him behind me through life.  Is he just a lazy user, or could he have a behavioral disorder?  Should we explore that before separating on a trial basis, or should I just leave, at least for a while?"

"My [26f] husband [29m] found his dream home and wants to make an offer immediately. I hate it. We've been married 2 years.


We've been discussing purchasing a home recently. I told my husband ""Drew"" the only thing I care about in a home is an open floor plan because I spend so much time stuck in the kitchen when we have company over or he's in the living room before and after dinner. I want to be where everyone else is, not shouting through a doorway. 



Drew found a house that checks off everything on his wishlist... at the expense of mine. The kitchen is in the *basement*. So not only would I have to haul everything up and down stairs but I won't even get a picture window! The house is our max budget, there's no money to renovate it (the kitchen isn't the only reno we'd want either so it wouldn't even be a priority) so I'd be stuck there for a long while. 


He argues we can eat in the kitchen and he'll help me bring everything up to the dining room for company. I really don't think he appreciates how much time in the kitchen I spend and how goddamn lonely I will feel down there. When I try to explain it to Drew he just says he'll spend more time in the kitchen. I'm sure he will for a few months but we're talking about living here for *years*. 


I want to keep looking and he wants to make a offer immediately. Things have been getting really heated lately. He thinks we're going to miss out on his perfect house because I'm being pessimistic and I'm too fixated on my kitchen. 


Maybe I am but I spend most of my time there when I'm home so it's pretty important to me that it's not in a freaking dungeon. 


tl;dr: I want to keep house hunting even though my husband found his dream home. He thinks I'm being negative and self-centered. Is there a compromise that will make us both happy? "

"I [15F] have really bad period pain but my parents [37F+40M] don’t believe me.


I’m not sure if this is the right place but I wasn’t really sure where else. I have been having periods since I was 13 but over the past year as they got more regular they have become really bad. They only last about about five days but the first three days are extremely painful. I think its worse then normal cramps, the pain is so bad I sometimes throw up, its similar to the pain I felt when I had to have my appendix removed. The first two or three days I can’t really get out of bed and just have to curl  up in a ball for hours. I have had to miss days of school and shifts at work because it. I have tried taking different pain killers but they don’t do very much.

I have told my mum about it but she thinks I’m making it up. She thinks I’m just trying to get days off school and the thing is I have lied about being sick to get days off in the past and its kind of like the boy who cried wolf now. I have also told my dad and he just said I was being a drama queen and need to get over myself. I have asked them to take me to a doctor (we live about an hours drive away and public transport is almost nonexistent) in case something really is wrong but they say that they aren’t going to feed into it.

 The more I bring it up the more mum refuses to talk to me about it and now she has started ignoring me completely. The other day I tried to ask talk to my dad about it and he made some pretty gross jokes in front of the whole family. It has kind of become a household joke now and its really embarrassing. 

Any advice on what to do is very welcome.

**TL;DR** I have really bad period pain and am normally unable to leave my bed for two or three days. I can’t get myself to a doctor because public transport is almost nonexistent here and my parents don’t believe me.

"[22 M] Call me crazy, but I think my housemates [28 M, 28 M] are spying on me.


I chose not to use a throwaway account for this post, because, hell, maybe I *want* my roommates to see it. That is, if my fears are correct and they are actually tapping my phone and computer. 

It was brought to my attention a couple months ago, and then again this week, that my phone, computer, and all my personal and private online activity is possibly being monitored and recorded by my housemates. I need a second opinion to determine if there are any grounds to my suspicions, and if so, what my next step should be. 

I wish I could just cut to the chase and tell you exactly what I've witnessed and all the evidence I have of this occurring, but unless I paint a broad picture, it all just sounds like crazy talk.

I suppose I should start from the beginning. A year ago, I [22, M] moved into a two-bedroom apartment with two friends-of-friends [both 28, M] who are brothers. They shared a bedroom, I was in my own room. We got along great at first, and we still get along well enough face-to-face, for the most part. I pay rent on time and carry my share of the load around the house. I'm friendly and try to be considerate of other people's space. I mean, I'm sure there are *some* things I do that annoy them, the same way some petty things they do annoy me too. But other than that, I can't think of any reason they would have to conspire against me and violate my private life in such a way, other than the fact that they *can,* presumably. 

My roommates are very close brothers, so they spend a huge amount of time in their room, online, playing video games together. One of my roommates fancies himself a popular Twitch streamer, and has a huge expensive gaming rig he built, so I'm sure he knows his way around a PC. He was also good at coding in high school, so I know he's very tech savvy. Due to his heavy internet use from streaming, he offered at the beginning of the apartment lease to pay for the entirety of the internet bill. Okay, that's fair, right? 

It wasn't until about six months ago that I started noticing problems with my Android phone usually involving the Wi-Fi network at home. Connections would cut in and out, I started receiving a mild amount of popups and spam, I would come home from work and have to re-introduce my phone to the network (same router I've owned for years, same network SSID and everything). I didn't think anything sinister was happening, until **I started hearing my roommates talking about what I was doing online.** 

My roommates both have very distinct, booming voices, and the walls of our apartment aren't exactly soundproof. If I recall correctly, the first thing I overheard them talking about was my comment history of this very Reddit account. I couldn't tell if my ears were tricking me, because when you're overhearing dialogue from another room with the doors closed, you never can really be sure. But sure enough, over the next few days, I felt more and more like I was being spectated at home. I kept thinking I could hear my roommates narrating my online activity to each other, or to their Twitch stream, or whoever. I overheard vague descriptions of my Snapchats, who I was messaging, etc. One morning in bed, I started perusing the-- ahem... PG-13 side of Reddit, and I overheard my roommate immediately wake his brother up in a very excited, hushed voice, presumably to show him what gets my rocks off. 

At this point, I was pushed to the point of anger, but it wasn't like I could just confront my roommates about this very loose suspicion. I didn't want to accuse them of something I know very little about. So instead, I opened up a Google Document on my phone, titled it as my roommates' names, and wrote a brief yet direct warning /promise to move out if they continued invading my privacy. And I just left the note pinned open on my phone. That way, if they *were* to ""stumble across"" my little note, they would maybe leave me alone and take me more seriously... aaaand if they didn't see it then maybe I was wrong about them all along, no harm done. 

But after my little warning shot, either they got better at hiding it, or they stopped monitoring me altogether... ^^Or ^^they ^^were ^^never ^^doing ^^it ^^in ^^the ^^first ^^place... Because I stopped overhearing them talking about me, the Wi-Fi and data on my phone was functioning normally, etc. From then on, I stopped seeing the signs of being watched. Maybe it was all in my head after all, right?

Welp, I started seeing those signs again this week. My phone started acting up again when my roommates had one of their techy friends over, and then I was being booted off the internet *while they were streaming*. On top of that, The other night I overheard them talking about my girlfriend. I was standing right outside their goddamn door when I heard him sarcastically say he ""checked out [my girlfriend's] photo work"" among other shitty little comments about her/ our private pictures and content on her phone.  

I could try to forgive and forget about them invading my privacy for so long, maybe I deserve it for being the jackass who signed a lease with these guys. But my girlfriend doesn't even live with us, has every right to her privacy, and her only mistake was asking for the Wi-Fi password, apparently. **We just entered into our last month on the lease of the apartment**, and since we're all moving anyways, my little threat to them about moving out doesn't really pack a punch anymore. I suppose the obvious solution to this is to move out ASAP and get the hell away from my roommates and don't even bother bringing it up, but, in theory, they still hold all my information and passwords and could do a lot of damage. I don't really care so much if they're snooping on what gets me hard, or what I'm ordering on Amazon, or even how much is in my bank account, because let's face it **I have nothing to hide**. And honestly I don't hate them for it. They aren't blatantly malicious or truly bad guys. They're just total assholes with extremely twisted senses of humor. But if they can wittingly do this to me, as well as my girlfriend, who's to say they haven't been spying on our neighbors? What else are they capable of doing?

**That's why I need your help**. I mean, do I sound crazy? Paranoid? Is it possible I have just been hearing what I wanted to hear? Or could I actually be onto something? If there is any solid basis to my story then I think it's only right to confront my roommates. But in terms of tangible proof, I have none. I'm not an inflammatory kind of person who will make accusations willy-nilly with nothing to back it up. Especially when I know it will end up being a two-on-one argument. However, I still owe this last month's cut of rent. And I don't feel like being the jackass to just fork it over when I still feel so wronged by this. I just don't have the ethical or technical ability to move forward without more convincing. Because I don't know if I'm right about this.

~~Lastly, Loggy, if you're reading this, if you wanted a picture of my dick you could have just asked.~~ 

**TL;DR Started having suspicions that my two roommates were tapping into my phone/computer through the Wi-Fi. I overheard them talking about my private life on multiple occasions until I subtly let them know I knew what they were doing. Now it is our last month of living together and they ""allegedly"" started snooping again, on my girlfriend as well. I want to know if there is any grounds to my suspicion, before I make any accusations or pay them for this month's rent.**"
"My [32F] ex-husband [40M] said he doesn't want our daughter [10F] to do her homework when she is with him. Is he in the right?


I split with my ex two years ago. Our kids are with me most of the time, but see their dad one night in the week and every other weekend. 

The kids go to private school and because of this, have more homework than if they were in state school (in the UK). 

This year, my daughter gets six pieces of homework a week. One a night plus a piece for the weekend. 

Now, she's something of a perfectionist, so what should take her half an hour actually takes her an hour. I also take her to a couple of after school activities so sometimes we struggle to fit it all in, but we do. She's very diligent and wants to succeed, but she also struggles in some areas. Because of this, we set up a timetable for her homework so she knows what she's doing and when. She agreed that one piece a night was the way to go, as it meant she wouldn't ever be under pressure to get lots done in one night and it also helps her fee more organised and in control. 

So I texted her dad and told him about this. He pretty much said that he feels she shouldn't do homework when he's with her as it eats into his time with the kids. 

I get that he values the time he spends with her, but also feel that this is part of parenting - I asked whether he'll say the same as the amount of work continues to grow as they get older and he said that he feels it's justified that they do more when they're with me because I see them more. 

I do see them more, but I also take them to extra curricular activities, do their reading with them (he doesn't read with either of them) and also have to get through the homework they should be doing with me anyway. 

If he refuses to do homework on his nights, it puts way more pressure on me and also on my daughter, who will have to spend hours doing multiple pieces on one night. 

Extra info: usually I ask the kids what they've done with their dad on the school night they spend with him and 99% of the time the answer is 'nothing, we just chilled.' So I really can't see the issue. 

I also understand that I might be missing something/might be being unfair, so would like to ask Reddit for impartial advice. 

TL;DR. Ex doesn't want to do homework with our daughter on his nights as it 'eats into his time' with the kids. Feels I should do extra on my nights. Am I being unreasonable? "
