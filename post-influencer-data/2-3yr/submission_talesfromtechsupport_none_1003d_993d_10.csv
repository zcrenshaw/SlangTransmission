"I never use those, i won't pay for it!


It work for a small IT company providing website, email servers and web software.  

**the interlocutors :**  
&gt; $Me : Your dearest  
&gt; $Boss : Boss of client company  
&gt; $Mom : Co-Boss of client company and also $Boss's Mother  

After few year of collaboration with $Client our accountant come to me saying that $Client haven't pay the monthly fee for their website and mail server.  
*Sometime clients forget to set up automatic transfer when they change bank or their accountant went on vacation and forgot to tell someone to do it*  
So i call then to know what append :  

&gt; $Me: Hi, it's $Me from $IT we havent received your transfer from last month. Is there a problem ?  
&gt; $Mom: I don't know what are those fee. I won't pay for it.  
&gt; $Me: These fees are for your website and your mail server.  
&gt; $Mom: We don't use it. I don't want it. I won't pay for it *Click*  

*Okay! You do not have to be this rude.*  
So we send a registered letter with recorded delivery saying that if they do not pay until the end of next month we will have to shut down all their service.  

After a month and a little bit, still no transfer, we shut off everything.  
Sure thing 30 minutes later we receive a call from $Boss.  

&gt; $Boss: My emails stopped working you have to fix this please.  
&gt; $Me: Yes we shut of your server because you haven't paid your monthly fees for the last two months.  
&gt; $Boss: What ? But $Mom is in charge off all the suppliers, she should have paid you.  
&gt; $Me: No, she told us that you did not need our services and did not want to pay for it.  
&gt; $Boss: She is crazy! We take care of all our invoices and contracts by emails. Without them we may as well close the company. I will take care of paying you personally from now on. But please start the server back on.  

So we did and 20 min later one of his employee was at our door with a check for last two month and the upcoming one. And from this point he always paid us in time.

"""Ma'am. I can't fix a bullet hole.""


I was out Christmas shopping when I got a call from the mother of friend(We will call her FM).

&gt;FM: Hello, Zentharian?

&gt;Z: Hello FM, How have you been?

&gt;FM: Not well. I can't get my internet working, and I need to do my holiday shopping. Can you help?

&gt;Z: Sure, I'll be there in an hour.

So she lives in the middle of nowhere south Oklahoma.(keep this in mind for later.)

&gt;Z: So! What appears to be the problem?

&gt;FM: Well I woke up this morning and the internet has won't load.

I look at her computer, and everything is fine. Now when I move to her router is when the problem becomes BLATANTLY obvious.

&gt;Z: Well here is the problem, unfortunately I can't fix it.

Her router was full of bullet holes, about 4 of them.

&gt;FM: Oh that must have happened when I found that snake on it yesterday. I told my neighbor about it, and he took care of it.

Snake don't like the cold, and it has gotten cold here recently, her router was warm, and it was in such a location where a snake could hide. So her neighbor shot the snake, and the router was also shot in the process.

So I give her an Netgear I keep in my work bag, this fixes the problem, and I now have bit of extra money for Holiday shopping."
