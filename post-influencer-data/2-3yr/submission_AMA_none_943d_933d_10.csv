"My husband is having an affair. I'm about to confront him. AMA


Update: spent the night talking then crashed. I asked him who x was pretty much as soon as he got in. He looked physically winded. Kept asking how I knew. He admitted he was seeing her but said it hadn't gotten sexual. I'm not sure that's honest as she said in one message she missed his arms. I dunno.
Long story short. He wants this relationship. He was very remorseful and apologetic. He finished with x by text last night. When I asked him why he began this with this woman, he simply said he doesn't know? 
We didn't fight and there were no raised voices. I'm confused and don't know what to believe or do.

Thank you for all the advice and support.



****UPDATE ll; let me begin by saying thank you for all the advice and support. 

I've had a few days to think, had a meeting with a shrink to talk and spoken a lot with my husband. I've made a lose decision on how to move forward. I don't know if I can repair the relationship or my feelings of trust, I don't know if I'm ready to leave or stay. Everything is very early days. 
I was madly in love with him the day I found out and the experience is a little like running full throttle into a brick wall. These emotions don't just disappear. 
So as I don't know which way to turn I have decided to stay for now. Stay in the home and bed with him and keep seeing my therapist. 
I am committing to trying but not to an outcome. He knows this and wants to work with me to save the marriage. 
If I can gain trust without resentment we have a chance, if not we will work at separating. 
For now I am also protecting myself financially. We will walk away with what we both brought into it and I have no intention of seeking revenge there, in case anyone thinks that's on either of our agendas. However, I am saving for the worst just in case.  
I know this won't sit well with some people but I need to try this for myself and see where it gets us, maybe a better marriage ahead, maybe divorce......but I have some time to find out. I don't need to rush to a finish line in haste.
I was sent some incredible advice by pm and I shall be forever grateful for the time people have taken to share their stories. 

Thank you. You are amazing!!!"
"I promise I will answer absolutely anything, what's the most awkward question you can come up with? AMA


this has been going for near 18 hours or so now so I feel I should update a few things 

1. All answers are genuine apart from the questions where It calls for a sarcastic answer but none are lies to deceive. 

2. I still have plenty more to say.

3. I refresh Reddit constantly when I can due to the popularity this post has gained, all questions will get responses if I miss a question inbox me so I catch it.

Still going, had some really interesting questions but I think you've all run out now ;)"
"I just watched my fiancée give birth less than 48 hours ago. Our child is now in the NICU. Trying to keep distracted. AMA!


Fiancée is also willing to answer questions as asked. Will submit proof if required, though not posting initially due to privacy concerns. 


Edit: Thank you all for your kind words and encouragement! You've all helped keep our minds busy while we wait to see her again soon. I'll continue to answer questions as long as you ask them and I have the time. Save for one unsavory comment, you've all been wonderful.

"I was adopted, and my bio mother dated my adopting father. I was surprised in 5th grade when confronted by my real sister that I did not know I had. AMA


I guess it all started in 5th grade.  I was playing basketball during recess, when a group of girls walked to the court beckoning for me.  I walked over and the girls parted ways and in the back was a new girl I hadn't met before.

She said ""Are you {firstname} {lastname}?""  

""Ya?  Who are you?""

""I'm your sister.""

""I don't have a sister...""

""My name is Megan Ann... *ring a bell*??""

Oh but it did.  When I was a toddler I had a picture book that i was a character in.  I was an astronaut, and i had a partner that was exploring the universe with me.  Megan Ann.

""Holy crap, what?""

I went home and told my mom that I had met my sister at school.  

She flipped out and called my teacher to explain the situation.  The school gave me As for the rest of the year, and I got to stay home.  Luckily for me, I had just gotten a nintendo 64 (which was totally hot shit) and got to play video games every day for the rest of the year.

My bio-mom had moved to our town without telling my parents, and put her daughter (a year younger than I) in to my school and told her to find me.

A year later, the parents who adopted me divorced.  

A year after that, my bio-mom had convinced my father to move in.  For a couple years, my bio-mom and my new sister were living with me at my house.  It was completely bizarre, and my sister and I talked about it frequently (both becoming rebellious teenagers around that time).

By highschool, she had moved out, borrowed a bunch of money from my dad, and disappeared for a few years.  He had to hire a private investigator to track her down for repayment.

During that time she used to send me emails asking if I wanted to move out of my parents house and move in with her.  She had all kinds of business ideas we could do together and even said she made a bedroom for me.

I of course declined and went to college, and have been self sufficient since.  I'm always a little weary of her, because looking back now that was some crazy behavior.

"I'm a guy who went half around the globe to meet a girl I accidentally met on Reddit. AMA


Was sure I want to visit her few days after we met. Went there few months later cause needed some savings and all that visa bs. Spent 6 months in her country. ~ 1 month in another country to get her visa to my country. Few months of bureaucratic hell, 2 trips from Ukraine to Malysia, lots of spendings and other dramatic stuff later we got married in my country and are now living together. The whole story is like some novel but it totally happened :P"
