"TIFU by volunteering for a fundraiser half marathon without knowing the run route.



Last Saturday I volunteered to be a worker for a half marathon race fundraiser. After I checked in I was driven to the last water point, at a T intersection about 2 km from the finish, so I was told. But I was told nothing else and I asked no further questions. 

Within 15 minutes a pack of very fast runners begin to approach. Their leader yelled to me ""Which way?""
Well, I had no fucking idea. I could either guess left or right. But, the road they were to turn on was a one-way road. So I directed them in the direction of the one-way, towards downtown. I had a 50-50 chance of directing them in the correct direction. I guessed wrong.

For the next 30 minutes or so I directed runners in the wrong direction until one of the race organizers drove by and caught me in the middle of directing another group downtown. We spent the next hour sending vans downtown finding runners and bringing them back like lost kids at a park. 


TL;DR I directed the first 40-60 half-marathoners in a race in the wrong direction (when they were 2km from the finish) causing them to run around aimlessly.

"TIFU by talking about my graduate research in public


I'm a PhD student in Chemical engineering and doing research on gas hydrates. I do research using high pressure reactors. This morning I was taking the bus to work and mentioned on the phone to someone how we collect our high pressure samples using [sample cylinders](http://store.clarksonlab.com/images/products/detail/K27851.jpg)... Except... we commonly use the term ""sample bomb""... And I said that on the phone... 

I got a few eyes on me but nothing too alarming until i got off the bus about 15 minutes later and 2 police officers were waiting for me. They asked me a bunch of questions and I tried to explain how a sample bomb isn't actually a bomb... They even made a few calls to corroborate what I was telling them before letting me go...

TL;DR Almost got arrested for using the research related term ""sample bomb"" in public."
"TIFU by not learning from my daughters mistakes.


This happened to me last week, I was at work bored out of my mind. Playing with a pencil when all of a sudden I got the bright idea to put it in my ear. After a short few seconds of in-ear pencil stimulation I came to the realisation that something was wrong. I wasn't getting the same feeling from my twisty turny motion as I was at the beginning. After a brief second of doubt, fear and confusion I yanked it out. SHIT. SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK. The rubber on the pencil had vanished. Okay calm down. I'm and adult I can resolve this. Or not. There was no way my stubby finger was gonna be of any use. I looked around after trying the sideways head jump to find some double-sided tape. I'm starting to panic. I stuck some tape on a thin screw driver and into my ear it went. Instant regret. What. The. Fuck was I thinking I mean really A SCREWDRIVER?! I knew I had to go to the hospital. I mustered up the strength to go to my boss. ""I have to go the hospital there's a rubber stuck in my ear."" I didn't even make eye contact with he before hearing her burst into laughter. I left. Waited two hours at the hospital because this was definitely not urgent. I mean a rubber lodged in your ear? Standard. Came back to work the same day. Everyone knows. As if being the IT guy isn't bad enough, now I'm the IT guy who got a rubber stuck in my ear. Great. 

TL;DR I lost a pencil eraser in my ear.

EDIT - First of all, holy shit. Second of all, my daughter. Appologies for not mentioning. Was not intended to be the story, more so the fact that young children commonly do this sort of thing. When she was 4 she managed to get a craft thermocol ball stuck in her ear. I tried some unspeakable methods of removal on the way to the hospital. One of them being a straw and my lungs. Ultimately I took her to the same emergency unit that I went to and they removed it. They did not make a report for her. Apparently my age and relation made it worth documenting. Anyway, thank you to everyone who came here, I'll try my best to read and reply! Adiós."
"TIFU by coming home early


So, me and my GF share a room, and we have two cats. I get off work a bit early, and as I walk in the house, I hear some commotion and my GF yelling something that sounds like ""No!"".

Slightly concerned, as no other cars or anything were around, I run back there just as she is tossing the cat out the door for chewing on my cords. This happens just as I was rounding the frame, so the cat lands squarely on my junk, and tries to use my belly button as a grappling point. It didn't work, but I did get some nice rips in my shirt along with some deep scratches that bled quite profusely. "
"TIFU by accidentally sending one of my soldiers to assassinate a friends dog.


I am the commanding officer for a small band of soldiers, who undertake various missions as assigned. My group of soldiers however, are 2-3cm tall, green, and totally inanimate.  
     
As I actually work in IT, my job can be a little dull occasionally, when going somewhere to repair something, I usually bring one of my soldiers with me, to assist with my mission, enter their base of operations, establish a command point and work surveillance.    
  
Once I have done my job in hand, I will sneakily leave one of my little army men there, usually precariously hidden slightly out of sight. So far over 30 people have been left with the protection of one of my trusty brigade.    

Today I was alerted to the fact that one of my troops has went AWOL and potentially endangered one of my friends dogs. I received a text asking ""If I had left a little green army man"" toy at his house?""  
   
I surrendered immediately as I would not want one of my soldiers to be harmed in their mission, and I admitted ""I had left a little soldier there, yes"" and playfully added “What are your terms to ensure the safe release of my soldier?”  
  
5 minutes later I received another text saying that my friend had spent over 25 minutes this morning trying to remove it from his dogs throat because he had found my soldier and decided it would be a fantastic chew toy. Since Yorkshire Terriers are small dogs, he was horrified that I had potentially choked and killed his dog...   
  
Mission failed I guess. My troop have raised the flag for their fallen comrade.

TLDR: Leaving toy soldiers at friends houses and offices could potentially kill a dog.

"Tifu by using a hair product from a foreign country without understanding what the hair product did




So this happened several years ago but I still think of it. I was a junior in high school, having had 3 very sketchy years of German for my foreign language. I had the opportunity to do a home stay with a German family for a month during the summer. I packed the typical travel toiletries in small amounts...hair gel, hair spray etc. the family I stayed with had 2 girls my age and I attended school with them. After a few weeks my 'travel' toiletries ran out and I was unsure what to do. I was
Preparing for school one morning and decided I would 'borrow' the hair products that my host family used. I looked in their bathroom cabinet and found a hair mousse canister. I nervously and quickly read the label. 'Fur das Haar'  (for the hair). Yes! Hair mousse! More words after that...but those are unnecessary.. It just explains the details of the product.  I need this mousse! So I surreptitiously dispensed the 'mousse' into my palm and distributed into my wet hair. This German mousse smells like crap! But you know....I'm in Germany...they have cruddy hair products here. So...A bit more here and there. Blow dry...some eyeliner and I'm ready for German school!  

The dad of the family drove use to school in his Mercedes. There was traffic....it was warm...the car starts smelling of this German 'mousse' I put in my hair. The dad very casually cracks the Windows of the car....I start getting slightly nervous. 'Was that really mousse? Why does it smell so chemically?!?' After what seemed like FOREVER we get to school and I dash out of the car. I'm starting to doubt my decision to borrow their hair mousse. 

In class the air flow is better and no one seems to notice my chemical stench. But I do... It's become an alarm bell in my head. THIS IS NOT RIGHT!  I casually run my hand through my long auburn hair and to my horror, the hair comes out in my hand. Shocked, I run my hand again through my hair again. More horrible globs of hair in between my fingers! Horrified, I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. I stuck my head under the faucet to get the mousse our of my hair. My hair came out in the sink with the mousse. I had put hair remover in my hair!!!!  Who has ever heard of hair remover in mousse form?!?!!! I ran to the office and my host mother picked me up from the school. She took me to a salon where she whispered to the stylist in German so fast I couldn't understand. The stylist cut my hair (what was left of it) into a pixie cut and I was sent home in shame. The next day the entire school knew of the American girl who had put hair remover in her hair. I had to return from my trip and start my senior year. with almost no hair on my head. 

TIFU/ by not asking for help and using products that I couldn't read and that didn't belong to me. Fur das Haar  can mean many things. Don't just assume German mousse smells like death. "
"TIFU by smoking too much weed and scaring my girlfriend


So this happened last night.

Last night I wanted to relax in my favorite way, so I go out to smoke and do my thing. I came back inside and realized I smoked a little more than usual and my girlfriend kept staring at me, I was trying to be chill but I twitch when I get really high. 

After a little Battlefield 4 I decided it was Netflix time so I put on Louie (which is one of my favorite shows to watch when I am stoned). The next thing I know, i'm asleep. Then all of a sudden I hear a lady screaming in pain, screaming for help.

The woman I rent from (let's call her M) needs a new kidney and is on dialysis at home, so my first thought is that M is screaming for help cuz something happened. I flip over and start saying to my girlfriend who is watching videos on her ipad with earbuds in ""M! She's screaming for help! What do we do!?"". My girlfriend starts to freak out at this point.

We both look at eachother worried, and then she gets a confused look on her face. She then starts telling me i'm an idiot, and I am confused because I'm thinking M needs to go to the ER and we need to do something. My girlfriend then tells me to look at the TV.

I left the the TV on and a lady was screaming for help on the show. My girlfriend will never let me live this down, and now she disapproves of my marijuana use even more."
"TIFU by injuring myself through masturbation, going to the ER, then re-injuring myself hours later (NSFW)


**So a little note: I didn't think this was gonna get nearly as much attention as it did, and I can't really keep up with the replies. So I stuck the answers to the biggest questions at the bottom, I hope that satisfies everyone! Probably won't be in this thread any longer cause I mildly regret making it, but I'll leave it here for your enjoyment...**

Preface: I apologize in advance for adding to the steaming pile of masturbation related posts on this sub. Also obligatory ""this is my throwaway account""

So I'm a teen, it's no secret that we're pretty big fans of jerkin' the gherkin. Some would call it a hobbie. But my love for the singlehanded hanky panky has never seriously wounded me before. Well, until some days ago. 

I had the day off, and I thought I'd celebrate the only way I know how. So I waited until after dinner when the family would be most preoccupied, and locked myself in my room to discretely finish the job. I was going at it a bit rougher than usual, but the feeling was overshadowing the growing pain I felt down there. Disregarding my body's desperate cry for help, I chugged along. 

Suddenly there was a knock on the door, and someone wondering why my door was locked at 6pm. I hastily pulled everything together but noticed something was wrong with my penis. I backburnered that thought and answered the door, muttering something about how I was changing (pretty sure this never works but I like to believe it does). I carried on a conversation with my parents as the pain in my nether regions grows more obvious. 

They finally left me alone, and as soon as I closed the door I practically ripped off my shorts to examine my now excruciating member. First thing I saw was blood. Lots of blood. Gushing out from the head and the foreskin. After the initial rush of terror, I rushed to the bathroom and wiped everything off to get a better look. What I saw was 4 small gashes, 2 on the frenulum and 2 on the head. 

Now lemme stop right here to let you imagine the pain of an open wound on the incredibly sensitive head of your dick. Now with that in your mind, I'll continue.

I panicked a bit but tried to get it together and just let it heal itself. So in an effort to avoid having to bring attention to my condition, I just sat in my room and browsed reddit silently praying my dick would just get better. Sadly, it was not. In fact, it was getting worse by the minute.

So when the pain was finally impossible to ignore I sheepishly told my mom I had ""bleeding in a place I really don't want bleeding"", she got the gist and drove me to the ER. The ride and ER trip were probably the most mortified I've ever been.

So fast forwarding to after the ER, I've been told it'll heal if I'm careful, and I wouldn't need stitches (sigh of relief). 

So here's where being a stupid teenager comes into play. I get home from the ER at night, and after about an hour of being stoic and telling myself ""no jacking off, it needs to heal"", I caved and decided there's no way some careful and gentle jerkin' could upset it all over again. Well, I wasn't technically wrong. The problem was, after getting properly into it, all rules of gentleness went out the window. 

There was no pain so I figured it was totally fine, I was practically laughing at the doctors who said I'd need entire DAYS of care for it to heal well. I finished the deed, and upon cleaning up I noticed a searing pain. As you probably suspected, the jostling of fresh wounds reopened them, but this time the tears were bigger and more alarmingly nasty looking. 

Not wanting to admit I immediately fucked up the doctor's orders, I simply wrapped cold gauze around my dick and went to bed biting my lip from the constant pain. 

Now almost a week later, I was properly scared into treating my nether area nicely, and it did actually start healing. But, the injury to the area was so intense that my doctor says it won't be fully healed for months. So for my intense hormonal urges I get months of discomfort and a mostly out of order dick in return. And that's the story of how I temporarily destroyed my genitals, hope you enjoyed! Cause I sure didn't. 

TL;DR: Choked the chicken until it coughed up blood, immediately forgot doctor's instructions and opened fresh wounds which destroyed my chance of healing anytime soon. 

Edit: Since I'm probably gonna abandon this account, here's answers to the two biggest questions people are asking:

For why I went at it immediately, there was no bleeding or pain before or during it. If there was pain on the second go I would have stopped immediately! But the ""results"" we're delayed. I was trying to be careful but the lack of pain or problems gave me a false sense that everything was fine. It's also worth mentioning that the ER Doctor didn't give me specific instructions and told me that risk of hurting it further was low. My post makes it sound like I got home and just jacked it raw through tears of pain but it wasn't quite like that.

As for how I even managed the injury (people are rightfully very confused by that), It mostly came from tugging a little too hard. Those with foreskins understand that accidental over-pulling can hurt a lot. I discovered that enough of that can cause tears. So basically I got too into it and tore things.

The cuts on the head were most likely just from friction. Usually friction isn't a problem with a foreskin but my aforementioned over-pulling exposed parts that don't usually get any attention (read: aren't used to direct contact), which combined with my rough hands (I work with my hands and at times my palms are like sandpaper) was just a recipe for injury.

And to the people saying this is fake: I don't blame you for being skeptical, but I *really* wish I was lying about this

Hope that answers enough."
"TIFU by scalding my genitals (possible NSFW)


So this literally happened within the last half hour. 

Back story: my wife is just over 40 weeks pregnant and this morning we came to the hospital for an induction. She was having really bad contractions, so the midwife kindly offered her a nice hot bath to relax her and help my son come into this world.

Anyway, onto the fuck up. So I go to the bathroom with my lovely wife as she is not allowed to be left on her own. She strips off and gets into the bath when I realise that I need to piss, like, right now. No biggie, I'll just go to the loo in the bathroom, it's nothing my wife hasn't seen before. Wrong! No toilet in this room, just a bath and sink. 

So I do what any other man would do in that situation. I look to the sink and then to my wife. She knows what I'm thinking and just shakes her head and tells me a firm ""No!"". I give her the sweet puppy dog eyes that got her to agree to mate with me in the first place and she caves within seconds. Anyway, I'm no animal so I decide to run some water whilst I'm doing the deed to wash it all down. 

After I finish, I still have my meat and two veg out whilst I turn off the tap. This is the part where I learn three very important things:

1. I had actually been using hot water
2. These taps turn off the opposite way to what I am expecting
3. [This sign](https://imgur.com/3pJC2FY) is extremely accurate

I had turned the taps on full blast of near boiling water inches away from my favourite body part. I took a fair amount of splash damage and while I was dancing around this small room with my pecker flailing around thinking what a numpty I've been, my wife was just laughing her ass off at me.

Aaannnd now her waters have broken, so I might be delayed responding to any comments.

Edit: [my little boy](http://imgur.com/l71316f) arrived around 3hrs after my post! Thanks for all your kind messages, now time to dad! "

"TIFU By eating a sparkler


So this wasn't today, but on Tuesday evening while drinking in a bar I work at.

I'd had many drinks over the course of the previous 5 hours and in pretty good spirits. This changed very quickly when sparklers that are used in fishbowls/cocktails were revealed. I instantly saw it as a good idea to light one, and put it out in my mouth, like you would with a match. No idea why I would think this would be a good idea, and no idea why I thought I wouldn't be badly hurt.

My girlfriend pulls out her phone, begins videoing and lights the sparkler. Luckily at this point for some reason I didn't go directly in to my mouth and on to my tongue, I actually caught my lip and part of the sparkler broke off in to my mouth and seemed to get stuck to the inside of my lip. I panicked and tried to grab it out of my mouth as nothing else felt it was working quickly enough. Eventually most of it came out but some remained which fizzled out.

I carried on with my beer and had a couple more and went home.

The next day was pretty painful, I was sort of ok eating but my face was really numb on the right side and my lip was extremely swollen. 

The video got posted on facebook, it was shared a few times and I got a lot of comments telling me how stupid I am (obviously). I was looking forward to it blowing over and people forgetting it had happened. Which it did, until yesterday a colleague decided to upload the picture to Imgur then one of my colleagues shared it on reddit. Other people then posted it in other subreddits and one of them gained quite a lot of traction, to the point where I was on front page of Imgur and it had been viewed over 1.25 million times. 

There's constant jokes at work about it, I've had many people contacting me, I've replied to a few questions on both Reddit and Imgur and it doesn't seem to be going away!

As of right now, the swelling has gone, I have 2nd degree burns which are reasonably painful but I can eat fine and I have hopefully learned a lesson.

tl;dr Ate lit sparkler, was not a smart idea.

More than happy to answer any questions here.
