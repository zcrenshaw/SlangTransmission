"I cheated and I feel like crap. Not sure how to tell my girlfriend.


Background story: I've been dating my current girlfriend for almost a year. In fact, we are celebrating our anniversary next month. She's a wonderful person who has been nothing but fully supportive of whatever I do. I've started a low carb diet and lost around 40 pounds in 6 months. While everyone was criticizing it (oh you need carbs, this is unhealthy, blah blah blah), she was there for me through and through. In fact, she got on the same diet and lost 5 pounds just so we both have the same routine and plan. Throughout my weight loss journey, she'd always compliment me and make me feel better about myself (I kind of had some self-esteem issues). I've reached my weight goal a few weeks ago and I'm over the moon. I've been hitting the gym to gain muscle, joined and completed marathons, but the most surprising out of all was the attention I've been getting from women. Something that never happened before. 

So last night, I was out with a few friends without the gf. She claimed to have a headache, but I'm pretty sure she's planning our anniversary (she loves planning stuff). I get to the bar, and there were a bunch of people that I haven't seen since highschool 10 years ago. One of which was a cute girl I remember from back then. I was chatting with her throughout the whole night. She was so amused by my weight loss and she told me how she wants to become a nutritionist and help people out. We had so much in common that made me lose track of how much I drank. Since I'm on low carb, alcohol gets me drunk so much faster. Everyone gets drunk also and decides to head back to the girls place. I, on the other hand, was completely wasted so I can't remember most of what happened. I woke up in the morning with one hell of a hangover, and my friend filled me up with all the events from last night. I was mortified. Apparently, they all got pizza and I ate a whole meat cravers pan crust with extra cheese pizza all by myself. I can already see the disappointment in my gfs face.

"I just finished reading yesterday's post, and now I'm very curious: men, what do women think you DON'T care about but you actually DO?


It just seems that a lot of stuff we think you care about you don't, so what are some things that we generally don't think you are concerned with that you actually are?

"Those of you who primarily go to chain restaurants when you go out, why don't you hit up your local places?


I'm listening to my co-workers talk about their weekend plans and several of them are planning on going out with their SOs, families, etc and they're excitedly talking about hitting up Red Robin, Outback Steakhouse; those kinds of places.  Nothing inherently wrong with them but there are A TON of awesome restaurants in my city for young people. families, etc and I don't know why they're passing up on them.

Note: For those of you wondering, ""well why don't you tell you co-workers about these place?"", it's a dreary Friday morning and I more or less just want to keep my head down and avoid talking to my co-workers today."

I'm 23, 6 feet, 60kg guy, just trying to get my life back from depression &amp; unemployment. I just got a job. I want to exercise but can't even do 1 push up. How do I start?

Edit: Thank you so much guys for the support. It's morning here right now, I was so shocked when I woke up to see so many replies. Btw, I'm in Malaysia and gym is pretty cheap here, 30usd per month, so I might be considering it once I build a little strength at home to do 1 push up."

"When do you tell your friend that his girlfriend js a gold-digger?


Long story short, one of my friends has been in a relationship for about 2 months. Personality-wise, she's basically a blow-up doll who wears too much makeup, acts like a child for attention, and yells everything she says. She's universally hated by our friend group.

Anyway, the friend is going to make a fuckton of money right out of college and, per inside sources (his ex who works with her), she's been bragging to her coworkers about how he's inadequate, but she's sticking around because of the money. She's also told her coworkers about how he's too small for her. 

Now, at what point do I tell him that she is using him unapoligetically? It feels shitty to keep it to myself but I also don't want to interfere in his relationship.

Edit: looks like I fucked up. I guess I have some thinking to do."

"Why do people go to strip clubs/strippers for bachelor parties?


So i'm a 19 year old dude and i'm not married and i've never been to a bachelor party so I never really knew anything about them until now.

Anyways I was just looking at a thread on askreddit about titled ""Those who went too far during their bachelor/bachelorette party, what happened and do you regret it now that your married?"" (I can't link the post because of this subreddit's rules)

Man this thread left me dumbfounded. I though this shit was just a TV/film trope. Celebrating with strippers/going to a strip club just sounds so trashy and pointless when you could be doing so many more fun things. I don't want to spend hours next to 10 other horned up and drunk dudes while getting cockteased, i'd rather do something that's actually engaging, fun and memorable for positive reasons.

I then searched ""bachelor party"" on google and now i'm seeing that they are considered a celebration for your ""last night of freedom"" and ""a last night of being single"" that strippers are very common during these. WTF freedom are you losing other than not being able to fuck, kiss and flirt with other women? I mean shit if your in a monogamous relationship which I would imagine 90% of people are in, you should have lost that freedom the moment you and your SO became an official couple, not just before you get married. And what the fuck do you need one more night of being single while wanting to get married? How are you supposed to know this won't lead to you or your partner wanting another night of being single later on during your marriage? If you want to be single, just be single.

Like why is it ""ok"" to do this promiscuous shit this one day even though you're still clearly in a relationship that day but if you do it in your relationship before or after this day it's cheating and wrong? It should be considered cheating and wrong any day of your entire relationship, married or not!

Also it seems like in some of these responses that some people were ok with their partners going as far as in getting the stripper to make them cum, like fucking what cunt? And then I see some people saying a blowjob from the stripper is ""too far"", and i'm just sitting here like hell no, that's way more than too far, that's straight up Chris Kyleing that bitch, ""too far"" is allowing another person to act with a sexually provocative behaviour towards you without telling them to fuck off when you know you're in a mono relationship.

This new knowledge is just crazy to me, shouldn't a bachelor(ette) party be about celebrating with your friends that you're getting married, not because it's ""your last day of being single"" even though you probably spent years already in a relationship with this person? That's what I have always imagined it to be.

I'm sorry if this seemed too much like a rant but god damn, I never knew bachelor(ette) parties were like this, this shit just sounds trashy as fuck to me.

P.S. I'm no prude, I love sex as much as the next guy but sheesh, if you want to have fun being single then do that before you enter a relationship."
