"I work at a Men's Bathhouse. AMA.


I've been working at a popular gay bathhouse in my city for a couple of years. I've met tons of people, seen and experienced things I never thought I would in my professional life, and all around have had a great fucking time. 

I'm still getting used to telling dates and strangers where I work but I still love talking about it. 

For privacy reasons, I won't discuss anything that can potentially be used to identify either me or my employer. I like my job; I'd like to keep it.

*********EDIT: DONE!*********

**Thanks for the question guys, you helped a lazy Saturday pass by really quickly! I hope I demystified bathhouses for some of you! Please, please, please practice safe sex when you're in these types of establishments, tip your cashiers, and cut our custodians a break by not leaving towels just laying around!**

**Have fun out there!**"
"I'm living with Adonis in my college dorm


It gets really awkward when he gets out of the shower because I try not to stare. But once he talked me while still in a towel and my eyes were on his v-lines and lower abs...

He's a straight guy, but he knows somethings up. Once he asked what crazy shit I did and he alluded to me sucking dick as a joke. Little does he know, I often suck dick!!

Eye contact is a bitch because he looks you in the eyes, but his eyes are blue and green colors so I can't look for long without becoming physically uncomfortable. So I do the thing where you look for a few seconds then shift position/eye contact so I don't look like an autistic person

But guess what? I don't sniff his dirty underwear(even tho I could) and I'm not a creep so no, I don't have a crush on him.

That's it, I don't have a crush on my sexy straight roommate

"Hearing from an ex's daughter


About 18 years ago, I had an affair with a beautiful, bright, sweet guy. At first, I just chalked up some of the odd things he said to his being a quirky bohemian artist, but as it progressed, it became clear that he was in the early stages of schizophrenia. His decline was one of the more tragic things I've ever personally witnessed. The disease stripped away his personality; it was like he was slowly disappearing. Friends of mine and I tried to look out for him as it got worse (the affair was long over at this point), but he couldn't hold a job or take care of himself anymore. The last I knew, his parents, who lived in another state, had had him hospitalized. No one I know knew anything of him after that. I knew he had briefly been married to a woman and had had a daughter before I met him, and he told me her name. It was an unusual name, so I never forgot it. 

About two years ago, I ran across a photo of him and started wondering what had become of him. Finding no trace of him, I searched Facebook for his daughter's name. Because it wasnâ€™t a common name, I was able to find her, and when I saw her picture, I knew she had to be his daughter. She has his eyes.  

I sent her a message, but never heard back and figured I never would. Then, yesterday, she contacted me out of the blue. She had found the message. It turns out that she never really knew her father, and she was very curious to know what he had been like from someone who'd known him as a friend. So I told her all I could about him, leaving out some details. I decided not to tell her that he and I had been involved, figuring she didn't need to know that. I said enough that she could probably suspect, but I'll only tell her if she asks directly. I offered to send her a couple of photos of him, and she was excited to see them. She said that she'd made peace with his absence from her life, but it helped her to know what he had been like. I told her that he'd written and drawn in journals and that she should ask if her family still has them. 

I didn't tell her that the first night we spent together was in a sleeping bag under the stars out in the California desert. I didn't tell her that he would hold on to me at night like he was trying to hold on to what few connections he had left to the real world. I didn't tell her that I loved him. 

As for me, I didn't get my answer. He disappeared years ago, and no one in his family knows where he is (a testament to the lack of mental health care in the US). He could be living on the street, if he's still alive. I don't know whether I hope he's still alive or if it would be better if he's left a world where he was always lost.

"Masculine isn't a bad word


I have been debating making this thread for a very long time but after seeing some more terrible comments and threads recently I figured it was time to talk. 


1. Calling yourself masculine isn't a bad thing. You're not attacking feminine men by describing yourself as someone who behaves in a masculine way. 


2. If you're offended by guys describing themselves as masculine you need to really look into your own insecurities and try to understand why you're actually upset by this. 


3. It's ok to have a preference for masculine gay men. This doesn't make you a terrible person because you're into guys who have masculine features and habits. You should always give someone a chance and have an open mind but if you prefer someone who is masculine. That's ok. You like who you like. 


If you're a feminine guy that's ok and if you're a masculine guy that's ok and if you feel like you're somewhere in the middle that's also ok. Be proud of who you are.

"Update: I kicked my nephew out of my house after being there for 27 hours.


[previous thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/52m8ur/i_kicked_my_nephew_out_of_my_house_after_being)

I sent my nephew a text that night saying 

&gt; I'm sorry that you had to go so soon. I am very upset that you brought a stranger into my house when I specifically asked you not to. You were also untruthful about it when I asked. I love you nephew, but you need to understand that mutual respect is not unconditional. We have always had that bond of mutual respect, unlike some of the other family, and it really hurt me that that bond was not maintained between us. I'm still coming down for the auto show this weekend and you're still more than welcome to come with me.

He replied

&gt; I understand uncle no hard feelings I could have at least respected you on that and it was totally my fault. Yes I still want to go to the auto show with you this weekend.

I was glad that he understood, and I intended to put it all behind us at that point. I took down my inside camera so that I could wipe and reformat the memory card last night (I do this monthly, its better for the SD card) but something told me to look back on the incident. When I had looked at the camera before, he and the guy were walking in the house right as I logged in. This time, I went a couple minutes before that. I found my nephew walking down the stairs and as he passed the camera he did a double and triple take right at the camera and stared at it for a few seconds. This reminded me that I had talked to him a lot in the previous months about my smarthome system and the business I am starting setting up smarthomes. In our texts I realized that I've sent him funny screenshots of the things my dog does when I'm not at home, from the inside camera. He knew the camera was there the whole time. He then walked outside again and walked back in with the guy. I turned the volume up and heard him tell the guy to come this way because there's a camera over there. I guess he thought the camera could not see the entry and office doors. 

Towards the end, after the guy came from the bathroom, my nephew went into the bathroom and closed the door. Soonafter, my dog came downstairs and noticed a stranger in the house. He started barking, tail and ears down, and the guy ran back into the office and closed the door. My nephew came out of the bathroom minutes later and took the dog upstairs and put him in my room. My dog could have killed that guy. 

Anywho, I deleted the footage and didn't bring it back up. This morning I realized that one of my expensive lubes are missing. I also realized that one of my toys were put away in the wrong spot, and that my fleshlight had been used and badly cleaned before returning it to its place, its covered in lint now. I hide all of my toys on a shelf in the top corner of my closet, so he had to have been rumbling through my things to find them. So in the 2.5 hours I was gone to work, my nephew found and used my toys, used my lube, and fucked a stranger in my office, all while knowing about my smarthome system and knowing there was a camera there. I feel like my kicking him out is now justified. "
"Gaybros: what is something you love about your SO/bf/fwb/husband?


It could be something mundane or physical or even an event that happened. 


For me its the way he automatically is the big spoon when we cuddle. He holds me tight and makes me feel so safe and protected. Its dumb but it totally makes me all gooey inside knowing that no man can make me feel that way. No obtainable man. (Im sure id cream myself if Andy Samberg asked me to fuck lol)"
