"PSA/Rant: STRAIGHT BOYS DON'T LIKE YOU


To every single gaybro who posts asking if his straight friend secretly is harboring feelings for him: STAAHHHPPPP



Your straight friends are ***STRAIGHT***. They do not like you. That thing they do? Smile at you, give you a hug, even flirt with you a little bit, it does NOT MEAN THEY WANT TO BE WITH YOU. Maybe they feel they can drop the masc bullshit around you because they accept your sexuality and realize they don't have to put up a front with you. Don't blow it by drooling all over them. What if every single girl you were flirty and friendly with told you they love you? COME ON! Straight is straight. 

Leave your straight friends alone! Your situation is not special. It is not that one in a million where he realizes he's gay, he's always been gay, and he's in love with you, *how could he not have known!?* He's just straight. That one in a million? That's when guys have been best friends forever and their friendship grows into something more, or some shit like that. It is *not* that random guy in your class who smiles back at you. It is *not* that friend who bitches to you about his girlfriend. It is *NOT* ANY OF THEM.

LEAVE THE STRAIGHT GUYS ALONE, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE WITH YOU, AND STOP ASKING US IF THEY SECRETLY LIKE YOU

"Anyone had one clear defining moment?


I was 16 in high school minding my own business when a group of assholes starting teasing this Down's syndrome kid. They were calling him names, and one gave him a wedgie. It was horrible. Kid was crying and shaking. Told  them to stop and the fat loser started on me. One slipped his leg behind me, and the fat fuck pushed me over and said ""what's the matter faggot.. retard here suck your queer dick?"" I am gay, but nobody knew or suspected then. But I lost it and smacked him on the face. Only punch I've ever thrown , but he went down like the sack of shit he is, blood gushing everywhere. I had broken his nose and he ended up in an ambulance 

Next day (fist still hurt) was in mandatory 2 week in school suspension. With him. Before noon was called and my suspension terminated after a lot of classmates had described the event. 

So the kids mom sends me brownies. I go over and thank her and the kid gives me a hug. I'm like jello. I ask the kid if he wants to come watch my track meet the next day. So he shows up. And the next meet. He didn't miss a meet of mine in 3 years. I started volunteering in special ed, and special olympics. 

Next week I get my masters in education, and start senior special ed teaching in the fall"
"Dating with a Terminal Illness


So I'm 22 and have metastasized cancer. I have about 2-4 years left to live and I'm not doing chemo. Physically, I look good and you can't tell that anything is wrong with me yet, and I'm obviously not contagious (or harboring an STD), but I'm not going to get better. I still want to go on dates with guys though, but am not sure when the right time is to clue them into my condition, or if I should at all. I certainly do not want to tell them straight away for fear of a pity date or scaring them away. Maybe that's unfair, but I want to be happy too! I've never had a boyfriend and while my family is being really great, I'm still a person and I want to find something special, even if it only lasts for a little while. Has anyone had any experience with this, or has anyone been on the other side of my situation? 

Edit: Wow guys, this is really encouraging. I'd like to say thank you for all the wonderful responses and the support you've all shown me. It really does mean a lot, and while I'm not typing responses to all of you individually, please know that I've read what you've written and appreciate it a ton. To be honest, I expected people to be hesitant to... well, I'm not even really sure, but I assumed people would shy away from my situation or express some form of reluctance to consider me a valid dating option. Your responses have made me more optimistic of the reaction(s) I'll get when the time comes to inform my partner(s) of the ""tee"". 

Another thing: A few of you have asked where I live and expressed interest in meeting up, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. This is still a very private matter to me and frankly, I don't like the attention that it brings. I'll let you know if my feelings change, though. But again, thank you all for the replies and the support. I'm looking forward to putting myself out there. I even got a sweet tie on sale the other day!"
"So I finally faced the truth tonight:


I like guys.

It's been building up over the last few weeks, like becoming more mentally comfortable with myself towards my attraction to guys. Tonight while driving home something in me pushed me to say it and so I yelled out what I'd been suppressing for so long: I like guys. The first time I said it a weird feeling overcame me, like 'Holy shit, I actually did it... I.. came out to myself'... The feeling is hard to explain.

It was a long time coming. I've been able to see and appreciate a nice body on a guy for as long as I can recall, which I guess transformed into a desire for me to 'want to look like that.' While true, my desire to be like such guys essentially served as a self-accepted way of admitting I was physically attracted to them (basically my skewed thought process was I'm only attracted to these guys because they have what I want, if I too had a nice body etc. I would no longer look at them in that way.) It may sound stupid and confusing but it made sense in my head mostly. Sure, I find some girls hot and boobs are pretty amazing, but I have never cared for/looked at girls in the same way as I have guys: if I had to pick out attractive people in a crowd, my eyes would naturally wander to looking at guys (what that makes me, who knows). Regardless, let's face it - nothing beats seeing two attractive guys go at it.

I believe why it took so long was the need to overcome my biggest obstacle - my own mind: the lingering internalised homophobia and fear of the unknown (how will people react? In what way will this shape my life? What if I don't even like guys romantically?) Of course I'm yet to uncover the answers to any of these questions and only time will tell; ultimately it was through time that I have began accepting/understanding a part of me that I have never been certain of... Something which is an underlying element of who I am; and from tonight, been able to vocally accept.

Putting it in writing and being able to reflect on all of this, yeah it's clear the signs have always been present, and I'm glad I have finally mustered the courage to accept them as well as myself.

I am sorry for the long-winded post, I've done my best to keep things short. I'd also definitely be keen to discuss or hear from anyone who's had similar experiences!


Edit: Wow, this post really blew up. I appreciate all the supportive comments!"

"Do you guys worry about asking out straight guys?


I'm straight and had an interesting experience last Friday. I was asked out by a gay guy and I politely explained to him that I wasn't gay. Then he said ""oh, thanks for not reacting badly"". That made me wonder, do you guys worry about getting negative reactions/outbursts from guys you flirt with?(assuming they turn out to be not gay)"
"[UPDATE + Trigger Warning] Bf won't let me see him naked



[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/68c0nu/bf_wont_let_me_see_him_naked/?st=J26VCF0O&amp;sh=086b708a)

Apologies for the length of this but I think context is necessary. Also felt the need to go ahead and give a **trigger warning** upfront bc I know some of the subjects this post raises may be sensitive for some people. I was initially going to omit a lot for that reason but then I realized that would make it seem like we had some fairytale resolution and that just isn't what happened. 

Okay. Here goes. 

A few hours ago my bf came over to my apartment and we were just sitting on the couch talking. 

I don't even remember what we were talking about now but eventually we started making out and at one point he straddled my lap   while I was sitting down and kept kissing me. While he was doing that,  I put my hand up his shirt and started rubbing his back. 

That's when he  pulled his mouth away and said we should go in my bedroom (I basically expected him to say that bc, like I said in my last post, I can black my bedroom out with the shades and I can't really do that in the living room since the blinds always let in some light). 

But instead of just going in my room  like I normally would, I said maybe we could try something different this time. 

He got quiet and asked what I meant (though I'm pretty sure he knew). So I decided to go for something relatively tame and just asked if he could take his shirt off for me out here first and we could go into the room after. 

He kind of sighed and said ""you know I don't like doing that"" and I said I understood but was thinking maybe we could make an exception just this once. 

At that point things kind of went off the rails. He got off of me then and said he doesn't know why I have to ""ruin everything"" and I'm not going to lie, that pissed me off a little. I said it's not like I'm asking him to do acrobatics here, and that I've seen more of the guys at my gym's locker room than I have of him and that I'm sick of pretending this is normal. 

Well then he got upset and actually started crying. Obviously I felt terrible and I actually had never even seen him cry before this. 

I told him I was sorry and that I didn't mean to make him upset and we could go in the room or just forget about the sex if he wanted. That's when he ended up saying something like ""well maybe the guys at the gym don't have marks on their stomachs.""

Now I assumed he meant he had scarring from his appendix getting taken out (he told me before he had to have it out when he was 19, which was basically right before he met me). So I was just like ""an appendix scar isn't a big deal, babe"" but then he said ""it's more than that."" 

I didn't know what he meant at that point, but I told him I didn't care and that no one has perfect skin. I even told him about how I used to get teased when I was in middle school for acne and stuff before my face finally cleared up. He sort of seemed annoyed when I said that though and told me ""that's not the same at all"" and then started getting emotional again which made me regret mentioning it. 

So that's when I said it was fine, he didn't have to take his shirt off and I wouldn't ask anymore (bc I didn't know what else to say at that point). 

At that point he got kind of quiet for a minute and then he finally asked if I thought he was crazy. I told him no and then he looked at me and said ""Promise not to think I'm crazy no matter what?"" And I was kind of getting worried at that point but just said ""okay"" bc I really didn't want him to start crying again. 

So he ended up telling me that during high school he went through a period of self-harming. He said his resolution  at graduation was not to do it anymore and he's kept that promise to himself. (He would've been around 18 when he graduated and he's 20 now so that would mean he hasn't done it in 2 years). 

So obviously I was pretty shocked . I was expecting him to say he's insecure about not having a six pack or something like that but never this bc I never pictured him as a cutter. 

Anyway, at that point, I just hugged him and said it was okay, and he didn't have to show me. 

But then, surprisingly, he said ""you can see if you want, I guess"" and he just stood up and turned his back to me and then took off his shirt. Then I heard him sort of mumbling (I think he might have been counting to himself or something). Meanwhile, I'm kind of holding my breath a little bc I really don't know what I'm about to see. 

But when he turned around the scars weren't as bad as I thought they'd be. I mean they're definitely visible and when I looked closely I could see that there are a lot of them. But they're all  faded and clearly old. I told him all of that and he said they're better than they were bc he's been putting some sort of cream on them religiously since we started dating. But he also says he doesn't think they'll ever go away completely. 

***again, trigger warning***

I asked him how he had done all this to himself because I guess I just couldn't imagine him being able to cause that kind of damage (like I thought maybe he was lying and actually had been attacked or something you know?). But he told me at first he would use open scissors and then eventually managed to steal a scalpel. He then went into lots of detail that I won't post here, but it convinced me that he was telling the truth about how he got the scars. 

Anyway, when I asked him *why* he would do this to his own body, he said he didn't want to talk about it now. So I said that was okay, and decided not to push. 

So after all that we ended up just cuddling and watching a movie instead of having sex. And tbh that was actually fine by me bc I think after we were both kind of exhausted at that point anyway. 

Okay. That's all I have. He fell asleep a little while ago so I figured I may as well update people who were interested and/or were trying to help me before. I'm hoping now that at least I sort of know what's going on, I can start to take some of the suggestions people gave under my last post. 

Anyway please feel free to still leave comments. I'm navigating something totally new here and although I've been trying to do a little internet research to educate myself, feedback is always helpful. 


EDIT: Forgot to note something important. Because all of this information is so sensitive I ended up asking my bf if he cared if I posted about it (I have another Reddit account that he knows about but I told him I'd used an alternate account for this). He told me he doesn't care what I post since it's anonymous, but he said he doesn't want to actually read the posts or the comments and would prefer that I don't show him (not totally sure why, but I said that was fine and if he changed his mind to let me know).

"I'm 17, got kicked out for being gay, how can I get my own place?


I'm 17, in the UK, a full time student at college doing my A-levels and I also have a part time job. I just recently started my job and will be getting my first pay check this Friday. I earn £5.80 an hour and I do 18-24 hours a week (however in my term breaks from college I can work full time and earn more). I'm currently staying at a friend's house for a bit but really need my own place. I've seen a room In a shared flat for £50 a week which includes everything like council tax, utility bills, wifi, everything so I just need money for food and my personal things. How do I go about getting this place, I'm so lost and scared and I have no clue on what to do. I have no savings or anything. I'm giving up on life. I have my exams in two weeks too I hate how this had to happen now. :( "
"Coming Out Story


Okay so not really a question, but I wanted to share this. I live in Pakistan and I've known that I'm gay, well since as long as I could remember. I've been closeted all my life, I was terrified of somebody finding out or losing my friends because they wouldn't accept me. Over the past year I started accepting myself for who I am and I had also moved out to another city (college). Last night I couldn't sleep because the whole closet thing was weighing down on my soul so I conference called my two best friends at 2 am. One of them is agnostic, the other one is pretty religious.
We chatted for while and then I blurted out that I was gay. Silence. Then the agnostic one said ""well duh"". They told me that at this point they were pretty sure that I was gay and that they were just waiting for me to accept myself. Lol I've never been the straightest kid while growing up, but the fact that they knew I was gay and they stuck around in a country where gays are abhorred meant the world to me. I asked the religious one if he was okay with me being gay and his precise words were ""yeah I mean religion is important but so are you. Girls, guys, horses doesn't matter who you're attracted to, you're still the same person...and we love you.""
Then they told me that I didn't need to bottle my feeling up and that I should stay safe and I could talk to them without any fear of judgement. I told them about my bf and they insisted on meeting him when I get back home.
I went to bed with a huge ass smile on my face. :D
