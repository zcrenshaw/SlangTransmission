"I got a boyfriend!!!


April fools!

*sobs*"
"I had no idea gay sex was so incredible.


I had never done anything with guys before. I was curious about it and my gay friend was happy to let me experiment with him.
Let me just say, I get it now. I understand why you guys prefer it. His hole was way tighter and more pleasurable than any vagina I had encountered. And the way his dick was swinging back and forth when he was on all fours, and how it was slapping my stomach when he was riding me, it was incredible. We frotted (I hope that means what I think it means) afterwards and it was definitely the most intimate thing I had done with someone else.
I know this isn't a question, but I just feel like I finally know who I am and have a sense of sexual identity. I just felt like sharing with a gay community.

Edit: Just had to add, slowly sliding in and out of a guy's ass and hearing him moan has to be the most satisfying thing ever.

Edit 2: This thread is probably dead and no one cares anymore but I thought I'd post anyway. I gushed to my friend how eager I was to try it again and we went for round 2. I'm honestly torn between deciding whether I'm bisexual or gay. I've had sex with women before, and I enjoyed it, but I felt like I was just going through the motions to get some pleasure. When I was fucking a dude, both times I got this animal instinct, like a dog in heat. It's super weird, I can't really describe it. Plus, I think I had it wrong the first time. The most satisfying thing ever is having a dick in your mouth. Seriously, I could do it for a living. Sorry, I know r/askgaybros isn't my personal blog, but I'm just discovering so much about myself right now."
"Trump betrays his gay voters


**Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday allowing federal contractors to discriminate against LGBT employees.**

Trump‚Äôs order revokes three previous orders signed by Barack Obama, including Executive Order 13673, the ‚ÄúFair Pay and Safe Workplaces Order‚Äù.


Signed in 2014, the order required companies receiving sizeable federal contracts to demonstrate that they have acted in compliance for at least three years with federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender stereotyping.

Any gay bro Trump voters care to comment?"
"UPDATE: Boyfriend won't marry me...


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/61beuy/boyfriend_wont_marry_me/

Okay so a lot of people were giving me advice and feedback and some asked for an update. People are also still responding to that thread so I figured I should just post this now. It's going to be a little long (and also sort of embarrassing) so please bear with me. 

So last night my bf had gone out with some of his friends he knows from his program. He had assumed I was going out with him but I said I had a bad headache and he should just go (which was actually true. I managed to give myself a headache thinking about all of this marriage stuff). 

Anyway he seemed sort of disappointed but he didn't really question me and ended up leaving. After he was gone, I decided it would be a good idea to start drinking. The thing about drinking by yourself is that there's no one to gently imply that you've had enough. Last night, I *really* needed someone to tell me I'd had enough. 
I ended up getting really drunk by myself (drunkenly answered some of you all's comments tbh, so I hope everything was coherent). 

Anyway, after many vodka cranberries, I came to a decision. It's hard for me to say what motivated that decision other than to say I had a mini freak out. I ended up getting the ring out of this miniature vase thing where I was hiding it and I just put it on our bed and left it there. I went back into the livingroom after that (I think I was planning to wait for my bf to come home. I don't even know). Anyway, I fell asleep on the couch. 

I don't know exactly when my bf came in. I just know it was late and he ended up kind of shaking me awake and asking a million questions about the ring. (I didn't hear him come in but apparently he opened the door, turned off the living room tv and went in the bedroom, found the ring, and came back out). 

I have to be honest and say I don't remember much of the details from that conversation. I know I told him (or at least tried to tell him) we should probably talk tomorrow given the fact that I was visibly sloshed. But he was really wound up by that point and talking fast and he just kept going on and on. 

Okay this next part may be tmi (sorry) but if I'm going to share this ridiculous story, I might as well tell the whole thing. Now I don't really get hangovers even if I drink a lot and I don't tend get sick either. BUT the catch is that I have to sleep. I have to sleep at least 8 hours or more. Obviously that sleep was disrupted and so I wasn't able to process the alcohol. Anyway I was already anxious and bf was motioning his hands all over the place while he was talking, which was making me dizzy. 

So I accidentally threw up on him. 

The worst part is I was so drunk and upset that instead of reacting like a normal person and helping him I just started to cry. (At this point I was wondering if I'll not only be unmarried but indefinitely single). 

But strangely enough, for reasons I still don't understand, somewhere between lots of towels and showers and intermittent crying, he ended up saying that he does love me and wants to marry me. (I had to confirm with him this morning that he actually said and meant that rather than just saying it to appease a drunken crazy person. He was wearing the ring though, so that was nice). 

So...I guess that's the story of my engagement? Not very romantic or even pleasant, but it is what it is. 

Also, I know that a lot of people expressed concerned about us rushing in. I don't really want an overly long engagement but I am going bring up premarital counseling at some point.
 
Anyway, thanks to everyone who commented and showed interest in my dilemma! Much appreciated. If anyone has questions or comments, I'll try to answer what I can. Not going to be doing too much anyway because I still feel sick, but I am very happy."
"Do you guys sometimes feel like you've missed out on your youth because you're gay?


I'm 27 and sometimes feel like this. I never had a boyfriend or ever kissed a guy. If I could go back, I would fuck as many guys as I could and have more fun."
"Damn I just got fingered for the first time and my soul left my body via my dick


So now I know "
"Could my son be gay? What to do?


What's the best way to approach him about this? Is it best to leave it alone and wait for him to come to me?
This concerns my son and his interactions with his best friend. Both boys are 15. My son and his friend have known each other since the 2nd grade and have been like brothers since then. Best friend lost his father about 6 weeks ago. 
When he passed away it was sudden and my son and myself went over to the friend's house. I saw my son briefly kiss the other boy on the cheek while at the house. At the funeral they were holding hands and my son had his arm around his friend. I didn't think too much about the interaction at the funeral and figured he was just offering support.
Then yesterday my son asks if his friend could sleep over because he didn't want to be at home. His father's birthday was yesterday and this morning I saw them holding hands again.
I hadn't seen them interact like this until the father passed away, so I'm not sure if this is just my son trying to be supportive of a grieving friend or more.
I have no issue with him being gay if that's what he is just trying to figure out what is going on and be sensitive to teenage emotions."
"For those of you who's best friend was a straight male... was it hard coming out to him?


I have a friend who I consider a brother. I've known the guy since 2nd grade. I'd sleep over his house and he'd sleep over mine and blabla. We were straight up BROS. he was the very first person I came out to... I was 18... I called him over the phone and began to cry. He was freaking out wanting to know wtf is going on... I couldn't control myself because I was scared to lose him... so I finally was able to let it out and the first thing he said was ""I'm coming to pick you up"" he took me to his place and said no matter what you're like a brother to me no matter wtf you are into... he gave me a hug and I was shocked... and crying like a little bitch.... aster a couple of days he questions began... 

Our friendship is still going strong &lt;3

Love him üíô"
"Gaybros, what's the cringe worthy thing you've ever done for another guy?


I just stumbled upon a song I wrote, produced, and recorded for a guy I had a crush on about a decade ago. Fucking cringe-fest the entire way through.

All I could think while listening to it was *what the fuck was I thinking*? To top it off, in hindsight...the dude was not attracted to me and told me several times in a roundabout way that nothing would ever happen. I remember sending him the song and he was like...""that's cool"". I can't sing, and the sappy lyrics were so butt-kissy, and frankly a damn mess. 

You ever look back on anything you've done for a crush and shake your head?

edit: I meant *most* cringe worthy in the title..."
"Boyfriend of 2.5 years just ghosted me . . .


Just wanted to vent because this shit that happened is ridiculous. I'll try to keep it fairly brief for you guys, thanks in advance for reading!

 So I had been dating this guy for about 2 1/2 years. The relationship had generally been great. We've gone on trips together, he's come with me to visit my hometown which is several hundred miles away. He's the first guy I've ever introduced to my family. We've talked about moving together, getting an apartment and all of that. He's the first person I've ever had a relationship with where it actually felt healthy and happy. The only person I've ever talked with seriously about making a future together. You get the idea.

So the last couple of weeks things have been a little rocky. I've been a little depressed and kind of mopey which has led to us getting into a few arguments. Nothing too too serious, but there's been a little tension. So Saturday night he calls me because he was supposed to come over. He tells me that since I haven't been in the best mood he thinks he's going to stay home that night. I told him that was fine, I would give him some space. I said I wouldn't bug him, but for him to just call me when he's ready to.

So I spend the night alone and he calls me the next morning. We have a very long talk and we decide that we're going to work things out. He say's he's going to come see me that day after he takes a shower and everything. So I get a call an hour later and he says he's on the way and asked if he should pick anything up. I asked him to grab some food from this place we like and he says ""Sure, see you soon."" 

So he lives about 40 mins away. I'm sitting here looking at the clock and I realize it's been an hour.  I think okay, maybe traffic or something . . . One hour turns to two and I'm worried something is up. So I call him and I get this message saying that ""This is not an active number."" WTF, that's weird???? So I go to message him on Facebook and he's blocked me. I soon find out that he's also blocked every single person on there that we have in common!

So it goes from ""I'm on the way, see you soon."" to him just completely disappearing from my life without saying a word. He actually went through the trouble of changing his phone number instead of just blocking me (I tried calling from other lines!) I've just been so confused and angry because I feel like if you're going to break up with me I at least deserve a goodbye, especially after 2.5 years. I've never seen him act in any way that would lead me to think he could be this immature, the guy is 34 years old. It just feels so fucked up to not have some kind of closure. I have no way of contacting him though, short of calling him at work or just showing up at his house (neither of which I'm willing to do.) 

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How do you even cope with this when you're not even afforded any closure? 

**TL;DR**: Get in fight with BF of 2.5 years. We make up the next day, and he says he's on the way over. I realize that it's been a while so I try to call and the phone number is not active. Me and everyone we have in common are blocked on Facebook. "
"Thick legs on guys.


How many of us can agree that they are *everything* ugh.


Like I swear a guy can go from a 7 to a 10 if he has nice legs.


Idk, I just saw this really hot guy and I examined him and he had really nice legs and all I could think about was him laying back and me riding him."
