"(Update) I need help with my grandson.


Here is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/63n6t3/i_need_help_with_my_grandson/ (Did I tag this correctly to the post)

So from the last update I told him that he could tell me about his cute friend he is talking too (whether it be girl or boy).

Around an hour ago, he came down the stairs crying and came in to my arms and said ""I'm so sorry for not telling you."" Then I told him I didn't know what he was talking about. He told me he was gay. I told him that ""I love you no matter what and who is the cute boy then?""

He started to laugh and told me about his boyfriend. He showed me a few pictures of them together. They are really cute together.

This experience has brought my grandson and I closer already. I can only thank you guys for that! 

Edit: Thanks for your support!

Edit 2: He walked to school today like a brand new man. I've never seen him this happy!

"Am I gay? - The Guide


Hey bros, if you follow this subreddit, [you know that we get this post quite a lot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/search?q=am+i+gay&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

THAT'S OK! Sexuality is weird, and it's hard to figure out some things that are going on with ourselves without an outside perspective. Today, I'm writing this up for anyone that might be having these thoughts or asking this question. Let's me say this one thing first:

***It's OK to be gay!***

Seriously! Honestly I think it's awesome, but some are...not as content with it. Either way: It's ok. No matter what any *one*, or any *thing* tells you, it's ok. There's nothing wrong with you, you aren't sick, you don't have a disease.

Now, I won't tell you that this isn't something to freak out about, because you're probably doing that anyways. Relax, breath. Let's analyze your situation. Try to be as honest with yourself as you can.

* I get off to gay porn!

So? We get this a lot. Someone likes gay porn and gets off to it, thinking they are gay. Look: Porn isn't the best indicator of your sexuality. It's actually a pretty poor one. Can it help? Maybe.

Think about this: What part of the porn do you enjoy? Do you like the boobs and stuff bouncing around? Do you like the vagina and everything? Do you feel like you're more the guy in this situation? You're probably not gay then.

However: Do you find yourself looking at the guy more? Do you like his dick? Are you casually thinking about how awesome it would be to get pounded by this guy, getting kissed and getting tickled by his beard? Or maybe you're thinking about how awesome it would be to be in him? Surprise! You're probably gay.

BUT, let's look at some other things first.

* I notice girls!

Do you REALLY notice them? As in, walking down the street, you see a girl who you know looks attractive, and think ""Huh, she's attractive."" Then move on?

Or, do you notice say...that guy at the gym always lifting a ton of weight with that shirt that barely covers anything? How his huge muscles flex with each rep, showing off his chest? Do you notice the decent bulge he's got, and how awesome his ass looks in those shorts as he does squats? Then when he is close to the same machine as you, do you get really nervous wondering if he'll say something to you, and freaking out you won't know what to say back and look like an idiot?

You tell me.

* I'm not feminine...

Feminine â‰  gay. Gay isn't a 'lifestyle'. It's a sexual orientation. Feminine guys are totally fine. They are who they are. Same thing with masculine guys! Tons of gay guys who I know you wouldn't have any guess that they were gay. I'm one of those people, everyone who I've come out to was completely surprised. 

* But, I've had girlfriends!

Honestly this can mean very little. Tons of gay guys have had girlfriends in past. Usually it just means that they weren't quite sure of who they were, and were just following what was considered 'normal'. Or, they could be bisexual. Like I said, sexuality is weird.

* I've never thought about being with a guy before.

Probably due to the heteronormalization of culture. It's not something you see every day, but that doesn't mean it's wrong or 'weird'! It's just something most people don't think about. You might not notice it at first (some do, some don't), but you might get those 'butterfiles' everyone talked about after seeing a guy you like. You think about spending time with him, maybe taking him out to some fun or cool places you know of, or just other romantic feelings...

But, let's get to some tips if you're asking this question:

* Breathe.

Like I said, it's ok to be gay! Take it slow, and analyze your situation.

* Try your best not to worry about it.

You're probably gonna do this anyways, but just think: being gay isn't really that big of a deal. Most people are fine with it, others just don't really care. It's not something that defines you, it's just a little part of who you are!

* Don't be so quick to label yourself.

Humans have a natural tendency to do this. Labeling things just makes it easier for us to sort through things. Just go with the flow, and see what happens, and don't be scared of the outcome.

But I'm adding this section here: It's entirely possible that you might be bisexual. Take a look at this (at the request of /u/HushHushItsASecret): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale

It's what's called the Kinsey Scale. If you don't want to read a wiki page, I'll sum it up for you. Basically: The Kinsey Scale is like a scale of sexuality, going from 0-6 (Also x). 0 being strictly heterosexual, 3 being bisexual, 6 being strictly homosexual, x being asexual. It was created by Alfred Kinsey in 1948. It's worth a look! I'm Kinsey 5 if you're curious. But really look into it if you'd like, because you could always be somewhere in-between (Sup my Bibros?)

"I need help with my grandson.


I have full custody over my grandson [15] due to his mother being an alcoholic and my son passing away.

I have recently discovered some conversions between a friend of his and him on the computer we share. These conversations imply that he is gay and in a relationship.

How can I show him that I support him and tell him that I know he is gay?

Edit: I just picked him up from school. In the car I asked if ""you are talking to anybody cute"" he said yes and then put on his earplugs, he's in his room now. I'm about to go in his room. I will keep you guys posted. Thank You!

Edit 2: I walked into his room, and he was on our computer typing. I asked him ""hey what are you doing?"" He said he was doing nothing. So I just said that ""If you want to tell me about that cute boy or girl you told me about, I am here for you.""

It's going pretty good so far. Thanks!

"/r/Islam discusses punishment of homosexuality


&gt;Lashing should not harm the perpetrator and it is done to embarrass the criminal for committing a crime.

&gt;I don't understand why people are outraged over this. They didn't comply with the law, so they got their punishment.


&gt;Your ""human right"" to gay intercourse ends where my religious belief begins.

"Do guys wear shirts like this to show off?


I keep seeing shirts like [this](http://imgur.com/aUWNPZA) and  [this](http://imgur.com/cLD7bL4) ...so these people want to be stared at right lol? Why do they have a giant open hole in their shirt... 

When I see guys in those, I just stare at their bodies and I bet I look like a creep. I dont see what's the point in this clothing in a classroom, it's so distracting..."
