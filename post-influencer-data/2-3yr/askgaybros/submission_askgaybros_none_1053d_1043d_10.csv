"Date just killed himself


Hi there,

I've met this cute guy in a bar two weeks ago and we decided to meet the week after for a proper date because we were attracted to each other. We went to eat and ended up at his place so we can have some fun.

We sent some messages to each other for a moment. After a while, I was wondering why he would not respond back. Looking through his FB profile, I realized that he decided to put an end to his life.

I only met him a few times and had brief conversation. It's so sudden ... He seemed so happy and now, he is gone. 
I try to reason myself that he probably hid his interior problems but I still feel guilty for being perhaps the last person he had intimate moments .. I am a bit lost as I write this.

I hope you guys are all doing well because I care about all of you, everyone cares."
"Does it bother anyone else how much Black guys in porn are labeled as 'Thugs'


It seems so racist and backwards. It feels like they're fetishized in a way that white performers aren't."
"Piece of wisdom y'all should see (from r/showerthoughts) - After years of disliking the way i look, only now i realize I'm not ugly, I'm just not my type.


Especially for all those on here who worry about their looks or if they'll ever find a partner cos they too fem, too masc, too big, too thin etc etc

Turned up on the front page today, immediately thought of a bunch of threads I've seen round here"
"My boyfriend just told me he's ""In love with me""!!!


And I couldn't be happier because I feel the same way. He's 22 and I'm 24 and he's the first guy I feel the same way about and he's my first real boyfriend too! We've been together for almost 6 months and I am crazy about him! They have been some of the most memorable months of my life. I didn't know someone telling me this could make me feel so happy and jittery inside. It's a great feeling! "
"Took Some advice! Thanks all :) - w/pics

"Any cuddlers on here?


I had a friend come over for cuddling. It was our first time together and it was an amazing 2 and a half hours. It wasn't platonic either. We had fun doing borderline cuddling. I found it more arousing than sex and I didn't feel lonely afterwards.

It really cured my one night stand insecurities from this summer. I can't wait for more cuddles with him. 

Any other cuddle sluts on here? "
"How can you tell when a gay guy has mostly straight guy friends?


He'll tell you. 

Edit: ITT: Gay guys with mostly straight guy friends talking about how most of their guy friends are straight. "
"Friends dad caught me giving his son a blowjob…


Pretty much what the title says, I was giving my friend a blowjob and his dad walked in and I backed away, like the movie back away with my head down really quickly. He asked whats going on and we said that we were just playing video games. We're both 16… so i literally just left his house ten minutes ago and well idk what to do. Im next door so I'm home now and honestly I don't want to come out yet I'm not ready and I think Im bi. Idk this is kind of weird. I was pretty good friends with the dad, is he ever gonna see me the same idk. Ergh idk what to do. It was probably a surprise to him… if he processed what was happening in time because we're both fit ""men"" if you know what I mean. They hear stories of me getting with girls all the time and vice versa. I didn't leave right away we finished. But I'm still pretty scared to what happens next HELPP



Edit: ok i feel better now, thanks all"
