"Questions regarding my son


My 23 year old son told us over the Thanksgiving weekend that he is gay. I think he only wanted my wife to know but when he did the situation got messy as my wife started crying and scolding him. I didn't even know what it was about till I walked into the kitchen and she told me. I was too shocked to react. I just remember him trying to calm her down before my eldest son also walked in. It turned ugly at that point between my two sons. I was pretty much silent at first trying to wrap my head around it and next thing I know I am trying to pull the two of them apart like they were kids again fighting over who gets to play on the console.

He left after breakfast the next day as he lives in another city and was home for the weekend. I didn't get a chance to talk to him. I didn't know how to bring it up and I don't know if he would want to talk to me about it. Nobody in my family wants to talk about it but I feel like it is on their minds.

All of my kids have been closer to my wife as I had been busy providing when they were growing up and my wife being a stay at home mom had always been more involved. I did the stuff a father would help with like first driving lessons and carpooling but I never discussed anything personal with them. If there was an issue that needed handling I was always the bad cop because I never thought it needed to be the other way round. But since that day I can't help the feeling that I failed as a father to my youngest son. I want to talk to him but I don't know how to do it. He usually calls his mom. He would ask for me and if I was around he would talk to me. I can't remember the last time he called me for anything personal. I was just never that kind of dad. But seeing him so vulnerable that day has made me weak.

I don't know anybody gay. I never thought I would know anyone gay. But I just can't let this go. So I'm thinking of going to my son's place over the holidays. He's not coming. If he was he would have told us by now. Also we are muslims so we don't celebrate Christmas. How do I apologize to my son for not saying anything that night? 

The guilt is eating me. I feel like there's a constant weight on my chest. I want him to know that I'm okay with him being gay.

I have also been reading this site and I have a few other questions. I don't know if they are appropriate to ask but these are at the back of my mind. I want to know if he has a boyfriend? Does he plan to have one? Is he actively having sex? Is he using protection?

Another thing that has crossed my mind that I want to know is that was he molested as a child? I don't want to ask my wife and plant this seed of fear in her mind. Is it okay for me to ask this from him?

Lastly I'm okay with him being gay. I really am. I know he's a great kid who has a bright future ahead of him. Nothing has changed in my heart, mind and body for him except I want to protect him even more now. Because of that I would prefer if he stays in closet. I don't think he will be accepted, at least not in the Muslim community. The fact that my eldest son called him out for having faggot music taste that night has made me scared for him. I guess I'll be okay if he finds someone for himself but I don't want him to tell anyone. Is it okay if I tell him to not tell anyone? And who else has he told? 

Sorry for the long post but I don't have anyone to talk about this with. Browsing here over the past 2 weeks has really opened my eyes. It isn't that I thought of anything vile for gay people but reading the stuff here has made me realize there are real problems you guys have, acceptance is just the beginning.

Hope everyone has an amazing weekend."
"For the first time in a long time, I feel like a man!


Well, I finally did it - I finally had gay sex. And, because I'm not out yet, I need to share it with strangers on the internet.

It was almost like an out of body experience. I lost all control as I kissed him in public. Next thing I know, we're back at his place. It felt raw - primal even - as we quickly undressed each other. It was like I was driven by instinct as we had what was probably the most passionate sex I've ever had.

I tried both topping and bottoming, and I have to admit, my expectations were entirely wrong. At no point did I ever feel emasculated. In fact, I felt more like a man than I ever have with women. Even when I was bottoming, the way he moaned, the way I wrapped my legs around him driving him closer, I felt in control.

He fell asleep in my arms afterwards, and I can't express how empowered I felt. It was completely different than how I imagined it would be. It didn't feel how I thought ""gay"" would feel. I felt like more of a man than I've felt in years.

Seriously, I feel so silly for stressing about and suppressing my attraction to men all these years. My self esteem would have been so much higher if I just allowed myself to have sex with men sooner.

Now to work on coming out to my friends and family. Wish me luck!"
"Ways to increase mana regeneration during dates.


Whenever I go on dates I tend to use too much mana right away and end up too exhausted to cast charm spells later on during the date. Any ways to increase your mana regeneration without the use of mana potions or resorting to a mana stone? I've invested in a couple points into warmth and cuddles but then it almost always leads to something greater which costs way too much mana. Just FYI I am a level 27 Shaman with points into Restoration and Electric. "
"Our Son (3) Walked In On Us


He opened the door, my husband yelled ""fuck"", I froze, ejaculated and then he ran away screaming and crying because he bumped his knee in the hallway. He has seen *a lot* I think because when we went to check if he was alright, he asked me why I was ""hurting daddy"". We asked him why he didn't knock but he said he did. He couldn't stop crying for what felt like an hour because he thought we were angry with him because my husband said a ""bad word"". I feel so sorry for him because he has been complaining about his knees because of the leukemia and my partner and I have been arguing quite a bit lately, so no wonder he thought I was ""hurting daddy"". We don't have a lock and can't really get one because he usually comes to our room once or twice at night because he can't sleep.
How traumatizing is this for a child? Because I once read an article about the danaging effect porn could have on children who stumble on it at a young age. I'm just glad he didn't come in half an hour earlier or else I would have had to explain why my private parts were being eaten.

Conclusion: no sex till he is at least six"
"PSA: He's just not gay for you


OK this is a thread made solely for the purpose of helping those who have fallen for guys that aren't gay. I personally know the situation and have done a lot of dumb things concerning boys and my feelings.
I separated them in the following categories.

1. He's Straight and you're Gay.
My advice:  It's not going to work out romantically; however, you can still be friends. Just make sure you give yourself time to get over him.

2. You told a straight guy you liked him
My advice: don't do it, it's really bad and awkward. If you already have, give the guy some major space. He needs to process what that means and you need to get over him.

3. You have a close bond with a guy and now you have feels.

My advice: Space and Space. You need to give them hormones a break. You need to be occupied in order to ensure they got a break.

4. You can't get over him

My advice: don't be dumb, don't stick with him if it makes you feel bad. In the end of the day. You're on this earth for you. Not for anyone else. So please don't drive yourself to insanity for something as plentiful as boys.

5. You think that the guy you like is gay or bi

My advice: you need to be very honest with yourself when it comes to assuming that a guy is bi. That's a dangerous road with a lot of heart break at the end. If you really think he's bi or gay, ask him. If he's close to you and he knows that you're Gay, chances are he would've came out to you.

6. But you love him!!

My advice: No you don't. You're attracted to him. More so you're turned on by him. For the younger peeps( highschool babies) love is so overused and everything that escalates past a hug can be considered love to you guys. Love is something that bigger than yourself. It isn't superficial like some of posts on here.
 
All from a guy who does dumb shit"
"My extended family just told me I'm not invited to their holiday dinner party because they found out I'm gay.


Normally, I don't really care, but this made me feel really depressed. I feel pissed off and humiliated. "
"I'm going on my first date tomorrow!


It isn't really a question. I just wanted to share since I don't have anyone I can tell in real life. 
I'm so excited. I met up with this guy Sunday night and we just hung out on his bed and made out for a couple of hours and talked. I think I may actually really really like this guy. Anyway we are going out to lunch tomorrow and I am so happy for the first time ever! He's super hot and I seriously love his personality. He's just great!"
