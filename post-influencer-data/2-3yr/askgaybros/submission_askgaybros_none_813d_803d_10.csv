"PSA: The risk of getting HIV from oral sex is so low that they can't even put a number on it. PLEASE stop coming in here freaking out over blowjobs


Educate yourself on the risks for different behaviors: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html

Unless your dentist who is also dying of AIDS gave you an oral cumshot before stitching up the wounds from your wisdom teeth removal, it's not HIV you have to worry about. Of course there are other diseases you CAN easily get from oral so worry about those. But don't waste your energy, time and money worrying about and getting tested for HIV if all you did was suck a dick. "

"What was your first gay experience?


Mine was at a sleepover at a friend's house. We were playing Pokemon together in his room. He was always the most handsome guy in my class and I didn't realise it at the time but I had the biggest crush on him. We sat really close to one another and played through the game. At one point he put his Nintendo DS down, looked right into my eyes and kissed me. 

It was one of the best experiences of my life and to this day we are very good friends. He is married to a beautiful girl and has a beautiful daughter. This experience helped me realise I was gay and opened my eyes to boys. After this I was boy crazy."

I haven't even gotten around to S2 yet. I just thought it was cool the fan reaction actually worked"
"""Straight guy here…"" lol


It's just an easy way to get attention. Don't fall for it.
I used to think I liked straight guys more, but I realized I don't like straight guys because they're straight… I just like **guys** and the percentage of straight guys is higher than gay guys so of course it's more likely that I'd like a straight one. Gays need to stop letting straight guys manipulate them.

Not asking a question but the point I'm trying to make is:
Straight guys aren't better and gays should stop worshipping them."
"Ask me a question, anything at all, then edit it after my response to make me look ridiculous.


Thought I'd just play a little game, you ask a question, and when I answer you edit it to change your original question, thus making the answer I gave look stupid/weird/kinky etc.

May well get downvoted to shit with this but I've seen it on other subreddits and I'm bored so fancied giving it a try.

Fire away!"
"(Update) I think he's breaking up with me after our vacation


Well I was wrong. He broke up with me during our vacation. I asked him if anythings wrong and he said yes but we'll talk about it later. I pushed the issue and found out he was planning to break up with me on the last day of our vacation...yay "
