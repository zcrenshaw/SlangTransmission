"Choose Life!


I am a white haired old coot going in for surgery this week.  The doctors say my chances are less than 50/50.  I just wanted to send a little note to this reddit because it has been such a joy for me.

I came out back before Stonewall.  Had a long run in the military.  Spent my whole life in three long term relationships.  Even had to raise the younger brothers of my first lover, in East Texas.  That was a trip, let me tell you.

My lovers and I were the original ""Gaybros"", back before we even had a term for it.  Military men who shared the tastes of the American middle class, but who were never accepted.  Indeed, I got to watch all my friends die of the plague while our society looked on with stone cold eyes contemptuously indifferent.

I have also seen the best of it, and in my opinion this reddit expresses that best.  I have got to watch the rebirth of a gay sensibility, and the coming of some real equality.  I pray God you youngsters will be vigilant, and will see how precious these changes are, and will see through our push for equality to the end.

I just wanted to write and tip my hat to you young gaybros.  To urge all of you to always choose the value of your own life.  Real life, your life, is in session.  It will have many ups and many downs.  Never give up on what a miracle your own existence is.

If I make it through I should be back, and commenting on more reddits sometime after the 15th.  If not, here is wishing you all the best, and hoping you all have as varied and interesting a run as I have had.

POSTSCRIPT:  Thank you for all the warmth from those wishing me well.  As to you hostile twats, just remember the old Spanish saying, ""Every pig has his Martimus.""  (For you unwashed, St. Martimus day comes once a year when the village runs the pigs through the town to the slaughter.)  We all have to die, and how you treat others is inevitably, how you are treated yourself."
"I'm 25 &amp; I came out as gay &amp; athiest to wife, 7 siblings &amp; parents who are super religious. I'm dealing with the aftermath rn. AMA!


I came out of the closet May 16th to my wife after being married for 8 months. Then shortly after she forced me to come out to my family. She put me in a situation where I had to choose between her telling them or me telling them, and she gave me a deadline. So I sent them all a letter (I can post it later if people are interested), because I wanted to be the one who broke the news to them so I could at least get my views across to them as they found out. 

Shit has hit the fan. My family went crazy. I grew up very religious, and my family and ex are still very religious. I grew up in the evangelical Christian environment, with parents who were so religious they didn't believe in birth control. I got grounded once for my Bible getting dusty. My father made jokes about killing gay people. Lots of bad stuff. 

I became super religious in my early twenties as a response to all of the guilt and shame that came with my being a gay man in the awful environment I was in. I read the almost bible every day for years. I donated 10% of my income to ""God"" and I prayed constantly. I also intensely studied theology. 

I was in an intellectual prison and the guards who kept me in it were fear, shame, and guilt. 

What rescued me from that prison was kindness of non-evangelicals/non-religious people, science, intellectual honesty, pro lgbt media, and my best friend.

My sister told me that she hopes I hit rock bottom so I have no where to turn but Jesus. And I still constantly hear shit like this from my family. 

All of my friends know and most have been great. But I still feel weird about things at times. It feels weird being out to people that I hid in the closet from for so long. 

I'm getting divorced and I'm moving on. I got married due to religious and family pressures.  My wife and I are separated at the moment. 

I've had sex with a few guys and it's amazing!  I also never did anything with anyone till after my wife and I separated. 

I'm also happier than I've ever been, but I'm also processing a lot of shit at once. So I would love to talk about it and hear advice from anyone. 

TLDR: 

I grew up gay with an evangelical family, and got married at 24. I came out to everyone and my family is being terrible, and my friends are being mostly cool. I want to talk about it.

Update: I just noticed all these messages. I intend to read them all and respond to as many as I can. 

I answer a lot of questions in my coming out letter. Some clarifications on this letter. My family already knew about the shit my parents did. I am also very blunt, but keep in mind I was forced to come out, and I don't have a good relationship with my family. Please ask questions for me to clarify something before you make personal judgements. Please. :)

"I (20F) want to tell my husband (M25) that its okay to come out of the closet?

"My bully died.


Today I found out that my bully from high school that tormented me and outed me for being gay died in a car crash.

And all I felt was pure happiness. It was seriously the high point of my week. 

But now looking back at it, I feel like a bad person. Am I?"
"It's never too late to come out or lose your virginity


I lost mine in my late 30s and it annoys me when folks are either shocked or act like I'm an alien. Maybe if I was straight and wasn't raised in a conservative environment, I wouldn't have took so long but it does annoy me how some folks like to believe I'm the rare exception. 

What I'm saying is that nobody should ever try to make you feel bad for being a virgin or losing it late because we all have our personal histories. Some lose it young, some don't. I would have loved to have lost it at 18 with a GRINDR hookup but guess what, we didn't have that in my day and I lived in the middle of nowhere."
"I prefer seeing guys half-naked (no shirt, or even with underwear) than full. Anyone else?

"Dear guys on Grindr who remain faceless while openly saying you ignore other faceless guys...


Stop. Just stop."
"My uber vanilla boyfriend is getting really kinky


I've been with him about 2 years (while we are still relatively young) he's always been extremely vanilla. He is so vanilla he said  doggystyle is degrading. Yet now he's turning into this Master of Kink. He asked me to choke him, spit in his mouth, slap him. He wants me to spank him. We were in his dads house and he gave me a BJ in his old room, swallowed my load then had a family dinner while looking at me so smugly. He would never have done anything like that before. He's just done a complete 180 its not like this has been a progression, its been in 1 week. Now some guys will be like shut up youre so lucky but it's like he's been possessed I don't know him intimately anymore, its such a drastic change and to be honest I'm scared he's learning this shit from someone else if I'm honest. Am I just being paranoid? "
