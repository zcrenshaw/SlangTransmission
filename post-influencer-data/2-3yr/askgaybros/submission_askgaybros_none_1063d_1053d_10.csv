"bottoms are real men


You know what, fuck this.

Bottoms are real men.  Getting ass fucked is intense and intimate and stoic and hard and gentle all at the same time, it's so fucking manly.  Women do not have the anatomy to enjoy getting anally pounded like men do.  It is such a fucking primal male act.  

Bottoms are real, tough, beautiful men.  As a top I love them, I am a beta male to any alpha bottom.  

Fuck anyone who says otherwise."
"I lost my partner of 8 years today


Hey guys,

I've made a few posts on here about my partner including our hard break up over the open relationship.

He has been sick for many months and he died of lupus this morning. I have been crying all morning. I miss him so much. 

I still believe he is with me as I cried myself to sleep, I felt him curled and cuddled up next to me. It was the most restful sleep I've had since he has been sick.

I just wanted to thank you guys for all of your advice and support. :)"
"Shout out to guys who don't get off but indulge their guy and get him off instead.


You know who you are. Hook up or spouse, you guys give him an orgasm but are entirely cool not getting off yourself. This is probably one of the most selfless things you do that makes him love you. "
"Feminine gay men make me really uncomfortable. Why is this?


I don't mean this in an unkind way and I'm not trying to be offensive, but.. feminine gay men tend to make me feel really uncomfortable. I know a bunch of gay guys and I'm completely fine with them, but for some reason when I'm around an effeminate gay guy I often feel somewhat uneasy and tense. I would feel much more comfortable around a guy who openly talked about fucking other men than one who introduced himself by saying ""heeeeaaay.""

I'm posting this here because I'm wondering why this is.. As I said, I'm not trying to be offensive or anything, I just want to know why I feel this way. I'm a straight guy, by the way.

**EDIT: As I said, I am asking because I realize that I feel something irrational and I'm trying to figure out why so that I can stop. I don't think I am the only straight guy that feels this way so I think that this would be a constructive discussion to have. It's only been 10 minutes and my post is already getting rapidly down-voted (currently 25%) so it seems that the discussion probably won't happen here, but as I said, I think it's worth talking about.**"
"Do you regret not having normal teenager experiences?


Do you ever feel like you missed stuff like having a highschool sweetheart, discovering your sexuality like any other straight dude and such, because you were busy understanding your sexual orientation when you were young?"
"Updating: I pushed my boyfriend for sex when he didn't want to. He reluctantly agreed. Now I feel like an abuser and a complete piece of shit.


This is an update to:
https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/53wf1w/i_pushed_my_boyfriend_for_sex_when_he_didnt_want/

I bought flowers, prepared an apology, was willing to do everything I could but he broke up with me. He told me that I treated him like a whore and he can't be with me anymore. He said he needs to be with someone who respects him and can control himself when he's drunk.

I the end I asked if he will forgive me for what I did. He said he will, but we can't be together anymore. We wished each other luck. It was a friendly but firm breakup from him and a wake up call for me that I need help. I'm not ready to be in a committed relationship. I'm talking to a therapist now to sort out my issues. Hopefully the next time I date someone I can be a better boyfriend.

"[Update] Six months ago I sat next to a hot guy from my hometown on a plane the day I moved to Europe, and just went home for a visit...


I posted this originally about half a year ago about how I sat next to a gorgeous older guy on the airplane the day I was moving to Europe. We had a scene out of the movies in the airport, you can read about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4ciq39/the_best_and_worst_chance_meeting_story_ever/

We kept in touch over the months and promised to meet up whenever I came home for a visit. That time finally came a few weeks ago, beginning of October. We were both super excited in the days coming up to my homecoming and I landed late on a Friday night, I would have went and saw him that night but I didn't want to be too anxious!

So Saturday morning I woke up and went over to his house. I stepped out of the car and he had come outside to meet me. He kissed and hugged me right away. It felt like I had just seen him a few days ago. He showed me around his house, poured us both a glass of wine and we sat on the couch and caught up on my life abroad and what he'd been up to since I had left. We were considering doing something fun (hard to do in my hometown) but I told him I was fine with just hanging out. So he went and got a big pillow, put it on the edge of the couch and we just cuddled and watched TV and talked for like... 3 hours. I could have stayed there all day but I had dinner with my family that evening, so we said we would meet up in the evening.

That night we went out for drinks and he introduced me to his friends. Everyone knew me as ""the guy from the plane"" (just like how all my friends know him). I'm still in my early 20s and typically hang around an older crowd, but I did feel a little intimidated because all of these people were definitely older, all in their 30s+ and professionals/really successful. But everyone was super welcoming and nice and we had a great time. That night we went back to his house and resumed our position on the couch with wine and watched movies until we went to sleep.

I saw him almost every day for the next week, just really enjoying each other's company - went to lunch, dinner with his friends, a concert thing one of the neighborhoods puts on... but most of the time it was just riding in the car or hanging out. The last night before I left, we went to dinner with some of his friends and then had wine at his friend's house in her wine cellar. When it was just us 3, she wanted to know the whole story of how we met, so we explained the whole thing to her and she totally ate it up. Once we'd left he couldn't stop saying how she couldn't believe how young I was, I think I made a great impression on his friends.

I was kind of anxious to see whether we would have sex or not. We talked about it the whole week and he wanted to reassure me he wasn't just seeing me to have sex, and I told him it was the least of my worries. We were kind of all over each other during the week and we kept saying we would, but the day we finally tried he told me he wasn't sure because he knew he'd really want to see me again if we banged and it would probably be a while. I told him I had the same fear and that it made no difference whether we did anything or not, and in the end we never had sex and I was totally cool with it. If anything it just made me feel for him so much more.

I was supposed to be staying with my parents during the week but I slept out 3 nights in a row and I didn't want my parents to think I came home just to see a guy, so I told them I was out with friends and that I was sleeping out. The third night in a row, I didn't send my mom a message before I went to sleep and when I woke up I had missed calls from her every hour from 3am to 7am and ""Where are you"" texts galore... I rushed to get home and called my mom on the way and she had already figured it out and she was livid. ""You are such a fucking liar, if you're going out to see a guy just fucking say it!"" My mom grew up in an old school Catholic family, but she's not religious and doesn't hate gays but she harbors a certain degree of disgust towards them because she assumes everyone is a slut. I already came out to my family and I wouldn't have a problem telling her about a guy, but not someone I'm still getting to know/not dating/sleeping at their house/like 15 years older than me, ya know?! So I got home, had it out with her and came clean, and she asked if I was ashamed of who I was. I told her I wasn't and that I had only lied because last time I talked to her about guys and being gay, she made me feel like she didn't want to be involved and pushed me to not tell her about those kinds of things. She immediately assumed since I was sleeping over that we were screwing, which I said was not the case. She told me the only reason she acts the way she does is because ""it's a hard life when you're gay"" and she is scared for me and afraid I'll be drugged, raped and killed... but in the end it was all good, and honestly, it was good that this happened because I would have ran out of excuses about where I was staying by the end of the week, and after that it was my prerogative whether I slept over at his house or not. Afterwards she asked me all about him and for a picture, and she even dealt with the age difference pretty well.

The last morning was sad, but we both agreed that we had really enjoyed each other's company and wanted to see each other again. I don't think either of us had a longing to try and make a long distance thing work - we had a discussion earlier in the week about enjoying life for fulfilment and that's what I should be pouring my energy into while I was living in Europe and not so much on relationships. I don't want to think too much into it but I felt something strong with him, I just know right now is not the right time. I'm still in Europe for the foreseeable future and have so much to do and see. But I know I'll see him again so I'm not wallowing, though I do miss that sexy mofo. I apologize for length but I didn't want to leave out anything important!"
"Like wtf y'all?


Every time someone posts or comments something legit positive like ""hey my life doesn't suck!"" Or I'm totally cool being out,you mfers swarm them with downvotes. I mean there's a reason the community is so small...you bitches are petty and jealous AF. 

I mean why though? Being salty is the reason you're overly anxious or insecure or self hating or jealous. Why not just be happy for ppl who aren't being shitty ppl? Why has this never dawned on you salty mfers or do you just not care and hate anyways?

Genuinely curious here, use a throwaway if you need to."
