"Today, I grew a pair.


So fellas, I have some good news. 

There is this guy who I have had a crush on for a while. I've seen him on Grindr, Hornet, Tinder and in the hallways at school. Every now and then I would send him a message saying ""hey"" or something along those lines, once I super liked him on Tinder (0/10 would not do again. Very awks when they don't respond). Anyways, all of these messages received no reply. 

Anyways, I was having lunch today and saw him sitting alone. I was with my friend, and we toyed with the idea of me just going up to him and chatting; something which I have never done with a guy before. 

My friend picked up his notebook wrote my name and number on it, and said ""worst thing that can happen is he shrugs you off and you leave your number.""

I don't know why, but having that note in my hand gave me some courage, so I stood up, walked over to him (legs and arms numb, obviously). - I sat down in front of him and blurted out ""Uhhh wanna go for a coffee?"" and faster than I asked the question, he picked up his jacket, said ""yes"" and we stood up. I said, ""Tim Horton's or Starbucks?"" and that was that. 

Long story short, I had two take-aways from this (1) I don't know what that little note with my name and number did, almost like some embarrassment insurance I guess, but it helped me have the balls to actually ask a guy out, in public, for the first time ever. And (2) if I just kept sending weird-ass creepy messages on slimy dating apps, I wouldn't be going skating with a 10/10 guy later this week - go talk to him. That's what normal people do.

"I'm getting a Master of Science...


...That means I get to put ""MaSc"" in my grindr profile, right?"
"Update, Fine. I did it.

I want to start off by saying thank you so much for sharing your advice and opening up to me and this forum with your stories!

I honestly don't know where this 'you are trolling' and 'this is fake' negativity comes from but I promise you I would never use such a delicate subject simply to get some comments online.

The truth is that I am not a person who is very good at confrontation and I am used to forgiving. I do not like to hold grudges. God knows I have committed my fair share of sins and I personally believe in a 'do not throw a stone unless you are not guilt of any crimes' type of philosophy, especially when it comes to someone as near and dear as my friend. 

I love my friend in a way that I imagine blood related brothers care about each other and I have always looked up to him. 
Growing up he was always an inspiration for me and I aspired to do the things he did. The person I am today was greatly shaped after him since I always saw only goodness in him. He was there from me from the time he taught me how to do a tumble for gym class in first grade, the time he stood up for me when I wasn't the most popular kid in middle school to the time I almost risked going after my dreams because of fear. 
Yesterday I was devastated, angry and sad to see my best friend and idol do something like that to me. Reading all of these comments made me realize even more that I wasn't as mad at him for touching me but for the fact that he, my idol, my protector, did something that was not in my best interest. 
I guess it was one of those moments where you are faced with the hard facts that no one is perfect and sometimes it is the people you look up to the most who are the most flawed.
 
Our families are very close, we have this big birthday lunch for his grandmother tomorrow and I did not want this to affect us, our families or the coming events so I agreed to talk to him today; much sooner than I would've liked or was prepared to. 
But it was an amazing talk. He apologized first of all for his inappropriate behavior back then and also for the way he decided to tell me and how he reacted. 
We talked for a while, about so many things and shared so many stories that neither of us had any idea were going on.
It opened up my eyes to see how so many things that I was always admired in him actually came from a place of him having to hide his insecurities for fear of being casted away and/or outed.
It also made me realize so many things within myself and in our relationship that I took for granted or did not appreciate. 

I can genuinely say that I have 100% truthfully and wholeheartedly forgiven him for his wrong doings. I will also try my best to stick to my promise of not letting this incident change our dynamic and friendship. 


To end this, I just want to thank everyone who commented on my post for their opinion, comments and stories. It was truly heartwarming to see that reception. I wish I could've tagged everyone to thank them personally but to everyone who commented on my last post: please know that I appreciate you taking the time to read through my eternal paragraphs and open up to me.

Again, thank you guys for your reception and I admire this community for looking out for their own and also being so welcoming to outsiders. 

I hope I can become part of this group. I see that my experience opened up so many discussions and I would love to see them being treated on this medium; I can learn so much from your different opinions and life perceptions. 

If you have any questions or just simply want to talk, do not hesitate to contact me, I will happily reply.

Yours truly, 

Alex

"Monogamy is not a fantasy /rant


I'm tired of certain gay guys  acting like cheating, fwb, and hookups are the only form of gay romance that actually works out. Using the primal urge of sex to excuse shitty behavior and basically acting like it's impossible to actually be in an monogamous relationship. With the excuse of all gay guys doing it so gay relationships are ""rare"" or doomed to fail. 
      
This is not saying that everyone one is meant for a monogamous relationship, or that just hooking up is bad. I'm talking about guys who date, act like shit and use it as a cope out to be abusive. 

Edit: People cheat using hookups and FWBs. I don't care about people who do those things outside of a relationship, or even those who do it in an open relationship as long as one is being hurt. If honestly think a healthy open relationship = cheating culture, yikes.

"I finally achieved a hands-free prostate orgasm!


Thanks to my butt-bouncing abilities on my six inch stick-it-on-my-bedroom-wall meat stick from Amazon, I did to myself what none of my past sexual partners could have done to me, so suck on that! 

This is an outstanding achievement for me and I have never been so proud of playing around with my own body and really getting to know it better. "
"I think I just outed myself in the worst way possible.


I'm 18 and still live with parents. I was at home, alone for a while so I just brought over my boyfriend to have some fun. He's a bit bigger than me, more of just like, more muscle than I have so don't really *want* to come out with that image.

Anyway, basically I start blowing him and since we live in a fairly large house you can't really hear a car come in. So midway thru my mom just opens my door which I stupidly forgot to lock while I'm sucking my boyfriend's dick.

She didnt really say anything, just closed the door and went away, now I am *really* fucking insecure right now. I never really wanted to come out and of course fucking karma wills it that I get outed the worst way possible. I feel really ashamed too, just cant get it out of my head. It's really messing me up.

My mom isn't homophobic or anything but I just feel so vurnerable now. Just a non-stop really depressing shame.

Fuck. Any advice?

"Straight Guy Here: Inappropriate Touching


Hello!

My name is Alex and I am 22 years old. I am straight but I needed advice on how to deal with a situation with my gay friend. I googled 'Ask Gays Group' and this is the first page that showed up. 

My best friend is gay. We have been best friends since we were born, neither of us have any siblings so he is a brother to me. 
We were both on the swimming team throughout school, were popular, had girlfriends and all of the sudden, at 19, he came out to me.
I came as a total shock to me because it never occurred to me but I genuinely could not care less and our relationship has stayed the same. 

We both moved to different cities for college but we still keep in touch every day and talk on the phone at least once a week. 

It was his grandmother's 90th birthday so we both flew home for her party on Saturday and today he was over and he is very affectioned with me and has always been and it has never bothered me. 

We were watching TV and he snuggled up with me and I let him and everything was cool until he confessed to me that when we were around 15/16 he used to touch me while I was sleeping. 

We went away a few times for swimming competitions and we used to always share a room and sometimes even a bed. He told me he used to wait until I was asleep so that he could see me get an erection and would feel me up as I was sleeping. 
He was laughing and telling it as a ""we used to do something stupid shit growing up"" story but it really freaked me out. 
It is creepy and I feel violated. 

I told him that and he got all defensive and told me this was normal and that a lot of gays used to do that when they were younger. 

I got really mad and told him to leave and now I feel conflicted. 

I don't want to hurt my friend and I do understand how complicated figuring his sexuality was for him and everyone but in my eyes this is not ok and not justifiable. 

I don't want to make a big deal out of this so I don't really know how to handle this. 

Can you guys please help me figure this out?"

"I'm coming out tomorrow!


So I coming out to my family tomorrow, I have finally plucked up the courage to do so.
I can't wait to tell them, for them to see how happy I am.
For me to talk to my mother about how the dates have being going with my special ( very supportive) someone.
Tomorrow is going to be a very happy day. "
