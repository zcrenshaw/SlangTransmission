"Found my high school teacher on scruff


So after after almost a year of not having any gay social apps I downloaded scruff yesterday, havent really looked much until I got home from work a half hour ago and while looking at the guys near me I found my English teacher from Sophomore year. He was one of my favorite teachers ever and I had a HUGE crush on him, He was fit, smart, scruffy, and absolutely fucking gorgeous. And now im freaking out so bad I want to message him but im not sure i should. "
"Advice - Wife denying the obvious


We have two sons, and the older one is definitely gay but the wife refuses to see it. She grew up in a very conservative household and doesn't want to think it could be true. 

He brought up dating today and when my wife asked who the lucky girl he was crushing on, you could read his body and see his uncomfortableness. I quickly switched to who is the lucky ""person"", and he started saying someone in his class at school. He didn't drop gender, neither did I, but mom is convinced it's a girl. 

Until he's ready to say it himself, what advice do you have for me to help my wife see what is there?

Edit: THANK YOU so much for everyone who contributed to this question. I learned many valuable things that will allow me to go forward in a safe, loving, fashion. "

"Update on the situation with my son that I kicked out at 16.


Someone [x-posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4jdi6j/what_would_you_say_to_this_father_who_kicked_his/) my post from /r/relationships a few weeks ago and it was very interesting to read your comments even though it got my post removed and I thought maybe you'd like to read the update as well.

I just wanted to give you guys an update and also thank you for all the great advice and insight. It was really tough to read some of the more angry comments but I understand why some of you where angry with me. What I did was horrible and unforgivable so I was expecting a few angry comments. 

What did bother me a little bit though was everyone who was saying that I only wanted to apologize to my son out of selfish reasons and wanted to guilt him into being in my life again. It worried me that that was the impression I was giving some of you because that's not what I wanted at all. I love my son and I just felt like he deserved an apology and a chance at having a relationship with his siblings and that if he wanted me back in his life I'm here now, even though I should've always been there for him. I wasn't expecting him to want to have contact with me again but I wanted him to know it was an option if that's what he wanted.

I invited my kids over for dinner the day after I posted here and they all came and I sat them down and told them the truth. It was a very painful conversation for all of us and lots of tears but I was happy that the truth was finally out. They all wanted to send him letters as well and we decided to send them together with all our contact information. 

I don't know how to explain the feeling I had after we sent them. It was a mix of a lot of emotions and then waiting to see if he would reply to any of the letters was also weird mix of emotions. I didn't really know what to expect but couldn't help but hope that he would at least reply to one of us. 

Our family try to eat dinner together every Sunday, it's an old habit. Everyone can't always make it but the Sunday after sending the letters we were all together. No one had heard from him yet which wasn't really surprising. We talked about how he probably needed time to process everything. I must be very bizarre and overwhelming to suddenly get an envelope full of letters from your estranged family. The doorbell rang while we were eating dinner and my oldest daughter answered it, when she came back we were extremely shocked to see that the person at the door was my son. I can't help but cry while I'm writing this because it was just so emotional to see him standing there in front of me. Everyone got up to hug him but I wasn't sure what to do so I just sort of stood there with tears in my eyes. When his siblings let him go he looked at me and I was half expecting to yell at me and half expecting him to punch me but he just walked over and gave me a hug. I completely broke down and he started to cry too. We all stood there crying for a minute before we finally were ready to actually talk. And we all talked for hours. There's no words to describe how it felt to see my son after all these years and hear him talk. I could listen to him talk all day. 

He said he couldn't figure out what to write in a letter or what to say in a phone call so he just got in his car and drove here. It was really unexpected but really wonderful. He told us about his life from the day he left and it was very difficult to hear what he'd been through because of me, but I needed to hear it. Apparently his aunt, my sister, had been in contact with him after he left, and she told him about his mom dying and she sent him money now and then. He's been through a lot but he's doing really well now. After sitting and talking for a couple of hours we went outside to talk just him and me and long story short, he forgives me. He said that it'll take a long time for him to really trust me again, but that he's been angry with me for years and he's tired of it and ready to start building a relationship again. 

He left about an hour after our conversation and we all exchanged phone numbers and his siblings added him on all their social media stuff. He lives about an hour and a half away but he said he'll let us know when he got time for another Sunday dinner. He's sent me a couple of texts since then and I couldn't be happier than I am right now. I know I don't deserve to be forgiven and I don't deserve to have a relationship with my son, but I would be lying if I said that I din't have a small hope that it would happen. I know that I have to be extremely respectful towards his wishes and let him take the lead with all this. I told him to let me know if he felt like we were being to pushy and that he's the boss of this whole situation. We all want to go at the pace he feels comfortable at and he's always welcome here whenever he feels like it.

So yeah, I'm extremely excited for the future and also incredibly grateful for all the advice you guys gave me. You really gave me the push I needed to tell my kids and send that letter, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you. "

"Update - I'm very effeminate. My husband's buddies treat me as ""one of the girls"". Is it normal?


Hey everyone. I want to thank everyone at /r/askgaybros for helping me out. In case you missed it: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4l2499/im_very_effeminate_my_husbands_buddies_treat_me/

I figured I owe you guys an update. So I talked to my husband about the whole thing and yeah some of you were right. The issue wasn't really me at all. They guys have been treating their ""guy times"" as a sanctuary from the SOs, a time to relax and let go and well someone who is himself an SO there who is best buddies with all their SOs, well, it's not very pleasant to have someone like me around. Even though they knew I would keep anything they might say between the guys, they'd rather not say anything. So naturally I felt unwelcome and uncomfortable but there wasn't much to it.

He also told me that he prefers that I hang out with the girls and he thinks that's awesome because a guy hanging out with other guys, that's everyday life but when a guy is welcomed by the girls it just shows how trustworthy he is that girls are happy to have him around even when they're exposed or vulnerable. He said even his own sisters are more comfortable around me than him (haha he's right about that). I don't know if he just said these things to make me feel better or if it actually makes any sense but it did make me feel better. He knows how to do that.

And about his friend who made that unpleasant comment to me. Well I realized that he has already talked to him about it without me knowing. He reminded him that it was out of line and its perceived as sexist and homophonic even if he hadn't intended it that way. He came over and apologized to me the day after me and husband had this conversation and told me that it was out of ignorance and a little jelousy (that I get along well with girls, who could have guessed), and he won't do that again.

We're also going to change our social plans. We're gonna have more couple's time with his best friend and his gf now, only four of us. So it will be all four of us spending time together rather than splitting among genders.

But yeah, when we hang out with his buddies, we're just going to do what we've been doing. I'm gonna hang out with the girls. It's not like they're bad. In fact they're awesome, so are guys. I can have the best of both worlds.

Thank you all again /r/askgaybros.

"Holy shit, this guy's crazy. Blocked and ignored, was that right?


For the first time I completely blocked another gaybro. Went out on a few dates, they went alright. Last Friday I was very tired, long day at work and I had a headache. The guy I was seeing texted me all day at work hounding me about when I'm going to get off. I just responded once saying I'm working and have no time to talk.

I get home, rather late. He's still texting me. I told him I'm tired and going to bed because I have a long Saturday ahead of me. Saturday's my birthday and I had plans to do a color run and some other things, like the Mystic Faire. I fell asleep around nine PM, a bit early to me. I was completely exhausted. I barely slept all week. Wallet got stolen, wisdom teeth recently removed, etc. 

He called me 4 times, at the time I didn't realize it was him. I was groggy, cranky, and tired as hell. I answer the phone and shouted ""Whoever the fuck this is, let me sleep."" Nope. That didn't work. He called again. I texted him to let me sleep, I'm tired and can't focus. He called again... An additional 8 times over the next few hours. I silenced my phone so I could sleep.

When I finally wake up in the morning, after sleeping for nearly twelve hours, I have 13 missed calls from him. I have about 40 text messages of him attacking me, saying he doesn't want to see me anymore, etc. In this manner:

* I can't believe you're ignoring your boyfriend.
* Babe, I'm worried you need to answer.
* Babbbbbe, pick up the phone.
* Why are you ignoring me?
* What did I do?
* Oh you're sleeping?
* Okay I'll leave you alone.
* Babe! I need to talk to you! 
* You're not answering me, I don't want to see you anymore. :(
* I can't believe this! I hate you!
* Pick up!
* omg what did I do?
* i will find you
* where are you?
* come on! pick up!
* help! I need help!
* Okies I lied, I don't need help but I just wanted to talk to you.
* Happy birthday!!! 
* Are you still sleeping?
* wake up!
* Why aren't you answering me? I hate this. You can't sleep you need to be here! 
* omg we're over we are so over! I've been trying to talk to you for a few hours and you are not even answering! You are ignoring me! Don't ever talk to me again.
* I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
* Babe?
* Babe, I'm sorry okay.
* Oh I forgot you don't like being called babe.
* But I like you, you're my baby.
* Answer me!
* Wake up.
* Are you still sleeping? 

They went on and on. He ""broke up"" with me about four times as well. Thirteen missed calls, five voice messages I haven't listened to at all yet, forty something texts. I just don't know. 

It's been about a week now, he's suddenly started following me on my instagram and keeps sending me apologies. I'm ignoring him still and I blocked him after sending him a message that only stated ""If that is how you feel, then we're over. I need my sleep. I have a busy life, you needed to respect that."" That's the last thing I ever said to him.

I felt like a dodged a bullet here. But, I feel bad for him. But, god damn. He felt crazy psycho to me. I felt so extremely uncomfortable. "
