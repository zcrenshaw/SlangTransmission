"My Grindr hookup took off his condom without asking me. WTF is wrong with people?


I'm 19 and last night I hooked up with some guy on Grindr.  I'm a bottom and before we even met in person I said I would only do safe sex (with him using a condom).  He said that was fine.  So he comes over to my house and we kissed, did oral, etc.  Then for anal I handed him a condom, he put it on, and I turn around for doggy (I'm bottoming).  When he finishes I see the condom is on the bed with no cum in it.  So I said ""why did you take it off"" and he said that bareback feels better and that it's fine because he was recently tested for STDs.  Is it right that I'm really pissed off? I don't think you should do that without telling the other person.  Now even though he said he was tested recently I'm worried that he may have had an STD he didn't know about.  And of course he blocked me on Grindr within minutes of leaving my house.  What an asshole.

Edit: Some people are saying to get PEP.  I just googled it, but how can I get it without my parents finding out? They're going to think I'm an idiot if I tell them this happened and it would be so awkward.

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice guys.  I told my parents what happened and they were understanding/supportive.  I also went to the ER for PEP, which makes me feel a bit less nervous about HIV.  I think I'm pretty much done with hooking up after this because I feel violated/disgusted with myself. Instead I'll look for a boyfriend who would actually care about me and wouldn't do shit like this."
"Choose Life Part Two


It is early morning on Monday, and I made it through the surgery, and I am now home.  They cleared out all the scar tissue from the previous botched surgery, and repaired the stomach.  Now comes a course of liquid diet and physical therapy.  In a year or so they go back in and put a mesh around the reconstructed abdomen.  

The surgeons are calling the procedure a ""slam dunk"", and were high fiving each other.  The nurses and technicians went on and on about how the surgery came off ""sheer artistry"".  The fact that I am back home four days latter, and off the pain killers speaks for itself.  They really didn't expect a white haired old coot like me to make it through, but I came up all sevens.

Just wanted to give an update, and to thank all of you who sent warm messages and prayers.  They were very much appreciated.  "
"For those thinking trump is going to bring a new wave of republican LGBT acceptance...


He's one guy. Let's assume he likes gay people. Let's just assume. The vast majority (I'm betting) of the elected officials of his party are not shy about saying how much they don't like us. 

The platform says several anti gay things, and you can read them at your own leisure. I just want to point one thing out before I go to sleep: when they were constructing the platform, some log cabin republicans tried to insert some language that would call for the condemnation of terrorist groups for killing gay people. [They voted it down.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/13/politics/gop-platform-lgbt-social-conservatives-rift/) This party does not like you or I. It hates gay people. It does not reflect it's own growing electorate of lgbt supporters or people who are indifferent to us. It's still playing to your evangelical Christian grandmother who's 84 and misses the days of segregation.  Until they recognize that times, they are a changing (bob dylan) they will continue to lose voters, not just on this issue either.

If you want to vote conservative, be my guest. Vote for Johnson. Help him get in the debates.

Just don't piss down my back and try to tell me it's raining by trying to equate Donald Trump saying a few positive or indifferent things about lgbt people as a new spring of acceptance by a party who's elected representatives and establishment have done, and continue to do, everything in their power to oppose our quest for equality."
"Finished my first day at the gym... and it honestly was not that bad (my fellow twink/big-boned bros, don't let your dreams stay dreams!)


So as I'm typing this, my skinny, twig-like arms are tired AF (I'm struggling to pick up my coffee as I'm typing this on my phone lol), and I walked out like I just took a 12-inch dick after doing leg stuff on my first day. But overall, the experience was not that bad. I originally planned to go w/ my brother so he could help me out, but he was busy w/ his summer job. So I decided to go by myself instead of waiting on him to come back who knows when. Anyways, when I got there, holy shit was I so fucking overwhelmed. I couldn't even think about all the huge biceps and butts I saw. All I could think about was ""Omg, let's try to blend in as much as possible and not look like a complete casual."" But who was I kidding, most of the people that went there were regulars, so they would instantly know that this was my first time since IT was my first time.

But after walking around the whole gym at least 3 times pretending I was looking for a friend, the right machine, or weights, I just told myself ""Alright Chris, you little shit. Just pick a fucking machine and do something. You payed $208 for this shit."" So I went to some resistance machines, did a couple of sets, and eventually went to the leg press machine and proceeded to kill my legs. 

Moral of my story: As intimidating as the gym seems and sounds, like the title of this post says, it's not that bad! After pacing around for like 10 minutes, I realized people don't really give a fuck. Sure they might recognize that you're new and judge you a little bit, but for the most part everyone is super into what they're doing. Their main focus is on that 350 lb stacked barbell that they're trying to lift so you're probably the last thing on their minds. Working out also feels pretty nice! So get your lazy butts and start working out already if you want to, but are too lazy or intimidated.

Tl;dr: Skinny 17 year old Asian kid finally goes to the gym and despite all the menacing testosterone, comes out alive."
"is gay porn getting worse?


is it just me or watching porn these days isn't as exciting as it used to be?

4/5 of gay porn i watch has the word 'straight' in it. i hate how it is gay porn but they overemphasize how the actors are so straight they doing it for the money. and during the interview, smh, i don't give a fuck what kind of girl those porn actors attracted to, this is gay porn, this is the place where you suck dick or fuck a dude, not talking about pussy. i don't know about you, but when the guys say that they're straight, i lost my mood. the guys are hot, i agree, but i'm not watching a semi doing anal with fake moans.

gay-for-pay is so overplayed as if all gay guys fantasize fucking straight guys. i just want to watch porn where the guys are into it, which something that is hard to find. to me, personally, gay-for-pay ruins gay porn."
"When someone uses the term ""gay agenda"", I instantly know he or she is homophobic


Just like the person who says ""I haven't got problems with the gay community BUT; I'm not homophobic BUT; I have gay friends BUT"". When you use the BUT word then you instantly negate yourself. There is a difference between criticizing flaws within the gay community, which there are, as opposed to criticize an entire community based on prejudice. Like saying there are too many gays on TV which isn't even factual and have they even seen how many gays exist in mainstream cinema? The whole ""Sulu is gay"" thing has created a major brouhaha leading to the whole ""Oh, it's the gay agenda"". Just that is enough to create a storm. 

What is a gay agenda? Never understood it. I've been hearing about this agenda since I was 8 and I'm pretty old. "
"I came out to my wife


I came out to my wife a few weeks ago.

We have two children, a five-year-old and a baby. I'm in my thirties. Without a lot of detail, I've dealt with twenty years of denial, repression, and distracting myself with other unhealthy  behavior. Over the last year, I've been working really hard on that stuff, and as I worked on it, I realized that I am gay and me denying that about myself was the cause of a lot of the anger that I was projecting onto others (mostly my wife).

I wasn't really planning on coming out to her when I did. She could tell something was bothering me, so I just blurted it out.

I've never had a sexual experience with a man, and honestly, only limited experience with women. I was married once before in a nearly dead bedroom.

Overall, my wife has been pretty good about it, as in she didn't just kick me out. Actually, she keeps talking about recommitting to each other, having a mixed orientation marriage, etc. She is not interested in an open relationship, however. I just don't see how this can work in the long term, and I think she can tell I feel this way.

She has asked me for a written commitment of where we stand. She wants it today. Last week, my therapist told me not to make any promises I cannot keep, and I think that is sound advice. I just don't know what to tell my wife. No matter what, I want to be financially and emotionally available to my family forever. I've only been willing to call myself gay inside my head for about two months, and this all feels like it is happening so fast.

Also, does anyone out there have any thoughts, advice or kind words for me? Anything I should expect as I venture down this road?

I know I'm a bit of a gay late-bloomer, but I think I should be able to do alright. I'm in good shape, look young for my age, have all my hair, good job, well-educated, well-travelled. How much of an issue will my children and history be when meeting other guys?

Thanks to anyone with something helpful to say."
"Everything happened so fast that I don't know what to feel.


So I'm 18 and a month into college. Last night I went to the English Language Club meeting and there was this senior there whom I hit it off pretty well with. 

He was cute, and funny, and we had chemistry. 

Well, after the club meeting he invited me to hang out -- just me and him. We hung out and when the cafe closed at midnight we went back to his room. He said I should sleep over and I took his offer.  I showered at his place with his towel then I wore his clothes to bed and slept next to him. 

I couldn't actually sleep next to him though, my heart was beating so fast. I was afraid. Anxious. I've never been *that* close to anyone other than my dad, and now I'm suddenly sharing a bed with this guy I just met. 

He then asked me why was my heart beating so fast, so I told him why, then he put his arm around me and comforted me. I said I was insecure, I was afraid he wouldn't like me, but he quickly shoot all my insecurities off as if he knew my soul like the back of his hand. 

He hugged me, held me just right. Our fingers interlocked and I didn't want to let go of his warm hand that night. 

We talked about a lot of stuff; sexuality, insecurities, and whatever else. I asked him whether he had done this with someone else before, he said yes, with a guy. An ex. Later on he went silent, he looked up at the ceiling, and shed tears. I didn't know what to say so I just held him like he did to me before. Then he got up, lit a candle light in a exquisite glass-thingy, and went back to bed.  

I watched the shadows danced as we talked. We talked, and talked, and talked. Hours flew by. He kissed my hands. Put his face an inch from mine. Held my waist. 

While hugging him I felt that he had a hard on, so I let my hands linger down there, touching his rock hard cock. It was warm. I tried to jerk him off but I couldn't so we went to sleep. 

The next day I woke up before him. But when I woke up I felt weird. Like nothing makes sense anymore. How could this happen? How? I just met him. Why me? Why did this guy choose me?

I picked up my clothes and did the walk of shame back to my room. I didn't woke him up, but I sent him some messages explaining that I left early. 

Back in my room I thought, ""What the fuck just happened?"" 

He texted me this morning asking me out to lunch. So we had lunch. I looked at him while he was eating and I thought, ""This is fine. I can like this.""

Until now I can't forget the way he touched he me last night. The way his fingers ran down my thighs. I can't forget how soft his lips were. He tried to kiss me though, but I said I wasn't ready. 

Everything was so surreal.

Wish came true overnight. 

As if he knew how lonely I was. 

It was like he already knew my self and that kinda scares me. 

So what I'm bummed about actually? I don't know, but the feeling is there. Like something is amiss. 

I've always wanted a gay experience and now I got it, but now I'm feeling weird.

 I asked him this a lot last night: ""Is this right?"" 

Well, is all this right? 

I don't know what I'm feeling right now. Scared, scared of intimacy? Nervous? Happy? Disbelief? 

Nothing makes sense anymore. Something is wrong with the stars. "
