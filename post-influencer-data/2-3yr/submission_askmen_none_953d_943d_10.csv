"NO VALENTINE'S DAY GIFT POSTS


We're not Cupid's little helpers, and we're not fucking mind readers either.  

Instead of asking a bunch of random virgin pre-teens on the Internet what they'd want from their fantasy supermodel girlfriend, try thinking about your dude's interests and buying something related to that.  Or go to /r/Gifts if you still want advice.

Cheers,

"One of my friends just got a chain wallet. How do I help him?


I'm around the dude often enough to know he doesn't have any activities that require the chain on his wallet. He attaches the chain to a belt loop, so it is extremely obvious."
"(Nsfw) what is the most vile, gut wrenching, morality splitting ""would you rather"" question you can think of?


I have to ask everybody in my fraternity 3 fucked up questions and i want to ask them things that will really make them reconsider everything they know about being a good person.

Stuff like ""would you rather throw a grenade into a nursery or suck trumps dick on live tv""

Thanks gents.

EDIT: it can be any fucked up question you want. One thing ill be asking every brother is ""you have to fuck one person in the fraternity or everyone dies, who is it and why?"""
"What changes moved you from living paycheck to paycheck to being financially comfortable?

"[Meta] How do you feel about having an Apache helicopter as an option in the gender flairs?


edit: Bruh, some of yous took this way too seriously lmao"
"How do you make your penis taste good (just in case) all day?


Other than washing it, obviously."
"Which videogame was the biggest let-down for you?


"
"What aspects of traditional gender roles do you like?


I'll probably get downvoted for this but I like to pay when we go out, I like to open doors and pull out chairs, I like the idea of being the provider (though with my current gf, I'd be open to being a SAHD). 

There's other stuff but that's fine for now. "
"Men who are successful with online dating HOOKUPS, what does your dialogue look like?


Looks aside because I know that plays some sort of role, what does your conversation look like in general with women to just seal the deal and setup something casual like a hookup?

Also, I know attractiveness is subjective, but for those girls that you do hookup with, how would you rate them 1-10? I have an inclination that the subjectively hotter women don't truly fall for this but I'm here asking this question to get stunned with sheer honesty.

Let's hear it!"

"How to get the name of the girl you already kissed, without letting her know you forgot about her name?


I kissed a girl this morning, I gave her my number and now she is messaging me, but I can't remember her name. How should I ask/get her name without looking that I forgot completely.

edit: Yes, it worked. She just said normally, her name is Gabi."
"People who left social media, how has it improved or negatively affected your life?


I decided about a year back, enough social media. I was sick of basically everything it bought me. Procrastination, the attempt to project a certain image about yourself, reading stories from people I really don't care about at all etc. I know reddit is a form of social media to an extent, but to me its an information sharing platform, not about creating a 'persona' of greatness about yourself.

I must admit, it has been harder than I thought to leave it. It does leave you with an overwhelming sense of loneliness and I think thats a good thing. By reading peoples Facebook or Instagram updates, you get the feeling that you actually know them, that they're part of your life. But when you remove that connection, you feel like you're detached from them. When actually you were detached prior, you never spoke to one another, you just felt that connection due to seeing their social media posts.

I think overall its motivational, as you have to actually text and call your friends to keep up to date. It has helped me do that, instead of reading facebook for an hour of a night I'll try and call a friend and have a genuine interaction. "
"How can I make my girlfriend feel attractive?


I feel like I'm failing my girlfriend. we haven't been having a healthy sex life lately because I lose my erection part way through or we get interrupted. Today she told me she doesn't think I'm attracted to her. What can I do?

Edit: Thank you for all the help and support! I appreciate it. "
"How often do you get told to smile?


As a woman, I seem to hear this quite a lot. Wondering what it's like from your perspective. "
