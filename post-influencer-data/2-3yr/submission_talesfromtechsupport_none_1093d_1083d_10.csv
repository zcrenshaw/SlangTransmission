"""HALP! I'm hosting a conference late at night that I never told anybody about and surprisingly the building is closed!"" / ""are you stupid?""


As some of you will know, I work an out of hours service desk which provides general IT support to a few different businesses out of hours when their normal IT people have gone home. These businesses are often hundreds of miles away and my access to their internal systems is usually anywhere from extremely limited to none existent.

This is a gem of a call that I received and typical of the level of stupidity we have to deal with.

**Me:** Service De--- [interupted]

**Caller:** I can't get into &lt;building&gt; open the door!

**Me:** I'm sorry, you're calling the IT emergency line, I can't open a door for you I'm based in &lt;miles away&gt;

**Caller:** SO YOU CAN'T HELP ME! WHY CAN'T YOU HELP ME?

**Me:** Ma'am this is an IT emergency line for reporting major system failure or general out of hours IT support, as I've said I'm not based on site so can't open a door for you. This was &lt;building&gt; correct?

**Caller:** YES &lt;BUILDING&gt;!

**Me:** Okay, well &lt;building&gt; closes at 9 pm, it's now 11:30 pm. That'll be why it's locked.

**Caller:** BUT I'M HOSTING AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL IN &lt;MEETING ROOM&gt;!

**Me:** Have you arranged this with management?

**Caller:** NO!

**Me:** We'll Ma'am if there's no prior arrangement with management &lt;building&gt; will have been locked down by security as normal as nobody knew you wanted to use &lt;meeting room in building&gt; out of hours.

**Caller:** WHY WONT YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR ARE YOU STUPID?

**Me:** I'm not based on site as I've already said multiple times, I'm unable to physically open a door from &lt;miles away&gt; for you. You'll need to speak to your management team for further assistance as this isn't an IT issue and we currently have another caller waiting so I'm afraid I'll have to end this call.

**Caller:** HOW DARE YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO HANG UP ON ME. ARE YOU STUPID? I'M REPORTING YOU TO &lt;someone I've never heard of&gt;

**Me:** Okay Ma'am, as I've said, this isn't an IT emergency, you're absolutely free to speak to &lt;someone I've never heard of&gt; however I'm ending this call now as it's not IT related and we have other people in the queue who need assistance, goodbye.

**Caller:** YOU FUC---

**Me:** *click*

For those wondering; this particular business has not provided us with any escalation contacts for their security team, if it's not IT related, we're totally free to drop that call and move on - *especially* if we have other callers queuing.

**Edit; wow RIP inbox, this post really blew up! Glad you liked it - Looks like it even featured on TFTS Quote of the Day. Thanks a lot everyone!**"
"I'm losing $1000/hr because I can't get the internet working, you need to fix it NOW.


Howdy, TFTS-ers! Got another one here, from quite a while back. Just got a new mechanical keyboard, so I'm gonna really enjoy typing this long one out.

*In the the post-internet world, wireless based offenses are considered especially heinous. In $ISP, the dedicated detectives that investigate these vicious tickets are members of an elite squad known as the Level 2 WiFi support team.*

&gt;**Greeting**: Plays.  
&gt;**Customer (CX)**: ""MY INTERNET...""  
&gt;**Me**: *Turns down phone volume.*  
&gt;**CX**:""...ISN'T WORKING AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH $ISP SINCE I STARTED AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT BECAUSE I'M LOSING $1000/HR BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be more than happy to take a look at what's happening and hopefully get the issue resolved. What's the internet doing at the moment?""  
&gt;**CX**: ""IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING. YOU NEED TO FIX IT AND I'M ALREADY FILING A LAWSUIT AGAINST $ISP BECAUSE OF S*** LIKE THIS, AND I'M SCHEDULED TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS TO TESTIFY AGAINST YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE THEY'RE STARTING TO DO AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO WHY THIS COMPANY IS TREATING ME AND OTHER CUSTOMERS THIS WAY.""  
&gt;*Oh.* ***GOODIE.***  
&gt;**Me**: ""I apologize, and I myself have nothing really to do with corporate issues, but like I said I'll be more than hap...""  
&gt;**CX**: ""AND I NEED MY INTERNET TO WORK BECAUSE I'M RESEARCHING FOR A BOOK DEAL WITH $ONLINE_RETAILER_THAT_HAS_EVERYTHING_FROM_A_TO_Z AND I'M ON A DEADLINE AND I WILL BE ON THE BILL MAHER SHOW AND I WILL TELL THEM WHAT A TERRIBLE COMPANY THIS COMPANY IS.""  
&gt;**Internal Monologue**: *I'm not a particularly religious person, but if there is a God they specifically granted me this amazing bucket of crazy to help me through life, as an example for the future, to say ""At least I'm not* ***that*** *insane.""*  
&gt;**Me**: ""I understand, ma'am. To take a closer look at the modem and see what's going on, is it alright if I verify your account so I can pull it up?""  
&gt;*Gets through verification process without any issues.*  
&gt;**Me**: ""OK, looking here, I do see that the modem is online at the moment, and looking further it would appear that something is currently connected to it. What is it that's happening when you try to use the internet? Are you getting any error messages, or is the computer sayi...""  
&gt;**CX**: ""I TOLD YOU IT'S NOT WORKING AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT. SEND A TECHNICIAN NOW AND FIX IT OR I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FTC. YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!? I ***MADE*** BILL CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN WHEN HE WAS FIRST ELECTED, AND I HAVE A LUNCH-DATE WITH HILLARY AND BILL NEXT MONDAY AND YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO COME UP.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Well, I'm more than happy to do that, but to send someone out I want to let them know what they should be coming to fix. If it's a problem with the computer itself, I may be able to help but the technician would just check the signal coming to the modem and...""   
&gt;**CX**: ""SO ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU WON'T SCHEDULE A TECHNICIAN? I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH $ISP FOR 15 HOURS OVER THE LAST 3 DAYS AND I EXPECT TO BE COMPENSATED AT MY CONSULTANT RATE OF $1000/HR. I ALSO EXPECT TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THE MINUTES I SPENT ON MY PHONE. I HAD TO SELL LOTION FROM MY CAR IN THE PARKING LOT FOR THESE MINUTES, AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THEM. I'M ALSO BEING VERY RUDE TO A CLIENT INSIDE OF THE SHOW ROOM I'M HOSTING, AND POTENTIALLY LOSING A SALE BECAUSE OF THAT AT THIS POINT, SO I EXPECT TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THAT AS WELL.""

&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
&gt;**Me**: ""Yes ma'am, I understand. I'm not in a billing department myself, so I'm unable to do anything regarding the bill or any potential credits that may be assessed, but I can and will do my best to fix your issue. Just to be sure, are you at home now?""  
&gt;**CX**: ""NO. AND I'M BEING VERY RUDE TO A CLIENT RIGHT NOW BUT I NEED TO GET THE INTERNET FIXED.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Yes, ma'am. To start out, can you describe the issue that you're having so I can let the technician know what to fix?""

And that, ladies, gentlemen, kids of all ages, is the most amazing single thing I've ever experienced in my entire life. Looking back at her ticket history, figuratively every single ticket said basically the same thing mine ended up saying, along the lines of:  
&gt;""$CX called in, complaining of internet issue. Refused to troubleshoot, hung up after threatening to sue.""
