"Can anyone recommend any weird stuff to do?


Sorry that I can't be more specific, but I have a friend visiting and he asked me to take him to some 'weird' places. 

A few things I've done here that I'd consider weird, albeit limited: a drag show (sorry - I hope my description does not offend anyone, I loved it though). Mckittrick hotel, the hologram museum (well, kinda weird), house of yes.

So yeah I'm mostly after just after weird experiences, weird stores, any bars with weird decor/weird performances (like bizarre bushwick), weird performance art. Anything surreal, surreal art galleries. Anything. 

Thanks!"
