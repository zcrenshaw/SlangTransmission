"I'm visiting NYC next week. What are some good locations to find unattended pots of gold?


Thanks in advance."
"What are you assholes thankful for?


Personally, I'm thankful that we finally have a fucking active mod (who is doing some saintly shit dealing with this place), that I didn't get caught in my neighborhood's subway shitshow yesterday, and that you motherfuckers, the rubes, and the occasional legit questions keep me entertained on slow work days. 

In light of how fucked 2016 has been, what shit are you guys actually thankful for?"
