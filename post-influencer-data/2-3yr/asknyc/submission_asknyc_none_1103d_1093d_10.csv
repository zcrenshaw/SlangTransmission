"Which strip club has the best all-you-can eat buffet?


Or best food menu in general. Cheap and delicious."
"How do orthodox Jews survive this heat?


I'm curious because the other day I had to wait for 25 minutes for the D at Broadway Lafayette which was the temperature I imagine hell to be. The humidity was insane and sweat is pouring down my face, my back, my arms and my legs. Everyone around is starting to lose their shit and I turn round and there's this orthodox Jewish guy in a think, full length black coat. Thick brimmed hat, waistcoat, dress shirt and trousers. It made me 10x hotter just looking at him, but he seemed OK. 

It struck me as a pretty dangerous outfit to wear in this heat as you could pass out anywhere, but are they just used to it now or is Summer the most miserable time of the year for them?"
"Was stalked last night while walking home - how would you handle this situation?


Last night was the first time I ever felt actually unsafe in New York. Was probably not a big deal, but wanted to get your ideas on how to handle situations like this in case it happens in the future. I feel like I got somewhat lucky.

My girlfriend lives in central Harlem, in the upper 130s. I'm coming over quite late, around 2AM. I park on Striver's Row, probably the most affluent and leafy block in Harlem, a block away from my girlfriend's place. As I'm parking, I notice three guys, young, black, wearing white tanktops and blue bandanas across the street. They start walking off. While trying not to flagrantly profile (""black men = danger!""), I wait in my car for a minute to see they've gone. I get my backpack out of the trunk, and start walking towards my girlfriend's. 

As I'm crossing 8th avenue, I notice that north, across the crosswalk, on the south east section of the block, the same three guys are sitting on the trunk of some car, kinda eying me down. Again, I'm not trying to profile, but at this point there's something a bit weird. Why the hell are they in this quiet part of Harlem just chilling in the middle of the night doing absolutely nothing (no drinking, no smoking, no interaction with one another, just sitting and staring). 

Anyhow, as I'm crossing the block I peek behind myself and notice that they're following me. But in a staggered fashion. One in the front, another a bit behind, and another even further behind. My girlfriend's home is in the middle of the street, but they're getting pretty close, and I worry that at this point if I run in they're going to try and follow me in and I don't want them to know which house I'm in and have access to my keys and so on. 

There's a white guy (gentrifier looking) walking three big dogs in the middle of the street. I approach him because at this point my instincts are telling me to approach anyone to tell them I'm being followed. He darts off. I take a right at the end of the block, having passed my girlfriend's place, and at this point I see that they're still following me. I pretty much have confirmation that something is about to happen. In my backpack there's a Macbook, an iPhone, and it seems like a mugging (or worse) is about to happen.

I start to run around the block and dip under into a random house's understoop area. I'm pretty much shitting myself at this point. I peek out from the understoop and see two of the guys staring straight down looking for where I've went. Right at this moment, I see a Hispanic looking Harlemite dude walking past me in the direction of the guys. He looks at me and keeps walking - its clear that he's not interested in me. At this point I jump out of the stoop, start walking with him, and say ""look these guys in front are stalking me can I walk with you,"" he says ""no problem bro, you better call the cops."" We walk directly by these guys, who look somewhat pissed that I'm walking with this guy. They try to stop him ""yo yo.. yo come here bro."" He ignores them, tells them ""nah"" while they continue to try and communicate with him while we're walking away.

I'm on the phone with the cops at this point, who are being somewhat useless (""you need to stand still on the block so we can come to you!"" and I'm saying ""I don't want to stand still as I feel unsafe"") but luckily a cop car drives by. I explain the situation. While they can't drive me home (some policy), they turn their lights on while driving by my side as I walk home. They say there's been a lot of muggings lately. 

Now its hard to completely plan against these situations in the future, however I want to think of what I did wrong or what I should do in the future.

- I think I was right not to run into the home while they were close behind me. 

- I think I probably should have called the cops almost straight away and overblown the situation so they came quick (""looked like they might have a gun I'm not sure"") **EDIT: This was a close friend's suggestion that I talked to, clearly a bad idea. Funnily enough we're both minorities so the whole 'don't be the paranoid white guy' doesn't really apply here. Ignore this anyway.**

- I was very lucky that there were a couple other people out on what is a very dead and quiet area at that time in the morning. Without those people, I could've been fucked.
