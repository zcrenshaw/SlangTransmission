"Apple-obsessed Idiot Seeks Kindred Spirits for Ridiculous Apple-Picking Field Trip


Since my brother skipped town and moved to Cali (jerk) I lost my ride to apple-picking. Last year I tried just going to farmer's markets for my fix, but the quality and freshness was extremely variable and while I love apples to a somewhat unholy degree I am also very, very picky about what I'll pay a premium price for. If I can put a dent in your apple, its not fresh and I'm not going to buy it. at least 50% of the ""just picked"" apples at union square are definitely stored from last year. Long story short, I need my ultra-fresh apples. NEED.

I found [this list](http://offmetro.com/ny/2009/09/16/apple-orchards-near-nyc/) of U-pick orchards which are more or less accessible by public transit.  I'm leaning towards Jenkins-Leukin farm or Meadowbrook farm, because they are further away from NYC (less screaming kids) and offer more varieties. 

For those of you who have never picked apples, it takes like an hour at most and truthfully is not that entertaining. So this trip will involve like 3 hours of travel and will culminate in carrying 25 lb of apples home in a backpack. 

So clearly, it's a stupid plan.  Anyone else interested? "
