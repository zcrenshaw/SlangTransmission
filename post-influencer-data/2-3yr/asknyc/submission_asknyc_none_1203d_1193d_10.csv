"Bars That Don't Blast Music?


Hey,

So I've been looking for a low key quiet bar where I could go read a book, or just sit quietly without music playing at 11. Light jazz is fine. I just can't find any old school quiet bars. Anyone have any favorites?"
"CitiBikers, was the membership worth it?


I spent this weekend trying citibike for the first time. I bought a three day membership and had a great time.

I'm contemplating buying a membership for the summer/fall season but the increase of 100 to 155 has me a little reluctant.

I'm not sure if it's worth it. 
I know I have to decide personally, if it's worth it. But I thought I would hear from you guys first.
