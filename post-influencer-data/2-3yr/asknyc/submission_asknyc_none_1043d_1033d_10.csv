"So everyone felt that weird sort of vibe in the city today. Right?


It's no lie Hillary dominated this city in the vote. So likely the majority of people you saw voted for her. Obviously not on SI but you get it. 

Even on the subway everyone just felt out of it. Same with at work.

Or was it just me"
"What can I do to survive if someone pushes me onto the subway tracks?


If someone pushes me onto the subways tracks, is there anything I can do to try and save myself?

I don't feel safe on the subway today :(

Edit: Thanks everyone, you helped calm my fears."
