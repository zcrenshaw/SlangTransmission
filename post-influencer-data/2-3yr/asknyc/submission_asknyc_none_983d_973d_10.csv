"An NYC bucket list for a departing life-long New Yorker?


My boyfriend and I are planning on moving out in early 2018, and I've been putting together a list of things to do before we leave the city. We're both life-long natives so we have been around and done a lot, but I want to cover the bases now that I haven't done before. Here's an example of what I have so far:    
    
Staten Island food tour (try all the top rated food on the island)      
Try the best fried chicken in the city (RIP Chicken Masters)       
Hike in the Arden Woods    
Ippudo ramen    
Try steakhouses other than Luger's       
Visit Flushing       

So tl;dr: **if you were leaving NYC in the next year, what are some things you'd wanna do before you left?**"
"It's a long shot, but I gotta try...


Hello everyone, my friend and her (now) fianc√© got engaged on New Years Eve on the Brooklyn Bridge just minutes past midnight. They're from Spain and were there on holidays. Is it possible that any of you has seen it and taken a photo of it? If you have, I'd be forever in your debt if you could send it to me so I can surprise my friend with a memory of such an important moment for her. If nobody has, oh, well... then thanks for taking the time to read this anyway :)"
"Is Peter Luger ""worth it""?


It's cash only and some people have told me it isn't. I went to Keen's last night and it was phenomenal. Am I really missing out not hoofin' it over to Peter Luger's at some point?

PS post your favorite steakhouses here, thanks in advance"
