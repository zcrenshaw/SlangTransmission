"Hey NYC residents, despite living in the city, are there hotels in the city you visit for their offerings/attractions (dining, bars, whatever-amenities)?


As someone who lives in NYC, I've personally never thought to step foot inside any hotels in the city for any particular reason (outside of maybe the occasional work event hosted in a hotel ballrooms or whatever). 

With that said, can you guys think of any bars, restaurants, pools(?) and/or whatever cool attractions that stand out in your mind and can only be found inside of hotels in the city? 

(I mentioned pools above; I know most of the especially cool amenities like that are restricted to hotel-guests, but I also know some places are lax with regard to enforcing their policies.) Just figured it was worth asking; thanks!"
"can we get a stickied ""is it safe"" thread?


and all it has in it is **yes**. i swear every week there are 2 or 3 posts with people afraid to walk the street in clinton hill or some place like that. or maybe we should start saying no it's not safe and you should just stay inside all day."
