"New Yorkers, where have you met your friends?


I'm sure this question has been asked many times- but I've feel like I've searched and searched and never seen any really good advice on how to meet new people in NYC when you're feeling stagnant- other than to use meetup, which hasn't worked well for me.

Basically, I'm curious where you all have met your closest friends in NYC??

I personally have some great friends here- and love the shit out of them- but generally we do the same thing every time we see each other (which is drink too much, go to bars, and end up crawling to bed at 4am.) Don't get me wrong, I LOVE doing this, and have fun- but I'm looking to expand my friend network, particularly now that I'm a woman in my early thirties and friends are starting to drop off into the world of marriage and kids (which is my worst nightmare for my own life, so not what I'm looking for.)

I've been trying for awhile to meet people but it never seems quite right. I'm outdoorsy, nerdy, tattooed and generally a giant trash talker- and I keep meeting people that seem a shade (or two) too proper for me- particularly through my efforts on Meetup.

So, yeah, how did YOU find your people? I'm hoping that by learning what other people have done, I can figure my shit out.

Thank you!

"Planning a ""hiking Manhattan"" trip - looking for advice, tips, and things I may not have considered


My college-age daughter has always wanted to see Manhattan, and I had the idea that walking the city over several days would be an interesting way to see a good chunk of it, including the nooks and crannies that would be missed if traveling by taxi or subway.    

The bones of the plan are to take a train into Penn Station (we live in another state), each with a small hiking backpack with clothes and basics and no other luggage. We plan on staying 2-4 nights, sleeping in hotels at night and eating out along the way.    


I want to plan out a route that will allow us to see a good portion of Manhattan, walking maybe 10+ miles each day. At the end, we'll just take the train back home. So I have a few questions, and there are some I probably don't even know to ask that I'm hoping you may be able to help me with:    


* Any issue with getting into restaurants, stores, sites, etc. with backpacks? I'm not talking a huge mountain trek pack here, but definitely something bigger than a book bag, maybe 30 liters or less. We don't need to carry tents, sleeping bags, or food, really just clothes and essentials. Will people get the wrong idea about us and refuse service if we travel like this?
* Is it really practical to expect to cover the city walking this way? We could supplement with the subway as needed but would like to avoid cabs. Should we plan a longer trip?
* Is it safe to do this? I would guess there are areas to avoid and we don't want to be walking around with packs at 3AM (I guess) but is wandering around from point A to point B irresponsible? What are the risks?
* What are some things that will definitely happen that I need to think about ahead of time?
* Are there any things that we should check out that we wouldn't really have an opportunity to if we were traveling some other way?
* Is this just an overall bad idea? Starting at point A, hiking and looking around all day on the way to point B, sleep, then on to point C, etc.? Should we consider doing it another way like staying at one hotel the whole time, leaving most of our stuff there and then just venturing out on foot to cover different ground each day?    

Thanks for reading and looking forward to your input. We may write about it depending on how things go."
