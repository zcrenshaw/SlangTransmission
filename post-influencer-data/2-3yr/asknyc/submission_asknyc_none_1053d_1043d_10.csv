"Should I fight a $50 fine for taking up two seats on the train, at 2:30 am?


I was on my way home from work (Brooklyn to Queens via F train) and after working for approximately 15 hours at a restaurant, I sat down on one of those two-person train seats at the end of the train car, placed my backpack behind me for comfort and put my feet up. It was 2 am and I had an hour commute home. There were about 5 other people on the train, 3 of which in similar positions, one person completely sprawled out.

About halfway through my commute, a police officer came on and ordered me off the train. I asked if everything was okay, to which she explained I was taking up two seats and it was a violation of MTA code of conduct, and she was going to have to give me a ticket. I have only been living in NYC for about 4 months, and have never heard this rule before. 
I got a $50 ticket and am wondering whether I should fight it at the court summons or if I am better off just paying it. 
The fact it was 2:30 in the morning and the train was next to empty really frustrates me, but I don't want to waste my time if going to the summons has no chance of getting me off.
Any help/advice would be appreciated, thank you!"

Last week my boyfriend's parents were assaulted as they were getting into a taxi outside of Sparks Steakhouse on East 46th Street and 3rd Avenue. We're looking for any leads. Do you recognize the polo? or his face? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
