"UPDATE: I got a lot of help here for our trip to NYC. Here's some feedback and a bonus video of us on the SI Ferry.


This sub is such a great resource.

I recently returned from a trip to NYC. I used a lot of this subs advice during the trip.  Here are some of the things I learned or visited which I thought were helpful or worth it:

-Staying near the A-B-C or 1-2-3 line in any not-Time Square area. Adds an additional experience of being in New York.  Our weekday 8am trips into Manhattan from Bed-Stuy were along side real New Yorkers doing real NY stuff. Learning to use the system, seeing the variety of stations and train cars, and watching the people was fascinating. It was essentially an extremely low cost ($33 for 7-day pass, I think) and practical form of entertainment.

-Top of the Rock.  This all comes down to preference, but I'm glad I read the post here on how to choose between the 3 skyscrapers (with observation points). Something that I didn't read was that even if you show up at 8am, you my not get tickets to go up at 8am.  Our tickets weren't until 2:30pm.  That kinda threw a wrench into the works.  I'd have reserved ahead if I knew that.

-Ask New Yorkers for help. We were on a subway platform and didn't know which way the train was headed, so we asked a lady.  She quickly helped us and then stepped away.  She took one step and then turned back and asked, ""Are you guys &lt;sneekly looking over her shoulder and back as to not expose us&gt; *tourists*?"" After confirming the obvious, she broke into full guide mode for the remainder of our trip together and gave us advice for our eventual destination.

One of the tips commonly heard here is riding the Staten Island Ferry to get a good look at the Statue of Liberty. Totally great advice. I made a video from our trip: https://youtu.be/kKjXh2DRXiQ

A good book we read to help us prepare for the pace of NYC was this one: https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Tips-Etiquette-Nathan-Pyle/dp/0062303112 It's illustrated and my kids (6&amp;8) enjoyed it.  Especially the part about being Elevator Captain (No hustle?... DOORS TOGETHER!)

Two youtube videos which I thought were helpful are these:

So, thanks for the help everyone! I'd like to leave a tip for everyone else now: ""Bill Brand's Masstransiscope was installed in the abandoned Myrtle Avenue subway station in Brooklyn, New York in September 1980. It consists of 228 hand-painted panels that are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing. It differs from a movie where the film passes through a projector while the audience sits still. For the Masstransiscope, the opposite is true: The images are stationary while the train moves the audience past the images. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. Damaged by vandalism, MTA Arts for Transit restored it in the early '90s and then again recently following vandalism in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Masstransiscope can be seen through the right side windows of the Manhattan-bound B or Q train shortly after leaving the DeKalb Ave. Subway station."" - You have to take the bridge train, not the tunnel train). It goes by fast.  I wanna say it's only like 5-10 seconds or something.
