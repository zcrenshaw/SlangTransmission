"Can someone recommend a meal for around $25 dollars where I'd feel comfortable eating alone at?


I've been having a rough time lately and since my birthday is coming up, I'd like to treat myself to a nice meal. Since I  moved here semi recently and don't have a ton of friends, I'd still like to find a place that I could go to alone and still get a quality meal for around 25 dollars or so (or less, or slightly more, but not more than say 40 dollars). If anyone can recommend a burger, sushi or BBQ spot I could go alone to in that price range, that would be great. If you have a place you love that isn't those types of restauraunts I'd still like to hear it, but I thought I'd narrow it down a bit. I also live far from everywhere so I don't mind traveling anywhere in Manhattan to try, and would also consider Brooklyn or Queens. 

Thanks"
"Orthodox Jewish guys in NYC - what's their message?


So I'm just back from vacation in NY from the UK, when I was there, there were lots of Jewish dudes who had a fruit/vegetable in one hand (looked kind of like a bobbly lemon) and a reed in the other hand.

They would ask you ""are you Jewish"" and when I replied ""no"" (I'm not religious) they would say ""thanks have a nice day"".

My question - if I had said yes what would their message have been to me?"
