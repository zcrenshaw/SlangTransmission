Or am I the only one who feels that way? All the gunk off the sidewalks, buildings, etc. getting washed away in the rain."

"What's the biggest display of douchebaggery you've witnessed in public here?


Sitting on a bus and some guy (finance?) is having a loud conversation on the phone about some important meeting and he""s demanding this and that and how all he cares about is making this 30million dollar deal happen. There's a cute girl across the aisle and I can't help but think he's trying to impress. Anyways, give up your best douchebaggery story so we can all have a laugh on this brutally sweltering Monday. 

Stay hydrated folks! "
