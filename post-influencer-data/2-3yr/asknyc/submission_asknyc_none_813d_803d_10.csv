"Thank you!


Thanks r/AskNYC. I'd been lurking on your sub for awhile prior to my trip out there this past weekend.  The sidebar is awesome with great information and the tips are so useful, especially in planning and maximizing time during a trip.  My family and I had a great time and I appreciate the effort and sincere responses to posts in this sub. 

See you next time!"
"Beer tourism: there are a number of breweries in NYC, which are absolute MUST visits from a local's point of view?


I will be in NYC for 5 nights next month, and am obviously extremely excited! I'm from the UK and am as interested in the ingredients and production of beer as I am in drinking it, and really enjoying the rising craft beer scene over here over the last 4 years or so. I also homebrew occasionally so know my stuff.

There may be time to visit a brewery, and I'm thinking Brooklyn Brewery as I want to go to Brooklyn anyway, as well as trying out the more obscure beers that don't make it on to these shores, but that seems an easy option and a bit 'mainstream'. Really not sure, and this list isn't helping: http://www.nycbeer.org/brews.php

Redditors of NYC, your help is much appreciated and I'll raise a glass to ya wherever I end up! Also, if you have go-to bars on Manhattan you'd like to recommend, please fire away. Cheers!"
"What restaurant trends are popular in NYC at the moment?


I'm doing some research about the food industry, and I thought I'd ask here - what kind of fast-casual (upscale fast food but not quite restaurant, about $12 per person) trends are popular in NYC at the moment?

I know Pok√© became very popular recently, and I've heard more odd concepts like bone broth bars and that kind of thing, and that rotis also had a period of popularity. Was hoping someone could mention a type of place they've seen get popular. I heard ""Bing"" chinese wraps were taking off.

Thanks"
