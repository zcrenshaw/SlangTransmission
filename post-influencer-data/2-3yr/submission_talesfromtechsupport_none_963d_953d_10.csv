"Engineer is doing drugs!! No. No they aren't.


This just happened...

So, I had a laptop system board fail. Under warranty. No problem.

Engineer comes on site. Does the  job. All good.

10 minutes later, I'm called down to where he was working by a member of management saying that he must have been doing drugs in there because there's a syringe in the bin. There's about 10 members of staff all freaking out.

It's thermal compound.

Edit: damn this got big! My biggest post ever!"
"I made her cry.


LTL; FTP. None of the names I'm giving here (besides my username) are real. I work for a surgery center. So does Sandy. Sandy is a very kind (gullible, evidently) older lady who mans the switchboard phones. 

This is about the day I upgraded Sandy's computer. 

This is about the day I made Sandy cry.

&gt;Glass: And there you are. Do you have any questions I can answer about your new setup before I go work on the other tickets today?

&gt;Sandy: Well, how am I supposed to use it? 

Did I mention this was a particularly off-kilter day, and I had deployed the machine without a keyboard or mouse?

&gt;Glass: Oh, these new machines don't require keyboards or mice anymore. There's actually a neural implant, very low power and completely painless. It makes it a truly wireless experience, and the procedure only takes about 45 minutes. We have you booked for operating room 7 with Dr. Smith at 12:15

&gt;Sandy: But...but I... 

&gt;*At this point, Sandy's eyes start to bug out and she bursts into tears.*

&gt;Glass: Oh my God! I'm so sorry! I'm Joking! I just forgot your keyboard and mouse. There is no implant, I was pulling your leg. Please ~~don't go to HR~~ forgive me! I'm going to go get your keyboard and mouse right now!

This was many years ago now, but I still feel bad about it. Luckily she calmed down (and found it funny) a few minutes after I explained that I was joking. "
