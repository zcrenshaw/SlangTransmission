"I Climb Cell/Broadcast Towers AMA


Questions,concerns or want stories, ask away

Work release programs that our company participated in were really odd, Especially  with some of the people that came from prison. The most notable was a guy who had been jailed for raping others with a broomstick. He never said much and was very specific about a routine.
Most of the other ex prisoners that came through were just trying to adjust back into society, down to earth guys.

Yes I've had friends that have died while working or have had to behind to help clean up the marks left, that's never an easy sight to see on site.

Copper thieves are prevalent, stumbled across a fried body who tried cutting into a high voltage line. The smell was terribly odd.

I've had a guy who had his face split open on site from guyed wires for a small 60 ft tower, busting off it was 3/8 inch thick cable. I had no clue what to do for his face except wrap tape to try and keep it together( any injuries you receive with contruction style jobs, you tape it up with electrical tape to stop bleeding and risk of infections.) He suffered from brain damage and is a vegetable. 



These responses will take a while since I'm doing this from mobile.

For anyone that wants a cheaper alternative for a phone I suggest cricket. They use the same equipment by piggybacking  AT&amp;T and it's half the cost.(Clarification this applies to texts and calls not mobile data eg. Internet)

2200 ft is the highest I've climbed. 2000ft of tower with a 200 ft extension for additions to beacons and the likes.

Pictures are going to be limited until I can shuffle through all of them this is standard view for cell towers

"Hi, I‚Äôm travelling to EVERY single country in the world in a single UNBROKEN JOURNEY, without the use of flight. Ask me anything!


Hello everyone, I'm Thor from Denmark in the north of Europe. I'm here to tell you a little bit about OUAS ;)

This is day 1,089 and we have reached 116 countries across 4 continents!

You are welcome to Ask Me Anything, read up on it here below or watch this short video to get some quick answers:

Welcome one and all! :)

What is OUAS?

Once Upon A Saga is a complicated logistical challenge of historical proportions! It also has great humanitarian value and a source for inspiration for many who cross its path.

In short, the ""Saga"" is the quest for 1 man to reach every single country in the World in a single unbroken journey - completely without the use of flight! Although the World has been conquered geographically by travellers many times throughout history, a flightless journey is a feat that has never before been achieved...until now.

In order to understand the ""Saga"" better it can be seen as 3 individual projects:

1)
A journey to every country without flight with all of its complicated logistics (203 countries).

2)
A positive promotion of each country sharing stories of positive experiences to counter the negatives often seen in the media.

3)
A positive promotion of the Red Cross Red Crescent movement, which was founded in 1863 and today spans across 190 nations.

As such, the Saga is known to provide three elements for those who partake:
- Inspiration
- Entertainment
- Education

So, join us on the journey by spreading the word, that A STRANGER IS A FRIEND YOU'VE NEVER MET BEFORE! ;)

Thor ;)
