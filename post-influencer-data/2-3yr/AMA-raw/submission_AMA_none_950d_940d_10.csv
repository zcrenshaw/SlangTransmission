0,"[AMA Request] A survivor of The Bowling Green Massacre


The media didn't cover it so it would be great to get a survivor's story out there. "
1,"[19F] I am a failed porn star, AMA!


I signed up for the web-camming site Chaturbate the day I turned 18 and spent a few months as a cam girl before I graduated high school. Summer of, I left home to live in a cam-house in Miami where I took on a popular male talent as my agent. I was not at all successful in my endeavors to become a ""porn star"" and have only ever appeared as an extra once, and highlighted as female talent on four separate occasions, but I sure as hell have stories to share with anyone interested.

Aside from my identity and the identity of any involved- porn persona included- I'm open to answer any questions.

2,"My grandma lived through the Great Depression, WWII and moved to Richland, WA in the 1940's to work on the Manhattan Project after spending her childhood in the South. I am here with her and she is ready to answer your questions. AMA!

3,"I have gone shopping with my wife to IKEA on more than one occasion *without getting in a fight.*


I am a veritable relationship NINJA. If you have questions about how we accomplished this feat or if you have general relationship questions please ask. "
4,"I spent 4 months in a mental hospital, ask me anything


My months of September through January this year were spent living in inpatient and residential mental hospital facilities, including 2 weeks in general mental health, then 3 1/2 months in eating disorder (which also specializes in depression, OCD, and mood disorders)

Ask me anything! (Honestly ANYTHING!)"
