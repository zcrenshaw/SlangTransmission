1,"I will spend the rest of my life answering every single question on this post AMA


Let me address the most common questions I've been getting so they're hopefully asked less.


&gt; Why?

Because I like answering questions.


&gt;How long do you think you'll live?

Hopefully another 50 years.


&gt;What do you do for a living?

I teach game development."
2,"I am currently on a boat in the middle of the sea using a multi million dollar submarine to find bombs from ww2. Ama


Internet is kind of bad out here so may take me a minute or two to reply. Also going to bed in about an hour but will reply when I get up for my shift. "
3,"I am a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder)


[removed]"
4,"I have a year to live. Ask me random questions relating to life and people!


I have already done an AMA extremely similar to this one but that generally focused on my illness. This will hopefully be a bit more lighthearted. 

I'm also a thirteen year old girl. But apparently I don't speak like one. I'm always afraid it'll take away the power of and meaning of what I say, but I hope you look past that."
5,"I'm a 24 year old girl living with my 10 year old brother. Ask me anything!


My little brother Dylan moved in with me about a year ago. I'm in grad school in the city that I grew up in and where my family is from. My parents, basically on a whim, decided to move across the country. Rather than completely uproot Dylan and drag him to New York, everyone agreed it made more sense for him to come live with me. Having my 10 year old brother here is not what I expected at 24, but it's been really wonderful. Ask me anything about our lives, our living situation, etc."
