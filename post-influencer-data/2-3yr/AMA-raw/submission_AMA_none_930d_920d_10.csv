Im fine now, but still a difficult experience.  With all the conversation currently, I feel its important for the general public to understand the psychology of dealing with the situation.

Currently married with a career.  I have gotten over the depression, but the shame will always haunt me.



**Edit 1**  To address the fact that it start when she was under the age of 18 (15 I believe).
Children who were sexually victimized by other minors, including inter-sibling abuse, show largely the same problems as children victimized by adults, including anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse, suicide, eating disorders, post traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and difficulty trusting peers in the context of relationships.[1][12] The victim often thinks that the act was normal, including thinking they were the initiator or that they went through the act voluntarily.[11]

Major factors that affect the severity of symptoms include the use of force or coercion, the frequency of the abuse, and the invasiveness of the act.[13] An increased risk of victimization later in life has also been reported.[14]

Ive dealt heavily with all of the above not including eating disorder.  I experienced heavy depressed and suicidal tendencies from the age of 12 - 28ish.


**Edit 2**  Ill be here all day into the evening.  For the after work crowd.

**Edit 3**  ""Woman"" not ""Women"" - Title typo

**Edit 4**  Just had this thought, after being asked from a parent of a child that was molested : using the restroom, specifically urinals, next to adults has always given me a high level of anxiety.  I feel that its important, for society and in terms of the trans bathroom discussion, to take this into consideration.  I could not imagine the fear and anxiety I would've experienced If I were force to share a public restroom with someone I was unsure of, and in turn scared.  This could be resolved by informing the molestation victim.  But please remember, they have been and always will be the victim of molestation."
