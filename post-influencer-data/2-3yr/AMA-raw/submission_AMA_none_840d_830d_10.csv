0,"I am a captain (lead server) at a 2 star michelin restaurant making 120k/year. AMA


I've been in the industry for about 10 years (27 years old now). I've always had a passion for food, wine, and hospitality.

I got this job about a year ago, and it's the highest level of dining I've ever been apart of.

To put in perspective, a table of 2 with no wine, tap water, and no extra courses will still run you ~$500

AMA!

Hello.


My name is Brad and i'm 23 years old. I've been blind all my life. I can see  light and some shadows.

If you've ever wanted to ask a blind person a question, ask away.

Remember this; if you don't ask you won't learn. So please ask your questions and do not worry about offending me."
