1,"Many People Talked About Leaving the US After Trump Got Elected. I Actually Did, over to Ireland. AMA


To be fair I didn't move for political reasons at all, but found it funny how many people talked about moving away from America after the election, and every single one of them is still there and most are doing just fine. 

Born to Irish parents in America, went back and forth a bit but I decided in June to come over and stay as long as possible! Feel free to AMA (hope I'm doing this right). "
2,"I was raised in a cult at infancy to early years and got out. AMA


My single mom had me at St. Paul Park, MN. She was too proud to ask for her families help when she was bit by a tic and got lymes disease. 

I wish I had more proof to provide you guys, other than me stating I have no idea why anyone would ever bother to lie about this. 

We were homeless, and a ""following"" member found us and offered us a ""sanctuary,"" so she accepted. We were homeless plus she had an infant... and we were both cold and hungry I guess.... That's what she told me anyway. 

I was raised on the compound as ""polluted"" or an example of the ""snake"" and I was outcasted by other children my age because I am a ""bastard baby."" I was also told by them that the devil kissed my forehead as it entered the world, before I had even drawn breath. Although these people took us in as charity to my mother being ill, I was raised as an example to the other kids of what the devils children are. 

When my grandfather found out what was happening, he flew to Minnesota with 3 return tickets  and told my mother he was taking me with him and that he hoped she would come with. I remember that whole conversation. I was 8 years old and I had never had a single toy or real possession to my name. I was afraid that it was a trick; I thought it was a sick joke they were playing about me finally being taken away, and I just stood still frozen. He told me he was going to take me home with him, put me in a school, and give me toys. He told me about how he already had my own bedroom set up. He picked me up and I kicked and screamed until I got into the back seat of the cab he had outside and then I stopped. I ended up obliging to what I thought would be the devils trip to my hell... as these people had always taught me would happen to me. 

I got my first toys. I got my first education. First room. First puppy. First experience at what I guess is a normal kid thing.... 

I was raised in a cult that taught me I am a daughter of Satan purely because I didn't know my biological father... this was out in the midwest, i am 29 now and remember a lot about how I was saved before anything really horrible happened... Ask me anything!

(I opened up a throwaway account so nobody thinks this is some karma dig experience)"
