2,"I've been diagnosed with Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM). AMA!


HSAM is a condition where your brain automatically""keeps storing a vast multitude of events (of your life) by itself. 
I remember almost every day of my life since I was 4.
I remember everything Chronologically and I can pinpoint my first memory to when I was 14 months of age. 
I also remember everything is full detail, like the clothes people were wearing, what specific words they used, etc. 
I keep remembering everyday and every conversation I have until now. 
I'm 19 F! So if you have any questions! 

Edit 1: 
People are asking me a lot about what I was doing on specific dates. People with HSAM don't necessarily associate their memories with a date or time. Although I can recount for most of it.  
Exactly pinpointing what I was doing on a specific date at a specific time would be major sign of photographic memory, which is different than HSAM. 
Photographic memory is deliberately used. People with HSAM have no control over what their brain store, which is almost everything. It's purely Autobiographical. 
If I did something on an exact date that I did not myself associate with a date, then I wouldn't remember it. 
If someone sends me a text. I wouldn't be able to tell when they sent it but I will be able to tell when I read it. But then again if I never looked at the clock while reading the text, i won't remember the time. I'd only be able to tell if it was morning, evening, night, etc. 

EDIT 2: I'm being asked a lot about the effects of drugs, alcohol, etc on my memory. To let readers know, I have a Liver defect and have been living with it for over 5 years now. I cannot take any alcohol, rec drugs, narcotics, or even neuro meds because of it. I've never taken them, and I probably never will. So I guess I'll never the effect on my memory. 

EDIT 3: I am being asked about my dreams. I remember all my dreams ever. If I remember them in the morning, I'll remember them always. I used to Lucid Dream a lot few years back. It was fun. I could build imaginary cities, remember their roads. Walk the same roads if I wanted. Meet the same people, etc. I currently don't do it anymore as I'm really busy with studied and LD takes time and patience. "
3,"[AMA Request] Person whose confused Obamacare/ACA Facebook post made the front page yesterday.


I'm really curious to know:
1) what are your primary sources for news and are you now questioning these sources?
2) what exactly did you think ""Obamacare"" was if not the ACA?
3) how will your life be affected once the ACA is repealed?
4) what was your immediate response to learning this news?
5) do you know other people with the same misunderstanding and, if so, will you be telling them that they're misguided?

4,"A 14 year old boy just hit me in the head with a bottle trying to steal my laptop, AMA


I was with a friend talking in a park when two boys younger than us came to us asking for weed. A while after one of the boys grabbed my laptop, which I inherited from my deceased mom and I use to get all of college's work done, and asked me to lend it to him. After some words I took the laptop away from him, then he grabbed a bottle of beer and hit me with it in the head, then ran away with his partner.

I am now in the hospital. Fortunately, the wound is not too serious, but I'm still getting some stitches. I'll formally report to the police tomorrow morning. AMA!

Hi, all. I've been a freelance and contract writer for a little over a year and have just cracked the $10,000 mark! 

I'm using a throwaway because, well, I'm under 18 and can't *really* be using PayPal and need to stay as anonymous as possible, but other than that, ask away! "
