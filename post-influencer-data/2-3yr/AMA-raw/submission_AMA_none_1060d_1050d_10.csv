Hello, reddit. Let's get one thing straight right away. I'd fight the horse-sized duck because it would be really slow and I'd be able to circle it and attack its legs from side or the rear. It'd be an easy takedown. Then, it'd be giant Peking duck time. e

2,"I am a former porn director AMA


Well, ask me *almost* anything. I won't answer any questions about:

* My name, location, or the name of the company that I worked for.
* The real names of anyone in the porn industry.

*******

I'm an American man who produced and directed porn for about three years. I spent my first year making amateur videos (mostly POV style) with girls from my hometown, and then the following two years making anal pornography for a large existing studio in Europe. In that relatively short span of time, I saw a lot of crazy shit and learned a lot of things about how the industry works.

I'm happy to answer your burning questions and to share some amusing anecdotes. So ask away!

I'm going to let the questions accumulate for a few hours and then I'll come back &amp; answer everything I can. I'll be on for the rest of the night after that, and I may also come back tomorrow if time permits.

**EDIT:** Thank you for your questions. I'm going to wrap this up at the end of the night, so if anyone has anything else they'd like to ask, I'd advise them to please do so within the next couple of hours. (It's 10:00 PM Eastern time as of this writing.)

**EDIT:** Okay, that's a wrap. Thank you all again for your questions. This was fun. "

It's difficult to explain myself adequately without having a huge wall of text that most would would just skip over...but here are some basics (still a lot) and will go into more detail if asked...

* I was in special ed for 10 years BUT graduated college with a BA degree in communications BUT had almost no direction and a really bad job history and am currently unemployed and broke.  I don't even have a smartphone because I can't afford one...I live meekly off SSDI and anything even $20 is a big expense for me.  I have big issues with depression and feel unfocused and overwhelmed with life; and I sleep a lot.  I started seeing therapists since I was 10 and am still seeing one plus another psych guy I see every few months who originally DX'ed me when I was 27 and prescribes me Celexa.  If it wasn't for my religious, I'd be more inclined to commit suicide.

* I have many goals in life but they require money and connections that I don't have so year after year goes by and hardly anything gets done, on top of not developing in life...I still live in the same bedroom since I was 5 (the house has no basement) with my family, my only sibling is a low functioning special needs adult who I find difficult to live with, I want to live the life of someone in their 20's with a fun carefree active social life with not much responsibility but I'm out of the loop and old now.  And most people I see in real life over 40 seem to just settle into a life I can't identify with.

* I'm 5'9"", slightly under 230 pounds, developed a gut from a longtime habit of soda and fast food and junk food, slight hunched over back from scoliosis (I wore a back brace when I was a teenager), nearsighted so I have to wear thick glasses, blonde hair that is sometimes long and sometimes short over the years 
but now I'm growing bald on top (but not the front yet), sometimes have a beard (but greying now), big nose, somewhat crooked teeth despite going through painful orthodontics braces when I was younger, I had open heart surgery when I was 37 due to an ongoing heart condition.

* Many moments of sexual frustration that have piled up in the past 30+ years, and I'm still a virgin despite going to college and Woodstock '94 and '99 and having an active social life during most of my 20's. I used to frequently make the effort to go out to meet fun people and give off a positive fun vibe, but I almost never have any luck and if there IS luck it's a fleeting French kiss and then they lose touch with me. Then I stew in depression about how I hate my life.  Sex actually isn't too much of a priority for me; fooling around is.  I TRIED to lose my virginity to a stranger at Woodstock '99 (before the rioting) but it didn't work out so we gave up (she was up for it but I wasn't that much into her; I was more into the idea of having my ""first time"" story be at a big event).  I have many sexual fantasies that I'm trying to rework into a list...none of which are actually having sex.  Rather, the basic main three things I desire are me playing with a woman's boobs, a woman playing with or admiring my dick, and passionate French kissing/makeout sessions with various women.  Lack of good looks and social smoothness and money and youth, add up to no luck...my last satisfying sexual moment (makeout session) was in 1999 in my late 20's.  

* I desire physical intimacy with another person (as opposed to my own hand), not emotional intimacy. For social needs I'd rather have a group of friends instead of a one on one relationship.  Porn got boring after a while as it never involved an actual woman being physically intimate with me.  My fantasies usually involve the woman being sexually forward or aggressive towards me (in an erotic way), so I can feel like I am sexually desired for once instead of my scaring them away by seeing too eager and anxious, which has been the norm with women for me.  I prefer counterculture type women...hippies, goths, etc...but I'm not really part of any such lifestyle myself.  

* I love the aspect of a woman being exhibitionist and casually hanging out topless, who is not a stripper where it's her job and she asks for money and it's much less exciting to me.   Parties where a woman gets topless becomes a great, and I have been to a few such parties thanks to my making the effort to be around the right people (who I since lost touch with).  The coolest thing a woman ever told me was during a a phone conversation with a hot goth woman, about my wanting to dabble in nude photography: ""I want you to take pictures of me naked!""...then shortly afterwards 9/11 happened and priorities shifted and we lost touch.  Later on I reconnected with her on Facebook and saw that from some of her photos, she probably loves to pose nude (but censors herself on that site)...but she had a boyfriend now and is still almost impossible to actually correspond with.  I since quit Facebook as it was just frustrating and unproductive when my intent was to reconnect with old friends in person and not just reading what they post on their profile after being friended and that's it. 

* The only ""love letter"" I got was when I was a Freshman in high school and a Freshman girl acted like she liked me but it turned out to be just a cruel joke, which shattered me at the time.  I never had a girlfriend but came close when I was 23 and 26; both with women who were into me but I was not that into them but I was up front so as not to lead them on and after briefly ""casually seeing"" them, they broke it off as they wanted a more solid emotional relationship that they knew I could not provide.  I did not have sex with either one because I was not that into them and I was content to fool around instead.  I've met many many woman I was very attracted to but none of them ever liked me the same way.  Am I wrong in thinking that a relationship requires mutual physical attraction?

* I had regrettable fluke flings on Halloweens 2005 and 2010 (I was in my 30's), with women I was not into but I was so lonely and they were interested, that I caved in and fooled around with them, but at least I declined having sex with them because I didn't want them as part of an actual sexual history, so it was just awkward and frustrating for everyone involved...overall VERY awkward moments and I was pissed off that I never had moments like that with a partner where there was MUTUAL interest.  The second instance was someone I met at a Halloween party...which at by the way another friend who owed me $100 finally paid me back at that party, then I went on to spend it at a hotel with this woman that very night and immediately realized it was a mistake since I was REALLY not into it...just that lonely for sexual moments.  

* Considering the whole ""Ken Bone revealed to have iffy posts in his Reddit history after doing an AMA"" thing...I've been posting under this name for over two years, some posts are serious while other posts are just jokes and/or to rile people up for fun, and often it does make me laugh.  MOST people would be able to tell the difference.  Troll-ish topics I like to harp on include issues like thought police or ""people over 40 are worthless and should be shunned"" or ""People need to love Hillary Clinton or ELSE!"" or some other really polarizing view brought too far.  In real life, I'm not comfortable with EITHER candidate but I do find guilty pleasure in this campaign with how bitter both sides are to each other and how both candidate are so unpopular...it's like watching a car crash or something.  But in the back of my mind I'm hoping this doesn't effect my life too negatively before I have a chance to realize more sex fantasies.

...I'll leave it at that for now.  I'll be online for a couple hours now but follow up more tomorrow probably.
