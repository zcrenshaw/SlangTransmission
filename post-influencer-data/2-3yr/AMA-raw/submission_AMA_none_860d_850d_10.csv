0,"My grandpa is the world's leading expert on forensic linguistics - he works with copyright law firms and provides expert testimonies on the psychology of the English language and how words are perceived. Would anybody be interested in him doing an AMA?


He doesn't even know what Reddit is, but his line of work is really fascinating.  He's worked on major copyright cases for Microsoft, Frito-Lay, Monsanto, and many other Fortune 500 companies.  He has a very strong understanding of how different words are perceived and how they affect your thoughts and feelings.

Edit: thanks for the response!  He probably won't be able to do one any time within the next few weeks, but now that I know there's a big interest, next time I see him, I'll sit down with him and make him do one!  I will tag everybody in this thread when it happens :)"
