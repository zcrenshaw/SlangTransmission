4,"I was sexually abused by my older brother for 8 years: AMA


I'm 27 today and it's been more than a decade since it last happened. I was the first of the three of us ( I have two older brothers ) to move out of our family home, I was 21 and ran away to another country in another continent.

I suffered from depression as young as 8 and had dangerous suicidal thoughts and tendencies, the only thing that saved me was a fear of hell (that's another story). I was also diagnosed with PTSD and GAD as well as depression. I grew up having a terrible relationship with my body that felt like a prison most of the time. I also suffered from binge eating disorder, failed by my standards at school, and did terribly in university.

Today, I'm in a loving long term relationship with the man of my dreams, am about to graduate with a physics degree, beat depression and binge eating, and have control over my life after years of being a wreck. I still have terrible bouts of depression and trouble with sex sometimes but nothing I can't bounce back from.

There's two reasons I'm doing this:
1) To mark my emotional and mental progress
2) To help others who have gone through the same thing.
 

Disclaimer: I'm not a mental health professional or a physician. I have read a lot of books and literature on childhood traumas that have helped me along the way but your best advice will come from a professional who is specialized in childhood sexual abuse. Most of my answers will be based on my own experiences and what I have learned along the way."
