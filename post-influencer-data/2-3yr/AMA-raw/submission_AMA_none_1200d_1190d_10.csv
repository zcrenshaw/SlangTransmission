It's been a goal now for several years to visit every country.  I just got back from a trip to the south Pacific where I visited my three remaining countries. Tuvalu, Samoa and Nauru.

It's taken about 18 years to reach my goal. I got a bit of a late start in travel, I'd only been to 10 countries by age 26.  But it took off from there and I never looked back.  When I finally reached ~100 countries I decided why not try to go for them all?
