1,"I'm an American who spent time in a Chinese Prison, never being charged, and eventually deported. AMA!


/u/honeycakes suggested I do an AMA based on the responses to his comment on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4vxrg8/always_be_vigilant_at_the_market/d62keb4?context=3)

So I'll just give a brief rundown, then ask away, and I'll edit the post occasionally to show the more popular questions/responses.

The basics:
===
I went to china just after Christmas in 2004 to study travel around and study Chinese Martial Arts.  In August of 2007, my girlfriend at the time (who will be referred to as Voldemort from here on), and I were living in Beijing and decided we wanted to go down to Thailand for a couple months to just get out of dodge, then come back to Beijing, tie up loose ends and then go back to the states.  In preparation for that, i went to the Beijing Gong An Ju (Public Security Administration) to renew/get a new visa, since I'd need at least one more entry allowed on it to come back and get my stuff before going back to the states.  At the Gong An Ju, it was discovered that the visa I was issued via a visa/passport agency was bogus.  The workers attempted to extort 30000 reminbi from me in order to make it go away, and when I couldn't pay they arrested me and I then spent the next month in the Beijing Xi Dian Ji Liu Suo (Beijing west side detention center.)  During the next month, I was interrogated every day; accused of being a spy (which in retrospect is kind of cool); got food poisoning; eaten up by bedbugs; lost roughly 40lbs; and was quite possibly exposed to pathogens that finally knocked over the dominoes triggering my pancreas to crap out (I have T1d, diagnosed two years after this.)

After several visits and inquiries from the US Department of State (Embassy), I was finally released after having to sign a bunch of NDA's and paperwork saying that everything that happened was 100% my fault and that China is a land of candy and gumdrops and the Chinese Government is super cool, etc. etc. then I was put on a plane back to the United States and was given persona non-grata until 2011.  Needless to say, I have not been back to China

Now, Ask Away!

Getting a lot of questions, liking this a lot, so feel free to keep them coming! 

Also, quick Chinese lesson - If you're ever looking to start a fight with someone who speaks mandarin just utter this:  ""Cao ni zuzong shi ba dai"" (fuck your ancestors 18 generations back.)  For some reason that really rustles their jimmies.

EDIT:  5pm CST - 8/5/2016 - about to start my Friday night, feel free to keep asking questions, since I'm always on reddit, it'll get answered at some point

2,"I live in a country where i could be killed for being an atheist. AMA


I live in a third world country with a strongly religious Constitution and a culture of absolute devotion to religious values. Changing religions, saying things against religion or declaring oneself an atheist in this place could have serious repercussions like legal penalties and even the possibility of mob lynching, in addition to the obviously inevitable outcome of being socially isolated by family/friends for doing this.
