0,"I am a 95-year-old veteran who fought at the battle of Iwo Jima. Semper Fi! AMA


My Name is Smoky Williams (grandson is /u/ and is helping type), and I served during World War II in the 5th Marine Division as a 2nd Lieutenant during the battle of Iwo Jima. I was later promoted to Captain, worked a chemical engineer specialising in polymers, and then as an Economics professor- Ask Me Anything! 

[Edit: Thanks everyone! He really enjoyed this and it is getting a bit late for him here on East Coast. Feel free to ask further questions and I'll ask him in the morning] 

[Edit 2: sorry didn't get a chance to ask further questions this morning, as he slept in and we had to take off for airport. Will maybe try to do another AMA in the spring when I see him next and schedule it ahead of time (including pics of his discharge papers for proof). In the meanwhile, here's a pic or two of him nowadays:

1,"Nurse said I took the biggest dump she'd ever seen.


TL;DR I didn't shit for 8 days.

I recently had complex pneumonia for 6 days. I was unconscious for 5 of them due to a barbiturate-induced coma I was put in because of extreme fever and vomiting. The last time I had a bowel movement was the day before I started to really feel sick. After that, there was so much vomiting that I probably had little need to shit...yet.

While unconscious in the hospital, I was obviously on IV, and they put a catheter in my dick hole. My body regularly peed when it need to pee, but thought it would be funny to forget about shitting. Doctors would regularly check the bedpan to see if I needed cleaned up, but it never happened.

Apparently, they will not force a bowel movement in someone on IV unless it has been more than 7 days. More_Than_7_Days.

So I pooped one day, I was sick for the day, was in the hospital the following day, and unconscious for 5 more days. By the time I was woken up, no longer had a fever and was healthy, it had been almost 8 full days. I was groggy, tired, hungry, and had a little headache, but I was okay. And then it happened.

I had this terrible pain in my stomach area all around from below my sternum to my crotch. I thought it might be bad gas and that I should go try to poop it out. I had no idea that it had actually been almost 8 days.

Try to imagine 4 fruitcakes stacked on top of each other, ran over by a bulldozer, and then pressed into 1 fruitcake. That might be almost as dense as what I had to push out of my body. My knees were shaking, I had tears running down my face, and I was biting down so hard that it was hurting my jaw. I put my finger in my mouth and bit it in a desperate attempt to transfer the pain but it didn't help. After 3 or 4 minutes, I felt this massive tearing as my sphincter gave way like the Banqiao Dam Disaster.

As quickly as it had ripped my asshole apart, it was all over. I felt like I was open enough to give birth; it was a very awkward feeling. I then simply wiped and flushed. As I was washing my hands, I noticed that the paper was gone, but the turd was still sitting there in the toilet. I tried to flush it again and the water just ran by like a boulder in a creek. I went and told the nurse and she said they'd take care of it, so I went back to bed.

I later saw the same nurse and apologized and said I hoped it wasn't too bad. She told me it was okay but she had never seen anything like that in her life, and that I really should have had it taken care of with a proper enema. At this point, I was intrigued and began to ask her what was so fascinating about it. She half-heartedly laughed and said she could tell by the weight of it in the waste bag that something seriously terrible had happened.

I hope I never get that sick again, but if I do, I'm going to be asking for the hose.
