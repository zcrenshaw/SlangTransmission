1,"I'm eating a 5lb (2.25kg) bag of Sugar-Free Gummy Bears today, AMA


Gather 'round, children and listen well, to this the story I'm about to tell. For this is a warning you should well heed, a lesson to all of the price of greed. The wise man seeks just moderation, living life without consternation. Never was there a tale of more woe, than this of /u/SpottedPaws and her Haribo.

Disclaimer:I will not necessarily eat all 5lbs, but I am obese so don't rule it out.

It is 7:30am here. A portion of the bag is in the freezer right now as I like my gummy bears on the harder side. I will post as things happen.

8:05am- I'm having five gummy bears. According to Amazon reviewers, this is the safe amount to eat in one sitting. I want to spread the experience across the day, so I'm working in slowly.

8:10am- as per the request of /u/silverishdragon, I am eating five more gummy bears.

8:23am- Initial gas buildup has begun. Minor discomfort, alleviated with flatulence. No distinct odor or noise, such as that seen with excessive fiber intake. I am wondering if different colors of gummies have different strengths or effects. So far, I have eaten 7 of the pineapple, 2 orange, and 1 wild cherry. The pineapple are my favorites.

8:36am- I absent-mindedly ate 4 wild cherry ones while taking a photo of the bag as proof. I don't normally like cherry-flavored things, but these are pretty good.

9:46am- Home safely, pants intact and unsoiled. /u/cyclefreaksix &amp;amp;amp; Eddie Murphy suggest inserting a gummy bear as a suppository. I elected to use the lime flavored ones for this, as they're the ones I like least. I am also consuming another five gummies at this time, equalling a total of 19 sugar-free gummy bears thus far.

10:08am- I'm starting to think it's an urban legend because nothing is happening. Eating 5 more as per /u/itsacalamity

10:23am- 5 more, because why not. For those who are interested, the brand I got was [Albanese's](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DE4GWWY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;psc=1). Here's a [photo of the bag](http://imgur.com/Q30gdn0), albeit most are in the freezer right now.

10:46am- We've got movement, people! Just normal. Oh, yeah, heads up, this post may be NSFW. lol

11:51am- As per /u/HMNbean, I just ate 10 more. Starting to feel sick, but I think that's just from sheer volume of gummy bears eaten this morning.

12:52pm- Little bit gassy, but nothing notable. I'm feeling disappointed. Had another 10 just now, but I'm losing hope.

1:49pm- Still just gassy. Nothing to report. Sorry, /u/Awais1006

3:15pm- Oh. No. Please. No. Apparently my darling dog (the spotted brat in the picture with the gummies) pulled some off the counter. We are now circling the block and pooping on *everything*, making me dig through bushes. 

5:31pm- The grumbling begins. Starting to have some abdominal cramping. This feels like it may be the prelude to a long night or may be something I could brush off. We shall see.

7:11pm- Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. Sorry to disappoint everyone."
