0,"I am getting my doctorate by turning venom into medicine. I extract venom from snakes around the world and study how the same proteins that can kill a man in minutes can treat medical conditions like cancer, chronic pain, parasitic infections, strokes, diabetes and many more. AMA!


I've always been fascinated by venomous animals and now I've found a way to make it my career and hopefully spread the word to stop people from killing animals that might just hold the secret to treating cancer, preventing strokes, stopping severe pain in its tracks without leading to addiction and so much more!  Also, I handle and extract venom from some of the most dangerous snakes around the globe on a daily basis, including  some that, sadly, no one makes antivenin for; due to a South African company deciding it is no longer profitable to do so.  I love my job and I hope I can convince some of you to spare snakes even though they aren't cute and cuddly in the traditional sense."
