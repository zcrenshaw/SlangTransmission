0,"Girlfriend's gift of a DNA ancestry test led my parents to inform me at 28 yrs old that my father is not my biological father--AMA!


[Original TIFU Post (by my girlfriend before taken down by mods for completely erroneous reasons)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6a2fxz/tifu_by_buying_my_boyfriend_a_dna_kit/):

""When I met my boyfriend 6 months ago we hit it off immediately. It's almost appalling how many things we have in common--our physical quirks, mental patterns, and similar if not identical health problems--not to mention interests.

It wasn't long before we started joking about being narcissists because we were practically dating ourselves. Or that we were created in a lab, cloned, and made to be the opposite sex. Or being related somehow by a distant relative.

So two weeks ago, for funzies, I ordered him one of those DNA kits that tell you your ancestry and connect you with members in your family tree. I already have an account with them that I made a while back and have connected with first and second cousins through it.

He gets the tube, spits his saliva in it, makes an account, and mails the tube back to the lab.

Sunday we go to his parents house for dinner and he gets an email from the lab saying they started processing his DNA. Excited, he tells his Mom and Dad all about it.

The very next day he comes home from work:
""You're not going to believe the story I have to tell you.""
*Opens ears*
He tells me that his Mom sat him down and told him that his Dad isn't his biological father and that he was made by a sperm donor and he has a half-brother the next state over. Apparently his Dad was freaking out about this DNA kit, afraid he would find out and so his mom just decided to tell him today. His sister is his half-sister, she has a different sperm donor and she has known for quite sometime.

Boyfriend is 28.

TL;DR Bought my boyfriend a DNA kit as a gift, which prompted his Mom to confess that his Dad isn't his biological father.""

I am participating in this AMA because there were quite a few questions on the above TIFU thread and I want to reply to those folks! I am sure others have questions, too! Read below for the full story:

I began dating my girlfriend in December of last year. Our recurring joke is that we must be related because we share a LOT of common interests, opinions, ailments, etc. In the past, she had taken a DNA test to find out her ethnicity. Therefore we often joked that I should take one too to find out if we were related.

One evening, while having dinner with my parents, I mentioned that my girlfriend had bought me a DNA ancestry kit and I was excited to learn my ethnicity since there was at *least* a known gap on my father's mother's side.

The next day, I had to stop by my parents before work. My mother says she needs to talk to me but that it wasn't a good time for me. Of course, I demanded to know what was up, because no one on earth has patience for that.

She dropped the bomb: I was conceived by a sperm donor. My sister was conceived by a different sperm donor. My sister somehow ""found out."" My father was mortified that the DNA test would have told me this and called my mother freaking out so she decided to tell me.

TL;DR A DNA ancestry test forced my parents' hands to tell me after 28 years that neither my sister or I are actually the biological offspring of my father and that my sister and I share different biological fathers."
1,"I hold a PhD in Climate Science, and I love to debunk false or exaggerated statements about global warming and its implications (from both deniers and non-deniers). Ask me anything!


Hi reddit! I hold a PhD in Climate Science from ETH Zurich, I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. I won't provide proof as I don't want to expose my username.

The internet is filled with both false (deniers) or exaggerated statements (non-deniers; I hate the term believer. Science is no religion) about global warming. I usually don't bother responding or correcting stuff I see on the internet because it's both an infinite time sink, and people are not usually opened to a rational discussion.

**If you have any doubts about anything you read or heard regarding global warming, ask me, and I will try my best to answer!**

Some recurrent example that come to mind:

- Is water vapor more important that CO2 as a greenhouse gas
- Why is sea ice around Antarctica growing despite the warming?
- Is ocean deoxygenation gonna kill all life in the ocean?
- Is climate science based on actual physics or is it just handwaving
- Why were climate models unable to reproduce the warming hiatus from 1998 to 2015?
- Are climate models junk?
etc...


edit: Don't hesitate to challenge my responses, ask for peer reviewed sources, or ask for clarifications.

edit2: I am no expert regarding climate and energy policies (just the science!), so I will not always answer questions that are heavily policy oriented. If I do, take my answers with a grain of salt.

edit3: Getting a lot of down-votes... It seems like the subject is still to touchy for some. Again, I am on nobody's side, just on Science's side, and as everybody, I have an opinion regarding policy and energetic matters. If you oppose my answers, please challenge them and we can discuss. 

edit4: I'm gonna call it a day . Really interesting questions, I hope the answers were satisfying. I'll get back to the remaining questions tomorrow."
