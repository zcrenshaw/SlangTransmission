"Single mom with a question. My son is very depressed by the fact that he has no father and wants to quit playing baseball because he's jealous of other little boys and their dad's. What can I do to help him?


It's not just baseball, but that's what's getting ready to start for him. He has been having this issue with football as well. He hates seeing other boys being coached and cheered on bybtheir dads. It hurts him tremendously that he doesn't have a father (he passed away when my son was a baby). It got so bad last year that he asked me not to actually come to practice to pick him up but to let him walk up the street and meet me at the gas station to pick him up."
"What did your parents handle really cool?


I came home one day after school and my parents told my younger brother to leave the room because they had to have a talk with me. They told me my younger brother (he was 12, I was 16 at the time) found a pack of condoms in my drawer, I bought those because I was dating my first GF back then and we had both been talking about our first time, so I wanted to be prepared. I thought I was into some deep shit as my parents are fairly conservative, but they just handled it pretty well, said it was good I bought condoms and they were glad I was responsible and if I ever needed money for things like that I should just ask, because they didn't want me to spend my monthly allowance on it. They punished my brother for snooping around in my drawers. We actually still laugh at it from time to time."

"I can't get attracted to a fat girl and I feel like a jerk. What can I do?


So my best friend introduced me to this girl that he knows because she is really nice and I've been looking to get back into dating for a while.

She is a really cool person and I have tons of fun talking to her, plus I'm sure she likes me, but I just can't get myself be attracted to her because she is a bit too overweight for my tastes. I just don't think i'll ever see her as anything more than a cool friend

I know I must sound like a complete asshole and I feel terrible, but I'm just not interested in her that way. It's usually not like me to judge someone so harshly because of their appearance (my ex-girlfriends are not super models or anything, and I'm not an extremely handsome guy either) so I'm really confused by this.

What do I do? I really don't want to force myself to date someone but I would like to keep talking to this girl as a friend, she is really cool.  
Am I a shallow asshole? I really don't want to be

Let's just be clear that I'm not trying to ""Body shame"" anyone. As long as you are happy with yourself then you can look however the hell you want.  
This is what I've always believed so that's why this is such a problem to me. I feel like a total hypocrite "
"My barber's pricing has been going up for the last couple of years, how important is tipping if he's getting too expensive?


I've been going to the same barber on and off for about 4-5 years, he's changed locations a few times so I've gone to him whenever i could. He is the best barber I've been to and I get the most compliments from his cuts.
I started going to him when he first started at his house cuz a mutual friend recommended him. He used to charge $15 for haircut and beard.
Changed shops and it went up to $20, then $25
Now recently changed shops again to a downtown location, prices went from $30, to $35 and now $40 for a haircut and beard!! I always tip him $5.
So last time I gave him $45 and I was like wow I'm paying $50 for a cut... that adds up if I go once every three weeks or so...

I'm thinking just paying him $40 from now. No tip, is that bad? Or just keeping him for special occasions/events and go to cheaper barber for a more regular visit."
"What do you do when you're not really sexually attracted to a potential SO/wife, but in all other aspects she is perfect for you?


Any guys here who have faced something like this?

I've been friends with a woman for a short while now, and I can truly say that she will be the perfect wife for me, considering our individual personalities and interests. She is also good to get married.

However, I don't find her attractive as such, and consequently I don't know how much I'll be into having sex with her. Adding to the complication is that I have a separate FWB right now, and the sex with her is absolutely effing amazing. And I think sex is a major 'criterion' for me when it comes to my wife.

Anyway, I know looks fade and personality endures,  but right now I can't seem to get past that. Can any bro offer some sage advice?"

Especially aimed at those who refer to women as ""females"" but to men as ""men"".

"How do you deal with the crushing feeling of leaving your dog at home when you go to work?


Me and my SO have to leave our pup at home to go to work. When my SO had a different role at work she was able to come home and see him on lunch breaks so it wasn't as bad. But now it's a rare occurrence and he has to spend a lot of time at home on his own, sometimes we can get him to my SO's parents and he spends the day with her dogs. We should be adopting another dog soon hoping all the checks go well so he can have a friend, but it still breaks my heart to leave him in the mornings.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the advice/words, here's my pup looking fancy with his junk out. http://m.imgur.com/MikGbcg"
"Guys, what's something that unexpectedly turned you on or made you more attracted to a girl?


I had a moment on my 2nd date with my ex-girlfriend. I pulled up in my car to meet her and I looked in my mirror to see that she was parked on the opposite part of the lot. At first I was like ""oh shit, there she is."" Then I saw her pull out her makeup and freshen up quick before she got out of the car. The fact that she was putting forth an effort to look good for me was really a big turn on. "
