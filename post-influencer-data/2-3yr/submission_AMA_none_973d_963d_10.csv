"I'm directing a documentary on Cluster Headaches, the most painful condition known to science, and I'm about to take mushrooms to treat them. AMA.


Hey everyone.  As stated above, I'm the director of an upcoming documentary about Cluster Headaches called [Clusterheads.](http://www.clusterdocumentary.com) I am one of the lucky few that suffer from them.  Psychedelics are one of the few known treatments for CH, and work really well for me.  I've been pain free for over 2 years due to mushrooms, but recently they came back so I need to a maintenance dose to kill off this cycle.  The strain I'm taking is called Penis Envy, and is very potent.  I'll be taking 1.5 grams.  I will be filming this entire process for my doc, so I will be jumping into the thread at points to answer the questions assuming that I'm not too mind-frazzled.  AMA.

Update: Thanks everyone for an engaging conversation and the kind words, means more than you can know. In case anyone is interested here is the BBC produced investigative report on the cult I grew up in: [The Secret Swami](https://youtu.be/YlL_CDqFCLg) "
