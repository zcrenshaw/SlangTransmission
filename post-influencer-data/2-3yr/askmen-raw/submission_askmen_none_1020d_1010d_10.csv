1,"Men in your thirties who are living a ""prolonged youth"" – enjoying life, your hobbies and your relationships without kids or other extra responsibilities – what are the drawbacks to your lifestyle choice?


I'm especially thinking about how other people are treating you. Do you find it difficult to maintain friendships with your old friends who've ""settled down""? Do you sometimes feel judged by people who more closely follow the LifeScript? Do you ever feel like you are an outsider or do you have a group of like-minded people to hang out with?

And to be clear, this is pretty much the opposite question to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/445iuj/childless_bachelors_over_35_how_sweet_is_your_life/). You don't need to brag here."
2,"What's the worst/best pun/dad joke you know?


Here's mine: 

John loved trains so he went out and got a job as a train operator. His first time driving a train, John crashes and 10 of his passengers die. Poor John is taken to court, found guilty, and sentenced to death. As his last meal John requests a banana. After he eats his fruit, John is strapped to the electric chair and the executioner throws the switch.

But John lives. Seeing this as an act of divine intervention, John is set free and cleared of all charges. Insistent on pursuing his passion, John once again finds a job operating trains. In his new job however, John crashes his train yet again and kills 20 of his passengers. John is once again brought to court where he is found guilty and sentenced to death. 

As his last meal, John requests two bananas. After consuming his bananas, John is strapped to the electric chair and the executioner once again flips the switch.

But once again John survives. Out of options, the officials let John go. John, determined to redeem himself, somehow finds *another* job driving trains. Unfortunately, this time John crashes into another train and causes a grand total of 100 passengers to lose their lives. John is dragged to court and once again sentenced to death. For his last meal, John requests three bananas.

""No more bananas! Enough of your tricks!"" the executioner shouts.

""It's okay,"" John says ""The bananas don't do anything. I'm just naturally a terrible conductor."""

6,"How do you not lose your boner when you have to put your condom on?


I don't understand. I find it so difficult to maintain a boner when I need to look for a condom pack, open the pack, pull the condom out, check if it's the right way around etc. I just lose the feeling when I need to do this. I like blowjobs and handjobs a lot more. They are just easy to jump into when ever I feel like it, but I just can't have regular PIV sex because of this. When I'm processing with the condom, I feel like I need to be fast or my girlfriend will get bored. I've tried condoms at home, and I can get them on and stay hard with them. Usually i need to fap a little bit, then slide it on, then fap with the condom a little so I get fully hard again. I feel like this takes some time, and she will get bored during this time and turned off, and this gives me pressure, which also affects the hardness. How do you guys do it? She will start some pregnancy prevention pills in 3 months, so I think that will make things easier."

9,"Can you give me a detailed explanation for why you guys break a friendship with a girl when she doesn't reciprocate romantic feelings?


I know the general form of this question has been asked, but I just need to understand this more deeply. 

A good friend of mine asked me out recently. He's a friend that I care about a lot as a person, and I tried to let him down as gently as possible. Since then, he hasn't talked with me since - and pretends not to see me when we pass by each other - and I feel like utter crap. I know this is a common sentiment, but it's like all the late night group conversations and open discussions and trust meant nothing at all compared to not being romantic partners. 

I've been reading related past threads, but the answers feel so awfully vague to me. In my experiences approaching guys and being rejected, even if the rejection stung, I've never felt that their rejection of me romantically meant I had to cut them completely out of my life. For me, you ask out someone because they're someone you admire/enjoy being around/feel is your kind of person. It's not easy to find people like that - people who are your kind of people. As an introvert who has had trouble breaking through shyness and finding meaningful relationships, finding people that I connect with means a lot to me. Even if I'm rejected romantically, I'd still want to keep people like that in my life.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/289l8q/when_you_get_rejected_do_you_still_try_to_stay/ 

Honestly, I'm wondering if it's because I haven't met someone whose rejection of me romantically would cause so much pain that I couldn't be around them. It just seems so extreme to me, but so many people here share the same belief that I feel like I'm missing something. 

What is going through your mind when you completely avoid a girl you were friends with that rejected you? What did the friendship mean  - did it mean anything? - if its so easily thrown away by being rejected romantically?


EDIT:
Wow, I posted this really late last night when I thought no one would be only a few people on - I really didn't expect to get so many answers. Thank you for the heartfelt replies. I'm reading through them slowly, and it's been meaningful to see what I have been missing.

For one, I realized that for me friendships are more sacred and important than relationships , and I was projecting that view on him. I feel that relationships break and crumble easily, but meaningful friendships stay constant throughout all that. From a lot of comments, it seems like most guys view it the opposite way - thank you for showing me that. 

I wouldn't ask him to stay my friend if it really caused him so much pain - the change in our relationship after he asked me just all felt so sudden and drastic. It's my fault when writing the post, but I think I did a poor job of giving details and context. We hang out as a group of three with another friend, and when we study together we can pull all nighters talking about philosophy and random things. After this happened, our group has completely broken and I know it can't be recovered especially with the way he's gone completely cold. At this point I just wanted to understand why, and the comments helped pull me out of my own perspective of feeling really hurt by the entire event to what he might be feeling. 

Thanks so much for all your perspectives. I can feel the sincerity in the replies and I really appreciate it."
10,"Why did men start wearing more conservative ties after the 90s?


Back in the late 80's and 90's you'd see all the male characters on tv wearing ties with flamboyant patterns. Examples:

Frasier, X files, and even 'The Bill' in the UK. Basically in any show that was on tv at the time you'd see the men wearing something like this. These days it's pretty rare to see that kind of style, especially in a corporate setting. When did more conventional designs, i.e. stripes, polka dots or plain colors, start becoming the norm?"
11,"1 line of dating advice for your son, 1 line for your daughter, 1 line for both. What are they?


For Both: Create more options for yourself! When you have more options you make smarter choices.  


For Daughter: Head games work **on** you more than you think, and **for** you less than you think. 


For Son: Your vocation will get you laid. Getting laid is not your vocation. 

What would you tell them?

Edit: I don't have any children. Give advice to your theoretical children. Or real ones if you have them. Or theoretical ones if you have children but would feel weird giving them dating advice. "
