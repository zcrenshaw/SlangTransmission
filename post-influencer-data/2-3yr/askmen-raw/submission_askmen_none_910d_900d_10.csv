5,"How can I freshen up the smell of my gentleman's sausage? [NSFW]


I'm a particularly sweaty man. Not in an unhealthy way, I just tend to run hot. After a long day of slow cooking in my jeans, my wedding vegetables tend to smell like old provolone. It's to the point where it's starting to really bother my fianc√©. I'll take my nightly shower, but there's gotta be a more permanent fix that doesn't require me scrubbing my scrumple before I climb in bed every night. 

I'm a really healthy, active dude with no other bodily issues, just some sweaty nuts. Any suggestions?            

Edit: a word"
6,"Would it bother you if a woman used a vibrator on her clit while having sex? If so why?


"
7,"What widespread belief about men and/or women do you think has the most ""toxic"" impact on the dating environment?


I think there are a lot of common beliefs in society that people take at face value, but actually do quite a bit of damage.

For example, I think propagating the belief that men always want sex and women do not like having sex is very detrimental when it comes to expectations we have for dating. Hell, I still believe that shit every now and then even though any time it has come up in conversation with a female friend of mine they always say it makes no sense. I just think it's very culturally pervasive and a lot of people believe things like this that end up hurting us all.

What examples do you have?


EDIT: thanks for all the comments everyone! Didn't expect this to be such a big topic. I find a lot of these interesting, some of these examples have just never crossed my mind."

11,"Men of Reddit, Did you ever get out from a manipulative relationship? if Yes, how did you do it?


I have a GF who's kinda unconsciously manipulative we've been together for 3 years now but I feel chained with her because she gets upset and cries over nearly everything although I do everything for her. 


my friend told me if I actually put 1% of the effort I put into this girl on another girl, she'll be the happiest girl ever.


everytime I do something other than talking to her, she'll keep saying she's lonely, or something like ""It's fine I don't mind..."" with a sad tune. it got annoying. I want to end it, but I don't want to hurt her."

14,"What brands are known to be good by people working in that particular industry, but are mostly unknown to people who work outside of that industry due to a lack of marketing?


For example, I've heard that there are some really good brands that make great headphones and if you ask someone in the music industry then they'll know about these brands but most people outside the music industry have never heard of these brands due to a lack of marketing. I hope this makes sense!"
