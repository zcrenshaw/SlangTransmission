2,"How do I tell my friend he's a creep to women?


I have a friend who's pretty creepy towards women.  I've been cool with him for a while and when he's with guys he's totally normal but when he gets around girls his main goal becomes trying to have sex with them. At parties and bars he'll spend the whole night trying to get laid, and even will hit on my female friends if he meets them. He's definitely made some girls uncomfortable, but I don't think he's doing it on purpose, he just doesn't get how others are perceiving his actions. 

He did express to me that he felt he wasn't being invited to hang out with me and my friends (some of whom were female and I had met recently - he also hit on all of them) and I didn't know how to tell him the truth. Should I tell him or not really bother? "
3,"I am a woman who makes a first move, but I haven't been succesfull. What may be the reason?


I am not afriad to make a first move. Step to a guy, start a conversation (in person or online on Tinder/Facebook). But it have never evolved in something more. 

I am not forever alone. Guys do approach me, so I have a dating life. But when I like someone I approach too. 

A few examples: 

1. In a bar: a guy was out with his friends. Actually he said something to me first, but I approached him outside a bar on a cigarette break. We had a small conversation, he seemed interested, but that was it. Next time I met him his friend said something to me, but that was the end. 


2. Tinder guy. I had realistic photos, send him photo even without make up, we taled for weeks. Went on a date, but after date he didn't texted back as wuickly as before and used excuse he doesn't have time when I asked for a 'fuck buddy/casual sex'. 


There are a lot of these stories. A lot of guys doesn't turn me down instatly, but quick enough. 


**How can I be better at making first move?** 

And no I am not that girl ""buy me a drink"", I usually pay my own drink, or buy another round. "
4,"What makes a girl seem unapproachable to you?


Hello r/AskMen! I know this may be a really stupid question and you may not have the answer to it but I'm struggling at the moment and any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I've been going to Uni for two years now and currently almost half way through my third one. So far I have not been able to make friends with neither guys nor girls. I'm kind of an introverted person so this did not bother me that much during the first year, it started to affect me a little during the second one, but this year it's just getting unbearable, it's taking a toll on me and I feel incredibly lonely all the time. 

I was very social in high school, but after finishing it it's like I don't know how to be social anymore, I don't know how or what to talk to people about. I am always alone, and it's draining me, and I know this is mostly my fault but the thought of approaching people gives me anxiety and I don't think I'll ever be able to go for it.

Onto my main problem; I've never been in a relationship before, I turned 20 recently, and seeing couples anywhere genuinely upsets me. I don't really get why guys rarely approach me? I honestly don't think it's something that has to do with my physical appearance, and this may sound snoby-ish but I think I'm at least average looking when it comes to attractiveness. I try to sit in places where people may ""notice"" me, try not to look busy in hopes that someone will strike up a conversation, I see it happen to other people around me but it never happens to me. What's wrong with me?"

I'm currently caught in an odd situation. My SO broke up with me because she is having a lot of family issues and needs space. We still talk every few days and we have attended weddings, family dinners and my birthday dinner together after this break up. I'm in conflict as to whether I should start dating again or if i should hold out until things get better with her. I feel in my heart I should wait but I have a small burning itch to get myself out there again. "

Maybe they're not conventionally ""hot"" or anything, but what do you think about those people where you see them and you just get this gut feeling that you just *mmmph*. This always perplexes me, because sometimes there will be a girl that I see and just *feel* something towards her. Like yeah she's cute but something is making my heart race when I look at her. I'm having a hard time putting it into words. Also I've had a few to drink."
