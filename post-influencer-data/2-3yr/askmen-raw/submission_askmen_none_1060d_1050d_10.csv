1,"When do you tell your partner (romantic partner) you are a superhero.


Dating someone for a few weeks now. Running out of excuses to use when I have to save the city. They are a detective so they'll figure it out one day, but I want to be the one to say it. How long do you normally wait? I trust them and am heavily considering telling them soon and putting their life in danger so I can stop all the lies and not carry this burden alone"

When I was 13, my friend had a mom with huge tits. I used to sneak one of her bras, smell the cups of it and nut in them. Yikes. 


EDIT: judging from everyone else, I don't think I'm as weird now. :) thanks sub!

8,"Guys, what's a sickeningly cutesy thing you do in regards to your SO, but wouldn't ever admit to for fear of seeming clingy?


For example 

-Me and my SO are long distance, when I can't sleep I'll form a row of pillows next to me so it feels like they're beside me.


-When I'm lonley I'll sometimes read through our Facebook chat log from a few years ago."
9,"What's the weirdest compliment you have received?


Last night I was wearing a pink checked shirt and and had this interaction with a drunk friend of a friend on the way to a club:

""Your shirt reminds me of a tablecloth""    
""Not really the look I was going for""  
*squeezes my upper arm*
""But by god you'd be a strong table like oak"""

13,"Guys that get the feeling that a girl isn't interested, but hasn't gotten a direct response where she says so, what's your approach? Did you ever get a confirmation?


So I was chatting with someone and seemed like it was going well and she was up for meeting up, but I kinda got the hint that she wasn't that interested when I tired to schedule something and she just said she was busy during those times and didn't offer to reschedule. She seemed like a cool person since we share a lot of hobbies (I know this point doesn't matter,  but I wouldn't be asking this question if it was for this point). I also get that she is a busy person, so the lack of being able to coordinate a schedule time is understandable. 

I figured there is two reasons as to why a girl wouldn't be direct.
* Fear the guy will take it badly and make her feel bad
* Don't really want to hurt the guy/make themselves feel bad for hurting a guy

What is your approach to this situation? I know most would just brush it off and move on, but has anyone gotten a direct response?

14,"Do you ever feel world weary, jaded with the state of affairs on our planet? How do deal with it?


I've been feeling it a lot lately and I'm not sure how to live with it or move beyond it.

EDIT: Wasn't expecting this much of a response. Thanks. I am normally an optimistic and hopeful person but I've been through a lot this year and I'm just trying to stay on the path to my dream. I love astronomy (thanks to Carl Sagan) and I agree, whenever I contemplate the scale of the Cosmos or the distance between stars, all our problems seem petty. 

I need to just enjoy the simple things with good company, let go of what I can't control, and do the best I can to be part of the cure, not the cancer. That's a life well lived and it's within reach right this second. :)

EDIT 2: THANKS! I feel a LOT better knowing there are a lot of ways to deal with this feeling. I am not being cynical, my compassionate heart hurts seeing so many suffer in such cruel ways. Yet, this feeling is the beginning of a life of service and action. I'm only 26, I can affect a lot of lives positively still. "
