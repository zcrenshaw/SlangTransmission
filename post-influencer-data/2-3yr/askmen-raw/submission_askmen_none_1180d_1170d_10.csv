0,"Do you ever get bothered by how much of your life is now computer usage?


I swear these days I don't know what to do if I'm not using a computer. I get up, check the internet, go to work, use a computer for 70% of my time at work, come home, cook, go to the gym, check the internet, go to sleep.

It seems so very strange that using electronic devices can become the 'normal' waking state for most of us now.

1,"I just turned 27, and I feel like I want run away and start over anew; a quarter-life crisis, I suppose. Has this happened to any of you guys? What have you done?


Last week, I turned 27. And it hit me kind of hard. 

To sum it up, I guess I feel like I'm living the last gasps of my youth and I'm staring down the barrel of eternity and a life of ennui. I know I'm not old yet, but it's coming. 

To start, I've been dating a girl (21) for about a year now. What began as a fling (with her being much younger than I and feelings of it couldn't work) turned into a very strong relationship.  I love her very much.  But at the same time, I'm bitter and jealous of where she is in her life, in that everything is still ""in front of her.""  I feel like that potential and ""what if"" wonder has passed me. 

On the career front, I'm relatively satisfied. I work full-time as a copywriter and run a small freelance copywriting business on the side. I love that I can make a career of writing, but I did/do always want to be something more than ""just"" a copywriter. Basically, my writing helps sell a product, whereas my goal is to have my writing be the product. My dream job would to be a columnist or author or what-have-you. 

My personal, non-romantic life is boring. A good chunk of my friends are married and are preoccupied with that.  The ones that are not are incredibly ""comfortable,"" and would rather spend their free times playing the same board games every weekend. My girlfriend dislikes these friends. She always says that they just spend their time ""sitting around and talking about the fun things you guys did four years ago."" 

And I'm not much better. I have no ideas to have fun. And I'm so risk-averse. I think this is partly because I had $80,000 in student loans (I've paid down $40,000) and I try to be as cheap as possible so as to throw money at the debt.  I feel like I can't do anything substantial because of it.  

Then there's Helen.

Helen and I met while I was spending some time in Barcelona a few years ago. I guess you could say we fell for each other, and had that sort of abroad affair people dream about when they are traveling. Honestly, the night I met her was probably one of the two or three best nights of my life. Summer Night. Foreign City. Beautiful Girl. It was like a beer commercial. 

We've remained in touch (via Skype and text) over the years. Nothing underhanded, mind you. My girlfriend was well aware of her, and didn't seem to mind, saying ""ehh, she's in Spain."" And Helen was aware of my girlfriend.  But recently, Helen has made some remarks about ""loving me"" and wanting to ""see me again"" and invited me to come stay with her in Barcelona. 

And this is where it all hits me. I'm so dissatisfied with my life that the appeal of leaving dreary Boston, my girlfriend, and my friends and family for a life in Barcelona seems so very appealing. But the pragmatist in my says that's impossible. What about a job? What about my debt?

But at the same time, I feel like if I don't do something to shake up my boring existence I'll spend the rest of my life getting more bitter and more disenchanted with everything. And the longer I wait, the more impossible it'll become. As it is, I just know I'll grow to resent my girlfriend and my friends. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this in their latter 20s? What have you done? Can anything even be done?

TL;DR: Dissatisfied with almost every aspect of my life (romantic, platonic, career, where I live) that I just want to start over. But I don't know what to do. 

Edit: To all the pedantic losers: Yes, I'm probably at the 1/3 point of my life rather than the 1/4.  However, quarter-life crisis is a more widely used term for this type of existential crisis in your 20s. 

Edit 2: I want to thank everyone for their thoughtful responses. I simply can't respond to everyone, but I have read every single comment on this thread, and it has given me a lot to think about.  

Edit 3:  I seem to have misrepresented my feelings towards my current girlfriend. I'm jealous, but not of her, so much as her stage in life. I want her to succeed, and I encourage her in everything she does. I just look at her at 21, and see myself at that age and get a little jealous/nostalgic/sad/etc. For instance, she wants to go back to school and I'm actively helping her in doing that. I want her to have the best possible life. But when I walk through college campuses with her, I can't help but feel I wish it was me going back. Make sense?

UPDATE: Wow. This post took off way more than I expected, and the majority of you had very insightful comments. I read almost every single one. Last night I sat down (alone) and tried to pinpoint exactly what was bothering me. 

Generally, it came down to the expected:

One: I was unhappy about the direction of my relationship, and I need to have a serious talk with my girlfriend about our future. She's coming over tonight.  Wish me luck. If we can't get on the same page, it'll probably be the end of us. But at least its better than me ""emotional cheating"" on her.  She deserves better. 

Two: I'm unhappy with my physical self. I was always very fit and active, and since dating my girlfriend, I've gotten out of shape. Tons of eating out and skipping of exercise.  I didn't realize how unhappy I was about this ""new"" me until I took the time to actually sort through the things that are bothering me. 

Three: I'm unhappy that I haven't taken the time to work on my longterm career goals. Coming home and drinking or going out to drink with her instead of working on my pet projects outside of work is no longer acceptable. That needs to change. I need to be a little more focused on the longterm. 

Four: And this was the most surprising for me, and I never even mentioned it in my post, but I kind of had a revelation. When I lived in Missouri, I felt a great sense of adventure and independence.  When I moved home to Boston that stopped.  The only difference I can think is the presence of my parents. I love them dearly. But they are dropping in/calling/texting/checking-in so much that it feels like I'm still under their thumb despite being 27. I've realized almost every decision I've made I've checked in with them first. Everything. And maybe thats what Barcelona represented, a chance to put an ocean between us.  And Helen was an excuse. 

TL;DR 2: It seems that I haven't been moving forward in any aspect of my life (financial, health, relationship, career) and that is why I'm so upset. Barcelona was an easy escape. I still want to visit, but I don't think its the answer to my problems. Thank you to everyone who helped!"
2,"When you ""read between the lines"" on somebody's dating profile, what do you really see?


We've all seen enough dating profiles to see certain lines over and over again, and to subconsciously categorize what these lines ""really mean"" when we read them.  What are some of the common phrases you see over and over again, and how does your brain filter them?

Here are a few of mine:

**Ask me if you want to know** - I'm used to being pursued, so I can get away with putting in as little effort as possible.

**I want a man who respects me** - I have sexual hangups, and I'm going to make you jump through a ridiculous number of hoops to even broach the subject.

**My kids are my life** - I'm exceptionally boring and have no interests or hobbies to speak of.

Edit: Girls, feel free to respond with your view on guys' dating profiles too!"
3,"Men, I'm getting married in 6 days, what is something you wish you'd done before or known for the big day?


I absolutely love my fianc√©e and we're throwing a down to Earth Comic Book wedding (her idea). Both of us are a little stressed as the big day is approaching, but we're keeping our wits about us.  This is our first marriage for both of us, so, hopefully, no drama there.  Both sets of parents have been pretty laissez-faire about the whole event, so I don't expect any issues. "

9,"Men, what was the best thing a female (SO or not) did that just made your heart melt?


I'm talking affection, hugs or just any other thing that made you happy to be alive."
10,"How do you feel about women who want to take on the dominant role in the bedroom?


"
11,"Men, what are things girls do that you find to be major turn-ons or just plain sexy?


A little added specificity. I'm talking to this guy and planning to hook up with him. I've only ever been with one other guy so my sexual experience is pretty limited, and I don't want to just blatantly ask him what he finds sexy because I feel it makes my job of turning him on and getting him going to easy. 

I have a few ideas of the things I could do or say, but I wanted to also have a few pointers of things guys generally find arousing leading up to sex and during."
12,"How do you feel about women who want to take on the dominant role in the bathroom?


Do you still leave the seat up?"
13,"Men in LTRs or marriages, how has sex evolved in your relationship?


I asked because I've noticed that I've always been a bit confused by threads on r/askmen about 'initiating.' I realize now that I've never been in a relationship for longer than 2 years, or the so called honeymoon period. It's a bit of a cliche that sex can diminish in an LTR, but I'm sure some of you have found ways to keep the heat going in your own way. "
