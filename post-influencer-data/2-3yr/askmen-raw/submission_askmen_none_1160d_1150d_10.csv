4,"Men, have you ever had a woman accuse you of being sexist or anti feminist and what caused it?


I was shooting pool in a bar last night and the girl about to play me mentioned she's not sure she remembers the rules. I super quickly summed up ""We'll shoot to see who gets stripes and who gets solids, then after that just shoot for your balls. We don't have to play call pocket."" I then got bitched out for a solid 2 minutes for 'mansplaining'. What the hell? Do I just not answer her question?

That was my first time ever really encountering the aggressive feminism I always see around reddit and I wanted to hear other guys' stories of it happening to them.

5,"How do you feel about the term ""mansplaining""?


I personally haven't encountered it IRL, but the word itself strikes me as alarmingly sexist and provocative when the word ""patronizing"" or ""condescending"" would do just as well. 

How do you feel about it?

*****

EDIT: The general consensus seems to be that yes, the term is inherently biased -- implying that only men are capable of talking down to the other gender is of course a sexist notion.

Most seem to agree though that its origins are entirely valid, and that there has been (still is, I'm sure) an issue with women being talked down to by men more often than not, especially in male-dominated workplaces."

8,"How do you think man kind will deal with climate change and its damage?


To me we seem to be on the brink of this disaster but no one is really doing anything to solve it. I'm just not sure how human kind will deal with even the modest challenges, take sea level rises, by 2100 some of our coastal cities will be underwater. I just can't imagine how mankind can deal with that, we're will the people go? Who will compensate them? How will they afford it?

Even those basic questions seem almost too big for humans to organize and grasp, let alone the substantial increase in global disasters, famine etc. look at what one instance of hurricane Katrina did to the world as a whole, that issue still isn't solved."

13,"Men-I keep seeing negative things from both men and women on askmen and askwomen. Let's say something positive. What are some positive non-romantic things you would say about women? Be specific!


As a man I work with mostly women.  I will say that at times it can be tough as one of the few men but mostly it is good.  I would say one of the main things I notice is they seem to give out positive feedback more often.  What specific things have you noticed?"
