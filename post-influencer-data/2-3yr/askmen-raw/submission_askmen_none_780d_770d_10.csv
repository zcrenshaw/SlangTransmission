0,"Dads of Reddit, I am expecting my son to be born today, what is something you wish you knew before your first child was born?

1,"What was the hardest adjustment you had to make when you first moved in with your SO?

2,"â€œWhat's a not gay way to ask him to go camping?""


So I just started a new job like 3 or 4 months ago and I don't really have any desire to hang out with anyone I work with, but I want to have some friends I work with. There is a guy who started right around the same time as me and moved cubical closer to me and he is actually really cool. We spend a fair bit of the day BSing, and I'd kinda like to grab a drink with him sometime after work. The thing is, I have no idea how to approach this and have him not think I am hitting on him or asking him out. Any ideas?

And just for clarity, this is in no way a sexual thing. Just want to bro down with him.

Edit: to be clear, the title is a park's and rec reference. I'm not literally asking him to go camping. Hind site being 20/20, I though it was funny and clever, it is in fact confusing. 

Edit 2: Upon further reflection, it is less about seeming gay, and more about appearing awkward. In my head it feels weird to ask someone to hang out for the first time. Is this social anxiety? Ii don't think I have ever had this before.

Edit 3: So I think game plan as of now is have my guy friends I don't work with meet me at a bar for happy hour and just say that I'm meeting some friends, want to come. "
3,"Men, do you ever have those times where you're very social and can keep a converstaion, then on another day it's the complete opposite to the point where you're stuttering just to think of what to say?

13,"How do you build/maintain attraction with your SO?


I feel like there's a lot of talk about how to get the girl of your dreams. But what about the next step, for men already in relationships whether it be new or old. What do you do to maintain a romantic relationship after the initial few months after meeting someone new? 

Or not necessarily romantic, but what can one do to make your SO feel attracted and wanted after all the initial magic begins to fade away when you've passed the first few months of getting to know one another. 

What are some things you do in your relationship that makes your SO feel loved and happy?
