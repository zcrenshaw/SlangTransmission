Falling so slow

6,"[Serious] How do I ""deal"" with my 10 year old son masterbating? Single mom here who grew up as the only child. No family to ask advice.


Edit: 
I didn't catch him in the act, I noticed a few things happening in the shower. He jumped off the ground or would get frazzled when I came by the door to let him know he was taking way too long in the shower. He also would come out with his penis very erect. 

I told him it's a normal and healthy thing that everyone does, just don't do it too much. Or else he might get addicted to it like video games, maybe I shouldn't have said that part.

Me and my SO have fallen into the trap of always initiating sex in the same way. We're beginning to find this a bit boring and want some different ways in which we can both initiate. "

12,"What are some red flags women should look for in men?


Recently I met a guy off a dating site. He seemed okay and we talked for a bit. 

He asked about my job and I told him, then I asked about his and he says ""Stock broker.. but don't get excited, I only pay for the first date. After that we go dutch for everything.""

That whole attitude turned me off. First of all he isn't the cutest guy, but I was willing to overlook that because he seemed nice/interesting and I can become attracted to someone over time. But when he said these things about his job and the way he handles money on dates I just got turned off.

For one, I don't care if you're a stock broker or if you work in retail, as long as you support yourself. Secondly, I have no problem paying my way on any date, but that statement combined with the first one about ""not getting excited"" just left a bad taste in my mouth... Like he thinks he's a prize or something just because he's a stock broker.

So I politely declined his date and accepted a date from a nice construction worker instead, and had a great time. Now the stock broker guy keeps sending me harassing texts about how women are bitches and won't give him a chance... I haven't replied or blocked him yet.

Are there any other ""red flags"" a woman should be on the lookout for? In my mind a guy who even subtly brags about his money is as annoying as a woman who only cares about money."
13,"How do you guys prevent the pain from holding in too many farts when you're seeing a new girl?


We all know you can't fart in front of a new girl until like 4 months and the sunk cost fallacy kicks in. So during those long hangout sessions just at one of your houses (no place to fart as you're walking away) how do you guys prevent that immense pain that inevitably builds up? "
