2,"When did you grow out of your ""drinking phase""?


I'm 23 and have a fairly large group of friends that have been getting together nearly every weekend for drinks since we were all in highschool. I'm starting to get fed up with it - it's the same thing every time. Waste money on a cab, get drunk while playing party games, go to the bar, waste more money on a cab, wake up regretting how you wasted the night and nurse your hangover for the day.



Maybe it's just worse now because it's winter so we're not able to break up the binge-drinking with bonfires / BBQ's / pool parties / beach trips but I'm getting tired of the same old routine (as is my girlfriend).


 When did you grow out of your drinking phase?"

5,"What are some fucked up things you've seen someone praised for?


I recently overheard a bit of a conversation at a Subway, where a young man (college student age) described one of his recent relationships to 4 friends (2 girls, 2 guys). He apparently got sick of the relationship after a week and instead of just ""manning up"" and breaking up with her acted like a dick for 3 weeks so she would break up with him instead. A couple of his female friends said he was ""slick"" and the group seemed impressed by his behavior. I feel like that's fucked up to string along someone in a relationship just because you are too immature to end it yourself. So Reddit, what are some things you thought were fucked up that someone got praised for?"
6,"Men who are good at flirting: how do you go from platonic conversations to more romantic/flirty conversations? How do you change the mood and see if she's interested?


25M here. My whole life I've been terrible at picking up girls. Only ever had one girlfriend and that was through online dating so obviously she knew my intentions from the beginning.

I've noticed a pattern to my interactions with women at social events like bars and parties: I'm really good at conversations as long as they stay on a platonic level. Not to toot my own horn but I come across as interesting, funny, full of stories, asking thoughtful questions, etc. People have told me this directly.

**However** this all goes out the window when it comes to flirting. I just can't. Don't know how to. My modus operandi is to immediately switch gears from platonic discussion to --&gt; ""GREAT NOW CAN I HAVE YOUR NUMBER, LET'S GO ON A DATE"". Which usually catches her by surprise and 100% of the time has resulted in awkwardness and a no (in my experience).

How do I gauge her interest without bringing out the big guns like that? I bet there are a few guys here good at this stuff, what's your secret.

On a last note, I am getting fucking sick and tired of advice like ""just treat women like people, gosh!"". As explained above I do treat them like people and it leads nowhere. I feel like I'm missing some key element of flirting."

9,"Fine Men of Reddit, do you always make a conscious effort to tidy up your living quarters when inviting a date or lady friend over to your place? Why or Why Not?


Does your 'cleanliness-level' vary based on circumstances? For example, it's a friend that you've known for a long time, a girl you're planning to hook up with, someone new you're just hanging out with to get to know better, a girl you're trying to impress, a study partner, etc. 

It's a question that's been bugging me for the longest time from and I'm just curious to know what goes through a guy's head when they prepare for inviting a female over to their place for whatever. 


Edit: Woah, didn't expect this many answers, thank you! Still going through all of your comments and am getting some interesting insights.

10,"What is your biggest regret in college and if you could go back in time what would you tell your younger more naive self.


I am just curious about this since I am graduating soon and very nervous. I have a job lined up already and have done well my four years here but There are still a lot of things I want to do with my few months left here but not enough time. One of my regrets is spending too much time doing work and progressing my academic/professional life but not enough emphasis on the social aspect of college which included joining more clubs and going to bars more. It would be interesting to know what your regrets are in college since you guys are probably a bit older than me and have had time to reflect on your four years in college. 

Edit: Wow! I didn't realize I would have gotten this many comments. RIP Inbox. I just posted this to see what others wish they would have done in college and to see if I missed out on anything. Thanks guys! I'll read all the comments and try my best to reply to as many as I can. 

Edit 2: I want to make an edit to my post. By joining more clubs, I mean finding ones that really mattered for me since the ones I joined were mostly miss for me and my friend group is initially from people in the same dorm and its been slowly growing since then. I'm not a huge bar person since I enjoy apartment parties and pregames much more. Bars at my university are awesome because they're a great place to socialize/hook up with girls but because of how expensive cover and paying for drinks is I try to limit myself to once every two weeks. I would say my biggest regret is not going to a single day of class for three years because I was too lazy and forming relationships with more professors. 

Edit 3: I will post this in /askreddit as well 

Edit 4: I just want to summarize the most common regrets shared by everyone:

1. The most popular one is finishing college and getting a degree that is meaningful and pays well. 

2. The next most common is to give the girl that's been hitting on you a shot and to not miss any signals(much easier said than done).

3. To socialize more during college and not be a hermit that doesn't make any friends his or her first year there. 

4. To focus less on partying/socializing in college and actually put more effort into the professional/academic aspect to get a good job to start. 

5. Life starts after college and it's important not to think it ends because it is likely the kids that say otherwise went nowhere after college. "
