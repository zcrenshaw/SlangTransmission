For context, you had a light breakfast the day you were stranded, and won't face physical repercussions, but judgement will be passed by your Island mates based on your cannibal etiquette. "

5,"Men, what is your least proud fap of all time?


This is a bit groce maybe but one time I was watching an amateur vid of a sleek, bouncy blonde babe pleasuring herself without any regard for decency at all and when I was realy goin at it it just struck me that she looked so much like my older brother's girlfriend that time. Well that only drove me over the edge like no fooks given and I believe I never came so hard like a phuckin oitta control hose but after that I was very ashamed cuz my bro's been nuthin but good to me. I tried not to fantasize bout her again tho.

And just last year well I've always liked older women and I realy am embarrased to say this but I may have fapped a lil to Kellyane Conway but its just a bit tho so yeah the lesson here is I like them blondes."

11,"How many of you are able to turn on and off your emotions at will, or sometimes not feel emotion when a normal person probably would?


Recently my five year old son fell down and fractured his humerus. It the break wasn't obvious at the time, but I observed his skin turned pail, he was shaking, he was obviously in a state of pain greater than I'd seen in any of my children before. We were close to home so I took the other kids back home so I could take him to the hospital. 

When my wife saw him she turned into a nervous wreck, as she always does in this type of situation. Afterwards she said how good it  is that I'm so clear-headed in these situations, because if we were both like her it would be a disaster. 

This, and other incidents like it, has got me thinking about my emotional response. In many ways I'm a reasonably empathetic person. But I do have an ability to switch off or on my emotions, and in some cases (like the above) I don't have an empathetic response when one would be expected. 

I know I'm not autistic or devoid of emotion like a sociopath. But I'm not sure to what extent this type of thing is normal in men, which is why I'm asking this question. "

13,"Dads of Askmen, how did your sex life change when your wife became pregnant?


First time dad. Wife is pregnant with twins. Haven't been able to see her in a sexual manner since we found out, hence, no sex since. Love and commitment is not an issue. I find the idea of sex is weird now knowing she's carrying babies. Has anyone else experienced this with their wives? Is it a phase? Is it normal?"
14,"Men of Reddit land, how do you feel about dating single mums?


I'm after your thoughts on this. Would you ever date a single mum with two kids? Would it be for short or long term .... or just a one night stand? If not at all, what would be your reasons for not wanting to.

The reason why I'm asking is that I recently left my husband and I have two children. I like to think that I am decent looking, intelligent and have a sense of humour...and I'm only 30 years old so not too young or too old. But I'm just wondering, that when I am ready to date again, will it be possible to find someone again. Or should I face the fact that I will probably be alone for a number of years in the future.

Edit: holy crap...I was not expecting this to be such a popular post - thank you to all that have responded so far. It will take me some time to go through it all. 

To the young men (generally 20s and teens (?)) Thank you for the input. I completely understand where you are coming from. If I was in my 20s again and had no kids, I would agree with you 100%. Just a side note - life doesn't always work out the way you planned. Don't limit your viewpoints too much. Thank you again for the input. 

For the people that have posted well thought out responses, both negative and positive, thank you. It's given me some things to think about. As I said below in posts, I'm not anywhere close to being ready to date at the moment, but this has been eye opening. So thank you to all. 

And apologies for the essay ðŸ˜Š"
15,"What's your ""screw it all I'm gonna treat myself"" meal?


What do you eat when you truly want to indulge?

Is it something you prepare yourself, or ready-made? Take out or at a restaurant? It it something you share, or something special just for you?

Recipe sharing welcome!"
16,"Why do I keep falling for female friends?


I haven't ever been truly shot down.

Only friendzoned.

Because the only girls I've ever fallen for are friends I'm close to.

 I don't understand. Some of my other friends think that falling for a close friend is utterly disgusting and incomprehensible, but I can't see it happening any other way. I have never been attracted to somebody I didn't personally know well. Sure I can see a cute stranger on the street, flick my eyes that way and enjoy the sight, but for someone whom I'd actually like to get to know better and get into a relationship with, I can't imagine it with anybody but a friend I was already close to.

Is something wrong with me, because it's not *some* - it seems to be **every** girl I get really connected to. Legit, you could probably figure out who I had feelings for by simply asking who my closest female friend was. If anyone's familiar with psychology, would be really helpful if I could figure out what's wrong with me if something IS wrong with me. Do I have some unaddressed emotional problems or something?
