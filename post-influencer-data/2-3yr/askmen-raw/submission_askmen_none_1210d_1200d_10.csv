1,"Going on a date with a girl WAY out of my league - how do I avoid royally fucking this up?


**EDIT:** Wow! Did not expect all this bro love. Thank you guys. So far I've received a lot of advice ranging from ""take an enema beforehand so you don't shit yourself during the date"" to ""imagine she has a 7-inch penis under her skirt"", but rest assured I'm reading everything. Also, I'm fairly sure she's real because she just gives off a feminine vibe, I feel like I could tell if it was a guy. Either she's genuine or this dude/troll is putting on a show worthy of an Emmy award. We moved our date up to tomorrow to the aquarium, so I'll let y'all know how it goes...

--------------------------------------------

Me, 25 years old, pretty inexperienced at dating. Not a stud at all - short, Indian, weird face. Didn't even get a peck on the lips until I was 23. Have had only 1 girlfriend and - you guessed it - she left me because I didn't measure up to her physical standards and she ""couldn't take it anymore"".

Yeah. Just to paint a picture of where I am realistically.

I was browsing OKC last week and came across this bombshell of a girl. We're talking Instagram model type girl. Like guys-would-stop-their-conversations-and-stare-as-she-walks-by level. At first I was pretty sure she was a troll or bot, so I sent off some jokey bullshit message. Surprisingly she replied... then I replied... then she replied... on and on for days. She's quite intelligent and witty.

We've made plans to meet on Friday. Now I've had some online dates but the girls haven't been nearly as hot and smart, and even then they always sent out the vibe of ""ugh, I guess I'll meet this loser"" instead of actually looking forward to being with me. Unlike the rest of my OKC experience, she actually sounds like she's interested and excited to talk to me.

My insecurities are really kicking in at this point. I don't want to go into the date with spaghetti flying everywhere, stammering, being a tryhard, etc... but that always happens to me.

Please help! How do I avoid making a fool out of myself?"
2,"Men dating someone famous, how's it working out?


Anyone have an experience dating a girl who is well known? I am not talking about Angelina Jolie or Beyoncé status (that's probably a whole other psychological thing), but a girl who is more Internet/IG/Tumblr famous? 

If so, how did it work out? Did you get jealous of all the guy ""followers"" online? Did her ego play a role in the relationship?"
3,"How common is it for the guy to go down on a girl during a casual hook up?


Reading another thread and a guy said he never goes down on a girl if its just a casual hook up.  Got me thinking, is that majority?

EDIT: Holy shit... I didn't know this many people would come in here!  But thanks for everyone who answered!  It seems like most men either would 1). go down on the girl or 2). just wouldn't do oral in general during a casual hookup.  

First time having a post with so many contributors, so I also learned how scary reddit is when sexist men disagree with the way you ask questions in a thread :/"
4,"What does rough sex mean to you?


I'm meeting up with a girl I've been talking with for over two weeks now. The sexual tension is pretty high. It'll be a pretty great release, but she's into rougher sex and mild domination. She told me she doesn't expect me to make love to her. 

I've asked her what she likes and she's been pretty vague, but she's always made clear she doesn't want me to be gentle. What would rough sex be in this case? 

Thanks for your advice, guys. I appreciate it."
5,"Kinda older girl here. I got asked out by a 22 year old. What do younger guys into older girls expect in dates?


[deleted]"
6,"A guy slapped my Girlfriend's Butt, and made a sexual remark, how do i approach the situation?


My GF (19), was talking to a friend, when another guy who she knows, but not well, slapped her ass, and she left the area. An hour later the guy messaged her on facebook saying, i hope that left a mark for your bf to see. How do i approach the situation, or if he comes to her again?

•She got nervous, that he would touch her again so she left the area, and called me,its long distance relationship, NY-Boston, but im going to an event thats a few days long in boston, so i'll be with her and the other guy is attending the event also."
7,"Seriously, what do I need to teach my son about cleaning his penis?


Hey Dudes!
My son is 4 and I have begun teaching him how to bathe his own self. He's awesome and I'm really amazed that he's caught on quickly to the ideas of cleaning his body and respecting his body and other people's body too!

With that said, it has dawned on me that I don't *really* know anything about a penis like someone who has a penis should know. Lol. 

So men, what should I be teaching him about taking care of his penis? What types of soaps should he not use? How long should soap ever be on there? Should soap ever really be on there? (Those of us with vaginas have to be really careful about the soap, lol)

Please leave advice for both circumcised and uncircumcised penises!

Thanks

Did you know right away you were being manipulated or did it take some time?"
9,"Women of r/AskMen: Why do you like hanging out here and what is you favorite thing about this forum?


"
10,"How is 'being a man' different today then it was in previous decades?


This conversation came up from an ask reddit post and I wondered what 'made men, men' decades ago compared to now. One of the examples was that now, men are encouraged to show emotions whereas 50 years ago this was a lot less common. 

I find it really intriguing to see the pressures that are put on men and I feel like it's something that is often overlooked so I just wanted your thoughts and experiences.

Edit: thank you so much for all the responses. They have really opened my eyes and I have learnt a lot. You guys are great."
11,"What are things you do during sex that you reserve only for an emotional relationship/someone you care about - and not for a random hook-up? why?


"
12,"How can I talk to my boyfriend about lasting longer? NSFW?


He used to take these testosterone pills that made him last longer, back when we first got together. It got to the point where he lasted too long, and I physically couldn't handle it, so I asked him to stop taking them. 

But it's been a while, and he doesn't last long.. at all. And I mean, it's GREAT. I just wish it lasted longer than a minute. I've tried getting him to have sex every day, or even every other day, so that he will end up lasting longer. But he works a lot and has a lot of chronic back and leg pain, so it hurts him too much to do it too often. 

I guess I just need some advice on how to -nicely- ask him to start taking them again? At least for a little bit. I know guys are really sensitive about that subject and he's extra sensitive about everything. I don't want to hurt his feelings or for him to think I'm not enjoying anything. Ya know?"
13,"MOD POST: A Guide for Summer Redditors


Sup Shitlords,

So in the weeks to come, we will have a bunch of fresh-faced high schoolers and collegiates flocking here because they're bored and want to bitch about whatever girl accidentally looked at them on the bus or something.  And even though some of us might be tempted to bitch and whine and make shitposts about how much they all suck, it's important to remember that you were once (or probably still are) a fresh faced idiot who wants to bitch about unrequited love that you're too stupid to act on.  So in the spirit of being welcoming and shit, here's a guideline for your newbies about things you should keep in mind.

1) READ THE GOD DAMN FAQ.  Here, [I'll link it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index)  It's also on the sidebar.  

2) READ THE GOD DAMN SIDEBAR.  Please.  If you made it this far in the post, then you can read the god damn sidebar.  It's not that hard.

3) No personal attacks.  Keep it kosher.  Just like me.  

4) No negative/forever alone rants.  We get it, you're a troubled soul whose life lacks meaning without your gothic fairy princess, but please keep that shit to yourself and your livejournal.  

5) NO GIFT POSTS.  SERIOUSLY.  

6) Do not make posts asking about a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.  Just ask them out, no not all guys are like that, yes you're the only person in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD who does the thing you think is weird.  There, I answered all your stupid specific questions.  

7) NO AGENDA POSTS.  Women suck, the government is out to get you, and Chad takes all the nice girls away from you with his superior good looks and people skills, but please stop bitching about it.  

8) USE THE REPORT BUTTON IF YOU SEE ANY POSTS THAT VIOLATE NUMBERS 2-7.  Make Askmen great again.  Although we were never really that great, so it's more like ""Make askmen tolerable"".

9) Please, for the love of god, do a search before posting.  Any frequently asked questions will be taken down.

10) Please make sure you're actually asking a question when you post.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4hqelu/mod_post_can_you_please_phrase_the_title_of_your/) for more information.

Edit (courtesy of /u/bfg24):

Also, we know it's a stickied post on the front page of AM as we speak, but for the love of god, PLEASE ASK A FUCKING QUESTION

Seriously, we have had at least two dozen people in the last week complain their post hasn't gone through when it's not even a question.

Example:

""I need advice on books"" is not a question.

""What is a book you've enjoyed recently?"" is a question. Note that this sentence ends in a question mark.

11) No cucks.  

Now let me take the time to answer some of your questions, because I know you have them.

Idiot: RK, did you just list off all the sidebar rules?

**RK: I did!  It's almost as if doing all of the things in the sidebar makes everyone's lives easier.  Crazy.**

Idiot: My question isn't about a specific person.  I just want to know why all guys abandon me after blowing their load inside me.

**RK: Then your post is an agenda post, and should be removed anyways.  But it's probably because you're a bad person.**

Idiot: I want to buy my boyfr--

**RK: NO GIFT POSTS JESUS FUCKING CHRIST**

Idiot: But it's not about a specific person.

**RK: Yes, it is.**
