0,"What would your dating life be like if you could see in four dimensions?


"
1,"If your sexually active girlfriend randomly said ""No sex before marriage."" What would you do?


Implying marriage is 3+ years away.

My girlfriend hit me with this question last night.
""Hypothetically if we completely stopped having sex until marriage would you stay with me?""

Mind you we're 20 years old. I don't know when marriage is even on the table. She claims she doesn't want to be married anytime soon. And we've already been fucking like rabbits for 10 months. She literally changed her birth control so we could do it more.

I said ""Yeah, I would be very unhappy being sexless for 3+ years.""

This upset her to the point of tears. Saying I only want her for sex etc etc. I just want sex. It's not the only thing I want. I like plenty of other stuff about her she just won't listen. I don't see how completely removing a part of our relationship would help anyone. A part of our relationship that we both enjoy. Sometimes she just shows up and asks to get fucked. She's a very sexual person.

I just don't see why she'd want me to say ""Yes I'd be okay with being in a sexless relationship for 3+ years."" I'd just be upset and frustrated I don't get it.

EDIT: For those saying this was a shit test I intentionally answered honestly. Cause I don't see the point in lying.

EDIT: She called me wanting to talk about the situation. I wanted to wait until she wasn't at work cause she's going to cry the whole day now and fuck her job situation up. I want her to be employed. But she poked and prodded until she got the idea that I was trying to break up. She's now crying hysterically at work and she's headed to my house after she gets off.. I don't know what to do."
2,"What is the optimal way to spread cold hard butter on bread without damaging the bread?


Without heating up the butter or bread, obviously."

5,"Guys who get together with chicks on Craigslist: How is that going?


"
6,"What's a ""gender issue"" that's really just a people issue?


Couldn't phrase it without quotation marks.

Basically, what's an issue that is attributed to gender, but is in reality related to the people rather than the gender?

Rough Example: ""Men are sexist and don't respect women"" is really just about assholes rather than men in general."
7,"What is something that women can do, that absolutely amazes you?

8,"What was the most romantic moment you've experienced?


Edit: Thank you for all the replies! My moment is more my happiest than my most romantic since it was my only interaction with a girl and I had a crush on her for nearly 4 years.

She was driving and singing in her beautiful voice at night. I had the courage to ask her to eat dinner with me and she offered to take me home, since I couldn't drive yet. Just being with the girl I've been crushing on since my freshman year left me ecstatic. I was mesmerized by her wonderful singing and I couldn't help but smile and stare endlessly at her. I only wish I made a move on her to show that I was interested before she cut me out of her life."
9,"[nsfw] where do you put your dick when you have to sit on the toilet?

10,"How do I get over the dating-is-a-pain-in-the-ass feeling?


I just can't escape it. Every time I think about trying to start putting myself out there, I get the overwhelming feeling that it's all just such a pain in the ass. So much work every step of the way: trying to set up dates, entertain all night long, keep conversations going, etc etc. It feels like pulling teeth and I know it shouldn't feel that way.

Has anyone managed to get over this type of feeling?"
11,"Hey guys. What is your hobby/ an activity you would suggest trying?

13,"Men of reddit, when your wife is not around, what are your true thoughts about the trebuchet?


"
14,"Have you ever fallen for a girl who isn't your ""type"" and what is your story behind it?


Have you ever fallen for a girl who isn't your ""type"" or who you wouldn't normally consider attractive?

I know, I know... Beauty is in the eye of a beholder, but have you ever been surprised or fallen for a girl that you didn't initially find attractive at all and wouldn't make the move on if you saw her in a bar? This sounds stereotypical but it's true in most cases, people of similar attractiveness date each other (like I said, I'm generalising) but I want to hear your story, if you have one.
