0,"At work today, I was told ""man up &amp; take that jacket off"". What are some other arbitrary/stupid ""manliness rules""?


"
1,"What would you do if a deaf girl asked you out?


I am a 19 year old hard of hearing girl and I wear hearing aids. I want to date but I'm worried guys my age would be embarassed to have a hearing impaired girlfriend. Given that you are close to my age (or reflecting as if you were) would you date a deaf girl? What are your opinions?"
2,"What have you (men) done in long term relationships (longer than 5-10 years) that kept the spark alive, made her feel desired, loved, and not like she was being taken for granted?


Edit: thank you everyone for the really thoughtful responses. I've learned a great deal. "
3,"What unrealistic expectations do young women have about dating?

4,"Lenin is a game played by an adult and one or more kids. Lenin lays down on a bed and pretends to be a mummy, kids quietly serve as Guard of Honor at the entrance to the Mausoleum (bedroom). Fathers of Reddit, what games did you invent to get your kids to do something?


"
5,"I'm a girl moving in with 3 guys for University. Shared house. Any tips on what to expect/what to talk about before we move in together?


* We're all between the age of 19-21.

* We all know each other and are mutual friends.

* I've lived in a house full of women (mum, grandmother) for years. I've never lived with a bunch of guys before. 

* I had a short 'thing' with one of the guys, like very short, but since then we're just friends, though many of our friends think it's going to be weirder. Weirdness aside...

Any tips on what to say to them such as ground rules, etc? Anything I should know about before moving in with 3 dudes?

6,"Gay men of Reddit: What percentage of the men you know do you want to have sex with?


"
7,"What things you wouldn't have guessed about women, until you started dating?


I learned how offended they get when you turn down sex or how much hair falls from them when you start living together. "
8,"I'm apprehensive to approach girls because I always hear about how much they hate being hit on. How can I talk to someone without ruining her night?


Hopefully this doesn't come off too sadboy/forever alone, but it's what I find myself debating in bars, subways, etc. The girl I'm about to talk to is probably having a fine time by herself or with her friends. Isn't it rude to interrupt that nice time?

I have a few very attractive female friends, and probably about 1/3 of the times they go out, one of them comes home upset because a guy was creepy or aggressively hitting on them. Being horny or wanting a girlfriend is not an excuse for me to ruin a girl's night."
9,"I bent down to tie my shoelaces this morning and just started crying. What are some signs you need a break?

14,"Men, what are some (seemingly) little things that have landed you in the doghouse and how did you get out?


So I'm in the doghouse for an overly dramatic slow clap when the girlfriend dropped a pitcher of sweet tea and it spilled all over my kitchen before I grabbed the paper towels and swiffer to clean it up. 

Let's hear your stories."
15,"What was the shortest date you've been on and how did it end?


Aside from the one you went on with my mom that immediately ended in the bedroom because she couldn't resist your monster dong."
