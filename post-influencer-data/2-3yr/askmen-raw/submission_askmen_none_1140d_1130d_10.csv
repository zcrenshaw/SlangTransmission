0,"What made you realize life was not fair?


"
1,"My whole life i wanted to be TRex, but now that im older with a degree ive come to realize there is 0 demand for the Tyrannosaurus Rex. What the next best thing i can do and why?


all those years of roaring and marching around in the backyard, i dont want them to go to waste......"
2,"How would you feel about 1hr naps being allowed at your work place?


"
3,"What do guys really mean when they say ""Women can have sex whenever they want?""


I see comments like this all the time on reddit. ""Women have it easy because they can go to the bar and someone will always take them home."" ""Women can just text any random guy 'Hey wanna have sex' and he'll be at your house in two minutes.""

These statements always kind of make me roll my eyes because what I hear is, ""Any (attractive) woman can have sex whenever she wants."" Like, hi there, average and ugly women exist also. I'm a normal looking 28 year old chick, not overweight but not toned, B cup, and I have NEVER gotten the impression that my sexual opportunities are overflowing and only a text away. I always thought that ""easy sex"" is something that is reserved for attractive people, men and women. 

So are men always inserting an unspoken ""attractive"" in to these statements about women getting free sex thrown at them, or am seriously underestimating most men's desire to have sex whenever possible? Thank you for indulging my curiosity :)"
4,"What attracted you to a woman that caught you off guard?


"
5,"Men who are happy with their significant others, what is a flaw of your partner and why is it not a deal breaker in the end?


I think it would be healthy to read examples of coming to terms with imperfections with the women (or men) we love. "
6,"Men of Reddit: My (now ex) girlfriend admitted to me last night that she was faking being in love with me and thus has been using me for 5 months. Has anyone else here been through this and what did you do?


Edit: Here's how she used me, since people will be curious:

In this case she works as an au-pair and gets treated like crap and is made to work long hours.

We saw each other every Saturday which she saw as a good way to escape from the family she's with.

I also offered to have her move in with me so she could get out of the situation.

Effectively, she used me as an escape from that situation. She liked me but said she wasn't in love with me and faked being in love with me.

Edit2: As much as I appreciate it, I'm not here for advice or sympathy. Genuinely curious what other people have been through. :)

P.S. My plans for tonight are having a stiff drink and checking out the new tapas bar that opened last week."
7,"Would you prefer a nuclear war or zombie post-apocalypse situation? Why?

8,"What cringe-worthy things have you done after a breakup?


"
9,"Men who have cheated but were never caught or confessed during the relationship, what are your thoughts and feelings on your infidelity now?


"
10,"For frat members - Are initiations in frats as crazy as they seem on tv? What was your initiation or the craziest one you know of?


Apparently hazing is the correct term and not initiations "
11,"I think a girl might be trying to get me to knock her up, how do I proceed? (Nsfw)


A girl I've slept with a few times now tends to want to rub my cum on her pussy. It seems to be a genuine in the moment response, she rubs it everywhere, but a part of me thinks she might be trying to get knocked up. She always wants to go to the bathroom soon after too, which I know is very normal but I fear she might have bad intentions. Usually at this point she'll have cum on her face and or chest.

I've stopped her from rubbing it on herself, and I tell her to wipe clean before going to the bathroom so I'm OK for now (99% should be anyway). Do girls do this though? Is this a thing? I've never been in this situation before so I want to know if I'm being paranoid. I quite like her so I don't want to make wild accusations or stop seeing her unless she's a legitimate threat. She's 26yo with a good family (she says) and a history of mental illness.


Edit: Thanks for the replies. I think I already knew the correct answer but needed to hear it from other people. Cheers lads"
12,"What Was a relationship red flag that you ignored and how did it effect the relationship?


"
13,"men, whats the job that you were treated the worst\hated the most but you kept doing it anyways until they fired you?


For me I had a few contract jobs that were basically sweat shop mentality and people were backstabbing where management had their favourites. Worked my ass off at both and got fired out of nowhere."
14,"What is the biggest lie you've told?


Extra points if the lie is still going "
15,"I never cut myself when I do not use shaving creme. I always cut myself multiple times when I use shaving creme. What is the point of using it? Am I doing something wrong?


"
16,"as I'm growing older, I'm not advancing anywhere career wise and all my friends are moving forward - marriage, house, kids. I feel intimidated to hang out with them (or even hang out with new people who are very far in their careers) and start ghosting because I feel we have nothing in common. [tmi]
