What age were you living on your own doing what you want to do. What did you do to get there? Whether that being college military technical school just knowing people. "
5,"Gay man asking here: Do Straight men get the same rise out of women's midriff showing?


Like when a dude's shirt barely raises we all tend to go nuts ( ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) it's just oddly .... Arousing?

Are straight men the same? Anything in particular to why or why not?

I've actually never asked this of my straight bros so I'm quite curious now haha

Edit: oh my word. I would say don't drink and Reddit folks, but the results from the post cured my hangover. 

Thanks hetero broseidons. It's evident we all love the ""stretch and reveal."" It's the things like this that unite us in the world at the end of the day.... Or the shirt line."

9,"How do you convince a young-man's brain that getting laid is NOT the most important thing ever?


Be it teenager or a guy in his mid 20s, I feel like society makes us believe that our worth = number of sexual partners. Not only do we often end up objectifying women, but also we feel worthless if we can't manage to have sex with them. Earlier I thought it was just puberty and all the testosterone, but I'm starting to think it's more of a social-pressure problem. Be successful = have sex. Have sex = be successful. Right?

How do you make our brain stop with such a self-destructive way of thinking?"

I was just stuck behind somebody who had these on their truck. I'm really curious what lead you to believe that dangling a ballsack is necessary. 

For those who haven't seen it, here's an example of what I'm talking about;

13,"How can I support my BIL through his divorce?


My sister is divorcing her husband after being together for 15 years, and they have a toddler together. I grew up with him always around and view him as a brother. He really is a great guy and my heart is breaking over this.

My sister has told me some of their issues over the past couple years (losing attraction, dead bedroom, getting bored) but recently told me she is also seeing someone else (before she started the divorce process). I can't stand cheaters and I hate what she's doing. 

My BIL is messaging me a lot now, venting mostly and once asked if she was lying about her whereabouts (we went out for her bday, he thought she was with the other guy). I try to do my best to confirm that, yes this all fucking sucks right now but you're strong enough and you have your son to focus on. He's a mess though, suicidal as well. I invited him out to grab a beer with me and my husband, but I feel like I could do more to help. 

Sorry this turned into a wall of text, it's just been eating me up inside and I want to do what I can to support him. Any advice?"
