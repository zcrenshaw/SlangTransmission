0,"My Wife of almost 17 years just passed away suddenly at 36. She was the only woman I've ever loved. I have 3 kids and a Nuclear War with Her Family. What should I do?


We were having a fight for a few days and i moved a few things over to a friends. Two days later my phone rings from our neighbour asking why there is a fire truck and ambulance at my house. My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.

I don't know if this is the right sub.
There is so much more to the story.
Is there anybody out there? I am reaching out to the internet for this as i am stumped legally and so much more.
I am in Canada if that matters
Kids are now 14, 11, and 5
In complete electrifying terror. I miss my Woman so bad. She was the only person I could talk to because we ""got it"" in terms of life. Pressure somehow got to us.
Trying my best here. Sorry if formatting is bad I am all over the place. There were no abuse issues in the house. Some arguing about chores/ video games/ etc.

1,"I left a pineapple under my friends dorm room pillow. Now that it's winter break, he mailed me a piece of pizza from across the country. How do I respond?


For months we've had a running joke relating to pineapple emoji. I decided to escalate by buying a pineapple, getting his roommate to let me into their room, and leaving it under his pillow.

A few days ago we were texting and he was eating pizza and I said that I wished I had pizza. Today I get a package from literally halfway across the country and it's a piece of pizza wrapped in tinfoil. 

How do I properly escalate from here?"

4,"Do you sing the word ""nigga"" when listening to music?


I know it's a silly and random question but as a black dude I always wondered if white people sang along to the word if it's In a song if no black people aware around.  "
5,"In my mid 20s, what books do you recommend for me to read?

6,"/r/AskMen: How do you sleep comfortably with your SO? Where do you put your arms?


So, after decades of my wife and I spending each night spooning tightly together, I did something to my down shoulder (the shoulder I'm laying on) and now I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping comfortably. Last night we swapped sides of the bed (because my wife likes that we sleep spooned, too) but I still couldn't find a way to lay my arm that wasn't painful.

So, how do you do it?"
7,"A woman I had a crush on in high school recently got married and just asked me out for a beer. What's your ""The gods are cruel"" moment?


I mean it's probably nothing and I definitely won't be trying anything. I just find it a bit odd because I never get approached, much less from an attractive married newlywed. The gods are cruel lads."

11,"For those of you who asked for your S.O.'s father for his approval before you proposed, what did you say to him?


Did you have a speech planned out? Did you cut straight to the point? Additionally, how did it go? What kind of response did you get?"
12,"Do you ask a girl what she likes or wants before having sex?


I'll keep this short. I've been seeing this girl recently and we hooked up for the first time the other night. As a rule for myself I always ask a girl what she would like me to do. So of course I asked this girl the same thing, and she seemed puzzled... after the fact she asked me why I asked. And even said it was weird. And said it 'caught her off guard'. Is it really that 'weird' to ask? I always thought it was respectful. Thanks guys. "
13,"Gents, what are your 'I'm miserable but I'm going to listen to a sad song to wallow in my own personal tragedy' songs?

15,"When did you realize people other than your grandmother thought you were good-looking.


For the longest time, I never really believed people when they called me attractive/good-looking/handsome. My confidence was always low,I thought they were being nice, and most likely drove girls away from me more than anything.

So men, what point or moment was it that made you realize that it was them being genuine and complimenting you, and not just being kind. Mine (unfortunately) was over the summer when I messaged a girl I worked with, who I thought was way out of my league, and she immediately said she'd miss seeing my handsome face."
