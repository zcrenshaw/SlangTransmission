2,"Men, if a girl were to take you on a picnic, what kind of foods would you be excited to see that she brought?


[deleted]"
3,"You meet a girl on a date and she's significantly less attractive than her pictures suggested. What's the tactful way to handle this?


"
4,"Women of AskMen, what is the most interesting fact you've learned from reading AskMen?


"
5,"This is an actual question I have: When you jerk off, are you supposed to stop once your dick starts to ejaculate, or do you keep going till you feel you're finished?


"
6,"How to remove semen stains from walls?


Gentlemen, I assure you, I do not intentionally fire at the walls.  I have, however, noticed protein stains on the painted wall above my laundry hamper.  Judging by the direction of the splatter, I have determined some of my recycled clothing is dropping some precious cargo along its long-distance aerial route.  I have thus ended my daily b-ball routine, but am at a loss for how to address the damages with the least amount of effort possible.  Any advice lads? Cheers"
7,"What is cliterus? Where?

9,"So, men - what victories this week? Big or small, let's hear it.


I've identified the 'meditation room bandit' ... a sneaky person has been causing some drama by utilizing the *meditation room* at work for personal breaks. 

(We created the meditation room to allow for spiritual employees to get their thing done @ work, rather than going home to do it, or skipping it). 

Someone has been in there frequently with the lights off and a chair propped against the door. "
10,"When do you stop doubting yourself when dating a girl?


So does there a come a point for any of you guys where you start believing she might be interested in you? 

For example, I currently have a second date set up with a girl. The first date went incredibly well but her texts/chat since then have been pretty aloof. This is despite her suggesting the second date. My self doubt is kind of running out of control at this moment and I don't have the best dating experience so any advice appreciated."
11,"I'm a big fan of asses. What gif could instantly turn me into a boobman?


[NSFW]"
12,"Don't see a lot about grandpas on here. My grandad, a WWII vet believed that anime was Japanese propaganda and went out of his way to keep me and my two brothers away from it, what hillarious things did your grandpa do.


He didn't even care if we watched porn. Dude just really hated the Japanese and used to give us 30 Min GOAT rants on the Japanese alone when we asked him
about the war."
13,"How do I politely stop platonic guy friends from paying for me?


I've noticed that men - even openly gay men (obviously not interested in me) - tend to insist on paying for my drinks. I have tried various strategies like putting down money first, talking over them directly to the waiter (but the waiter always seems to side with the men), and even communicating directly. But no matter what I say, from 'I want to pay' to 'I insist' to 'Please let me pay for myself', I am often politely overruled. And I feel like it's bad form to make a big scene. 

How can I get people to take me seriously on this? These people are 100% not manipulative or even interested in me, they are nice people who just have a warped idea of how paying should work. "
14,"What problem, annoyance, or inefficiency do you wish society would just solve already?

15,"Those living with their girlfriend, how often is the sex?


 I'm having way less sex than I thought ever since I moved in with my boyfriend, I didn't do anything wrong, in fact, I'm doing everything right. The last time we had sex was 9 days ago. 

Yesterday was his birthday, I gave him an expensive gift and he was really excited, his friends came over for the party (which I paid and organized) and he was all over me the whole time so I assumed we were going to do it once they leave, but nothing happened, he went out with them and came back very late. 

I'm moving out this evening so I don't know if anything is going to happen, I feel like I've wasted my time and money for nothing this last 2 weeks.

Edit: For those messaging and calling me fat, no, I'm not. I'm 5'10"" and weigh 126 lbs so what are you talking about?"
16,"Let's ban men from this sub.


Fuck what /u/yoyo2016 thinks.....This is now a diving sub, and everyone knows the best divers are women because boobs are like floaties and allow them to rise to the surface easier."
17,"What's sex like when you're trying to conceive a child?


Might sound silly but I'm curious if it's different in any way.  Obviously no condoms or birthcontrol, do you feel different while doing it?  How does it feel to impregnate someone?
