0,"MOD POST: YOU ARE BEING USED...FOR CLICKBAIT


Sup shitlords,

So recently, it has come to our attention that posts in askmen are being [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLInFcV0vjk) as material for a sex+dating blog, which is ironic because you're all virgins who can't even talk to women so all this information seems tainted.  Now you might ask, ""RK, how do you know these articles are stolen from Askmen?"" which is a very valid question.  Well, the writer in question references a thread directly and [doesn't even bother quoting](http://i.imgur.com/hVdYRRA.png), as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/Cg2fhn1.png).  That ""weird reddit thread"" is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5xmn9f/at_what_age_did_you_decide_you_needed_to_settle/) thread.  That was our first clue.

Our second clue was them referencing quotes that one of our mods wrote, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/IZQR5wW.png).  We also recognized users from [this](http://i.imgur.com/EvmXrXH.jpg) post.  Now you might say ""RK, those posts could be from anywhere on the site"", but we know you guys are friendless parasites who only post here to validate yourselves, so these comments really couldn't have come from anywhere else.  Also, since I don't have a place to put this other screenshot, please go take a look at [this one too](http://i.imgur.com/hDQ6wmY.jpg).

Now you might be saying ""Wow this bitch needs to go down in a big way, I'm gonna go flood her inbox with pictures of my dick"" or whatever [juvenile response](http://imgur.com/fs8Eg85) you come up with when someone on the internet disrespects you.  But I am specifically telling you NOT to do that, and if we get a single PM of people complaining of harassment related to this, we will go straight to the admins, because doxxing can result in a site-wide ban, so [don't fucking do it.](http://imgur.com/a/0Yuzm)  No matter how [mad](https://i.imgur.com/LEmKh.png) you are, just remember that if you respond, a writer like this will take the responses and surely make an article about it no matter how much we want her to [stop](https://i.imgur.com/GDydgmJ.png).  Living well is the best revenge, so just take comfort in the fact that your responses are [insightful](http://imgur.com/mXyupD1.gif) enough for someone to take them and make a living off of them. 

So in summary: Writer stealing content, don't do anything.

Thanks and [have a blessed day](https://i.imgur.com/ji3rn9k.mp4)!

EDIT: Oh right, in an effort to make it more difficult for you to embarrass yourselves, we are locking the comments.  "

3,"Guys, I woke up and saw a spider on the covers. It moved and I can't find it. What do I do?


Do I just burn the house down? Or just leave the house for good?


Send help pls.

Update 1: I got ready for the day, and came back to Gonzalo sitting on the bed. He seems tired, I think his *spinning* class wore him out this morning.

Update 2: I put him in a Clif bar box I found. He seems cozy in there. I'll add some grass and what not when I get back from lunch. Turns out he enjoys Elton John so I've been playing that for him.

Update 3: Put some grass and flies in there for little Gonzalo. Will try to get pics later. Changed the tunes to the likes of Led Zeppelin. We'll keep going with this classic rock selection and see how much he enjoys it. Gonzalo said earlier: ""It *bugs* me that they don't make them like they used to,"" when asked what he thought of classic rock. I think we'll be good friends.

Update 4: Played Led Zeppelin IV for him, he really liked that one. He complimented me on my music choices. Started playing something completely different, Fleet Foxes, and I think it's slowly growing on him. Going to buy some edibles for us to eat after work, he seems the type to enjoy getting high.

Update 5: Came home from work. Gonzalo was still chillin like a villain. He hadn't eaten any of the flies yet, but I think he did drink up the soaked cotton ball. He still seems pretty hung up on the ex though, so I'm taking him with me to my coworker's to get really drunk and help take his mind off things. More updates to come! (and hopefully pics, but I never use imgur or anything)

Update 6/Final: So, went to coworker's, smoked a ton and watched Archer and Rick and Morty. I fell asleep with Gonzalo in his room on the table. I woke up around 4 am and went to check on Gonzo, and he was gone. $20 was missing out of my wallet, but a note saying ""appreciate everything. so long and thanks for the flies"" was tucked inside. I'm at a loss for words because I never got to say goodbye. He talked about leaving again but I thought that was just the THC talking... I guess I was wrong. He was too good for this town, and maybe one day our paths will cross again. *cue Don't You Forget About Me*

Edit: still don't know what kind of spider it was, all I know is that it's small and dark brown. It likes classic rock, and has a good tolerance for THC. Also enjoys watching 90s sitcoms, so if you know any species of spider that matches that description, let me know."
4,"Why is it better when a woman swallows?


I've heard multiple men say that they find it very hot when I say that I like to swallow. What is it about swallowing that men like, and does it make a woman hotter? Do you think it makes you like her more? What if she refused?"

9,"Anyone go from fit to fat? Did you get depressed, and how are you doing now?


Just curious to hear other guys' stories.

I used to be a fitness nut. I competed in powerlifting at a solid 220 lbs and was seriously training for a bodybuilding competition. Lifted 6 days a week, ate painfully clean, the works. Then I had a severe back injury, aggravated an existing herniated disc. I couldn't lift at all, then I still couldn't lift the way I wanted to, and completely lost all motivation to do anything. I gained a lot of weight and developed severe sleep apnea, which made a comeback even less likely. 

I had a wake-up call this year when I tried to donate blood 3 times and I couldn't because my resting heart rate was over 100 each time. I made excuses the first 2 times (stress, too match caffeine) but couldn't deny I had a problem after 3 times. Weighed myself for the first time in over a year and was shocked to find I was 300 lbs. I took a good look in the mirror and was disgusted with what I saw. I took down all my old pictures because I couldn't bear to look at them anymore.

I'm on the comeback train now, got a CPAP machine, eating strict keto, and seeing a personal trainer. I don't feel the need to be that big and strong anymore, but I don't want to have a heart attack at 31. Down 15 pounds already and really trying to make this comeback stick. 

Anyone else go through something similar? How did you deal with it?

Edit - wow, strong responses! I can't respond to everyone, but feel free to message me if you want to chat. Best of luck to everyone's endeavors!"

11,"Guys who need a lot of space in relationships, how do you typically deal with a girlfriend who wants to spend more time with you?


I ask since my BF likes having a good bit of space and not a lot of texting either. When he doesn't try and hang out, I feel like he might like me less, etc. I need a little more validation than that honestly. Yes, I'm talking to him about this next time I see him. Just wanted more insight and perspective from guys who function like this.

* Would her wanting to see you more end up pushing you away? Does it not bother you? 
* Do you lose feelings if it happens too much, or conversely do you lose feelings/not think about her when you aren't around her? 


Pretty much how do your feelings and thoughts work with needing space, and how a good girlfriend should go about giving you enough space, but also potentially getting more attention/spending more time together without being pushy or coming off as clingy? Obviously  I'm going to give him the space he wants, but what's the best way to ask or talk about hanging out more? I definitely want him to initiate the hang out so I know I'm not forcing myself into his alone time. We've been dating about a month now if that means anything.


Might be the wrong sub, I dunno, sorry if it is. Thanks for any thoughts on the matter. Cheers :) 

Edit: Thank you all for the advice so far. It's seriously helped me out a lot, and pretty much everything comes down to understanding that it has nothing to do with me, and that communicating my needs and finding compromise is the best approach. Yall are wonderful. "
12,"Have you ever burnt out on online dating? What was that like?


I've been dating via tinder/bumble the past few months and I've got to say that I feel somewhat...exhausted. It's beginning to feel like an emotional rollercoaster and a meat market, and I'm getting disillusioned with it all. I get matches (though not tons) and it takes a lot of work for it to materialize into actual dates. If it does become an actual date, more often than not there isn't much of an compatibility. It's all kind of intense. I find myself speaking to european friends and longingly wishing there was more of that culture here in NYC, where I go to school - i.e. you slowly get to know someone and it may or may not blossom into a romance. I'm curious if anyone else can relate to this."
13,"Men who had/have crushes on a close friend, what happened?


I've known this chick for a few years now, and we've become pretty close friends, but I've started to develop feelings for her for a while now. 

I've thought about talking to her about it, but I'm actually not 100% interested in a relationship at the moment. Anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do? "

15,"What are things you can NEVER tell your girlfriend?


Been with my girl for 7 months and things are going great. I tend to get jealous easily but I feel like I could never tell her how truly insecure I am and how jealous I get because it's irrational and I don't wanna scare her off. Is this something I should just keep to myself?"
