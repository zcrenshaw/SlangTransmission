0,"Fathers, what are some of your best ""don't tell your mom"" moments?


"
1,"My neighbors have been complaining that I wake up too early. It's my first apartment. How do I handle this situation?


I wake up at 4am to go workout everyday. My neighbor said that my alarm clock and my car (I drive a 2013 Corolla) are too loud for her and the tenet downstairs.

I don't want to get evicted, but can't really change the time I go workout due to my work schedule and other commitments. How should I handle the situation? I live in Los Angeles, CA.

edit: I posted this in the morning and ended up having a call with my landlord this afternoon. I explained to her the situation and the noise complaint I got from my neighbor. My landlord basically said ""Are you serious?"" and that I'd be fine."
2,"For those who felt ""empty"" as teenagers, how did you feel?


My 17 year old son took his life a week ago. All of his family and friends were shocked. I had been worried about him, though. I didn't think he was depressed, but he seemed much more indifferent to life. He never was a kid who seemed to have much emotion - not unhappy or happy. (He wasn't on the autism spectrum.) He was well-liked, he was ranked #1 in his class of almost 500, he was athletic, and he was attractive (per his peers; I always thought so, too, but I'm biased). He had such a high ACT score that he was able to complete abbreviated college applications, and he already was received early acceptance to some colleges to study engineering. Paying for college was not a concern.

I'm not trying to brag. I'm trying to show that, on paper, he should feel good about himself, and confident about the future. But, he didn't/wasn't. He thought about the world and himself in black and white terms, and I truly think he thought he wasn't good enough. Even though everyone said he was the nicest, happiest kid they knew, I never thought he was comfortable in his own skin. He played a lot of video games in his free time, after school and sports. Video games seemed to be the only thing he truly cared about, and he did share with me that he wasn't looking forward to being an adult. He had his first job this summer, and he said he hated working.

Also: I did put him in therapy in middle school, because he wasn't eating. He said he thought he was fat; he has never been fat - he had a muscular build. He kept telling the therapist what he thought she wanted to hear, and she didn't see through it, so he stopped. His father was in his daily life, but they weren't close. He was closer to me than anyone, because I did see that he wasn't who everyone else thought. He has a younger sister and brother, and while he wasn't close to them, there were no issues. Friends liked him a lot, but they told me since he died that he never opened up to them. He really kept everything inside.

I am trying to understand better how he might have been feeling inside, which led to him ending his life. Has anyone experienced something similar?

(Sorry, I know this is a heavy, emotional topic, but I am a daily reader of posts here, and I have learned so much wonderful insight here.)"
3,"I'm getting married next year. My fiancé's family is much more financially secure than mine. Now they want to buy her a house. Guys that have been in similar situations, how have you dealt with it?


Hi All,

So my fiancé and I are getting married next year. Her family is very well off, whereas mine is lower middle class.

This week, her parents told her that they would be prepared to buy our first home (budget of 500k). As a result, we would need to sign a prenup. 

Now i know that this is a great opportunity to live mortgage/rent free, but the broader implications are not so comforting to me. We've already discussed the fact that this potential house will never be 'ours'. Rather, I'd  be living in 'her' home. In the event that her parents or siblings or family ever come to visit, I would feel powerless in this house and would not have any authority over it. Any construction considerations or other modifications would likely, I feel, have to go through her. 

Again, my fiancé and I spoke about how I feel and my discomfort to this potential scenario. She has assured me that we wouldn't go through such situations. Although I trust and love her, I also feel that she has grown up a little more naive and relaxed with her lifestyle. To be fair though, having myself grown up on the lower end of the income scale, I can't help but harbor these feelings of paranoia and emasculation from the idea of being taken care of by my fiancé's family. 

My current stance on this situation is that we should take the offered money and buy a home. This would take away a lot of the financial burden, especially after getting married. Moreover, we wouldn't need to pay for rent or mortgage and instead invest the money into saving up to eventually buy our own home together. The current home could then be used to rent out, removing myself to a degree from any sort of awkwardness that I would have felt by living in it. I should also mention that we both still live at home with our parents (both traditional family upbringings). We do however intend on moving out within the next few months before the wedding. 

I was hoping to know if anyone here has gone through a similar situation and how you handled it.

4,"My 14 year old sister died from a brain tumour. What are the things to help me cope?


I'm speechless, can't help but think I should have been a better brother when she was still alive. I have been depressed for some years now and this only makes it worse. "

8,"Aloof men of reddit, how do you pull it off when it comes to attracting women,dating, relationships, or whatever you call it?


I'm not shy. I'm not afraid to talk to women who I find attractive. The thing is I am just not really good at small talk. Sure I can, but I don't feel like trying too hard either. However, I still prefer face to face conversation and want to keep texting minimal. Consequently, when small talks don't happen naturally, it can be hard for me to connect with someone (namely a girl/woman).

Any insights would be appreciated.


Regards,

12,"Men in long relationship, what to do if your SO stand in the way of your life goals ?


I've been in a relationship for more than 4 years 
*(4 years, 2 months and 8 days to be exact)* 

Due to our social restriction and stupid laws based on traditions, we are not allowed to move together and obviously not have sex 
*(you guessed it, its a Muslim country)*. But we managed to fight our way through it, we can spend months without sleeping together, but whenever we found a chance, boy its good!

Now for the past week, we've been living together in a guesthouse in Seoul (we came here to spend a 20 days vacation) and as much as i love it, as much as i don't think that being with the same person 24/7 is something that i can do, i get bored, but most importantly i get very uncomfortable sometimes because i am very used to be 100% alone in my room where no one can enter without knocking, here we are living in this one single room where the only alone-time i get is when am taking a dump. 

So this alone is making me question if i still want to get married or not. 


But here is the real problem : 
 
Occasionaly we talk that if luckily i got my career going ([am a game developer](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/)) and needed to visit another country for a game conference or any other event, her immediate response is that she will not let me go unless she goes with me, which i know for a fact that unless we're married or she somehow got super rich, she won't be able to leave the countr *(we live in Tunisia and getting out is really hard, we're able to be in Korea now because its VISA-free for us)*

And i honestly can't stop thinking about this, i decided that i want to make games since 1999, and [i've been working **REALLY HARD** for it in the past couple of years](http://imgur.com/a/Mk1dh), its also one of my main goal to leave the country and live in a more secular place , specially now after spending few days in Seoul and saw how an organized society with mutual respect and advanced economy can work, i am more eager than ever to leave the shithole i live in. But my gf is doing nothing helpful toward that subject, in fact i am not so sure that she want to leave the country, she just want to get married. She also doesn't have any real goal in life, not a dream-career not a real hobby (i bought a piano for her last year and she barely use now -__- ), she is studying ""pharmaceutical sells"" in a private school which eventually will give her a very shitty job with 8h/day and **AT BEST** $400/month. But in the other hand, she is an AMAZING supporter, i know that i've been saying all negative stuff about her but i'll admit, from 2012 until 2014, i am 90% sure that i wasn't be able to do it without her, i was really depressed back then, and i had zero support from my family cause they know nothing about the gaming industry and me dropping out of college was a huge chock for them specially that i was a good student and all of a sudden i became *the atheist devil worshiper who left college to play games* 
Back then she was my only supporter, both morally and financially, and i am VERY GRATEFUL for that.

Nowadays am in my best shapes, am happy, i make enough money to fully support myself and buy all the goods i want, i gained weight! 2 years ago was posting on reddit crying that am a 21y.o male 172cm and i weight 50kg! now i weight 70kg :) 

But am in love with a person that whenever i ask her what do you really want to do in life, all she say is ""be with you"", and as much as love that, it fucken scares me! she's pretty and cute and all fun, but, come on, get something else to do!

And i really want to put that in her, when i met her, she was a very religious muslim girl, she even wore the scarf, she told me back then that she see Atheists as low-level people that doesn't even deserve to live, so i kept that hidden from her for the fist year, and kept working until i brought her to light ;) 
Since then she's became more secular than most of my ""Satanic"" friends (lol) 

So I kinda think that i am able to change her mind toward this ""lets get locked together"" attitude, but its not as easy as debunking a religion, cause religion is fake, bullshit and full of flaws but laziness and the absence of will are real things that grows up on a person and its really hard to get rid of. 

So Am hoping that some of you guys have been through a similar process, and maybe i don't have to make her a dreamer but i **MUST** make her understand that she can't stand between me and my goals, cause i'll definitely choose my goals instead. And doing so will hurt her SO MUCH in all levels, i am not only her SO but am her only financial supporter and if we break up (which is something that i don't want to do at all) she'll be all alone in a Society where most of its people will tag her as a thrown away bitch. 

------------------------------------

**TL;DR** 

You love someone so much, And you love your careers/Dreams so much, what to do to make that person not to stand between you and your goals ?


Thanks guys"
13,"Why is it socially acceptable for women to have sex toys but automatically weird whenever a guy does?


My best girlfriend told me that she is so ""weirded out"" that her boyfriend has a dildo. He is a straight man, but enjoys using a dildo to himself sometimes. She is really turned off about it, even though she has a high number of sex toys.

Was always curious. I don't think a man is gay if he likes using toys... pleasures pleasure.

15,"What off-putting Tinder messages have you had?


Just a quicky for fun. I just matched someone, she asked me a few questions. After I had dinner I checked Tinder again and she has sent a long message saying she hopes I am honest and not a liar. This is after less than 5 one-sentence messages sent by me. Can anyone top this for off-putting?

Update - she asks this because a guy chatted to her for 2 days, then unmatched her. "
