0,"Caught my girlfriend going through my PC and phone, how to handle this?


We've been dating for 6 months now. We don't live together. I'm 32(m), she's 24(f). This PC is a desktop/gaming rig in my bedroom.
So last night, she came over. We went to watch a movie (Into the wild) around 9. I fell asleep, and woke up close to midnight to her on my computer. As soon as she noticed me awake she quickly closed what she was doing and gets back in bed with me. Didn't really think anything of it at the time, but it's about half an hour after the movie ended.

A little later, I start to pass out again. I feel her get up and open my eyes to her starting to open either Chrome or going into files on the computer (Something with a white background), and again closes is it as soon as she noticed I was up. Didn't say anything, but seriously it looked shady as hell.

Now, this follows her saying earlier in the night that I was supposedly stalking one of her friends on Facebook. I knew who she was talking about because I had typed her friends name in FB before to find her when we initially started dating. Piqued my interest because I'd never met her, but talked about her often. The problem here is no one would know this unless she went into my phone or PC, went onto Facebook and looked at the saved browser history in the search bar.

I feel like both of these are huge breaches of trust, and were triggered for no reason. I've never asked to see her phone or laptop, we've never discussed this kind of thing but she knows I'm not the type of guy to hand this stuff over to someone. I don't think anyone has a right to any of this kind of personal information, either
Anyway...I feel a little put off by this. Borderline mad. What are your thoughts on what she's done.and how should I handle it?"
1,"I scored a date. I know shouldn't have but on a whim I found her twitter account, and its the most obnoxious thing I've ever seen. I don't want the date anymore. How to proceed?


Am I overreacting?!? On some level I feel as though this is grossly unfair to her. But then I reread the tweets she puts out....

Edit: this blew up like a basic bitch on twitter....

For those of you curious we met on OkCupid and talked on kik. Bonded over our mutual love of trance music and working in art.

Anyways I've given it a lot of thought and while I *do* understand why the overwhelming majority of you think I should run/ghost her, I have also been the recipient of ghosting, and being on the receiving end isn't fun.

I'm going on the date tonight. We'll see how much her overbearing single lady attitude on Twitter spills over to real life. Hopefully as some of you say, she is much more grounded and humble in person.

Finally to those of you advocating *hit it and quit it*. FUCK NO. This is potential crazy we're dealing with, proceed with intense caution until crazy levels have been assessed.

Edit #2: Guys I'm back from the date. It was shit, so so *SO* shit. I'm tired and pissed. Will elaborate tomorrow morning.

Edit #3: Here's the story: I show up at the coffee house/bar waiting for her and she turns up 30 minutes late. When she finally arrives, the first thing she says is that she pregamed before meeting me. Not the best way to start the date but here goes:

* Ask her if she wants something else to drink (makes sense to ask right?) *Are you implying that I'm an alcoholic?!?!*
* After that awkward exchange, we get to talking as our coffee gets ready. Immediately brings up that she got kicked out of her ex's apartment and that he is seeing an older woman who works as a teacher
* Called her mom trash at one point
* She talked about how her ex spread lies about her and I responded with a joke about ""fake news"" She immediately asked if I was a Trump supporting pig (her exact words)
* Have awkward talk/argument about the ""fake news"" meme
* After I convince her I am *definately* not a fascist, she talks about how she has never orgasmed. I don't know HOW we got to that subject.
* Try to change the subject to something chill like music and had the *GALL* to ask her if she knew about music outside EDM (which we had talked about alot through text) She promptly took my question the wrong way as me being sexist and presuming she didn't know shit about music.
* Any question I asked was mostly taken in bad faith.
* After 2 cups of coffee and some pastries she decides that she wants alcohol NOW even though she refused my offer before claiming that she wasn't an alcoholic.
* Give her credit, she finished 4 glasses of Sweetwater IPA. I only had 2. Also I had to pay for everything because I'm stupid.
* As she got tipsy, she decided to let me know that Linda Sarsour is a bad bitch. Demanded that I agree with her. I have Jewish friends so I said no.
* I fucked up by saying that
* She asked if I was privy to the whole social justice thingy. That conversation got really loud on her end.
* I'm pretty sure she tried to say ""don't be a tio Juan"" but she was too drunk to say the words correctly.
* At the end of the date, I offered to drive her drunk ass home and she got mad and told the poor server that I was acting predatory. 
* I made sure all tabs were closed and left.

PS I got called a rapey fuck boy on twitter

2,"I'm about to turn 25 and I still feel like a 15 year old. How can I grow up?

3,"How unapproachable is the hijab?


I wear the hijab, but I'm not very religious. It's really more of a vestigial feature of my religious past. I don't wear all the time (read: social outings, concerts, running errands, the occasional walk), but I wear it enough such that it is a part of my social and formal identity. When I do wear it, it's more along the lines of [this](http://i.imgur.com/l7d4f3w.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x7VgkV.jpg), with more hair showing.

I can't completely take it off because I'm still partially dependent on my family (even though I no longer live with them) and they would be severely disappointed if I took it off. I recognize that this is a problem, but it's an incredibly delicate, difficult and overall shitty situation to be in.

I don't really expect most people to be okay with it, but I'm wondering how it will affect my social life in graduate school. Part of me is looking forward to dating/new friendships as I start this next phase of my life, but the other part acknowledges that anything of the sort will be difficult at best.

**EDIT: Crazy how much this post blew up**.

Thank you all for the honesty. I think this whole thing pretty much just verified my suspicions, and I in no way blame or feel disdain for those who vehemently rejected the idea of me (contrary to what many of you lovely folk commented here). Still, this was informative, and I'll keep a lot of this in mind when I start grad school this fall. 

Just to clarify a few things:

- Yes, I am still financially dependent on my parents. I think it would be kinda dumb of me to cut ties with them when I have no way of supporting myself. Obviously, the hijab is something I will reconsider altogether once I can completely depend on myself in a couple years.

- I'm not actively looking to date someone. I'm also not just open to dating exclusively in one race/ethnicity/religion. I just wanted to gauge my chances at finding someone/anyone (friendship or relationship-wise) if I put myself out there, regardless of religion. 

- Because many of you were asking: Most people, in my experience, are very friendly toward me. I'm friendly back. I'm able to have interesting conversations with strangers (male, female, atheist, muslim, middle-aged etc.) that were not initiated by me. I have yet to have a hateful interaction with a stranger. I have actually been pleasantly surprised by how tolerant and accepting most of the people I encounter on a daily basis are. 

- I have been in a relationship before. But that was one that grew more from a friendship with someone with a similar background as mine. I have also been asked out before, by both Muslim and non-religious guys. Again, this happens more from becoming friends with someone over a long period of time than just straight-up being asked out. 

- Also most parents and families don't really give a shit what their kids do. It's all about maintaining an image, which is what the hijab all really is nowadays. I don't have a hoard of family members out to get whoever I date. In fact, my parents are pretty divided on the matter: one would love to see me get a boyfriend and often encourages me to date, and the other doesn't seem to care as long as I don't involve them. This is generally the case with most Muslim girls - pls don't assume we all come from traditionalist asshole families. 

*If you take a one thing from this mess of a post: idk just keep an open mind i guess. but i completely understand the hate.* "
4,"Too many threads about relationships on here, single men, sound off and tell us how its going


I'm settling into a new job, and starting to reward myself with nice things like a 4k TV, and adding to my book collection. I'm also trying to lose a bit of weight for my mate's wedding since I'm a groomsman and I wanna look good to make him look good. Going to go home tonight and smoke a few joints to season 11 of Trailer Park Boys, and maybe play some Darkest Dungeon. Importantly, I'm fucking happy.

Edit: It warms my heart to hear from all you lads, I wish I could reply to you all but alas, just know that you're never alone, take this thread as proof and reassurance that other single men are out there living the struggle, ready and willing to support each other."
5,"Guys who left an SO for someone else, what was your experience like and was the grass greener?


Like you left your SO for someone else. Did you end up regretting it down the line? Do you miss your SO? Is the new person's grass greener? If you could go back in time, would you make the same choice? "
6,"I'm always told I could have any guy I wanted. So why am I 30 years old and still single?


I'm pretty happy with who I am as well as what I have within and outside of me. I don't know how to say this without sounding like an asshole but I'm attractive, kind, funny, honest, a pretty good communicator - I always get ""Cameron Diaz in There's Something About Mary.""


But I'm 30 and have never had a real relationship. 


The past two guys I've dated are lovely people but after the initial few months of getting pretty intimate, they tell me I'm an amazing person but they still need to figure themselves out.


And then those turds linger until I'm like ""nah, bruh.""


I know there are 1 trillion more important things in the world than my Reddit post but I've been to therapy, asked friends and I can't figure it out. I really appreciate any insight or hard truths or even just mutual sympathy from anyone else in this same place at this point. 


Thanks, everyone. "
7,"Why do we find certain clothing/outfits more sexy than the naked body itself?


Like why is that we find women wearing thongs, lingerie, and other ""skimpy"" outfits--or even certain outfits--sometimes sexier than just seeing the naked body? Why is it that seeing these things on a women is more exciting than seeing full nudity? "

9,"my girlfriend is always on her phone, but when she's out with her friends she doesn't reply to my texts.


My GF and I have been together for ~6 years, about half of that long distance. We live together in a major metro in the US.

I haven't been terribly successful with building a friend group here, meanwhile she has made a bunch of lady friends through work. They're all single, she's the only taken one in the group. They occasionally go out for ""girls nights"" together, of which I'm obviously rarely invited to.


My girlfriend is the kind of girl who very frequently checks her phone. When I'm with her she's pretty much glued to the thing and very responsive to anyone who messages her.

But when she goes out with her friends, I pretty much don't hear a peep from her for 2,3,4+ hours. 



I won't lie, it makes me feel really insecure / paranoid that maybe she's meeting up with a guy or something. I know it's illogical because we've been together for so long but I KNOW her and I KNOW she wouldn't go that long without checking her phone.


because of this I usually end up texting her a couple times, and she usually only ends up responding when she's on her way home. 



I feel like im being insecure, since I trust her, but part of me just is paranoid that she's not texting me because there is some funny business. What are signs to look for of this being the case? I'm not really close with any of her friends so it's not like I could text one of them or something. I don't know. I want to give her space but I also feel ignored and it sucks? "

16,"My son is 10. As a mom, how can I best navigate the next several years?


His dad lives in another state and his stepdad isn't a hands-on parent in a lot of ways. They have a great relationship but if he has questions or a problem, I am probably the best he's going to get... 

I am very open with him, we've had ""the talk"" a few times over the years, and he's also got some books that cover the difficult stuff--puberty, girls, sex--so I'm not necessarily looking for advice on that sort of thing. It's more like -- imagine you were being raised by a single mom; what do you wish your mom knew about being a boy that would have helped you? Or... what did your mom do (or not do) that helped, or didn't help? What do you look back on as an adult that you are grateful for in your relationship with your mom? What challenges do you think your mom faced when raising you, and how did she handle it? What's your relationship with your mom been like over the years, and why? Answers to any of those questions will help me greatly!!

Your thoughts appreciated! Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thank you so, so, so much to those of you who have responded. You made me think about a lot of important issues today &amp; have recommended lots of ways to do this whole crazy parenting-a-boy thing as well as possible (given that I am burdened by my unavoidable femininity, that is... /s) ... Men of r/askmen, you are wonderful. I will now continue my daily lurking!"
17,"How do I stop viewing every girl I meet as a potential partner?


I'll be upfront about it, I've never been in a relationship (19 years old), am pretty lonely, and have somewhat mild self-esteem issues. I feel like one of the contributing factors is that, no matter how hard I try, I end up considering just about every girl I meet as somebody I could have a relationship with (should probably mention that I'm a Computer Science major, so we're also not talking about a particularly large number of girls here)  
  
I really don't want to think like that, I feel like it just gives me an aura of desperation and possibly makes some people somewhat uncomfortable if they pick up on it.  

There's also the issue that I tend to crush on any girl who really shows me positive attention, but progress has definitely been made there as it's pretty easy to realize that most people are just friendly and nothing more.  
  
Any advice?
