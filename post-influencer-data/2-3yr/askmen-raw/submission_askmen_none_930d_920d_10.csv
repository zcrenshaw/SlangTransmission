3,"How do I politely tell a girl I don't want to be friends?


I told a girl i was interested in dating her. Girl says she has a bf &amp; that i'm a great guy &amp; that we should be friends, I politely tell her no thanks &amp; move on.

but she keeps trying to be friends with me. 


in person, i ignore her as she stares at me seemingly forever. she started dressing up in blue &amp; orange (she knows those are my fave color combo cuz I told her that) &amp; literally stares at me &amp; follows me around during crossfit classes, like she's literally right behind me or next to me. 


she literally stands with her back to me, (great ass ;D praise yoga pants)  while I work out on my own lifting.


on fb she is messaging me saying  ""we should be friends"" ""I don't see why we can't be friends"" "" don't overthink things we are good, always have been""


I'm actually starting to get annoyed. She's hot &amp; i want to fuck her but she just wants to be friends so like the fuck outta here. but won't leave me alone.


Any advice on what to do? she VERY persistent.

UPDATE: Back from the gym. She was there. she was very sad &amp; seemed down the entire time &amp; lacking energy during the crossfit class. at one point, she stared at me all sad &amp; when I looked right at her, she immediately turned around &amp; acted like she totally wasn't sad lol. (She did not reply to my fb message) 


UPDATE 2? maybe? lol. btw thanks guys. As a twitch troll I enjoy a good laugh from reading silly comments. The helpful ones though, thanks! :D


UPDATE 3: Morale of the story: if she's not down, move on ;D"
