1,"Dudes who drive around shirtless, where are you going? And what happened to your shirt?


"
2,"Do you go into first dates with a loaded gun? Why or why not?


I'm trying to find a long term partner but I'm finding that sex is seriously clouding my decision making. I would like to seek out a different method and I'm thinking some release prior to dates may help.  Does anyone do this? Has it helped? How many dates in do you stop releasing?

4,"What's the best compliment you've ever received from the opposite sex?


One time an ex told me I had the prettiest dick she'd ever seen. I was flattered but it raised questions about the sample size that led to that statement."
5,"What differentiate a rookie and an expert for a kiss?

6,"What stereotypes about girls do you dislike?


Shamelessly copied because i think it would be a good thought experiment. I'm truly curious what men think about this because I already know what women would say. "
7,"Fellas with full sleeve tattoos, anything you wish you knew before getting the sleeve?


Appointment is booked for a couple of weeks from now for my first session. I work a corporate office job so I know I'll need to stock up on more long sleeve button-ups. Anything else you didn't realize would change?"
8,"how would you feel if a girl half your age was hitting on you?


this is really for the men over 30. but i'm 20 and i have a thing for a man who looks like hes in his late forties (possibly fifties) who is a regular at the coffee shop i work at. he's always very nice but never hits on me (maybe he doesn't want to be creepy), although ive noticed he is a lot nicer to me than my other coworkers. so how would you feel? would it creep you out? would you go somewhere else to get coffee? "
9,"What's something you've always secretly hoped for a compliment on?


Am I blatantly fishing for ideas? Yeah. "
10,"As a male, nearly all of my closest friends are female. While it's not an issue, I'm the only guy I know who almost exclusively has female friends. How normal is this?


While I do have male friends, I never really get along with them *as* well, especially when it comes to arranging to hang out. Again, by no means is this a problem, but I don't know anybody else with the same situation.

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify a couple of things.

Firstly, I can guarantee you I'm straight, and getting along better with girls does not automatically mean I'm gay. Secondly, I don't **exclusively** have female friends, I just get along with them better."
11,"How do I be a slut for my boyfriend?


Hey r/askmen!

I'm looking to potentially get a little slutty for my boyfriend since he's kind of mentioned it before but I have no idea where to start or anything...I'm not like that normally haha

So my questions to you are:

- what would you like a girl to wear if she was to be acting slutty?

- would you like it to continue out of the bedroom, say we're out one night and I just start acting a little slutty, but not pursuing anyone else kinda thing?

- what would you love a little slut to do in the bedroom?

- how would you like them to act?

Feel free to add anything else that you think would help me become the little slut I might destined to be ;)

EDIT: Wow! I totally didn't expect this many responses, you guys are amazing! I've only gotten half way through the comments but i promise i'll read them all and try reply :D"

13,"What's the hardest thing you and a significant other have endured together?


Like illnesses, financial issues, family tragedies, etc "
14,"Where can a man get free emotional support or find someone to talk to outside of close friends/family?


I don't feel comfortable at the idea of pouring all my weaknesses at people I know closely. And when I ever did in the past my parents or friends just consoled me and tried to sweap my problems under the rug and tell me to just deal with the situation or escape it. It felt embaressing altogether.

Where can I find a help-phone or some type of voice willing to hear me and listen to my problems? I'm a senior university student if that matters.

Basically I'm about to crack and slip into a depression since I'm putting so much work on some areas normal people accomplish easily and am getting no results. At some areas in life I am a utter loser and tear up during the night thinking of how easily normal people do what I can't do for months or years on end. I know I don't have any ""real"" problems (poor health or dead family members) but its eating me inside the demons I'm dealing with."
