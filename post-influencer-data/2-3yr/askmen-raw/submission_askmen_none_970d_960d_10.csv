0,"My Ex girlfriend once asked me if I would still love and have sex with her if she would be a horse... She was mad for a week or so when I said no after a long discussion. What are your weirdest questions ever asked to you?


"
1,"I'm currently drinking wine, eating Chinese food and watching Gossip Girl. I am a 21 year old male. What are your guilty pleasures?


alone"
2,"Guys, what has the filthiest thing a woman has ever said to you been?


Never dated a dirty talker so I'm curious as to what bombs have been dropped
"
3,"If there was a national men's march, what issues would be at the center of attention?


"
4,"How much did getting a girlfriend/boyfriend affect your happiness levels?


Before getting a gf/bf : rate/7  
After getting a gf/bf : rate/7  
Thanks."
5,"Guys, when did you realize you were in love?


what happened? Did you tell your SO and how did they react?"
6,"How do you feel about women using the the mens restroom when you are out at the Bars?


"
7,"Gay men of /r/AskMen, what's the funniest/worst/weirdest reaction a straight guy had when you said you were gay?


I'm bi and I live for the moment when you tell a straight guy about your gayness, most of the times they're completely cool about it, but sometimes, you see that mini freakout in their eyes.

Worst case scenario they ask you for a threesome. 

"
8,"What was something mean you did to your girlfriend/wife that made them cry?


And how did it end? Sorry and cuddles? :("
9,"How often do you hoover?


I tend to hoover every day and both my SO and a friend at work have said that it's a little obsessive and probably unhealthy. Do you hoover every day?!

EDIT: I love the flair Mods, God Save The Queen, pip pip. "
10,"What did your friend tell you about his sex life that made you see their SO in a completely different way, good or bad?


"
11,"Men of reddit...what's the most interesting or strange sexual first time you've had?


Not necessarily ""your first time ever"" but any interesting first time with someone, what did they do that made it weird/exciting/memorable?"
12,"Those who were abstinent until marriage, how is your marriage going?


"
13,"I just found out my girlfriend pronounces it ""jif."" is there any way to salvage the relationship? What should I do?


"
14,"As a woman, sometimes sitting down to pee prompts me to poop while I'm at it. How does that work for dudes, on account of standing to pee?


Do you ever go to the bathroom to piss and then decide you might as well take a shit while you're there?

Or is there more premeditation involved in crapping as a dude, seeing as you're not (usually) sitting when you (just) pee?

**Related side question** - Say you need to shit, but for whatever reason you're holding it (don't want to murder someone's toilet, out in public etc) does the muscle release involved in peeing make it harder to clench in a crap?

Because sometimes as a woman peeing but not also pooping is a delicate art."
15,"What downvoted comment you have written do you stand by 100%?


Not just here, but on any sub. For example, on AskReddit, I once said that AskWomen is a police state and what consequences that has resulted in, and I got rewarded with a score of -30. Doesn't make the statement any less true, though."
16,"what was the final straw that made you realize a girl was just using you?


"
