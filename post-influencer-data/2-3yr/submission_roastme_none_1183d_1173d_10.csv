"[META] Can we stop allowing young, insecure kids to post here?


Honestly, I find it a little fucked up when a self-proclaimed ""emo"" 13 year old kid that you can smell the horrible insecurities on posts here and gets torn apart. Yes, it is /RoastMe, so I have no pity for posters who get annihilated here. But when its a young kid that just gets shat on for his acne, fatness, etc. they clearly did not understand what they were getting themselves into.

Call me an SJW or something if you want, I know my opinion won't be popular. Just seems fucked to me.

EDIT: as u/RossumEcho pointed out, there have been multiple accounts with tons of posts of every insecure-looking kid at their middle school. Kids who were probably pressured into it &amp;amp; had their comments read in a circle of classmates. 

EDIT 2: as several people have pointed out, requiring posters to be the subject of the post would is a good solution to kids posting each other in school. "
"Changing the minimum age rule


As most of you know, the current age for posting on /r/RoastMe is 13. This has been a cause of debate for millennia on /r/RoastMe, now it's time to revisit that rule.

Following [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4oy0dh/meta_can_we_stop_allowing_young_insecure_kids_to/) it's clear to see the community thinks something should change and we think so too. 

After discussing amongst the mods we have decided to change the minimum posting age from 13 to **16**.

We looked heavily at the pros and cons of increasing the minimum posting age and think 16 is an acceptable age for /r/RoastMe. If you have any questions regarding this feel free to ask in the comments."
