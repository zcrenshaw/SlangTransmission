"""Hey mom, why not just put it up?""


Second post on the sub

At little bit about me and my job: I'm a bagger / cart-getter at smaller grocery store chain and it was recently Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving = busy store = lot's of carts for us baggers to get. 

So anyway, I was the only bagger in the store at that time so my  head cashier told me to get carts so we could prepare for a massive influx of people coming in later to stock up on last minute buys. I get my vest and cartclip and walk outside to fetch carts. 30 minutes go by and it's all smooth but more people are entering and leaving. This is where it gets good, a mom and her daughter (no more than 8 maybe) are leaving the store with their cart in hand and the mom promptly pushes up a curb and lets it sit there for us to get. 

&gt;Daughter: ""Why'd you do that, the thing (cart corral) is right there?""

&gt; Mom: ""It's ok, he (referring to me) can pick it up later.""

&gt;D: ""Hey mom, why not just put it up. He's busy and the thing is right there anyways""

&gt;M: &lt;sighs&gt; Fine, I'll do it.

I'm just watching them put their cart up and I throw up the biggest retail smile I possibly can.

Though it's only 1 cart out of a whole bunch, it makes my job *that* much easier.

TLDR; Girl sticks up for me and tells her mom to put her cart up

"...Do you understand how traffic lights work?


Card machines. I used to give customers about three tries to get it right. The failed tries would print on the receipt, so in lieu of a 5km receipt, I'd take over if they fucked it up that many times.

Lady comes up, I put her purchase through, she puts her card in the reader, chooses her account, puts her pin in. Yay, a customer who knows how to work things.

BOY WAS I WRONG.

Puts in her pin, presses a button. Cancelled.

""Oh, I say, the machine must've stuffed up, let's try that again."" Always a good idea to blame ""the machine"" in retail, it's like the eternal, unfailing scapegoat.

Repeat process. Cancelled.

Lady starts getting a bit annoyed, ""I have money on this card, it worked before, yadda yadda yadda.""

""Third time's the charm,"" I say, ""I'll watch the screen this time, maybe it'll show a specific error message."" (screen was pointed at the customer on an angle, so I'd have to swivel the machine if I wanted to see, good privacy thing.)

Look away as customer puts in pin.

Look back.

Customer presses the red button with an X on it. It is next to a small, small yellow button with a backspace arrow on it, which in turn, is next to an ENORMOUS GREEN BUTTON WITH A BIG CIRCLE ON IT.

I'm sure I don't need to explain that red, like in pretty much all contexts, means bad, negative, go back, stop.

""Oh,"" I said, ""You must've hit the red button, that means cancel.""

""I thought it was enter,"" she replies disbelievingly, ""How am I supposed to know? They're not labelled!""

I worry that she drove here. I wonder how many pedestrians she hit."
"""I don't want an alternative.""


A short, but sweet one this time.



A middle aged man enters our video game store. He looks through the games for PS4, when I approach him. (Me= M, C= Customer)

M: ""Hello, can I help you find something?""

C: ""Ah, hi! You know, I am searching for [newest entry in popular racing car series]. Do you have it?""

M: ""That one has not been released yet, but will come out next year.""

C: ""Too bad, well.""

M: ""But there are great alternatives on the console!""

C: ""I know, but I don't want an alternative. It's like with woman, you know? There are great ones on this planet, but I don't want any alternative. I only want my wife."" 


He then smirks, points out of the store where I see his wife, says bye and leaves the store.


My cold retail heart melted a little that moment.


Edit: Thanks for the positive responses. Yes, he was looking for Gran Turismo Sports, since people were asking which it was."
"No ID=No Game


OK, OK, this is my last story for the day, Saturday was crazy though!
I'm gonna fill in some info that will help you understand why there are no other employees than my bro, M and me.
There are only three employees there, Me, my Brother and the Manager, who is also the owner.

Anyways, we close at 11 PM. At that day only me and M 
It's about 10 PM and we are fixing to close, then four drunk guys come in and start knocking stuff off the shelves and start ripping open packages. One of them comes up to me and wants to buy some stuff, we head over to the register and he wants to buy GTAV 
(DG: Drunk Guy, M: Manager, Me: Me)
    

Me: Sir, I'm going to have to see an ID.
    

DG: *pulls out ID* Come on! Hurry!
    

Me: *looks up to see the store wrecked* Sir, can you get your 
    friends and follow me? I need to see if this copy works, broken  
    games can be issues and I wanna save you some time.
    

DG: sure *he and his friends walk into a closet (not the back 
    room we use to actually test games mind you, I lead them into
    a closet)*
    

Me: *closes and locks door and calls police*


Me and M showed the cops the security camera footage and opened the closet for the cops to arrest the guys. 


ALSO, I'm sorry for any format or text issues in my posts, I'm kinda new to reddit and I'm still learning stuff.
