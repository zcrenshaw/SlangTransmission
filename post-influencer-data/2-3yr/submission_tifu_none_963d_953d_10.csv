"TIFU and almost died in the most hilarious way possible


Not today as per usual. But 18 years ago.

I had moved to California a few years earlier. A few blocks away was a grocery store. In that store was a toy section. Back then. 1998? It just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. Rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. I would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. They are the size of a pill or vitamin. If I placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back I could talk while making a stupid noise. One time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker I accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. I'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. No one is around. Nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. So I'm choking. But instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. Reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. I'm grasping at my chest. Reereet, ruuuh. My vision fades and a fall down on my back. This dislodges the squeaker with one more loud REET. After a moment on the ground I get up and go home. Deciding I'll never take a squeaker again.

Edit: Only to say thank you all for the laughs you provided me too."
"TIFU by not knowing what a queef was


Like all other posts on this sub, this did not happen yesterday, but about 10 years ago when I was in my sexual prime. Now before I begin, it should be noted I'm an only child. Therefore I had no sibling to teach me about the birds and the bees, and my parents worked ALL the time. They both worked C-Level jobs at big companies so I hardly ever saw them. Everything I know about sex today is through experience and the wonderful world of the internet.

So at this time in my life, I had already had sex with a small handful of girls. Being only 18, I thought I was hot shit. My life consisted of throwing parties at my parents vacant mansion and sex. Every 18 year olds' dream right? Well at one of my parties a group of college girls showed up (I was still a senior in high school) and the hottest girl of the college group was giving me vibes that she wanted to get it on. One thing let to another and we head up stairs..

Everything started off normal, foreplay and what not, when I finally got her naked I spread her legs so I could go down on her (I like to be a gentlemen and please the girl first). As soon I get down to that region she lets out the smallest ""toot"". Confused, I looked back up at her and she is still in a moaning bliss waiting for me to start as nothing happened. ""Did she just fart on me?"" I thought to myself. She was still begging for it so I shrugged my shoulders and we got it on.

Fast forward a week and we're now kind of ""dating,"" still having sex at least twice a day like new couples do. And each time she would let out a small ""toot."" I liked her a lot and didn't want to freak her out by asking her about it, so I decided to go to my friends (bad idea). They proceed to tell me that she's known as being a ""freak"" in bed and I just need to along with it. 

Ok here's when the actual fuck up happens... so that night we start fooling around and this time she wants to go down on me first. She's giving me the typical BJ when she goes down a little further for a little ball play... that's when I cock my legs up and release the biggest fart I could muster. I swear her hair flew back as if she had her face in front of a fan. She immediately stops what she's doing and looks back at me in disgust. I smiled with pride and said ""that's all for you babe."" 

She locked herself in my bathroom and cried until she let me call one of her friends to come pick her up. 

TL;DR: Didn't know what a queef was and thought my girlfriend was farting during sex as a fetish. I returned the ""favor"" by farting in her face when she was going down on me.

EDIT: Ok before I go on my rant I want to say WOW! I was not expecting this to blow up and I especially wasn't expecting front page and so much gold. Thank you all for your reading my stupid story and participating. 

With that said, I wrote this to make you LAUGH reddit. That's it. To put a smile on your face and hopefully make your day a little bit better. The story is true in the fact that I really did let one slip on a girl when she was in my no-no area (that girl is now my wife btw), but the rest is added filler to make it funny. I'm sorry I offended so many people on the tweaked facts. "
"TIFU by not locking my door at night.


OK so about an hour ago I was woken up by my girlfriend who was adamant the cat was acting wierd. It's almost 3 in the morning so I'm all for ignoring it and going back to sleep but nope she want me to go see if he's been sick somewhere.

Alright fine I'll humour the damn cat and go see what he wants 

The second I walk out into the hall I know something isn't right and then I spot it....just to my left the door handle is about halfway down and the door is about to open or shut and I have no idea which.

Now I'm not a physically intimidating guy by any stretch of the imagination but my girlfriend and yoing child are inside so I'm not waiting to see what's on the other side of that door. I wedge my foot as hard as I can against the bottom of the door pull the handle up and twist the key all in one motion but by the time I'm looking out the peep whole they are gone. 
I hear who ever it was run out into the street at top speed. (Thank God) 

But now a new problem, we're they going out or coming in? 

The first one is fine I stopped them getting in and no one got hurt and they have now ran away at top speed. 

The second one though.....this has me worried that they weren't alone.

I start to search the flat....no one seems to be here. good thank fuck, honestly I wasn't thinking about what might happen if I found someone. 

I go to our bedroom and let my girlfriend know everything is OK but someone tried to get in..

I call the police and they take a few details and ask if everything is OK. I let them know no one is here and that they didn't get in. 

About 15 mins go by, the whole time I'm shaking and checking all the rooms over and over, then i get a phone call good news they caught them.....yup them two of them and they ask a question that get my heart going again. 

Are you missing a wallet?.... I don't think so I'm sure they weren't even inside. But I don't know for sure 

Sure enough I check my coat pocket that's in the living room at the opposite end of the flat from the front door and it's gone. They were inside and not only that they had gone through my jacket and God knows what else. 

The police arrive shortly after to give me my wallet back and take a statement. Apparently these guy were off there face on drugs but managed to mission impossible through my flat without making a sound. They were caught on cctv trying to get into parked cars in the area. 

Thank God the cat was acting shifty he's getting to sleep in the bed tonight. 

Lesson of the day CHECK YOU DOOR AT NIGHT. 
Don't take it for granted that someone else locked it.
 

TLDR: didn't check the door and two drugged up ""youths"" got into my flat stole my wallet and almost got away with it. If it hadn't been for that pesky cat. "
"TIFU when trying to play a game with a friend ended up getting the FBI involved.


This happened when i was 7 years old.  


I lived in suburban midwest US, where all the kids in the neighborhood could walk alone to the park and each other's houses well across town.  My best friend lived on the other side of the park and for some reason I had this idea that it would be fun to write her an anonymous letter giving hints about which friend I was, and then inviting her to meet me at the park later to see if she had guessed correctly
.

I decided that the letter had to be typed so the handwriting wouldn't give me away.  This was 1997 and computers were so new that microsoft word was entertaining.  I had played pretend secratary enough that I had taught myself to print addresses on an envelope.  I typed up this long letter and gave her 3 clues describing who I was and set a future date for her to meet me.
    
A week or so goes by and I've pretty much forgotten about the letter when we get a frantic phone call from my friend's mom asking if I had received any suspicious mail.  She was so upset when she saw the letter that she went immediately to the police.  Due to the typed envelope and the advanced grammar (thanks Mom) the police believed there was no way this letter was from a 7 year old but surely a local child molester.  Then undercover agents were sent to stake out the park and wait for his arrival.
Her mom was calling all the parents in town warning them to check the mail and be on the lookout for local predators.

I got grounded *for lying about my involvement  at first* for quite awhile and was scared straight after I had to tell my story to the policeman.  Whoops.

*Edit:  Yes, everyone, I know computers existed well before 1997 "
"TIFU by making a joke


Earlier today, mothers birthday was going on. As we're all sitting around (roughly 15 people) my mom starts telling a story about me and sibling when we were younger.  

As the stories go on, she gets to one of me as a baby; 
""He hated wear clothes, I couldn't ever get him to keep anything on"" (etc)


So, being the joker I am, I jump out of my chair, start to take my shirt off and run across the room, all while shouting, "" Still can't!""


About halfway across the room, with my shirt half over my head, I trip blindly onto the staircase leading up, blacking out for a good 30 seconds, laying there with my shirt half off and in pain.


&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I made a joke about being naked as a baby, knocked myself out and had to lay in my shame.


Edit: Oh hi Front page (insert joke here), RIP inbox. 

Edit2: I'm 23, fire away

  
Edit3: Head is fine, guess I can take a beating, prescribed some acetaminophen. "

"TIFU by bringing a new water bottle to the gym


This is actually a YIFU. I'm training for a half marathon but I'm pretty new to running. Yesterday was only the 2nd time in my adult life ever on a treadmill (I usually run outdoors). I figured I was a pro after figuring most of the buttons out a couple weeks ago so I headed back to train while avoiding the weather. I thought I was really prepared this time because I brought headphones and a bigger water bottle (ain't nobody got time to stop and fill that shit halfway through). I start my run and it's going fine. After about a mile I decide to grab a swig of water from my very full water bottle while running at a 6 mph pace. 

I carefully open the lid and begin to bring the water bottle toward my face when I realize this is not going to work. I usually use a disposable water bottle with a small opening and I'm able to easily drink while running. The bottle I brought today has an opening the size of a normal drinking glass. This is not ideal for drinking while running. As this revelation dawns on me, panic begins to set in. 

Did I mention this is a tiny gym and there are about 6 people in my close proximity working out and there are mirrors everywhere? I cannot drink my water, and I'm going too fast to set it down without it sloshing everywhere. I realize that I need to make a quick decision about how to remedy this situation without spilling water everywhere. Like the pro I am at treadmills, I remember that there is a pause button and I desperately reach out and touch it and begin to feel relief as I stop running... but the machine does not stop running. 

Apparently pause means ""begin to slow down and then stop in a little while."" My brain and body could not come together to figure this shit out and somehow I end up going down on my left knee while holding my ~~stupid fucking~~ glorious water bottle up toward the heavens. I slowly slide off the back of the treadmill while maintaining this pose. 

When I reach the bottom, I hop up, take a swig of water, and start running again like nothing happened. Everyone else around me also continues on without acknowledging my fuck up except the girl a few treadmills to my left who is stifling a laugh. I then proceed to run the next 8 miles I need to run with a pretty gnarly brush burn on my ankle.

TL;DR fell off a treadmill in a slow motion genuflect; worst injury from running yet is caused by a fucking treadmill

EDIT: sorry for my previously shitty formatting; obligatory thanks for the gold kind stranger"

"TIFU by taking my wife to Applebee's.


I guess I should point out that this story started at Applebee's. My pregnant wife looooooves the French onion soup there. After running errands and having our lunch at Applebee's, we went home to relax. We both decided to take a hot shower together and put on comfy sweats and T's so that we could watch a few back episodes of Wentworth. 

As I stood behind my wife in the shower, I realized that she always finagles her way into the front part of the shower to leave me with the tail end of the warm water. I realized I could get a little quiet redemption by peeing at her feet and ankles. As she started rinsing her hair of shampoo, I took careful aim and let a steady stream shoot at her feet. What I didn't realize was that she had her eyes open, looking at the water below her. She couldn't feel the warm stream but could see the miscolored water and caught a slight smell of urine. ""ARE YOU PISSING ON ME?"" She yelled at me. I couldn't help but laugh and nod yes like a shameful child. She responded by hawking a nasty loogie and spitting it on me. Now, I knew I deserved it but we had gone this far so I figured, why not? And with that, I fired a tremendous snot rocket at her. As she tried to dodge it. It landed in the back of her hair. She shrieked, ""Is it in my hair?"" Through belly rolls of laughter I exclaimed ""YES"". 

Now I guess snot is where she draws the line because she started dry heaving at the thought of snot in her hair. It wasn't more than three more dry heaves before she lost every single ounce of her delicious French onion soup all over the shower floor. The smell of her half digested French onion soup was almost unbearable and I couldn't help but start dry heaving at the stench. Lets just say I didn't get to keep any of my lunch either. 

Although we both started cracking up at our ""stand by me esque"" barf o rama, I think I learned to never pee on my wife's feet in the shower again. "
"TIFU by flipping my four wheeler down the mountain and developing a bond unlike any other


This happened a little while ago but I wanted to share it with everyone.
I was getting pretty confident on my four wheeler after riding it up and down my hills in the back yard which is around  8 acres. The right side of my property is not as steep as the left side so I always climbed the right side. One day I was feeling cocky and wanted to climb up the left side because I thought it was completely possible. (Right side is about a 35 degree incline compared to the  50 degree incline on the left side) so I start up the left side, I'm doing great. Make it about 50 yards up the mountain when I hit a fox hole and it dips. I stopped accelerating and tried to slide back down which was the biggest mistake I could have made. As I was coming down I hit something else which turned the four wheeler and it flips. I hold on as it rolls me once because I didn't want to wreck my baby but as it went to roll again there was no way I was saving it so I jumped off face skid down the mountain, rolled, broke a sapling with my back and some how flipped onto my feet and ran about 15 yards before falling down again. The whole time I hear the four wheeler flipping down the mountain directly behind me. I hit the bottom of the mountain still hearing the four wheeler coming down. It smashes 3 feet behind me and is still rolling as I fish flop out of the way and it travels past me. In an adrenaline rush I feel fine. I get up. Walk over to the four wheeler on its side and flip the four wheeler onto its wheels only to see it's completely wrecked. Instantly I feel everything and fall down. This is where the stories changes. My donkey Henry runs over to me. Sniffs me. I get up because I'm worried he's gonna step on me but as I am trying to walk back to the house I keep falling down from the pain in my legs. I stand up again and Henry sticks his head under my arm and I hold onto him as he begins to walk back toward the house, making his donkey call the entire time. He walked me all the way back to the house where my parents had walked out to see what he was calling about. I suffered no broken bones though I had a terrible whiplash, two welts on my back and a connection with an animal that I've never had before. Thanks to everyone that took the time to read this extensive, grammatically incorrect story.

TL;DR Flipped my four wheeler down the mountain and my donkey Henry came to the rescue and I developed a bond unlike any I've had with an animal. 

Edit: Added photo of donkey for all to see with a goat on th four wheeler after it was fixed [Henry](http://m.imgur.com/a/pJwKD) "
"TIFU by hurting a copy cat


This actually happened at about 5am, I was just finishing up an essay I totally didn't procrastinate or plagiarize 70% of and I was getting ready to command P the f*** out of the paper, when I shoved the scanner down i didn't realize that my cat was sleeping on it. I smashed her tail in it pretty bad and she meowed so loud I'm sure my neighbors heard.. She ran under one of the couches and hasn't came out since, looks like I'll just have to accept the fact that in the eyes of poor little Mia I'm a dangerous serial killer out to take one of her nine lives away 

Tl;dr I turned my cat into a 8x12 piece of white paper "

"TIFU by assuming a guy was just standing around and wasn't being serious about purchasing a property


This happened yesterday. So I was interning at a real estate firm and during my lunch break, I saw this guy standing around. He was really short (about 5'2"") and looked really young (about 18 years old) so I said, ""Hey little guy, what's your name and what are you doing here?"" (Basically at college, my friends always call me ""big guy"" so I always playfully call them ""little guys"" but we all know it's just fun). He told me his name but then said that he had to go so I jokingly said, ""Haha, did you just come in here to walk around?!"" - I didn't think he was being serious about buying a property, I thought maybe he was just fantasizing about being able to get his own property and I didn't think much of it for the rest of the day. However later on I found out that one of the partners at our firm was waiting for someone with his name because they were going to go and look at one of our properties together (worth about $15 million) and I was absolutely shocked. I realized that I was talking to a potential client and I clearly offended him so much that he chose to leave. 

Today, I went to the partner and told him what happened, apologized to him, apologized to the firm, offered to apologize to the client and said I would resign. He told me that whenever a client suddenly loses interest in a deal, they investigate and last night when he spoke to the client, he found out what I did. He wasn't 18 years old, he was 21 years old. He wasn't just walking around our firm, he was interested in a $15 million property and he had a net worth in the 9 digits (partner wouldn't say exactly how much). The partner was furious because instead of closing a deal, they're now focusing on damage control and I just had to do it on a property the firm has been trying to sell for a while. He said it was good I resigned because he would've had no choice but to fire me anyway. He suggested that I grow up, learn to treat people with respect and not to put his firm on my resume. He asked me not to speak with the client again in case I sabotage things again. He also said that the firm will now be considering whether to continue internships. 

I'll now be focusing on how to treat everyone with respect because everyone deserves respect, even if they have nothing to offer me, and I was so rude.

TL;DR: I saw a small young guy walking around, I called him a little guy and asked what he was doing, I thought he was just fantasizing about being able to buy a property, he was so offended that he didn't turn up to the appointment with a partner to look at a $15 million property and now the firm is focusing on damage control, a $15 million deal is at risk and they're considering whether to continue internships.

EDIT: I will reply to some comments now, I didn't expect to receive so many responses and private messages. I apologise for being so late. Losing an internship is depressing so I decided to keep myself busy to keep my mind off it. "
