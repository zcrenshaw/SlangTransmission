"18 y/o moving to NY update


Hello /r/asknyc 
A couple weeks ago I posted [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/52t0jq/advice_for_an_18_yo_moving_to_ny/ ) looking for some advice on moving to NY. Just a quick update a week into having moved if anyone's interested. About three days here and I was able to land a full time coffee shop job in Manhattan that pays decently. The next day I was able to get a room in Brooklyn (Bushwick) for $800 a month. A little more than I wanted to pay but I'll make it work. Just thought I'd let you guys know how it's working out thus far. And thank you all for any advice you've given me."
"Anyone know where we can get yesterday's New York Times?


Hey NYers! My new husband and I got married yesterday and meant to pick up a copy of the New York Times for the scrapbook, but amid the chaos, we forgot!  Anyone know where we can get a copy, or does anyone have one they're getting rid of that we can have? It was for yesterday,  October 4th.

Thanks so much!

UPDATE: We found one! There's a guy at the New York Times front desk who actually just keeps a few copies of the previous day's paper and he gave them to us! We're discovering that New Yorkers are the nicest people (we're from Asheville, NC, and the ""Southern hospitality"" doesn't stack up to how well we've been treated here). We absolutely love this city! Thank you for all of your replies!"
"What is your favorite subway station? (Other than ones that you use regularly)


Growing up here, I've got a whole list of stations that are somewhat special to me like: Bowling Green, Fulton Street on the G, Jackson Heights (74th Street), Forest Hills 71st Ave/ Continental, and Christopher Street 
But also a couple of stations I just enjoy visiting: Hudson Yards (cuz its new), or Sutphin Blvd-Archer Ave-JFK, or Smith-9th Street. 
It's kind of a dumb question but I'm curious. 

Edit: How could I forget the awesome Fulton street transit center with its connection to the Oculus?"
