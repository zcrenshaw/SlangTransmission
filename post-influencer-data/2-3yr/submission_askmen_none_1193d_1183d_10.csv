"What do you do when a friend in your close group likes you but you don't like her back?


Just kidding, are you guys excited for summer or what? What's your biggest plan for this summer?!

 Ahh RIP my inbox you sick party animals.

Btw to all you raging about it not being summer in like 80% of the world or w/e, stop being such a Sour Susie. Let's try to have some fun regardless what time of the year, eh? P.S I'm not from ""murica"" ya turd burgler. "

"What's something you've had forever that, the second you get a S/O becomes theirs?


For me, it's apparently a comb.  It's pretty much the only comb I've found that can get through my hair, and I'd had this thing for six years before meeting her, using it pretty much every day.  The second she sees the thing, I have to hunt for it in her purse, makeup kit, cosmetic drawer, and the couch.  The woman has four hairbrushes.  What's the comb for?

"My Girlfriend is going to breakup with me. What do I do?


Well, my girlfriend and I were set to leave for a 3 day vacation today after work but I just received a text about an hour or two ago saying ""Babe, I'm having a really hard time and I don't think I can go on this vacation."" I asked her why (already kind of knowing what the response would be) and she said ""It's nothing you don't know really, I just feel like I'm not happy even though I've been trying to be, something is just off and I don't want to waste our money or time, etc etc.."" 

We're supposed to meet up after work later on, so we're still not officially broken up or whatever you want to say, but I have a strong feeling that it's going to happen when we meet up later this evening. Should I even bother meeting up with her? I feel like I'll just be walking into a buzz saw. I seriously think I should just be the one to say that we need to break up and then just play the no contact card. Maybe it would be even easier for me to get over her that way? I'm only considering this because my response last time to a break up was to immediately freakout and send her saying all sorts of cheesy ""I'm so sorry, I don't know what I'll do without you in my life"" text messages and nonsense like that that clearly doesn't work. So, I figure this time I should handle things a little more differently and see how that plays out.

Any ideas? 

Thanks!"

"What do you think about a girl that expects a guy to spend $150-$200 a date every week?


*** I AM NOT DATING HER, SHES JUST A FRIEND, WELL EX-FRIEND NOW. I WOULD NEVER DATE SOMEONE LIKE THIS ***

I'm talking to this girl that is my friend and this is what she expects and keep in mind she's not rich. She expects this from an average 25-35 year old guy. She also doesn't normally spend this much on herself and if she does, its a rare occasion.

She also says she would never pay for a date this expensive and may pay for a $60 date a couple times a year."
