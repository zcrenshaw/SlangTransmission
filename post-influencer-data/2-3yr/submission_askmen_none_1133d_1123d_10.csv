"Men, how often do you see women who are reasonably attractive in your every day life?


I'm a dude, and I feel like most of the women I see or interact with who are around my age are at least moderately attractive.  Like if I go to a grocery store, I'll walk past at least 10 women where I'm like, ""hey, she's cute."" Do you guys feel the same way?"

"I've had primary custody of my 15 year old son for 3 years. He called me today, to tell me he wanted to try living with his mom for a semester. Can someone please tell me how to feel, or what to do?


Title pretty much tells it.

My son has lived with me for three years.  I always thought everything was good, but I wasn't expecting this.  I don't really know how to take it.  

I've always told him it was about what he wanted to do, through the custody battle, the lawyers, the drama.  I still believe that, but the ""As a parent, you have to do what's best for them, no matter what they think."", and I have doubts.  But, he's 15.  If I go to court, pay the lawyer, and he says, ""I want to stay with mom."", I'm not winning that.  It's just how the system is.  

He's also a type 1 diabetic.  Which requires diligence and responsibility, which years ago, his mom failed to handle properly.  On the other hand, it's been 3 years and she's had him all summer with no issues.  

So what am I supposed to do/feel here?  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Edit:  I went to sleep, and I'm at work now.   I'm reading all of these.   Thanks.

"How many of you are happily willing to financially support a woman that you love?


Edit: How many of you are happily willing to financially support a woman that you love, not because she actually needs support, just because you want to.

Edit 2: Some comments state it would be okay if the wife took care of the house and/or children. I asked the question with this as a given in my mind. It's a little absurd to provide for someone whilst they do literally shit all. Sorry should have clarified that earlier.

My family is Muslim and in Islam a man always inherits more than women in his family because he is obligated to take care of his wife, whilst a woman is not obligated to pay for anything. It doesn't mean she won't, just means she doesn't have to. I don't want this to be a discussion about religion, I'm aware of all its flaws. Just genuinely curious if any men actually have that old school mentality where they believe they should be ""taking care"" of their women. How old are you? What is your background?"

"Married Men, how do you seduce your wife?


I know my wife doesn't owe me anything, including sex. That being said, how do you get your S.O. in the mood?

 Additionally, married women, how does your husband seduce you?"
"People who found their ""calling"" or ""passion"" late, how did you find it and what do you do?


I'm one of those people who has never really had any idea of what to do with their life in terms of career. A lot of people say that you should find and follow your ""passion"" or your ""calling"" but I've never really been that passionate about anything to be perfectly honest and kinda figured that it is something you find when your like a kid/teen. I was hoping that any of you guys who found their passion/calling a little later in life (mid 20s) could share how they went about figuring it out and what they are doing now. Thanks. 

**EDIT: Holy smokes guys, I didn't think this would get so many responses. Thanks for sharing your stories and advice everyone.**"

Thanks guys, this is a great community"

"Why do a good amount of bikers pull up within inches of the car in front of them at stop lights and in traffic?


In my experience it is most of them and honestly seems like a conscious effort to get that close every time. I ask because I know bikers hate it when you are right on their ass and understandably so, since they are less protected on the road. But why do this to cars if you don't want it done to you? Hopefully someone who rides can explain it to me. I just don't understand why you wouldn't leave a bike length in front of you out of courtesy so you aren't so close to someone's vehicle simply because it isn't necessary. Hope this is okay to post here. I always feel strange asking questions that don't have different answers for every person on /r/askreddit

Edit: Thanks for all the answers. Definitely gave me some new perspectives for that question. "
