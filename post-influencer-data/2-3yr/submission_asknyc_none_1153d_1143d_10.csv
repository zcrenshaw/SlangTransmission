"Thank You r/AskNYC!


Got home yesterday from a quick vacation to NYC with my wife that lasted Thurs - Sun.    We both had a great time thanks to the wealth of information that you all have shared in this forum and in your **Quick Links** in the right margin.  In no particular order, some of the highlights from our trip.  


Getting from Newark Airport (EWR) to Manhatten/Time Square Area could not have been simpler.   I will say before leaving Houston I was confused and unsure as the previous posts all said it would be easy but without any context it just seemed complicated, IT WASN'T!   FYI.  Airtrain to NJTransit to NY Penn Station.   $13.00 one way.  


We stayed at the Hampton Inn on 41st between 7th &amp; 8th Streets. Which easy access to the subway and times square as well as Penn Station.  


Saw hordes of people playing Pokemon all over the city, but at one park in particular it was just crazy.  This park/square just south of Central Park across from the Plaza Hotel was ridiculous.  [Pokemon Players](http://i.imgur.com/ZX8SMTV.jpg) The pic does not truly appreciate just how many people were there, wow!   My wife and I actually downloaded the game and gave it a try after witnessing this crowd.


Had a slice of Pizza at **Pizza Suprema** at 30th &amp; 8th as y'all recommend I don't know if it is indeed the *Best Pizza In NYC* and don't want to argue that point, but I do know it was the **BEST PIZZA i've ever eaten.**


Took the **Free** Staten Island Ferry at sunset, thank you all for this tip, was a nice trip.


Found by accident a great lunch at **5 Mile Stone** at the corner of 85th &amp; 2nd.   I had the Fish &amp; Chips and their signature IPA.   The beer was cold, and the food was great and the service was outstanding.   This should be on someones list.


As y'all suggested we bought the the 7 day unlimited metro card and gave it away to a random couple as we were getting off the subway our last time.  Was a treat to see them light up in appreciation.  


This list can go on and on... but I will stop before I have to do a TL:DR.


The only bad experience was trying to get through security at the Empire State Building, so bad that we ended up not buying a ticket and walked out.  For the most part we did the ""Touristy"" stuff that sometimes gets made fun of on here, but had a most incredible trip thanks to the insights y'all shared. 


**EDIT:  TL;DR** Had a great trip thanks to postings found in /r/AskNYC and wanted to share and say thanks.

"What's your favorite happy hour in Manhattan?


Hey everyone

Thought it might be fun to share your favorite happy hour deals in Manhattan. Mine used to be ninth ward on 12th and 2nd. They had 5-8 all beers and well buy 1 get one free. And they had a great back area but they closed down :( Trying to find more awesome spots!"
