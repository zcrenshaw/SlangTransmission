"TIFU by not checking my backseat when I left for work.


I was assigned to support a pretty high-level meeting in a facility that takes over an hour to drive to in morning traffic. I decided to leave the house early to give me plenty of time to get to the building and have time to enjoy a cup of coffee and a doughnut. I hit some traffic but still made it in a little less than an hour. I was loving the fact that I got a decent parking spot and had close to an hour to get my coffee, read the paper and then get to the meeting with plenty of time to spare. 

I was loving life until I looked in my backseat and found [this asshole decided to sneak into my back seat!] (http://imgur.com/cORdL2H)

I ended up handing the meeting off to someone else so I could take the shit head back home.

TL/DR; Left home early to beat traffic to an important meeting and brought my stupid cat with me.

EDIT: 
1) I think he got into my car (SUV really) when I had the back open to remove a couple of water jugs. I left it open for about 5 minutes while I carried the jugs into the kitchen. I let him outside of the house earlier and so no, he didn't camp out there overnight.

2) I love my cat. I call him ""shit head"" and ""asshole"" because he acts like one at times. I'm certain he tells his cat friends about his owner, ""dumb ass"" and ""shit for brains"" too.

3) As for the meeting- I have endured well over 3,000 meetings in my lifetime and have owned only four cats. The relative ""rarity"" of cats vs. meetings causes me to place more value on the well-being of my cat than I do on sitting in a room listening to a bunch of people blather on about anything BUT the topic of the meeting."
"TIFU by destroying 67,000 dollars


This FU started around 6 years ago when I was a poor college student.

I had just enough money to ""survive"" on, for student values of survive. I had a hugely over-inflated sense of how intelligent I was. Rare for someone on reddit I know.

I thought that instead of getting a part time job I'd make money on the internet, I'm smart enough, why not? So, I set up webpages with the sketchiest of ad networks. I did as much matched better as I could (which to be fair earned me a few hundred $). And I also came across this thing called bitcoin, and people were giving them away for free on some websites. Everything I read about them said they were going to be the next big thing. Awesome, I'll get myself some of those. Over the course of 1 semester I'd gotten around 150 bitcoins, which at the time was worth around $11.00. What a waste of fucking time! These things haven't exploded like they were supposed to, back to my matched betting and Awesome^TM websites!

These bitcoins were stored on my laptop. I upgraded my laptop the following semester with more RAM and a bigger super fast 7200 HDD. I wrote a little sarcastic note to myself about the bitcoins and folded it over my old HDD.

That was the last time I paid any attention to bitcoin, it wasn't too long before I graduated and started to earn decent(ish) money.

Fast forward to last month and I'm moving to a smaller apartment (more expensive area), and had to be picky about what I could take. I had an old box of PC parts, I had a quick look through and marveled at the 256MB RAM sticks, the 40GB HDDs, I even had a few floppy disks! All of it worthless with today's hardware. So in the trash it all went.

I used that box to pack some stuff in and move to my new apartment a few days later. Because of my laziness several boxes remained full of stuff for a few weeks. Tonight after a 4 hour reddit session I unpacked one of the boxes, and I found [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/9dpCFQ3.jpg). I chuckled to myself for a split second before realizing bitcoins are worth a fair bit today, at which point panic set it. 

I've been googling for several hours but it seems I'm fucked, the bitcoins are gone! At least they weren't worth the millions that my idiotic self thought when I first found the note, but that's not much consolation.

TL;DR earned $11.00 worth of bitcoin, 5 years later threw them out when they were worth $67,000!

-----

**EDIT:** To the people offering to help me recover the bitcoins from my HDD, thanks but **it was put in the trash over a month ago**, it's probably in landfill now, hence the FU. The only trace I have right now is the note. I'm going to be scouring my emails / cloud storage etc."
"TIFU by scalding my colon (nsfw)


Edit: RIP inbox. Also, thanks for the gold! 

Posted this earlier this week, but was removed due to ""bodily discharge"" rule. 

This happened a few years ago. Took a vacation to Nicaragua and ate a ton of unpasteurized cheese (a free traditional breakfast was available every morning at the hotel, and I was travelling on a budget). I was relying on my usually bulletproof stomach to see me safely to shore, and, for a time, everything seemed fine.

After I got back, I slowly realized that it had been quite a while since my last poo. Took some laxatives, which only made me much more uncomfortable. After almost a week, I was getting desperate, so I ran by Walgreens and bought a disposable enema.

Here's where I fucked up, although I didn't realize it at the time. I bought the enema on my lunch break and left it in the car until I got off of work. It was about 100 degrees outside that day. When I got home I noticed that the enema felt pretty hot to the touch, but, thanks to incredibly flawed reasoning, I deduced that the closer the saline was to 100 degrees (my internal body temperature) the more comfortable it would be. I got into the tub (in case of spillage), inserted the pre-lubricated nozzle, and gave the bulb a firm squeeze.
It was at this exact moment that I realized the **unfathomable degree to which I had fucked up.** It felt like I had inserted a fire hose full of microwaved lava into my bowels. Like the grown-ass man that I am, I screamed at a frequency audible only to bats, thrashed around like a spider on a skillet, and fell over into the tub.
The silver lining is that it cured my constipation with extreme agency. I shat out a week's worth of hot saline and Nicaraguan cheese poops, the force of the expulsion causing me to rotate slowly in the bottom of the tub like a rocket with a bent nozzle.

After it was all over, I felt like I had re-enacted the suppository scene from Trainspotting with my entire body. My bootyhole (and regions beyond) hurt considerably for a day or two, although I was too relieved to be able to poop again to care. Also, I had to throw the shower curtain and an extremely unfortunate loofah away.

TL;DR: Hot enema â‰  comfortable enema"

"TIFU by channeling Hitler while translating at a business meeting.


I speak multiple languages fluently and I'm often called into top-level meetings at my company to assist in interpretation. 

Unfortunately, sometimes the syntax of sentences and the different expressions force me to translate in less than a second without thinking too much about what I'm saying. 

The conversation was dealing with some delays we had with the release of software due to Unity updates breaking things. 

To cut things short, I was translating to English for a C-level exec and he is from Israel. I said: ""Well, unfortunately, due to the issues we had in Germany, we still don't have a final solution to the problem."" "
"TIFU by locking the bathroom door


So I was in the middle of a week of nightshifts. Woke up about 5pm, 3 hours before I had to leave for work. First thing I did was go to the bathroom. I locked the door out of habit even though I had lived alone for a few months. When I tried to unlock the door the key wouldn't turn. I fiddled with it for a while with no luck. I tried brute strength. The key snapped.

So there I was. Standing in my bathroom in my underwear. There were no windows so the only way out was through the door. I tried kicking the door down only to realise that for some reason the people who built the place had put a fire door on the bathroom. And I was working against the hinges too. After a number of attempts I gave up. I tried banging on the wall and shouting for help (It was an apartment) but either nobody heard or they just ignored it.

About an hour passed. I was trying to work out the odds of a family member calling by that night and how long it would take people to notice I was missing. I was also calculating how long I could last on tap water. I decided to take some drastic action.

I pulled the towel rack off the wall and tried unsuccessfully to use it on the door. Last resort time. I used the towel rack to gouge a hole in the wall between my bathroom and my hallway. I managed to fit my hand in and get a grip on the plaster board. I pulled the plaster board off the wall until there was a hole big enough to get through. I then punched through the back of the board on the other side of the wall. There were some water flexible pipes in the way but nothing else. I managed to move them out of the way and get a leg through to the other side. I carefully slid through (remember, only wearing boxers) the hole and out into the freedom of my hallway.

I made it to work on time.

[The aftermath](http://imgur.com/L6e5D5l)

TLDR: Got locked in bathroom. Made my own exit.


EDIT: To answer the question about the door handle and hinges. [This](http://imgur.com/a/6D1lD) is a similar lock and handle and how the door is hung. As you can see, the hinges are not accessible once the door is losed and form a sort of double bracket keeping the door from being pushed forward. The door handle is simply a lever. The door lock is contained within a case inside the door and the only part accessible is the lock hole, which had a piece of the key in it. The handle was not specifically designed for a bathroom and was the same on both sides."

"TIFU by not listening to my body during sex


This happened around 3am this morning. So we're (in our 30's) in bed sleeping and my husband starts to rub on me and eventually we get into it, we're side by side , facing the same direction. It's feeling good, but I'm not quite there, so I suggest he get on top of me while I lay on my stomach, it's feeling better, but still, I'm not quite there yet, so I start opening my legs and we get into a modified doggy style (like this https://imgur.com/mliuSNY ) it's feeling better the more I open my legs, so I'm on my knees opening my legs as much as I can, it started to hurt my hamstrings a bit, but I was feeling the climax coming on, so I ignored the pain, I say ""stop moving"" because I finally found my spot and that orgasm was just a second away. He holds the pose and I do my butt thrust thing, I know I'm right about to cum but I needed one more push, I spread my legs as much as I possibly can and ouch, something is not right. I yell ""NOO!!"" because I'm so close to my orgasm and I worked so hard for it. I fall into a fetal position and grab my legs, I had the WORST cramping ever throughout the back of my thighs. So I'm screaming ""AhHhhhhh AhhhhHhhh!"" but we have kids sleeping in the next room, so my screams turn into these quiet ""ahhs"" and while this is happening, my husband is laying next to me cumming all over the bed and himself, he thinks I'm cumming too so he's like ""yeah...baby, you're cumming good tonight"" and he tries fingering me but I couldn't reply properly so I just whisper yell ""cramps! Help!"" And... he starts laughing his ass off. We're in bed punching/rubbing my thighs for the next minute, but I just couldn't recover, this was the most painful pain ever and it was in both legs. It's 11:30am now and I still can't walk, I assume I pulled two muscles but at least we're left with this fun story to tell.

Tl:dr spread my legs until I got cramps while almost climaxing during marital sex. Husband thought I was cumming good, but I was yelling in pain. A minute long punching session ensued. Oh, husband came on self/bed. 

Edit: I should probably add he's 6'1 and I'm 5', there, now you can picture it in your head properly. 


Edit 2: there is no poop or diarrhea in this story. Please stop hoping there is. You sickos. 


Edit 3: Thanks for the gold you mysterious pervert! "

"TIFU my face by eating a mango incorrectly.


Mango peels contain the chemical urushiol. It is the same chemical that causes the skin rash that many are familiar with after encountering a patch of poison ivy. If you have reacted to poison ivy in the past, chances are that mango peels can cause contact dermatitis on your more sensitive skin.

&amp;nbsp;

I did not know this and ate a mango by the slice, like you would with an orange cut by your mom after soccer practice. My lips swelled up to the size of all-beef franks. It looked like I took the wrong approach to satisfaction in a Bangkok whore house. The blisters clustered tightly around a rash that extended in several inches around my lips. Luckily I figured out what it was and treated it with a poison ivy wash called Zanfel. The swelling went down quickly, so now all I have to deal with is the rash and scabs.

&amp;nbsp;

Be careful around mangos. Work sucks today."
"TIFU by trying to reconnect a lost laptop to its owner


This morning I took the 6am train from NJ to DC (as I do most Mondays).  As the train was crowded I got one of the few seats in each car that didn't have a window.  When a third of the train discharged at Philadelphia, I moved to a recently-vacated seat.  

I found that the owner who just got off the train had left his laptop in the seat cushion!  I thought for a second about leaving it and giving it to the conductor who would be coming through shortly.  No, that's what a normal person would do.  ""I'm an Amtrak hero,"" I thought.  I grabbed the laptop and ran down the aisle, I jumped over the crowd of people now boarding the train at Philly and apologized, citing the need to return the laptop to its owner.  I got out of the train and yelled ""LAPTOP, SOMEONE LEAVE A LAPTOP?"" 

No response other than a lot of staring.  I looked at the conductor and said ""I'm just going to run up the stairs.""  Then, I started booking for the stairs that lead up to the main hall.  When I reached the [main hall](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/539b050fe4b077b40b221f4f/53a9d3fce4b0def533a237cc/547c92ece4b030244ba920e5/1417450281653/StationInterior.jpg) I again yelled for the owner of the laptop, hundreds of people stopped to look at the crazy guy yelling.  No response, so I handed the laptop to the Amtrak chauffeur at the top of the steps and turn to run back to the train.

Inside my head I think ""Oh my god, how long did that take?  Did the train just leave without me?""

No, that's not my fuckup. The conductor held the train for me and I hopped back on.  I had been in my seat for about ten seconds, just enough for the train to start moving again, when the laptop's owner came back from the bathroom.

I had gone to great lengths to help someone avoid ruining their own day, and had instead totally ruined someone else's.  I feel horrible.

**TL;DR: While a guy went to the bathroom on the train, I gave his laptop to someone in the station**

Resolution: I took the guy to the conductor and he said to call Amtrak.  I called and got the number for the Philly station and eventually talked to customer service who confirmed they had the laptop.  The gentleman had to hop off at Wilmington, take the train back to Philly, and then take a new train to Washington, D.C."
