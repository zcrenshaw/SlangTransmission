"TIFU by creating a dick-shaped island and getting suspended.


When I was in 8th grade science class we had to draw and create our own land mass in order to demonstrate our understanding of wind patterns, low and high pressures, etc. I thought of the idea to make the island in the shape of a dick. Our group drew it out. Of course we were smart enough to make it resemble a dick but not entirely, we made sure to make it curvy on the sides, edges where the balls were, stuff like that... but it clearly was a dick. We added tornadoes near the balls to look like pubes, added futures like 'seamen lake' and 'crabs port'. We finished and wrote the amazing title, ""PENN ISLAND"", or Pennis Land. We wrote it in big, bold, letters at the top and turned it in. A couple days later our science teacher called my group up to his desk... uh oh... but, we we were not in trouble. Instead he said something along the lines of, ""I would like to put this out in the hall, this is really great work"". Amazed, we all in unison agreed. For months our Penn Island was out in the hall, everyone saw it, everyone laughed and giggled. But the teachers never noticed until one day a parent called the school saying her daughter had told her about Penn Island. Eventually he called our group up after class and told us about it. Then out of no where, he started crying... he apologized for letting us get into trouble, he explained how its his job to keep kids from getting in trouble. HE apologized to US. He said it was his fault. To this day I still feel bad for him, it was never his fault. He was a good guy. The funny part was when we played dumb with him and he had to explain to us why ""Seamen Port"" was inappropriate.

Oh yeah, I ended up getting suspended for a day (the vice principal said I was very clever (one of my proudest moments)). Only me though, since my asshole group members made a plan to blame it all on me... fuck them. 

TL;DR I drew an island in the shape of a dick for a project and it sat in the hall for months without anyone noticing, eventually a parent found out... leading to my suspension.

EDIT: No, I don't have a picture of it. But here is what it basically looked like. The shaded part was brown, and the rest of Penn Island was green. The original was on a 4ft x 4ft paper poster haha. (Yes, those mini islands at the top are exactly what you think)

"TIFU by not finding a better place to hide my weed.


Well thankfully this didn't happen today or yesterday.  This fuck up actually happened when I was a kid...about 16?(which is why I can laugh about it now!)  

So anyways... back in the day I used to enjoy a little bud as a high schooler.  Most of my friends did as well, but we lived in Utah at the time which means pretty much none of our parents were cool with smoking...quite the opposite in fact. 

So with our strict parents in mind as little stoner high school kids we have to think of some pretty creative ways to hide our weed. I even unscrewed my DVD player, hid weed in it and my mom still almost found it. 

This time I was going to make sure was different!   I was going to find the best place I could to hide it.  I thought to myself shortly after buying some weed for my friends birthday...""I bet hiding this outside would be perfect!""  ""She won't smell it and she never comes out here, so she won't just find it!"" So as I'm outside smoking with my friend, I feel like I hit the goldmine of weed hiding ideas! We wrap up smoking and my mom's coming home soon, so I scout the yard and decide to hide my weed in the very back of the yard, wedged in between a fence and my shed. Over top of the weed i placed a big wooden 2x4.  I go to bed happy as can be because I think I've finally won.  
So I wake up the next morning and went to school. Just another normal day.  I get home to both my parents being at my moms.  This already sets off a red flag in my mind because having divorced parents, the only time they hang out together is when someone's in trouble.
So I walk in the door to find them sitting at the table waiting for me.  At this point I'm expecting them to have find a pipe or some papers. Ha! I sit down at the table and my dad pulls out this bag of weed.  I was just like what the fuck how did you find this?!?! Do you have hidden cameras or some shit!?!?  My mom slowly starts smiling and points to my Australian Shepherd.  Apparently my dog saw me hide it, got a little curious and decided to prance around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth right as my mom was outside having a cigarette. 

Yes I definitely got grounded.

Also, yes the dog is still alive and I'm writing this right next to the bitch!

Edit: Punctuation, Picture of the culprit http://imgur.com/WDZP2dX

Wow front page! 

Edit: For those who don't understand why my mom would be mad when she smokes cigarettes... it's because I was in high school.   

TL;DR Thought I had found the goldmine of weed hiding.  Dog had other plans and started prancing around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth getting me caught."
"TIFU on the walk of shame



This happened last week. No throwaway because everyone already knows what happened. 

I ended up at a guys house for a casual hookup. He fell asleep and it was only like 11pm and I couldn’t sleep to save my life. So, being considerate, I decided to bail so that I could go play on my phone(reddit) and not wake him up. 

I exit the house and find the gate we’d come through, only, it’s closed. To make matters worse, it's one of those weird gates that doesn't have a handle, but a keyhole on both sides. 

I decide, hey, I’m an adult, I can climb this fence, no problem. It’s got spikes on top, but I’m pretty positive that I can handle it. 

So, in my heels I decide to climb the fence. I get to the top and look down and realize this is easiest the highest gate/fence I’ve ever climbed. However, being precariously perched over the spikes, I realize it’s too late to turn back now. 

So I jump down, and perfectly stick the landing. YES.

Then I take a step forward and feel the arch in my left foot scream in protest. 

It’s cool, I can totally walk this off.

Make my way home and by the next morning, I can no longer put weight on it. Fuck. 

So I head to urgent care where lo and behold they ask for my ID and I realize I’ve left my fucking wallet at the guys house. 

I get put into a boot and told I have a sprain and possible fracture. Not only this, but I had PAX EAST (a gaming convention) the following weekend and ended up having to cancel because I couldn't walk as much as I was going to need to for all my meetings. Double fuck. 

So now I’m in a boot, missing my favorite con, and still ended up having to go back to the guys house to get my wallet.

TLDR: Hopped a fence in heels after a one night stand, broke foot. Left wallet there, still had to go back. Double fuck up. "
"TIFU by pushing the harness on a roller coaster one notch too tight.


Okay yeah, so this was about 6 years ago now. I recently remembered this story after years of trying to suppress it, and realized it was probably worthy of /r/TIFU.

&amp;nbsp;

So a few years back I was going on a date with my girlfriend at the time, and it was pretty early on in our relationship. I had some half-price coupons to the local theme park (Valleyfair, holla back Minnesotans) and we decided to go together. 

So we get to the theme park and right at the entrance of the park is this wicked roller coaster called [Steel Venom,] (http://i.imgur.com/yBictS0.jpg) and we decide that'll be our first ride. So we wait in line and get on the ride, and start buckling in. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now here comes the fuck up - after I push down my harness, I had just a *little* bit too much room to wiggle around. I figure I might as well push it one more notch, better safe than sorry right?

&amp;nbsp;

As it turns out, I was very, very sorry for being safe. 

&amp;nbsp;

I push the harness down one more notch and the ride starts, and I'm enjoying the ride from the safety of my snug harness, secure in the knowledge that I won't slip out and die. I'm a huge roller coaster guy, and I'm enjoying myself, having a great time, screaming louder than I need to.

&amp;nbsp;

And then all of the sudden I realize I'm enjoying the ride a little bit TOO much.

&amp;nbsp;

The harness, which was snugly contouring my body, unfortunately had an iron clad hold on my junk and was vibrating in all the ~~right~~ wrong ways. 

&amp;nbsp;

I start to panic, and frantically try to adjust myself in any way to get my nether regions away from the roller coaster-turned-sex toy, but it was no use. I was trapped in the mechanical jaws of Steel Venom, trapped by my own proclivity towards safety, and wishing that I would've just let myself slip out of my harness instead.

&amp;nbsp;

So at this point the ride is almost over, and I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, I can hold out. This ride doesn't need to have a happy ending - through the power of sheer will, I may be able to resist. 

&amp;nbsp;

But Steel Venom, the flighty temptress, had other plans. Right at the end of the ride (any of you who have ridden (rode?) it before will know this) the ride stops on the tracks (when it's vertical) and shakes the passengers violently. It's normally a fun part of the ride - I think the point is to make it seem like the ride is breaking or something. However, this time around, it was my undoing. The roller coaster shook and, despite my best efforts, I got to know the roller coaster in the biblical sense.

&amp;nbsp;

So we get off on the ride and I tell my date I need to go to bathroom. I assess the damage and my shorts and underwear are what an insurance company would call a ""total loss.""

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I need to decide if I tell the truth to my date or make up some bullshit, and so, in my post-coitus addled brain, I call my dad and ask him for advice (I told my date to go on another ride without me). He tells me, ""Son, that's the funniest goddamn story I've ever heard, and I'm pretty sure she'll think so too."" *click*.

&amp;nbsp;

So I tell her the whole story, and she laughs and laughs (it's echoing in my head right now). I tell her that if we want to stay, I need to buy a new pair of bottoms from the gift shop, and that I'll wait here in the bathroom and she can pick some out, and I tell her to go nuts. 

&amp;nbsp;

So she comes back with these sweatpants with ""WILD THING"" in pink glitter printed on the butt (""Wild Thing"" is another roller coaster at the theme park), I change, and the rest of the day wasn't nearly as ""eventful.""

TL;DR - Went on a roller coaster, pushed the harness too tight and it vibrated my junk on the roller coaster, ending as you would expect. Wore some glamorous as hell sweatpants for the rest of the day."
"TIFU by getting fired because of the movie Supertroopers


Not today but back when I was waiting tables at a steakhouse years ago we used to do all kinds of dumb stuff to keep ourselves entertained. One thing we did was play the infamous ""cat game"" from the movie Supertroopers. Basically we would follow someone out to their table and when we placed the customer's food down we would say something like ""here's your strip steak meow"". Then, on a busy Saturday night, I followed a co-worker out and dropped of his customer's food followed by a ""here's your chop steak meow"". Apparently, the guy thought I called him ma'am, made a big scene, called over our freshly hired new GM who ended up comping a $80 check because of his bitching. I finished my shift and was fired before I left because he said he needed to make an example of me. In retrospect, I should have called the guy a chicken fucker.

Edit: yes I know I played the game wrong, hence the reason it backfired :)

TL;DR I got fired for playing cat game from Supertroopers"
"TIFU by being courteous


I live in a very snowy place. Yesterday alone, we received about 4 feet of snow. This fu happened in the morning, last week. I drive to work, and as I was driving down my street I came face to face with a snow removal truck. Because my street is very narrow, there was now way I could just pass by, so I decided to be courteous and backed up in the nearest driveway, so they truck could pass. However, the driver did not raise the snow-plow and built a dense 3 feet snow wall in the entrance of the driveway I just pulled in. My car is way too small/low and I got stuck trying to get out.  I had to walk home, get a shovel and dig for 1/2 hr just to get out. 


As a result, I was late for work and I am the running gag of the office. 

Tldr: left home for work on a snowy day, pulled in a driveway so a snow removal truck could pass, the driver pushed so much snow in that driveway I got stuck and had to get back home and bring a shovel and work 30min to get out..."
"TIFU by losing my shit (literally)


Obligatory throwaway for obvious reasons

And obligatory this happened last night, not today

So last night was friday night. Finished work, decided to have a few beers. Whilst having these beers, decide im bored. Download some old school pokemon on my phone (emulator/rom). Having a grand old time playing.

Then i need to drop a number 2. 

Now lately my number 2's have been really sticky for some reason. 

And i should mention i get quite forgetful when ive been drinking.

So im on the toilet pushing one out, playing some pokemon. Decide ive been on long enough when i get up. This is where sticky poos come in. 

Just after ive stood up i realise ive got half a turd hanging out. I start to put my hand around back to catch it when i realise i dont want a handful of shit. So i pull my hand away. The jolting action makes the log slip away and hit the floor. I yell 'fuck'. The misses wakes and i can hear her getting up. She doesnt like me drinking too much so im desperate not to let her see a turd lying on the bathroom tiles. I move quickly to lock the door and step in the turd. I freak out and jump.

I ended up falling in the bath tub but didnt get to lock the door.

Missus comes in to me lying in the tup, shit on my foot and smeared on the floor.

Shes not happy.

TL;DR forgot i was on the toilet, dropped turd on the floor, slipped in it

Edit: after reading your comments i just wanted to clarify a few things.

First im not a stander. I literally forgot it was hanging there. I thought id already wiped and was good for liftoff.

Im not a mad alcoholic. I drink maybe 2-3 times a month. The missus doesnt like because something always happens (nowhere near as bad as this usually), not because im slammin' cans everyday.

And she took this incredibly well. After the initial shock, she chucked me in the shower and cleaned up. She was an absolute darl.

And for those of you wondering how i even have a missus...i dont have a fucking clue but if you're single, theres hope for you

Edit edit: ive been at work all day so havent had much chance to reddit but since ive been home ive enjoyed, for the most part, reading your comments.

I showed the missus this thread, and whilst initially horrified i would share this story on the internet, she found your thoughts hilarious and appreciated the support for her. If i could reddit correctly for a moment, in this story 'she the real mvp'.

In saying that i would like to touch on the comments about me being an alcoholic. I enjoy a drink every second weekend or so on average and this incident happened after about 7 beers. The reason she doesnt like me drinking is because ill either come pester her because i want a cuddle and want to talk, or because ill wake her up making a late night snack. 

And whilst i did get a bit drunk and slip on poo and embarrass the shit out of myself, remember thats all i did. I didnt drive while i was pissed, i didnt hurt anyone, i simply fell on my poo.

For all of you who enjoy an occasional drink but are clearly a lightweight, cheers to you!"

"TIFU by starting a epidemic of shittily charged iPhones


This fuck up happened over the course of a few weeks, but I've only now grappled with what I may have done.

So I have a fairly new Iphone 6s. It was, for wonderful reasons I'm sure, left outside on what we'll call a dewy morning a few weeks ago. No major problems ever occurred, except the minor nussiance with charging. It wouldn't charge if it wasnt in just the right position; wiggling the cord could make it stop/start charging. At first thought, I was happy that my phone didnt seem to have any cosmetic damage from being apparently exposed to morning dew for so long. But eventually the poor charging ability after the incident began to become the worst sort of damage; a phone that you have trouble charging is a defective phone. 

For a week or so my phone was always on low battery. Sometimes I would manage to charge it well at night, and it would last a while. Sometimes the cord would move, and it wouldnt charge at night. Understandably, I used several peoples iphone chargers multiple times for about a week.

As this week comes to an end, I've gone through a few new chargers trying to find one that works without much fuss. I notice pretty quickly that all of my chargers, even the new ones I just bought in an attempt to fix the problem, now have the same black mark on the same pin on the connector. Great, it seems that my phone is actually ruining the new chargers I'm buying. In a predictable way. 

And when I realized this earlier today, I thought back. I have used many peoples chargers in the last week; one from a girl at work, another three from three different friends in two different apartments. Have I ruined all of their chargers as well? 

As it happens I was heading to one of those friends apartment shortly after that. Two of my friends have an apartment together, and I've used both of their chargers multiple times over the past week. When one of them goes to plug their phone in, he immediately starts to complain about how his phone doesnt charge very well anymore, he has to move the cord around to get it to charge right. I take a look at the charger, and I see the same black mark, on the same pin, on his charger. 

Now, I immediately realized the full gravity of what I had done. My phone getting a little too wet had apparently burnt out some small pin in the charging port of the iphone itself. That in turn ruined any chargers it was connected to for too long. Those chargers then in turned ruined the charging port on any iphones connected to them in the same way that my phones charging port was broken. 

Now, I feel bad that I may have ruined my friends phones, at least somewhat, but I fear for the greater ramifications of this fuck up. Because see, now my friends phone will ruin chargers of their own. Which will in turn ruin phones of their own, so that they can go ruin more chargers. I fear that before we know it, the entire regional stock of iphones and iphone chargers will collapse in the face of this enormous plague of bad charging. 

**TL;DR: My phone got wet, didnt charge well, and started ruining chargers. Any phone connected to *those* (now ruined) chargers eventually started to stop charging.... ruining more chargers in the same way. In about 6 months the only chargers left will be in madagascar**

EDIT: So in anticipation of all of my friends reading this soon, and probably reading through my entire post history, I'm gonna come back under a different account."
"TIFU by shooting my friend point blank with a pellet gun


Happened way back when I was around 12 or 13. My friends and I were hanging out at our richest friend's house talking about mundane shit when I saw a pellet gun. I picked it up cocked it, removed the clip then proceeded to wave the gun around at my friends like Jonah Hill in ""This is the End"". One of my friends screams: ""That's loaded! Put it down!"" I scoffed and said, ""You idiot! I took out the clip."" Then pointed the gun at my rich friend and pulled the trigger from about 3 feet.
.
.
.
Yep he got a pretty bad pellet welt that was bleeding and bruised. Looked painful too as he was writhing on the floor. One of my friends then told me that I was an idiot and then explained how the whole gun loading process works.
.
.
.
My victim then proceeded to tell his mom about it who had just arrived home after shopping who then unhappily told me: ""So you were the one who shot my son!!"" Then sent me home.

We're all still friends to this day. But have never talked about that fateful day. Good thing they forgot. :)

Edit: replaced a letter and removed an apostrophe
Edit: To all those bitching that this didn't happen ""TODAY"" do everyone else a favor and read point 2 in the rules. There's your TIL entry.

TL;DR Thought I knew how pellets guns worked but ended up shooting my friend at point blank range."
"TIFU by putting lotion on my feet when I was running late for work.


So as usual I woke up later than intended this morning and had to rush through my usual routine. Was scrambling around throwing everything and anything in my bag and remembered I had been wanting to take some lotion to put on my desk. So I decided todays the day and go grab the bottle of lotion from my room. Well of course the pump is open due to it being house lotion, so I have to take one for the cause and push it all the way down so I can close it for transport. Jump to 15 seconds later and I have a palm full of lotion and not enough skin exposed to deposit it onto. This is where I should have just washed it off in the sink, thrown the lotion in my bag and bolted. But my natural instincts would not let me waste 12 cents worth of lotion so I proceeded to slather, in the truest sense, my hands with about 3x more lotion than they could absorb. But I'm a smart problem solver, so I decide the reasonable thing to do is the distribute the lotion between my hands and the only other exposed part of my body..my feet. Fast forward and I am downtown, walking fast enough to cause heavy breathing trying to 1. Make the crosswalk light before it stops and 2. Get to work less than 10 minutes late. I was rounding the home stretch as I took my final ill-fated step and my right foot went rocketing backward, leaving my shoe and my momentum completely unchanged. In keeping with the laws of physics I proceeded to eat shit. Fast forward 5 more minutes (now)...sitting at my desk, fielding questions of why my face is scraped when I open my bag and realize the fucking lotion is still on the counter in my house.

TL;DR I put lotion on my feet, ate shit in the road. Edit: Forgot the lotion. Thanks /u/beebeelion 

Edit edit: Well this took off...Im proud to know that this incident is shared not only with the lucky commuters of downtown Dallas but also with all of you fine folk! "
"TIFU by spinning a fidget toy up to high RPM's


This happened roughly 30 minutes ago.
These finger spinner toys have been getting pretty popular at my school in the past week. Kids have been making their own, So i decided to make my own. three ball bearings, some zip ties, and hot glue. Worked good. I thought it would be a good idea to use an air compressor to see how fast i could make it spin. Held it up around eye level and started blasting it, In my head i was thinking it was pretty damn cool. Before i knew it the thing exploded. One bearing hit me in the thumb right below my nail, Possibly breaking it. The other bearing whizzed past my head and broke a window behind me. So glad i didn't lose an eye...
I recovered 2 of 3 bearings.

TL;DR: High speed ball bearings broke window and possibly my thumb.

Edit: to the people who are wondering how the hell I made this thing,  http://imgur.com/OcsAVTO
Basically that, but covered in hot glue.

Edit 2: My thumb is ok! As for the window......
Also my highest upvoted post, thanks for acknowledging my fuckup.

Edit 3: I'll put a picture of the window when I'm able to :) Edit: Here's the broken window!

"TIFU by failing at rocketry and lighting myself on fire, and then almost freezing to death


Obligatory didn't happen today, was several weeks ago.

Some backstory, a couple friends and I have a side hobby of rocketry, building model rockets and launching them out in the middle of nowhere at a one of our houses. They're homemade with sugar and KNO3, a good/safe project to work on in your free time. These are 100% legal (the high school I went to here even makes these as chemistry curriculum) and we always follow all the airspace guidelines and safety measures. 

The other day, we'd built one about three feet long with a good engine, and we were really optimistic about getting almost as far as we could push the legal airspace limit in our area. Went to light the fuse...nothing. It was about 0° and well below zero with big gusts of wind, and the lighter just wasn't having it. I soaked the fuse in lighter fluid, and still nothing.  The entire bottle of lighter fluid cracked too and spilled out, so we ended up using what was for the rocket fuse and engine to get it to light. Still nothing. 

I ran inside and grabbed a newspaper and a plastic box, lit the paper up and hauled ass back to our launch pad with a box of fire that would light the rocket in place of the lighter. At this point, we were all freezing to death and needed to get the launch done quick, so I lit up the fuse and sure enough, it went up in flames. Unfortunately, the high winds snapped part of the pad and a flaming rocket fell onto the ground, not moving but just burning fiercely. There was absolutely no risk of fire, as we launch after a rain/snowstorm and take the necessary precautions. Normally once the fire dies down within half a minute or so it can just be stomped out completely. We weren't too happy with the result of the whole mess so we cleaned up the debris and I went to stomp out the fire.

It is at this point that the fuckup began. You see, I forgot that the fuel was still burning a little. Normally this would be fine, but do you remember earlier when the lighter fluid bottle cracked open? Little did I know, the fluid had soaked into my jeans and I never noticed because I was already freezing. I stomped on the fuel, noticed that it was still burning, and then immediately noticed that my pants were ablaze. 

At this point I stomped again to get the fire off of my ankles, and it didn't work. Within a second or two it was almost to my balls, and I had no plans to deal with that. Cue me scrambling to remove my pants, on fire, in freezing weather. I made a mad dash for the water, and ending up rolling around on the ground while dousing myself in ice water. 

As soon as the fire went out, it hit me that the water was downright frigid. I put Usain Bolt to shame in the sprint to the house. I'm told that watching a singed, half-naked man in boxers soaked in ice water sprinting across a field in the middle of bumfuck nowhere was the highlight of my friend's lives. 

Tl;dr: Failed at extinguishing fire from a model rocket, lit self on fire, almost burnt balls, put out fire with buckets of ice water only to almost freeze balls in 0° weather. 

EDIT: Glad to see some other rocketry enthusiasts in the comments, even happier to see that safety is a priority. Anyone just getting into rocketry or wanting to should take away two things: rocketry can be really fun, but you gotta do it with the right safety procedures. There's almost always a rocketry club or organization nearby that'll happily guide you. 

EDIT II: For those asking about getting into hobby rocketry, look at joining a local club or organization such as NAR or Tripoli Rocket Association (TRA), check nearby for hobby shops that carry rocketry gear. Start small with an inexpensive rocket kit and motor to get a feel first, and then if you enjoy that move on to projects with an organization or some larger rocket kits. I would advise avoiding the ""sugar rocket"" model as it is risky if you don't know what you're doing (and still risky even if you do), and less reliable than commercial rocketry motors.

Make sure you're safe too, and take a look at your local airspace laws to see how high you can legally send a rocket into the sky. Also, launch in areas where you won't risk hitting other people's property or causing a fire, and please make sure to clean up *any and all* debris or garbage that might remain. 

Stay safe, and have fun!"
"TIFU by working in my yard 3 days before surgery


Well, actually about a week and a half ago... Anyway, a couple of days before carpal &amp; ulnar decompression surgery on my dominant arm, I decided that there were a lot of things around the yard that needed to get done before I was out of commission for 2+ weeks. I spent a couple of hours picking up branches and sticks and cutting down some brush- general maintenance. A couple days later surgery comes and goes pretty uneventfully , which is great for surgery. But about three days into my recovery I start noticing couple of raised bumps here and there on the arm that was operated on.  Within two days they turned into little blisters.  
  
Mother fucking poison fucking ivy.  
  
And some of it is under the dressing for the wound.   It's bad enough that I'm extremely uncomfortable to the point I can't sleep, but these angry blisters I can't get to are killing me. 

TL;DR worked in the yard three days before surgery, got poison ivy all over arm that was operated on
