"TIFU By not putting the toilet seat down [NSFW]


My dog loves nothing more than sitting on the toilet seat when I'm taking the shower. The other day though I was having some stomach problems and the world was coming out of my ass. As I sat on the commode almost in tears praying for it to be over, I can hear my dog scratching to get in. I lean over to crack the door not only to let him in, but to let some of the nasty smell out.

When I'm finish I reach for toilet paper and find there ain't none. With a tear in my eye I stand on up, feeling at least 10lbs lighter, and penguin walk across the room to grab some. Next thing I hear is my dumb dog leaping into the toilet and falling down the bowl.

Everything goes slow motion. My Beagle cross is covered in my feces, he's freaking out 'cause he done gone wet and stinks. He leaps outta the commode and hightails it outta the room and runs to my sister's bedroom across the hall.

Now y'all seen dogs when they get wet right? They be shaking and rubbing themselves all on the carpet and up the wall. I hear my sisters hollering and screaming 'cause my dog is spreading my muck all over their sheets, shaking it on their clothes and none of them wanna touch him 'cause he's filthy. They can only sit back and watch in horror as he ruins everything and tries to leap up at them. You see, my dog is a big old marshmallow and loves to jump up on people. 

I'm standing in the bathroom with my junk still out, still needing to wipe, and all the while thinking it might be worth locking the door and climbing out the window to freedom instead of facing my sisters wraths. 

**TL;DR** Beagle cross leaped into the toilet, got covered in my diarrhea, smeared it all around the house, my six sisters gave me hell. 

**EDIT**: Holy shit, thanks for the gold!! Makes all this worth it and definitely a story for the grandkids!

**EDIT 2**: Keep seeing the same comments, so gonna put some answers here

The bathroom door weren’t all the ways open, just about an inch at most. I closed it most of the way after my dog came in, but didn't click it shut so he just used his nose to open it. I had the decency to close the door after.

I’m male and from Alabama (North east), and I’m sorry for how I write. I just write how I speak and grammar never really was my strong point. 

My toilet paper is in a cabinet opposite the toilet, so I wasn’t walking around butt naked in my house. All I had to do was stand on up, waddle three steps, and I was home free.

What I’ve taken away from this is I’m gonna be flushing the toilet more often when I’m having difficulties, and gonna be storing my paper underneath the sink next to the darn toilet within arm’s reach. 

And finally, had some real nice comments about making everyone happy and I’m glad I could bring some enjoyment into your lives. I’m still in the doghouse, ain’t no doubt about that, but feels good to know I made some folks laugh. "
"TIFU trying to clean my blender.


I thought boiling water and dish washing liquid with a quick spin would clean it in a jiffy. What actually happened was the soap expanded so rapidly it burst the lid off and like the eruption of Vesuvius, it rained hell from the sky. I had to hide under a table."
"TIFU by going to my wife's first antenatal appointment


This happened last month, but I didn't think to post it here.


Wife had her first antenatal appointment last month, during which they needed to do a blood test. I have a huge irrational phobia of needles. Every time I have had to go for a blood test or a vaccination, I have passed out. I know my fear is irrational, but due to the passing out, the fear has just gotten worse over the years.


I figured since it wouldn't be me who would be getting the blood test done, I should be fine as long as I don't look. So as the nurse is taking the blood, I looked away and shut my eyes, but I could hear the nurse talking, she was having trouble getting drawing blood for some reason and my wife made sounds of pain. Instantly I started feeling dizzy, so I asked to leave the room.


I got up, left the room, and next thing I know I'm waking up from an awesomely deep sleep on the floor with more doctors around me than I have seen in my life. It took a while to remember what happened, I just felt like I woke up from an amazingly deep sleep. As I was quite confused as to what had happened, I tried to get up only to feel a horrible pounding in my head and bad neck pain. 


The doctors stopped me from getting up, and were doing their own thing, one taking blood to check my sugar level (which almost caused me to pass out again) because I hadn't had any food that day, another doing something on my arm which I wound find out about later. Apparently I hit the ground quite hard, and injured my neck. They ended up keeping my the whole day for observation. They done a CT scan for my neck and brain. Had signs of a concussion.


The doctors had put a neck strap on me, and I wasn't allowed to sit up until the scan results came back. When they finally let me sit up, ignoring the pain, everything else felt fine..... until I felt itching on my arm.


I scratched, and felt something odd. I looked down to notice the guy earlier had put an IV in my arm. I'm not sure why, because it was never used. Looked up at my wife, and said ""there's something in my arm"" and I couldn't stop the panic. She said my face went extremely pale. Next thing I know, I'm again waking up from an extremely deep sleep, thinking I'm still at home in bed, only to find I am surrounded by a crap load of doctors again. It took a few seconds to remember where I am again.


My wife said the heart rate monitor started beeping, and a crap load of doctors ran in.


Once I recovered, they teased me for quite a bit until they discharged me. They ended up putting a bandage around the IV so I don't see it again. There was an old lady visiting her husband in the same ward, who also teased me. ""Don't fall asleep again! You almost gave us a heart attack!"".


When they finally discharged me, the nurse, a very butch polish lady teased me about passing out, and said ""now it's time for me to wax you"". Confused, I said ""what?"". She said : ""You're a hairy guy. They used a lot of tape on your arm...."". She was very rough. The hair on my arm hasn't still fully grown back. :/


TL;DR: Wife went for antenatal appointment. I ended up passing out twice and almost giving an old lady a heart attack, and got waxed by a butch polish nurse.

EDIT: whoa, front page for the first time.

EDIT: Oh man, I'm so glad I'm not the only one who has this issue. It's actually very reassuring, albeit still very humiliating.


EDIT: OH MAN! Gold! Thank you so much kind redditor! I'm glad you enjoyed my screw up :)


EDIT: Just FYI, we had a miscarriage. Not disheartened, we'll try again. Hopefully next time I won't humiliate myself at the antenatal appointment. :)"
"TIFU by accidentally shutting down a bread factory.


This happened when I was a teenager, working in a bread factory for the summer. I mostly worked on the production line feeding hot-dog bun pans onto a conveyor belt, but I also had to do cleaning duties like emptying the garbage canisters full of swelling leftover dough, and sweeping the floors.

I was pushing one of the stiff push-brooms on this particular morning, and was cleaning the area close to the end of the factory line. Finished loaves of bread were rolling by on the conveyor belt, ready to be bagged.  

As I pulled back the broom to make another push forward, I accidentally stuck the arse-end of the broom into the underside of the conveyor belt.  The machine responded to this indignity by making a sickening mechanical sound, and the belt strained, buckled, and then ruptured.  The beautiful brown loaves of bread all started spilling onto the floor.  It was clear that I had done some serious damage.

I glanced around to see if anyone had noticed what had happened yet. They hadn’t, so I quickly mulled over my options.  I decided it would be best to run away.

I took my broom and discreetly started sweeping away from the scene of the accident.   I kept sweeping in the opposite direction until I swept myself right into the adjacent room.  After what seemed an eternity, someone finally spotted the mayhem, and I started to hear yelling.  

Someone quickly stopped the factory line.  I kept up my sweeping routine, and watched a crowd develop out of the corner of my eye.

Workers started to gather at the crime scene, and I decided that I would look guilty if I didn’t go over and look at the carnage like everyone else.  I took a deep breath and wandered over with the most curious and innocent look on my face that I could muster.

The foreman was already there, and a lot of other workers, and they were sifting through the evidence to try and find the cause of the malfunction.  One guy took his work boot, and used his toe to push aside some loaves of bread that lay on the floor.  He spotted something and called over to the foreman.

I looked closer too, and saw that they had discovered large splinters of wood that lay on the floor.  The foreman thought about this for a second, and then he looked up to study the conveyor.  After a few seconds, he spotted something else, and reached up to pull two more sizeable splinters out of the conveyor belt.  He looked confused and he conferred with one of the other workers to try and figure out what had happened.

At this point, I was just as curious as anyone where the splinters fit into all this, and I remember thinking that I had caused more damage than I had realized.  It was just after that precise thought when I glanced down at my broom.  What I saw made me immediately sick to my stomach.  

The top-end of my broom was clearly missing some splinters and it was blatantly obvious that the wounds were fresh.  My broom, and the splinters, were a perfect match.  I had been in such a hurry to leave the scene that I hadn’t even noticed my broom.  It was as if I had showed up at a murder scene, for a murder that I was responsible for, and was proudly brandishing the murder weapon and handing out bright red balloons to everyone.

I quickly stuffed the end of the broom under my armpit to hide the evidence, and I pretended that I was just as shocked and perplexed as anyone as to what had happened.  I spotted another broom just like mine in the next room, and I managed to get in there without drawing anyone’s attention.  I hid my splintered broom behind a door, grabbed the fresh broom, and continued sweeping and gossiping about the incident.  I was never caught, but they had to stop all production for a couple of hours while they repaired the damage I had caused.

TL;DR  Accidentally stuck a broom in a conveyor belt at a bread factory, and shut down the entire factory for a couple of hours.

"TIFU by electrocuting myself and immediately shitting all over my bed


EDIT: Thank you so much to whoever gilded this. Wow, this really blew up. 

This happened during this week, but I hadn't been able to post it on here until now.

My bedside table has a lamp, my phone, a full can of drink, and a bag of crisps on it. The lamp has a lead which runs down to the floor and is plugged into a 4 point extention plug which i also use to charge my laptop, phone, and whatever else needs power.

So i'm laying in bed, my mind fully on a game I'm playing on my laptop when my phone rings. Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but because I'm so immersed in my game, I reach over without looking and promptly knock the lamp over, which in turn knocks everything else on the table over and sends the can of drink on a suicide run down the side of my bed.

After much swearing and hurridly picking up my phone and the lamp, it suddenly occurs to me that coca cola and electricity might not be the best combination in the world, and I instinctively reach down to pull the lead out.

Unfortunately, despite having been told in childhood not to play with fire, run with scissors, talk to strangers, or indeed put my fingers near a live electrical socket. in the brief panic, all that common sense departs my brain, and I'm left grabbing down the side of the bed, frantically pulling at plugs that are dripping with sugary soda

It's roughly 3 or 4 seconds later when the most intense stinging pain i've ever felt in my life shoots through my hand, and by some miracle I jerk my hand back as the entire plug makes a popping noise and starts to smell of charred plastic and burned fingertips.

It's within those first few moments, somewhere between the thoughts of ""Oh my God, I'm still alive"" and ""Damn, I hope my laptop charger is ok"" that a strange gurgling sound eminates from the depths of Hell known as my stomach.

The human race has evolved for millennia to have a fight or flight instinct, and when faced with a massive scare, is well known for dropping it's... uh...baggage at the first oppertunity.

So it is with great horror I realise, as I lay there in my nice comfortable bed, that my body has decided that now, of all times, would be the perfect moment to let rip with a stream of hot mushy diarrhea.

Gee, thanks anus, you really shouldn't have.

As I struggle to my feet, I feel it emerging, like a beast from a pit, bursting it's way into this world.

I make it to my knees, and look around, There's no way i'm gonna get to the bathroom in time, and having to navigate the bedroom, the hall way, and a small set of stairs to the toilet seems a challange akin to climbing Mount Everest.

There's only one thing I can do. I grab the bag of crisps and slam it against my erupting anus.

But of course, the bag is far too small, and not even close to being properly positioned, and the horrific gush of shit swiftly overwhelms it like a flood.

There has to be another way, I think, briefly considering my clothing, my bed sheets, or a pillowcase... YES! Thank you pillowcase, I knew you would come in handy one day!

The pillowcase, in it's delicate cream and blue coloring quickly joins the crisp packet, It won't hold long, but it stems the flow just long enough for me to make my escape.

I run to the bathroom with the speed of The Flash...if The Flash was covered in his own poop... hurling myself towards the toilet at near light speed.

30 minutes later I emerge, in shock, but no longer spraying shit like a burst sewer pipe

I survey the damage.

There's shit on my bed, down my legs, up my arms, across the floor, infact there's probably more areas of my bedroom covered with my own shit than I ever thought possible.

I begin the long, slow, and disgusting job of clearing up, and think to myself, at least one thing came out of this. I can finally post something on TIFU

Oh, and I found out the phone call was just a marketing call after all that... Fuck my life.

TL:DR got an electric shock from dropping a soda on a live socket and shit myself in bed"
"TIFU by sitting on a public toilet.


My boyfriend and I are regulars at this bar/restaurant in Austin. One day we went in there and had quite a few drinks. I had to pee pretty bad and when the person came out of the stall I ran in and just sat quickly. Usually I don't sit on public toilets unless I know it's a nice place and (usually) always clean. Well I sit down and feel something squish under me. In shock I stood quick and looked down... Someone shit ON the seat. I'm also not talking like a solid shit... This was like a soft serve shit. As I stood up, it went all down INTO my pants, all over my legs etc. I freaked out.. I wiped it up  the best I could while gagging and had to walk through the f*n restaurant probably smelling horrible to the front to get my boyfriend. He saw me and immediately knew something was wrong. I dragged him into a stall with me and he had to ask the bartender for wet wipes. I was mortified... Obviously everyone thought I shit myself. 
I had to throw out the pants I was wearing and wear my boyfriends pants. He wore his sweatshirt as pants home. 

All in all...I never go back there.. But I have a good boyfriend, and also ALWAYS LOOK AT THE TOILET BEFORE YOU SIT. NO MATTER WHAT."

"TIFU by losing my virginity to a foreign escort


Obligitory ""this happened on monday"". I’m 25M and I took an extended vacation in Berlin for 3 weeks. I’m overweight and it has caused some self-esteem issues with the ladies over the course of my life. I’m self-conscious about it and, as such, I’ve always been terrified to have any kind of physical relationship.

Whilst visiting Italy for a 2 day detour, I saw a prostitute on the street and it piqued my curiosity. The streets aren’t exactly littered with them where I’m from and it’s illegal there anyway, so it’s never been something I thought twice about. I went back to my hotel and a quick google revealed that prostitution is perfectly legal in most parts of Europe, so I decided to leave my V-card in Berlin. Experience every part of the culture here. As I’d never had a girlfriend and zero sexual experience of any kind up to this point in my life, I’d pretty much given up hope that it was ever going to happen for me, so I made up my mind. End the trip ‘with a bang’. Calibrate my confidence and get that first (if only) time out of the way. So I started doing some research. I looked into brothels all over the city, checked the menus, the prices, etc. I really did my homework and carefully considered my options. I wasn’t just going to throw it away in some nasty place I’d want to forget about. After finding the option that fit with my budget and preferences, I ventured out into the city for one last big adventure before heading back to the states. The subway ride there was gut wrenching; my hands were shaking, my heart was pounding, and when I got off the train I felt like I was going to vomit. I was more nervous than I had ever been in my entire life.

I got there, and it was a classy place. Really nicely decorated. Not ritzy, but elegant and nice. But my anxiety only got worse. I picked a room and they sent in the girls that were available for me to choose from. They came in, spun around, and walked out. One by one. My anxiety worsens yet again, and my glasses literally fogged up. I thought that was something that only happened in movies and cartoons. I picked the girl I liked. They housekeeper came in with a Red Bull on a fancy silver platter for me, and five minutes later the girl I picked came in. She was a Brazilian goddess. Insanely hot, curves in all the right places, and an absolute knockout. I held out a trembling hand full of cash and attempted to discuss terms and compensation with her. Here’s the first part of the fuck up. I quickly realized this girl I picked didn’t speak a single fucking word of English. And now I was too nervous to ask for someone else. From there on out, the two of us were communicating with hand gestures.

She gestured for me to disrobe, and I was so terrified I actually asked her if I could keep my pants on. She shook her head. So I disrobed and said “it gets bigger”. What can I say? I’m a grower, not a show-er. She had me lay face down on the bed and started to massage me. Eventually she flipped me back over and I was totally, completely, 100% flaccid. So she started to use her hand. I don’t know what she thought she was going to accomplish by going so fast, but she was really just mashing it into oblivion. I made a ridiculous “slow jerk” motion with my hand to get her to slow down. Thank God she understood that, or we would have had serious problems. 

The second part of the fuck up, as it turns out, was a decade in the making. I’d been watching porn practically every day since puberty, and my member just wasn’t as excited as I was. So guess who didn’t want to wake up? Yup. A combination of my nerve-wracking fear and a likely over indulgence in adult entertainment had effectively turned my gizzard into a taffy puller. Eventually she got it hard enough to put it in, but she just kind of sat there and wiggled around on it for some reason. Probably because at this point it’s not long or hard enough to do much else with. To clarify, she was on top the entire time. I didn’t move once. I just sort of laid there, petrified, and let her do the necessaries. Anyway, not long after it went soft and slipped right back out again. 

The condom wasn’t doing me any favors. I tried saying the word “bounce”. Huzzah! She understood that one. But all for naught; the next 30 minutes (I paid for 40, mind you) were comprised of switching back and forth between her riding me and her using her hands to get me hard again. Mostly the latter. Her body language and facial expression both indicated, after a while, that this was not something she was used to. Not disappointed or frustrated. More like surprised and confused. Ok, maybe a little frustrated, too. Who could blame her? She had a body that would give a dead man wood. And here she is, struggling to give an erection to someone who is far too young to suffer from erectile dysfunction. At one point I suggested she use her mouth. Turned out she spoke 3 words of English. “That costs extra.” I didn’t have extra, so I had to make do.

No kissing on the mouth and no oral probably didn’t help the situation either. Miraculously, this story eventually had a happy ending, though I have no idea how. She said “come”, so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and focused. Unfortunately, with my eyes closed, I was so preoccupied with finishing that I didn’t pay any attention to what she was doing down there. Cue fuck up number three. When she was finishing me off with her hand, she took the condom off and aimed my dick…at me. Like, straight back at me. I get it. She has a job to do. It (probably) wasn’t malicious. She just didn’t want to get messy. However, collateral damage on my end clearly wasn’t a concern of hers. Don’t get me wrong, it felt great, but when I’m by my lonesome I usually take measures to ensure I’m not my own blank canvas. So ensues another misfire, quite literally, in an awkward sexual encounter as I proceeded to spray myself machine-gun-style all over my own torso. There were a dozen places in the room I’d rather have done it, but closing my eyes like it was a fucking surprise party made it a good day for some friendly fire. 

 She smiles, hands me a towel, and says what I can only assume is Portuguese for “You just rocked my world.” Then she points to the clock. She was giving me the five-minute warning. We were already done because we had wasted so much time trying to get me hard.  I suppose it’s better than lasting 30 seconds for my first time. In the end I really don’t know if it was nerves or the porn. I’m guessing it was a little of both, but I psyched myself out way too much and the end result was a hot Brazilian woman trying to figure out what to do with an incredibly flaccid penis. So now I’ll always remember my first horribly awkward sexual encounter as one with someone who couldn’t get me hard and had no idea why because she didn’t speak English. 




TLDR; Accidentally picked an escort that spoke no English, couldn’t stay hard, and came all over myself when I finally could.

"TIFU by going to Ikea alone.


Happened 2 days ago, been a long time lurker and made an account just for this.  Basically I'm on leave before I start my new job.  Since my wedding is coming up real soon I thought I'd be productive and go shopping for furniture for the fiance before she moves in.

So I decide to buy a DOMBÅS 3 door wardrobe which comes in 2 packages, one about 40kg and the other about 47kg.  I didn't take it as a warning when I was struggling to carry both onto the trolley. (thanks to how massive the packages were)

And to cut a long story short, as I was carrying one of the packages to the car, it slipped from my hands because I was basically gripping it stupidly, and slammed into my right toe.  Fracturing it, and ruining all my plans for the next few weeks.  I may potentially still be hobbling when it's time to go for our pre-wedding photoshoot.

TLDR: Went to Ikea along, dropped 40kg worth of furniture on right big toe and ruined all my plans for the next few weeks.

Edit:  Wow, did not expect this to hit front page!  The conversations here are amazing!"

"TIFU By taking my friend to the bank.


This happened August of last year.

This all started when I was working for a construction company picking and delivering materials. I got a call from my boss asking me to check his house every morning while he was out of the country. I go to check on his house and pick up his mail when I get a call from my friend. He asks me if I can take him to the mall, I said sure since I had to go that way to pick up material. I pick him up and he asks me to take him to a bank that's close the mall so that he can give me money for gas, I was ok with that and we proceed to go to the bank. When we were getting close to the bank he asked me to park on the building next to the bank (which I thought was suspicious but didn't give it a second thought) he goes in the bank and comes out in less than a minute. I tell him "" that was fast"" and he replied "" I know, there wasn't a line"" so I just drove. Two blocks later he says ""here"" and tosses an envelope full of money. I parked in the nearest parking space and say wtf! I tell him to get out of the van and I started to panic, so I parked in a local supermarket and waited for the police to show. I see 10 cop cars pull up to the van and tell me to get out of the van. I did and I tried to explain that I didn't know what happened and that I wasn't involved but they still arrested me and got booked in. An hour later him and his brother get booked in also. Days passed and I finally talk to the investigator. He says that a note and the money were found in the van I was driving and that I took him there and that looks bad. I tried to explain my side of the story and he asks why I dropped him off and not called 911. I told him the truth that I panicked and didn't know what to do but wait. That night I get sent to county jail and spent the next 90 day there. I got 5 years deferred adjudication because ""the evidence were stacked against me""
 
TL;DR: Got asked to take a friend to the bank, the robbed the bank and I spent 3 months in jail.

Update: I checked the public records and the guy who robbed the bank only got 7 years deferred adjudication! His brother who picked him up without knowing of the robbery his still going to court, the bank robber might have thrown his innocent brother under the bus!

"TIFU by taking a laxative and ending up in the hospital for several days (where I still am).


Sorry to disappoint any folks, but believe it or not, this one doesn't involve any pants being shit. You can hit the back button now if you'd like, though there is some very mild talk about shit if that's what you came for.


So last week, starting on the Fourth of July, I was having some severe abdominal pain, fever, hot/cold sweats, headaches, etc. My self-diagnosis went from worst hangover of my life, to alcohol withdrawals, to kidney stones, for the next two days. The next day, I decided I was probably dumb and it was probably just constipation, which is something I have never experienced before, but have heard can be very painful. I had barely shit for several days, only some minor runs, so it made sense.


So I did what I thought made sense and I took a laxative.


A few hours later no pooping had occurred and the pain had strongly intensified, while also moving from just the middle of my abdomen and pelvis to the right side as well.


I decided constipation wasn't it so I did some further research. Based on my symptoms, it seemed that maybe I was having an appendicitis. I continued researching appendix issues and then began to freak out when I read that *taking laxatives can cause your appendix to burst.*

I freaked the fuck out and left my desk at work (after just returning from sick days) immediately and walked to the nearest hospital. I was sweating profusely and having a mild panic attack the entire way, and worse, my GPS wasn't working because of the tall buildings. I had to keep walking back and forth trying to find the hospital.

I finally found it and checked myself in to the ER and told them I needed an immediate appendectomy. 

They took blood and gave me an EKG scan and some other tests. Five hours later, they informed me I have diverticulitis (and that my colon ""pouches"" had ruptured).

So I've been here in the hospital since Thursday, without anything to eat or even a drop of water. 

I would (probably) much rather have had any of my other self-diagnoses be true, and would have gone to a much better hospital had I known I'd be staying this long. The ""FU"" in this case actually is probably a blessing, because at least now I finally know why I've been having so many stomach issues for the last *four* years.



Edit: Some people have pointed out that it may not be clear for some that diverticulitis is not a ruptured appendix. It is entirely different, and I stupidly dealt with it for over four years because I attributed it to other things like GERD, IBS, and alcohol. Don't do the same:

Also, I really hope my next post isn't ""TIFU by getting addicted to morphine because I FU and took a laxative and ended up in the hospital.""
