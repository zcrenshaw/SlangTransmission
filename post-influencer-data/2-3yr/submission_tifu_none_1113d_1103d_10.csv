"TIFU by applying for jobs with the Windows 10 Mail app for a year.


Finally, I get to post one of these! And bonus, it happened today! This is pretty much the only bright side to the whole thing, sadly.

Because I am human, I enjoy money, and I decided quite a while ago that I wanted more of it, so I started applying for other jobs. Also, because I live in the 21st century, and you can't just wander into a building and instantly become the manager anymore, I've been doing all of these applications online. So, being the good little applicant that I am, I made sure my CV was perfect and up-to-date, and made sure to write a personalised cover letter for every single job I applied for. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, except for the fact that over the past few months, I haven't even been getting any rejections any more, much less positive replies or interviews.

This continued on for several months, and all the while, my self-esteem started to plummet. A whole bunch of idiots from my high school have decent jobs! I see them on Facebook! How come I can't get one? Last week, trying to be a little less direct in my approach, I decided to email a whole bunch of recruitment agencies too...and even they didn't reply. What? I could be making you money, guys! Don't just ignore me! What are you, every girl I ever knew until age 17?

The fact that they didn't reply stirred up my curiosity. My CV is saved as a Word document, but I use an alternative program. Maybe the formatting is getting messed up and making me look unprofessional, and I can't see it on my PC? So, I decided to email my girlfriend to test it...using the Windows 10 Mail app. As I have been since probably last July.

I sent her an email with the CV attached, and the subject ""Test"". [This is what she received.](http://i.imgur.com/0VgvAdy.jpg) No attachments or anything. I then decided to try using the browser version of Gmail, which I haven't done in a long time. It worked perfectly.

7 fucking months, Microsoft. 7 Goddamn shitty fucking months since I've had a job interview. Eat a fucking bouquet of dicks.

**TL;DR: Microsoft broke all my fucking job applications for the better part of a year and I had no idea.**

Edit: Not suing Microsoft, guys. First, this is almost certainly my fault (I AM on TIFU, not techsupport). Second, I am English. We don't sue. We complain in the pettiest medium available to us. "
"TIFU telling special students that Jack Black is a role model of a successful down syndrome person


I work as a TA for instrument performance and composition in school, and I volunteered for teaching a special ed class with mostly 12~18 y/o? down syndrome students about piano, guitar and singing. 

I didn't know how to deal with these kids while supervisor was observing, but they pretty much went along cluelessly for whatever I said. One kid asked me ""How can we be good?"" and I kind of got saddened by the fact that the kid was aware that he won't be capable to achieve what people with normal mentality can achieve, and wanted to brighten them up whether or not if that was the reason why the kid asked or not. But I pretty much had to bullshit all the way and stall since I couldn't think of any successful people with mental disability except the McDonald's worker with down syndrome who retired that I saw on Reddit.

So I just quickly ran down my memory to find a famous person who looks like a disabled person, and came up with Jack Black. Then I played some video clips of him and told how successful he is.

Next few weeks they went full-on pro-Jack Black and now the classroom has a portrait frame of him above and watch his movies for ""Motivation"". Everyday they ask me to play Wonderboy. They want to write a letter to him and invite him to the school. I've done it, I'm fucked."
"TIFU by assaulting a small child


Okay, so I posted this yesterday, but my formatting was all kinds of fucked up so they took it down.
     Anyway here's the story:
     So I'm the general manager at an upscale(ish) Japanese steakhouse. The kind of place where they do the hibachi grill in front of you and charge you $20 for a plate that's 75% rice. Anyway, it's Friday night. We're balls to the wall busy and, like most restaurants on a Friday night, everything is generally chaos. I currently don't have an assistant manager, so at any one time I'm doing 8,000 different things by myself. So fast forward to the peak of our rush tonight. We have a group of 25 eight year olds show up to eat for one of the little fuckers birthdays. That's 25 eight year olds that are being supervised by 4 adults... In other words it's pretty much my worst fucking nightmare. 
      So I'm running around trying to make sure the other 150+ customers are being taken care of while all these prepubescent little shits are treating my restaurant like its a god damn chuck e cheeses. Meanwhile the 4 adults are at the bar drinking, presumably because they've been put in charge of 25 demonic hell spawns. At this point I'm so busy that I don't even have time to be concerned about these little demons or the worthless parents that should be trying to control them. 
       I'm standing in the lobby when I see a waitress flag me down from across the room. I'm making my way through the crowd that's amassed in the lobby and I'm moving at a pretty brisk pace. Suddenly I have one of the hostesses behind me shout me name and I do very abrupt 180 to turn around and see what they need. It was in this 180 turn that apparently I forgot how to control my arms. I turned around so quickly that my arm swung out in a weird kind of sweeping arc and the large faced, very heavy, metal watch that was on my wrist makes the most solid contact imaginable with this eight year olds forehead. I hit that kid so hard I half expected someone to pop out of the crowd and yell ""WORLDSTAR!"". My watch actually cut the kid when it hit him, so he's laying on the ground bawling and bleeding everywhere, I'm just standing there staring at the kid in shock, and the kids dad (who just happened to be one of the 4 adults) has now left the bar and is making a bee-line right for me and his concussed 8 year old. 
      The guy immediately gets in my face and starts screaming at me for hitting his kid. At this point I'm still trying to be all about customer service and I'm trying to calmly and politely explain that it was an accident and I'm extremely sorry. The dad continues to be a massive asshole, accusing me of assaulting a child and threatening to call the police. Finally I just snapped. I always treat customers with respect and kindness even when they're being belligerently douchey, but I just couldn't deal with this guy. I blow up on him, and ask him what kind of shitty father sits at a bar drinking while a horde of children he's responsible for run around a restaurant unsupervised. I tell him that if he gave a shred of a shit about his kid he would've been watching him and this never would've happened. At this the father becomes irate. He starts screaming about what a shitty restaurant we are and about what a shitty manager I am. He grabs his kid (who's still crying and bleeding) by the arm, yanks him off the ground and proceeds to storm outside, streaming a slew of profanity as he leaves. 
     About 15 minutes pass when suddenly two police officers walk in with this guy riding their coat tails like he's hot shit. The police come to question me and they're very curious as to why I ""would punch a child in the face"". I explain to them it was all a complete accident and a total misunderstanding. I explain how everything was caught on the restaurants security cameras and I'd be happy to show them the footage. They watched it, agreed that it was a total accident, and cleared me of any wrong doing. When the cops go to leave without me in handcuffs the father becomes absolutely furious and starts screaming at me and the police officers in the middle of the lobby. The cops begin to explain to the man he needs to calm down before they're forced to do something. This makes him even more mad. Then I mention to the police officers how the guy never paid for the drinks he had at the bar and how he just walked out on his tab. (Now I realize I may have caused brain damage to his child and I probably could've just let him have the drinks to compensate, but fuck that guy.) When I accuse the guy of walking out on his tab it becomes too much for his insignificant little mind to bare and he snaps. He lunges at me, swings, and totally misses. I jump out of the way as the cops take the guy down and slap the handcuffs on him. The police then dragged him out the front door while he was screaming at everyone he could possibly scream at and that was the last we saw of him. At least for tonight anyway.


TL,DR: I run a restaurant. Large group of unsupervised little shits show up. 8 year old little shit's not paying attention to me, I'm not paying attention to him. In a whirlwind of fast paced movement my large metal watch collides with his face and basically knocks him the fuck out. Little fucker's shit stick of a father flips out. Chaos ensues. 



Edit: I just got off work and saw that this was front page, so that's pretty dope. I guess I should say thanks for that? I never really thought so many people would be overjoyed by me hulk-smashing a child into oblivion, but the lord works in mysterious ways. 
         To everyone asking how exactly I fucked up I would refer to the part where I unleashed the watch of wrath on a child's forehead. And I might not have finished that business degree I started, but I'm pretty sure your general manager Kimbo Slicing a youngling isn't good for business. Also my job might not exactly be safe if this guy talks to a lawyer. Although that might not be all bad, because fuck managing a restaurant, am I right? It's pretty much the closest thing to hell.
         And to everyone bitching about my formatting.
Eat a bag of syphilitic dicks, I manage a fucking restaurant for a living. Do you really expect a literary masterpiece? Be happy I even attempted to make paragraphs. 
         But thanks again for the whole front page thing and all the discussions about child clubbing. That's pretty cool.



Edit 2:
And to everyone saying I'm a shitty manager for going off on that guy, go fuck your own face. In the 4 months since I took over our rating has increased across all social media, we've been making more money, and our service is regularly complimented. And I'm in charge of an entire restaurant at 23, so fuck you. I've got plenty of wiggle room for experience and lesson learning in my life/management career.


Edit 3:
Harambe. Never forget.

Last edit: 
I saw where someone gilded me, so I will say the customary thank you for that. As is tradition."
"TIFU by making a dad joke


So today (wow, today!) I was at my cousin's birthday party. He's still really young, he was turning 6. (For reference, I am 16, too old for a kids party but too young to sit with the adults and drink beer) We go to a bowling alley where they do kids parties, and everything is going well, I get a few strikes, everyone's happy. 

Then we go into the party room, where we are served the food. You can imagine how out of place I felt, towering over these tiny kids as we eat ""food"" with plastic cutlery and the mandatory party hat on our heads. The other kids realise this too. The little girl who I was facing looks at me inquisitively.

Little Girl: ""Excuse me. How old are you?""

Me: Sixteen.

LG: Oh. I'm Seven.

Me: Hi Seven, I'm Dad.

Her eyes widen, almost as if they were going to pop right out of her head and bail, and a look of absolute euphoria spreads across her face. She jumps up and runs to me, hugging me, kissing whatever part of me she could reach, saying ""Oh daddy! I've missed you! Where have you been?"" 

Me, confused as all hell, looks at the adults for some kind of support / explanation, and I was met with mostly disappointed or angry looks. One particular angry look was from this little girl's mother. She storms up to me, grabs her daughter, and walks off. They talk in the corner for a minute, and the little girl bursts into tears. Mother and daughter exit the building. 

My mum looks at me with complete disdain, and asks me why the fuck I said what I had said (all adults were close by, within hearing distance of the little girl and I). I told her that I thought it was kind of funny, and it might make her laugh. She shakes her head and tells me the story.

This little girl's dad did a walkout several months after she was born. Her parents were fighting, the dad was an alcoholic, and after one particularly nasty argument, he packs his stuff and straight up bails on the family. The girl was too young to remember her father's appearance, but treasures the memory of his presence. When I said I was her dad, all she wanted to do was believe her dad was back, despite the unlikeliness and improbability of it. 

In other words, I broke her fucking heart. 

I am now sitting at home, contemplating my previous decisions, privately resolving to not show my face amongst my extended family for a while, and feeling like the worst human being to have lived. 

**TL;DR** If you make a dad joke without being a dad, it must be bad karma or something because I convinced a basically fatherless child I was her dad.

**Edit** Thank you all for the words of support / the proper delivery of a dad joke. I should have indeed said my own name, that would have saved me from a bit of pain. For those telling me to send an apology note, I could but it would seem out of place. She never knew my actual name, she was just another girl amongst 20 or so other kids, and not a part of my family, just a friend of my cousin's. And for those asking, I won't be hooking up with the girl's mum. I feel bad saying that she *wasn't* hot, I'm sure she was in her day. Right now she just looks worn and tired.

"TIFU by forgetting about potatoes


For the past 3 weeks I've had a horrible cough, and have had nausea ever time I've been in my 1 bedroom apartment. Every single time I walked into it, I always got hit by this ammonia like smell that I thought were cleaning supplies. 

I've been having to keep all my doors and windows open, which sucks because I live in a hot area and I can't turn on the A/C doing so. And at night when I go to bed and close everything, I start coughing horribly. 

Last night I was putting away stuff I got from the grocery store. I was trying to find a place to put something and I opened a drawer... I was hit by this super strong odor that made me start coughing and retching immediately. I walked away, went outside, and felt like I was about to pass out. 

A few minutes later, I went back in, held my breath, and saw that I left a dozen small potatoes in there. I was told to keep them in a cool, dry place and I thought a drawer would be that.

Apparently not, they were all moldy, and that mold leaked into the wooden drawer. I picked them up, threw them out down the garbage chute, and have been aerating my apartment while I'm at work.

About a year ago, [I read this story](http://archive.is/cbmbR) about how rotting potato gas killed almost an entire family. I assume that's whats been making me sick (I hope at least, because then I found the problem). I'm going to get my blood checked in a few days because my lungs hurt.

**TL:DR**: In Latvia, even having potato can kill you.

**edit** My highest rated post after reddit'ing for 2 years is about potatoes.

**edit 2** Some people have suggested Carbon Monoxide. Whats a good, cheap detector? I live in a multi-unit apartment so would it just apply to me, or to the entire building?

**edit 3** Was just informed that carbon monoxide is a meme. The detector I ordered will be a just in case!"
"TIFU by declining the services of a lady of the evening


While not today, this happened recently, so recently that I’m a little worried that some kind hotel maintenance employee is going to see this and start putting pieces together in his head and figure out what happened, but I know if I don’t post this now I’ll forget it.

I was in Las Vegas for work.  Not an unusual event for me; in fact so not unusual that I normally come and go without touching a casino table or doing almost anything “Vegas” while I’m there.  But I was entertaining others, wound up spending too much time too late at night at the bar, and when I got back to my hotel I made the mistake of sitting down alone for one last drink at one of the bars downstairs on the casino floor.

Sitting and minding my own business, I’m approached by a beautiful brunette who asks if she can sit down next to me and if I have any interest in buying her a drink.  She’s pretty enough, and I tell her I’d love to buy her a drink.  We get to talking, normal stuff, asking lots about me and what I do, and after about 30 minutes of flirting and laughing and talking and drinking, she asks if I have a room, and if so if I want to go upstairs.

“Fuck yeah, I still have it,” I think to myself.  I tell her that “I think that’s a lovely idea,” and we head up to my room.

We get up to my room, and she looks around, walks in and out of the bathroom, then comes over to me and says “it’s $700 for an hour, but don’t worry about the time, I’m not going to rush you and we’re going to have a lot of fun.”

After a quick though as to whether I could afford such a sum, my better judgment came to me, and the blood quickly drained from my second brain as something resembling depression set in.  I explained to her that I had completely misread the situation, and that there was no way I could pay her that kind of money.

She was angry at first, telling me that she’d been clear from the beginning, and asking why I changed my mind.  After some negotiating downward in price, to which I continued to decline each offer, I handed her fifty bucks from my wallet, apologized for wasting her time, and wished her well.  She thanked me for “being a sweetheart” and told me not to apologize, but asked if she could quickly use my bathroom to freshen up before she left.  No problem, she uses the toilet, freshens up, kisses me on the cheek and leaves.  I go to sleep and wake up to my alarm going off way too early the next morning.

I hit snooze a few times, and finally drag my hung-over butt out of bed to the shower.
Where I’m greeted by a very large, very long, very messy, and very-much-not-mine turd sitting on the dry shower floor.

Fuck.

She’d left me a present.

Unfortunately, this is only where my fuck up begins.

Not wanting to touch her shit, I decide to start the shower, point the water over it, and let it wash away until it broke up and ran down the drain.  I turn the shower on, start with just cold water in order not to steam up and spread the smell, but then realize that the pressure is better with hot water and crank up the temperature, point it at the turd, close the curtain, and walk away.

Fifteen minutes later, I get a knock on my door.  Maintenance is standing outside the room asking if they can help, as water is coming through the ceiling in the bathroom below mine.

Shit.  Fuck.  What????  Shit shit shit shit shit.

At this point, I have the door closed and haven’t looked, but I quickly tell him that “I’m sorry, the tub overflowed earlier, it’s all taken care of and I mopped up the floor with towels, and I’m very sorry for the inconvenience.”  He tells me all is good, and runs off to bring me fresh towels.  In the meantime I run into the bathroom where I find half an inch of water on the floor, as the shower curtain was hanging on the wrong side of the tub and the shower for the past 15-20 minutes has been spraying 1/3 of its spray directly onto the bathroom floor.

I quickly shut off the shower, and start mopping up the floor, but wow is this a lot of water.  I use up all my towels, and luckily get a knock on the door a minute later with the maintenance man bringing more.  A couple more and the floor is in pretty good shape, and I’m all set.  Hopefully no charges appear on my bill, no bad damage, big fuckup avoided.

I’m late at this point, though, and need to get showered and out the door.  I quickly strip, poke my head in to turn the shower back on, and see that **the fucking turd is still there**.  Now that’s not completely accurate.  Probably 2/3 of the turd was still there.

At this point I’m fucked, I’m out of time, and I just need to get on with my life.  So I did it.  I pushed the turd to the drain with my foot, and slowly but surely broke it up with my toes and got it to go down.  I waffle-stomped a hooker’s shit.

I remember now why I don’t usually drink this much.


TL;DR Made waffles with a hooker - 5/7 with rice.

"TIFU and Made it Rain Porn on my Mom. NSFW, to be safe, not sorry.


This fuck-up happened almost half my lifetime ago when I was young, stupid, and still lived at home. 


For background, in high school I lived in a mostly finished basement room of my mom's house with a loft bed and a drop-ceiling. I also had a job that allowed horny teenaged me to amass a large trove of porn magazines and a small handful of videos on the sly.  

Envisioning myself to be a clever little shit, I stashed my ill-gotten gains by popping up a tile in the ceiling near my bed  and storing them in the gap between the drop ceiling and the actual ceiling.    
Being a lazy little shit who didn't want to use a ladder or stool to have to search more than one place for what I was looking for, I had everything stacked atop the same tile next to my bed.  
Eventually, the collection grew to the point where, if you knew to look for it, you could actually see that tile bowing, as it struggled valiantly under the weight of my wank bank.  


Time went on, I graduated, and prepared to move out to college. I had my doubts about the feasibility of bringing twenty plus pounds of porn with me, and besides, I had built my own PC at this point, so I left my hoard behind, assuming it would be as safe up there as it had always been.  

Fast forward almost a month when I get a phone call from my mom.  
""Hi LWVR"", she says, sounding a bit bubbly, even for her cheery self.  
""Hi mom, how's it going?"" I asked, wondering what was up.   
""Goood... listen, I was trying to clean the house up a bit to see if I can sell it, finish the basement, that kind of thing""   
""Yeah?"" *The basement? Shit, I wonder if she found it*  
""and I went to take down the drop ceiling in your room,"" she continues, a wry tone in her voice.   
""fuck..."" I whisper under my breath.  
""Something like that,"" she replies, still chipper. ""turns out when I got about halfway down the room, I took one of the supports down and the whole rest of the ceiling and a lot of magazines just collapsed on top of me.""  
""On top of you? Shit, are you alright?""  
""I'm fine, just don't think any of this will be here when you get back, and I thought you'd want to hear the story.""  
""Sorry, mom...""  

And that's the story about how I lost my high school porn stash when it avalanched onto my mom along with half my ceiling, scaring the shit out of her, but leaving her ultimately uninjured.  
  
tl;dr: Op's Porn Pours over Parent."
"TIFU by following my kid down the stairs while I was carrying a box.


Last night I had to bring a rather large box down the stairs and my 3 year old was already halfway down. I began my descent, slowly one step at a time.

Unfortunately 3 year olds tend to be quite short so I didn't realise she had stopped.....until I knee'd that poor kid in the back and sent her flying. Luckily our stairs curve round so she didn't have far to fly and she bounced off the wall quite safely. A little lip cut nothing horrific.

Bedtime comes so it's time to say goodnight to her Dad (he works very late and did not witness the 'incident') on FaceTime. Thinking I'd got away with it I left them to chat before I hear 'OH, and mummy kicked me down the stairs'. She offered him no explanation just told him that and said goodnight. Her Dad is now probably weighing up the costs of some hidden cameras to check what the hell I do to this child while he's at work. 

TL;DR heavy box blocked my stairs view, I kicked my child down stairs, she grassed me up instantly to her dad at work.

Edit: I would like to thank every one for not calling social services on my ass! Some of the stories on this post are hilarious! Thanks for the laughs :)"
"TIFU by packing several jars of spices with my books and electronics.


I packed them into one suitcase to take on a flight with me to college. The spice jars broke. All my books, my tablet, and my microphone are now coated in garlic powder and who knows what else. Garlic powder has a very strong smell. There's no real way to clean it out of a book or off of a tablet because it's fine-grain and using water would be a bad idea. So my books and electronics all just reek of garlic. They're still coated in copious amounts of the stuff. Life is suffering."
"TIFU by accidentally playing ""Born to Be Wild"" at my Grandfather's funeral


I was put in charge of the music playlist for my Grandfather's funeral, which consisted of quite beautiful classical and choir music selected by my Grandmother. I had everything set up in playlists on my Spotify account and felt a little nervous but prepared. I started to play the first playlist as people entered, but what I didn't realize is that the ""Up Next"" feature overrides the playlist feature, so instead of playing the next classical song in the playlist, my phone started to blare ""Born to Be Wild"". I heard it as I walked in and luckily cut it off, but not before I heard a few chuckles."

"TIFU by knocking out my brother with a potato


Obligatory, this didn't happen today. It happened around 11 years ago, and has only come to mind from all the potato posts recently. Maybe we should just get rid of potatoes?

Be me, somewhere between 7-10 years old, playing outside on a hot summers day. I was one of three children, and my parents were relatively rich for the area we lived in (one of the most expensive streets around that area). This meant that we had some of the coolest toys, swimming pools, them battery-powered racecars; the lot. 


Now there is 2 years between myself and my other brothers (so if I was 8, my little brother was 6 and my older 10). We'd always mess around and play pranks on eachother whenever we could, such as launching a water balloon out of the window to hit someone in the head.

Timmy was my best friend who lived just across the street, and his parents got him a new toy. He had a [spud gun](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBITDO15l78f4J68Ia9N_TQ.jpg). The way a spud gun works is you dig it into a potato, break it off and then you fire a bit of potato with some air pressure. It didn't hurt when you got hit (as long as it wasn't the eyes!) and it was all just for a little bit of fun, plus it was hilarious when your parents got mad about finding billions of bits of potato around the house. So, me being me, I decided to play a prank on my older brother. Timmy and I stole two huge fucking potatoes (I have no idea how they were so big, maybe I was just really little) and we went upstairs. We basically played an army game, and the target was my brother. We ran into my parents room, and opened the window as quietly as possible. We loaded up the spud gun, and started shooting at my brother. Nothing. Nothing at all. The potato pieces were barely reaching him and he was too focused standing up playing Pokemon on his Gameboy. We tried to keep doing this for a few minutes, but got bored as most 8 year olds would. We then came up with the **worst fucking idea known to man**. Rather than shooting potato at him through the spud gun, lets just chuck one of the overly-sized potatoes at him!

And the FU begins...

I pick up this potato, which I can only describe as looking like the fat woman out of 50 First Dates, charge my little arms up as humanely possible for a 2ft 8 year old, and sling this potato towards the body of my brother.

 Direct hit! 

In the head! 

Oh wait, is he okay? 

**MUUUUUUMMMMMMM**

4 hours later, I am sitting with my dad in the ER while my brother is having MRI scans or whatever they do when you hurt yourself in the head. Basically what happened, the potato hit him in the back of the head, this was enough force to sling him head first into the concrete slabs, which caused a small crack in his skull just above his hairline. He had bandages on his head for a few days and missed a couple of days of school, but I'm pretty confident he was just as brain damaged before that happened as he is now (21 in a few months...)

TL;DR: Friend had a spud gun. Spud gun was bad. Threw entire whale of a potato at brother. Hit his head. Cracked his skull. FU.

Potatoes are bad for this world, they just fuck everything up.

Edit: wow, my highest most upvoted thing ever is about throwing a potato at my brothers head and knocking him out? Free internet points!"
"TIFU by throwing my shit through my girlfriend's bathroom window.


So, after reading the steak-to-the-window TIFU I felt I had to share this with y'all, after all, it's kinda similar. Kinda.

This didn't happen today, it went down around seven years ago (but it still feels like it happened yesterday, i'm 23 btw). I warn you, the amount of cringe contained in this TIFU is over 9 fuckin thousand. Also, English isn't my native language, so please don't be jerks about my grammar.

This story begins on my girlfriend's couch. She lived in a big house outside the city with her parents and we had been dating for around 2 months, so the relationship was great and we were in that phase were everything feels like eating an entire double cheese pepperoni pizza in the middle of the night while high or drunk (for vegans it's like eating grass, i guess). Anyways, we're cuddling and watching an episode of friends, when all of a sudden I feel it. It's a fucking freight train sliding down my rectum and it won't stop for nothing.

Just so you know, I'm the kind of person who just can't take a shit unless I'm at my crib and there's a good amount of silence. Public places and specially my girlfriend's house is a big nope for me, but I just couldn't hold this one any longer.

Fastforward to the part where I'm in the bathroom finishing my delivery (which went great, to tell you the truth). It was one of those shits for which you don't need to wipe more than once because it's too compact to leave anything behind and also let's you get out of the bathroom in a very small amount of time, except this time the fucking toilet betrayed me and didn't flush. The toilet's tank had no water.

I turn on the hand washer and it works, so I start trying to fill the tank carrying water with my hands. It won't work. I'm getting all the floor wet and it will take an eternity and a half. I'm panicking now. I don't want this to be my first impression at her house and I'm running out of options. I tilt my face to the sky to pray for help and suddenly I see the light, which is passing through a small rectangular window near the ceiling. I open it, lift myself up and see that there are plants on the outside. Without thinking too much about the fucking risk, I grab my brown son and throw it out the window. Success! They won't be able to smell it and it will also feed the plants, so as far as i'm concerned, i'm doing them a favor.

I wash my hands and head to the couch again, only to hear my girlfriend's mother downstairs screaming my girlfriends name at the top of her voice and then shouting ""both of you get the fuck over here!!!"". FUCK. As I follow her downstairs, my head's panicking, I know something must have gone wrong with my shit but at the bottom of my heart I still have faith that maybe her mom is screaming about something else. 

We find her mom standing besides the maid in the laundry patio (which is a room right beside the house with a sliding roof and a door that faces the garden where the maid does the laundry and hangs the clothes on sunny days) AND I SEE MY SHIT LYING ON TOP OF THE WASHING MACHINE. ""What the fuck is this shit!!!"" shouted the mother (that didn't sound funny at the moment). Now I'm assuming the maid witnessed the whole thing and is in a state of shock. I look at GF's mom and then at my girlfriend, who looks at me as if I'm a monster, I can see the love in her eyes gradually vanishing. My reaction to this situation is to turn around while saying ""noooooooo no no no no"" and head to the house entrance to get the fuck out of that place. My girlfriend shouts my name as I'm escaping, to which I responded ""no no no no!!"". I run to my car, turn on the engine and book it as they are running out with a wtf face.

That was it. I wasn't mature or intelligent enough to just say to my girlfriend that the fucking toilet wasn't working and instead took the worst possible decision of my life.

I'll upload a drawing of the house later so that you can understand better the layout of the house.

TL;DR 

Went to my girlfriends bathroom to take a shit, toilet didn't flush, decided to throw my shit out the window on some plants, landed on top of her family's washing machine.

EDIT:

The drawing I promised with a short comic :)

For those asking if we kept in touch or something: Well, we certainly did not. I actually closed my myspace account (through which we met) and reopened my msn messenger account with a new email. For quite a while, I wasn't able to chill in public places because the thought of running into her or some friend or member of her family would be permanently present, It wasn't pleasant at all. Luckily that hasn't happened up to this day, though I'm sure if it did, I'd just turn around and run while shouting ""no no no no""."

"TIFU By smoking weed with this guy I'm trying to woo, then getting the worst case of the fear ever


TIFU by inviting this guy(25M) I'm trying to woo over to my (25F) house for the evening. We've been on a few dates,  but I was pretty sure this was going to be the deciding date on where things were going. Anyway, we're chilling out then decide to smoke some weed. Which usually is fine I can handle it. So smoke two joints,  make tea,  and go upstairs. 

All is going smoothly until suddenly I feel THE FEAR and PARANOIA coming on. We all know it. Lying there trying to act cool and chill.... Until eventually I just have to tell him to please stop talking and that I am going to die.... Dramatic I know now.  I tell him to go downstairs to get housemate/BFF to come save me. At this point I am frozen on my back in the bed with the worst paranoia of my life.  I'm (for some reason) convinced that Guy Crush is a weirdo and WTF is he doing in my room he's going to kill me... But still trying to play it cool....  Not for long. 

Housemate comes in,  and obviously finds it hilarious. Guy crush remains in room being all comforting and nice... But deep down I know he's a serial killer... I try to communicate this with my eyes to my housemate.... Obviously not very subtly either as she is still finding it hilarious. She gets me 7UP and Haribo to try help me comedown... While still taking the piss asking would I also like dreadlocks with that.. Or maybe we can listen to some reggae.  She reassures me nothing out of the ordinary is happening....  But not in my head. 

The Fear begins to get so bad that I start to jump at every sudden movement that Guy Crush/Serial Killer is making. And then... Of course to make matters worse...  In a scene reminiscent of when Chandler takes a bath in Friends, or when Ben Stiller gets himself stuck in his zipper in the film Something About Mary... The rest of my housemates are at the door sticking there heads in wondering Hey why is everyone in here,  what's going on... Then see me frozen on my back in the bed with eyes as big as saucers and they finally back away...and I hear the giggles starting from downstairs. This doesn't help my paranoia as I convince myself the only way out of this situation is to burn the house down. 

Still very conscious of Guy Crush/Serial Killer beside me.... He reaches out a hand to comfort me... This is the last straw.. I jump about two foot into the air and tell him HE HAS TO LEAVE. He leaves... The room. 

Once we're alone,  I tell housemate she HAS to get him out of house before he kills us all. She reassures me Not to worry... About a thing... Cuz,  every little thing... Is gunna be alright. -_-

We sit for what's probably an hour of me jumping and tuning into every little sound the house is making... Waiting for it to fall down or a chainsaw to roar from downstairs. Eventually it turned out Guy Crush just left without saying anything... After his DAD had to collect him (I was supposed to drop him home). He left a note saying not to worry about it and it happens everyone... A note I immediately interpreted as a blatant death threat in my Fear riddled state. 

After he has left,  I eventually ride it out and I go to sleep. Have to get up for work the next morning and literally have just pretended like nothing has happened. Which I will continue to do for the foreseeable future. Could the date have gone any worse? No. "
"TIFU by texting shots fired to my mom


So I guess i'll get right into it...It was the second to last day of High school and I was excited for summer and my upcoming first year of college. 

I was taking a college Speech course offered through my school and was therefore outside in trailers. The class was presenting our final speeches and after nailing my presentation on ancient artifacts in Egypt, I felt cocky and ready for college to start. We still had about an hour left in class and since I presented in the beginning, I had to wait for all my other classmates to go. 

I brought my phone out and started texting my some friends and my Mom. Meanwhile, this girl who my whole family particularly did not like, was presenting for the class on caffeine consumption and was butchering the whole thing, very cringe. I was letting my Mom know how bad she was doing in the hopes we could both for happiness in this girls misfortune. 

Unfortunately for me, my Mom thought it was hilarious and responded with a couple mean texts. Laughing while I read them, I responded with, ""shots fired."" For those of you who don't understand what that means, it is basically saying like oooooohhhhhhhhhh burrrrnnnnnnn. As soon as I sent that text however, I got in trouble for having my phone out and was asked to put it away which I did. I didn't hear the countless phone calls or the numerous texts. By the time I checked my phone five minutes later, I saw I had missed a bunch of calls and text messages. I checked my texts and saw my Mom freaking out asking if I was ok and that she had called the cops. I literally uttered, ""fuck"" in which my friend next to me turned and asked what was wrong. I didn't respond but raised my hand in the hopes I could be excused to go to the office and explain what happened before the swat team showed up. 

However someone new was now presenting and the teacher refused to call on me and kept on giving me a glare to put my hand down. I was about to just leave when the door opens behind me. Its our Vice Principal and a police officer. I am ushered out of the class and my friends are all thinking that i'm about to get arrested. I try explaining what happened, that my mom was making fun of a girl in a class and I responded with shots fired as a diss but they were furious and didn't understand. I was ushered into the office where I was met with with the eyes of the entire office staff staring me down. I was put into my vice principals office and awaited judgement. 

Now our vice principal is a pretty cool guy but I was still freaking out. When he came in, I tried explaining everything again and showed him the texts. However he still didn't understand the, ""shots fired"" meaning and proceeded to go onto Urban Dictionary to figure it out. He now finally understood it and started laughing. However I wasn't off the hook. Turns out the whole police force was ready to head to my school and the school was on lockdown. I wasn't getting off that easy, likely suspension. 

I started sweating bullets and saw my dreams of freedom at college slowly disappear. At this point the head

 principal came in and just started staring at me. It was literally like five minutes of him just staring at me and me staring back. Total alpha shit. He finally said, who do you think you are staring at"" in which I responded, ""I'm staring at you."" Obviously not helping my case. He proceeded to have me explain the story to him as well and he also didn't understand the whole, ""shots fired"" thing. 

He proceeded to tell me that this whole thing wouldn't of happened if I only I didn't use my phone during class. Ultimately they decided to let me cross the stage but gave me in-school suspension for a phone violation on my last day of highschool. When I drove home I saw my Mom crying on my porch because she though i was dead from a school shooting. Took a while to calm her down with lots of apologies. Felt like the worse child ever seeing my Mom cry like that. A couple years later, its kind of a joke in my family and we will always say shots fired when someone dissing another.

TL;DR 
Texted shots fired to my Mom, she called the police, I got in-school suspension and worst child of the day reward.

edit: my gosh, such anger for paragraphs and *principal "
