"No sir, I can't show you how to commit a federal crime


The repair company I work at is a small business and has two locations, one of which is in an interesting area. As such, we get a lot of interesting people. This guy came in yesterday. 

**$User:** ""Hi, can you show me how to access someone's text messages? I found some tutorials on YouTube but they didn't work""  
*I assume he wants to backup the messages so I start walking him through how to sync his phone*  
**$User:** ""No no no, I want someone else's messages""  
**$Me:** ""Wait, this isn't a device you own?""  
**$User:** ""No""  
**$Me:** ""Do you have consent from the owner to read their messages?""  
**$User:** ""No, that's why I need you to show me how to see them""  
**$Me:** ""Sir, if you don't have permission from the other person to read their messages it's illegal to access them. I can't show you how to do that here""  
**$User:** ""Well do you know anywhere else that can""  
$Me: ""No sir, I'm not aware of any other repair shops that can help you do that, it's a federal crime. I can pull up the relevant laws regarding unauthorized access to someone's personal devices if you'd like""

*Cue standard rant of ""you guys are supposed to be the experts"" as I stare blankly into the distance losing more faith in humanity*"
"Literally seconds ago - home tech support (my shortest tech tale ever)


Have a few spare laptops around the house from tech donation when I left my old job (my director said ""they'll just sit around otherwise, at least you'll use them."")

Battery's shot on one of them, but it's obviously fine when plugged in. My wife is using one of them right now, so I walked over to check model numbers to look for a replacement battery on Ebay. She asks what I'm doing, and I let her know. She asks why I think the battery's shot. I point to the orange flashing ""NOT CHARGING"" indicator.

&gt; ""No, hon, it is charging. Look."" 

Unplugs laptop. Aaaaaand whatever she was doing is gone now, since the battery's not charging. She looked at me and said: 

&gt; ""Okay, maybe not."""
