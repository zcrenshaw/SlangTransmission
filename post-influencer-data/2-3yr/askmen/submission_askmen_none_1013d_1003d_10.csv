"Men who groan and grunt loudly at the urinal, what's your deal?


Seriously. I've never understood this and it makes me so fucking uncomfortable. Are you in pain? Are you having an orgasm? I realize that after holding it for a long time or when drunk, urinating can be an amazing physical sensation which relieves some serious pressure. But it seems excessive. And just because we're in a bathroom doesn't mean we cease to be in public. Can't you just exhale without involving your vocal cords? I'd like to understand this better, so I feel less like murdering you all. Thanks in advance.

"How do you start from scratch making friends when over 30?


So, I'm 33... I lost my social circle pretty much entirely due to a defective relationship breakdown. It's about a year later and I basically need some new mates.

My girlfriend has been quite vocal that she gets anxious that I don't really have many friends I go and hang around with. She has girly nights out and invariably I just stay in with either my guitar or a PC game during those nights. The friends I am still in contact with are basically married with kids types who only ever go to one particular quiet pub.

It's a little sad but genuinely I do miss the whole lads night out thing. My girlfriend is right and I don't think she's too impressed with her being my entire social circle. So yeah, she's right.

In a nutshell, how? A lot of the guys near my age are either the same married with kids types who don't venture out too far, or have already formed their social cliques and wouldn't be the type to let in bystanders. There have been times I've needed to talk shit out and really, I would love to have a couple of mates who had my back and all that kinda thing.

So really, where? How? We can eliminate work (old, married with kids), the gym is cool but quite cliquey, not sure how to escalate into ""let's hang out sometime"". I don't get invited to parties, other than when my girlfriend gets a +1 invite and really it's all her friends.

So really, any advice? I'm a sociable guy, I can hold a conversation, I'm not bad looking and genuinely friendly. But I have no idea where to even start forging that sort of lads relationship.

"Men, what ""hard to find"" quality attracts you ?


I'm really attracted to girls who are greater than me (I'm 5,6), but those who are willing to date a guy shorter than them are not the majority.

What about you?

"Professionals of reddit, how do you negotiate a salary?


I just started to interview for a couple of full-time jobs. I've had plenty of $/hr jobs, but I've never had a salary before. How to you negotiate a salary? Bonuses? Benefits?

I have literally no idea how to do any of these. My dad has never had a salaried position, and my mom has her own business. I don't exactly have someone to ask, so I went to the internet. Thanks!"
