"Dont be shy now, but what is the top item in your fuckit list?


Its the item in your fuckit list (bucket list but for sex stuff) thats the most dificult to pull off, but you still feel like you have a chance, so your gonna do your best to reach that nasty, immoral star before you die. 

For me its having sex with a head of state who is still in office fcourse. Or at least the second-in-command cuz I aint choosy. Am sad since most leaders right now arent into guys I think, but I shall get my chance one day. We're all gonna make it!

Bonus: Be the boytoy of a Europien aristocrat with a castle so if you are one PM me please and we're gonna trade pics and we're gonna skype so you can see me and my goods and I can see your castle. Thanks."

"So yesterday I [26] was engaged to a girl [25] I had never met before. It was arranged by our parents(pretty common in India. I'm okay with it, and don't have any complains there). How do I break the ice?


I would really like it if we could be good friends before the wedding(6months away). I want to get to know her better and vice versa. However I cannot meet her often until the wedding, and never alone. Our families are conservative kinds. All I have is her phone number. Other than that, and her name, and her birthday you guys pretty much know her as much as I do. 

So how do I break the ice? Someone who has been in this situation before, what are do's and don't for the coming few months? How do I make her feel comfortable around me?

Her birthdays coming up soon, and I plan to do something nice for her. But mostly I'm pretty much stumped of ideas.

"What are the actual steps that happen between meeting someone and having casual sex?


Hi, I'm sorry for the stupid question, but I don't know what to do.

It's really embarrassing, but I don't even know how people how about getting into relationships or even just casual sex.   Seriously, every time that the subject comes up it's always like ""well we started chatting at the party and one thing led to another..."". Motherfucker, what's the ""one-thing-led-to-another"" part? It's like that thing you always see in movies where some guy starts a conversation with a girl and then it just immediately cuts to them fucking in her apartment.

I just want someone to explain step-by-step what happened that led to them having sex. I know that's pitiful and weird, but I don't know what else to do to figure this stuff out.

"If you were a dad, how would you react if your 15 year old daughter asked you for condoms and birth control because she wanted to have sex with her long term boyfriend?


"
"What is your opinion on being single long-term?


Maybe it was because my last relationship wasn't the healthiest, but I just feel I'm better off single. Relationships can take up so much time, money, and effort. Yes, it's great to have someone who's there for you, who takes care of you, who you're intimate with, but I already have friends that are there for me, I can take care of myself, and I can have sex while single. Nearly half of marriages end in divorce. Why get into a long-term relationship when you'll probably end up unhappy and doing stuff you don't want to do? When you're single, you can live exactly the life you want. All your money is yours. All your time is yours. You don't have to worry about spending time or money on things you don't really care about because your SO wants to. You get more freedom. You don't have to worry about dating or relationship drama. It seems like a win-win all around to me.

I know this is a pretty black-white perspective, and I probably will change my mind over time. But I've been single for 7 months now, and I just don't see myself getting in a relationship anytime soon. Any other guys share this perspective or have a different perspective they'd like to share?"
