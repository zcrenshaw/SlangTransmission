"Gay men of /r/AskMen, what's the funniest/worst/weirdest reaction a straight guy had when you said you were gay?


I'm bi and I live for the moment when you tell a straight guy about your gayness, most of the times they're completely cool about it, but sometimes, you see that mini freakout in their eyes.

Worst case scenario they ask you for a threesome.

And how did it end? Sorry and cuddles? :("

"As a woman, sometimes sitting down to pee prompts me to poop while I'm at it. How does that work for dudes, on account of standing to pee?


Do you ever go to the bathroom to piss and then decide you might as well take a shit while you're there?

Or is there more premeditation involved in crapping as a dude, seeing as you're not (usually) sitting when you (just) pee?

**Related side question** - Say you need to shit, but for whatever reason you're holding it (don't want to murder someone's toilet, out in public etc) does the muscle release involved in peeing make it harder to clench in a crap?

Because sometimes as a woman peeing but not also pooping is a delicate art."
"What downvoted comment you have written do you stand by 100%?


Not just here, but on any sub. For example, on AskReddit, I once said that AskWomen is a police state and what consequences that has resulted in, and I got rewarded with a score of -30. Doesn't make the statement any less true, though."
"what was the final straw that made you realize a girl was just using you?
