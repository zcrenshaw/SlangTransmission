"Wife put steak sauce on a nice rib-eye last night, what do I do?


How do I continue with this relationship if I spent the time to find and cook a PERFECT, I mean fucking top tier bone-in rib-eye steak with salt and pepper rub only to watch in horror as she slathers Trader Joe's steak sauce on it. I've seen her do it with pork chops, steak tips, a shitty t-bone cut but I honestly thought she didn't have it in her to forsake me like this. 

Good god what monster have I married?! I fear my only option is seppuku. "

"My female friends advised me that I shouldn't shower my boyfriend with so many presents because men do not like to be taken care of like that...men, is this true for you?


So I am in a serious relationship with a man who I love to shower with affection and gifts every once in a while, my friends told me that men are 'put off' by such a behavior and that I should stop if I don't want to push him away from me.. So far he has appreciated my gestures but now I feel like I am slowly turning him off with every gift by not being the typical women who wants to be taken care off and on the receiving end of gifts. so I would like to know the real perspective of men!! 


is having your lady treat you to a nice dinner and give you a gift every once in a while for no reason, a turn off?! Does it make the women seem like a 'provider' to you and thus make you see her as unfeminine? Cause that's what my friends are telling me.."
"I wear the hijab but i want a boyfriend, how do i get one?


I'm wear the hijab but I'm not religious. I'm looking for a boyfriend. Guys show interest, check me out, and chat me up, but no one asks for my number. Is the hijab off putting? Would you ever date a hijabi? 

I feel like they see me and write me off as ""religious"" so they don't even try. How do I show them that I am not religious and am interested in dating? I wear makeup, and tight clothing, so I hope you guys don't imagine me as wearing a black shapeless burqa.

And no, I won't take the hijab off. I know too many people in the Muslim community who will look down on me for it. Not worth the trouble. If I could take it off without being judged, I would, but that's not an option. 

Edit: damn this really blew up. I'm seeing a lot of 'take it off' which I am considering. I'm seeing a lot of 'you initiate and ask him' which I will work on. A lot of you guys seem to think I'm into white dudes... I'm not. I'm into Muslim/middle eastern/south Asian guys, and so like the comments say, I will focus on those. "
"How do I tell the girl i'm seeing I can't smell


Hi /r/AskMen,
 
Regular Dutch guy reporting in with a perfectly normal question. I have no sense of smell. Never had any. I've been seeing a girl I really quite like for awhile but I've never mentioned this to her. 
 
She'll make me smell flowers or food and I'm forced to go ""oooh yes nice"" while having no fucking clue. At this point I'm just afraid to get caught.  
 
How do I tell her this? I really can't just go up to her and be like ""hey you know something I can't smell""
 
Do I just roll with it?
 
Help me /r/askmen
 
EDIT: so I'll follow up in a bit with the result. I'm just pretty insecure about it and we're not close enough where I can just mention it and pass it off as nothing."

"There seems to be an ""Annoying white girl"" stereotype in the US – what is it about?


I’ve been enjoying Reddit the last few months. One of the things I like to read about is US everyday life: I guess a lifetime of American films and TV has left me with an urge for a reality check. And while I save for a ticket…

Anyway! Its always fun to read about stereotypes in other countries. “Something, something the wrong half of Connecticut…”, “Something something typical gamergirl behavior…”, “something, something bro’s do this and that…” etc.

Something which turns up fairly often on Reddit and Urban dictionary etc. is references to “annoying white girls”. “Only annoying white girls have rinsta”, “annoying white girls glorify native Americans”, “high-pitched voices of annoying white girls”. And so forth.

So! Is there an actual annoying-white-girl stereotype in the US? If so. What is it about – traits, geography, class? Is it only POC who has this stereotype of (some) white girls? Examples or stories are welcome :)

Am a European fascinated with the US - nerdy details are the best :-)

"Married Men, what clever ways did you find to find out your wife's ring size?


I've decided that I want to propose to my girlfriend!  We've discussed marriage and have decided that that's what we want. However, I still need to buy her a ring, I know I need to get her opinion on what she likes, but what should I do about ring measurements? Should I get them when we go look at rings or is there a clever way that you used?"
