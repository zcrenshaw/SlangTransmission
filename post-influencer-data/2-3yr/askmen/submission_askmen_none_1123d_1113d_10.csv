"How do us girls tell the difference between a shy guy and a guy who is not interested?


I'm all up for helping the shy guy out, but how do I know if he's shy or simply not interested? I don't want to be a pest if its the latter. 



""Oh, he's just shy"", meanwhile he's wishing we would leave him the hell alone. How on Earth are we supposed to know?"
"What the hell are you supposed to do as an adult?


I just graduated, and am starting work on monday. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do besides work and stay healthy. I moved away from my college town and will be moving again in January for other reasons. I feel like attempting to start a social life in such a short amount of time is silly. "

"Laptop died after not charging properly. Now it won't charge at all. Last thing I had up before it died was porn. What do?


Title pretty much says it. My admittedly old macbook is clinging to its life in this cold world, but it's losing the good fight. I can't diagnose much myself as I can't tell if it's a charger issue or a battery issue, and I don't have access to another charger to test on. Do I risk it booting up to porn in a crowded apple store? As funny and offensive as that would be, I'd rather not. Any suggestions at this point is appreciated."

"[NSFW] I need some advice for managing my sexual frustration when my girlfriend rejects my advances.


No matter how much i believe she has the right to say no, no matter that I'm truly not mad at her when she says no, no matter how much i try to rise above it, whenever my girlfriend tells no I get all sexually frustrated and the lizard brain takes over. On my best days I feel a low grade angry for a little while. On my worst days I turn into a giant 12 year old throwing a cold shoulder tantrum. I hate it. I desperately want her to feel comfortable with rejecting me. What do?

Edit: I suppose i should have made it clear that this situation does NOT happen all the time. it happens maybe one out of everyone five attempts at sex on average. Recently there has been an increase due to life circumstances thus making my reactions more of an issue. So to everybody telling me my relationship is failing and assuming i'm in a sexless relationship, that is not correct. I should have made this edit sooner but I didn't think this post would last this long. "
