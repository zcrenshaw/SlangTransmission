"Girlfriend bought me ""ginseng and cracked pepper"" shower gel. Why is that even a thing? Is she trying to season me?


She claims she thought her stuff was ""too girly"". On the one hand I appreciate the heroic sacrifice of a couple of square inches of shelf space in her bathroom, but on the other I can't help wondering if there are any other cannibalism red flags I should be looking out for...

Edit: /u/MisterKanister is a generous bastard. I'll go and hide in /r/lounge until after dinner.

"MOD POST: WE ARE CENSORING ASKMEN


Attention cuckolds and cuckqueans of /r/AskMen,

Recently it has come to our attention that you people are getting pissy because you can't make rape jokes and say things about how horrible groups of people are without getting hissed down by the masses, and you're mad that people are telling you that you shouldn't make those jokes.

So let me take this opportunity to tell you to [calm the fuck down](http://i.imgur.com/EyGOZ7R.gif) and let me tell you how an internet board works. 

When you comment on any board, you implicitly agree to abide by any rules or regulations set by the board. This may include, but is not limited to, refraining from harmful, threatening, or insensitive comments against groups of people or individuals. If you don't like those rules and you want to go to a place where you can make those jokes without hindrance, /r/the_donald is thataway. 

Just because you assclowns are hiding behind the fa√ßade of anonymity doesn't mean common decency isn't expected. Let me put this in bold and all caps so that you can see this loud and clear: **THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE SPEECH ON REDDIT, 4CHAN, TUMBLR, OR ANY OTHER STUPID BOARD YOU CLAIM IS THE ""LAST BASTION OF FREEDOM ON THE INTERNET"". THEY ARE ALL MODERATED SITES, AND MODS CAN REMOVE COMMENTS AS THEY SEE FIT, THEREFORE SPEECH ISN'T FREE.**

If you're going to be an asshole and say offensive or obnoxious things like ""I really wish I could kill all men"" or ""all women deserve to be raped"" or any game of thrones spoilers, then we will remove your comment. 

Similarly, if we don't remove your comment by some fluke and you get dog piled on, don't come crying to us saying ""I said a mean thing but those mean men are attacking me"". If you say a stupid thing, expect responses in kind. Because (and I'll put this in bold and all caps too), **THIS IS NOT A SAFE SPACE. THIS IS NOT AN ECHO CHAMBER OR HUG BOX. MOST ARE FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION IN A CIVILIZED MANNER, AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ABIDE BY THOSE RULES THEN YOU CAN FUCK OFF TO TUMBLR OR WHATEVER THE CRAZY WOMAN HATING EQUIVALENT IS FOR MEN.**

So if people get mad at you for saying something, just remember this (and I can't stress this enough): [your opinion is shit, the opinion of your opponent is shit, and everyone's opinions are FUCKING SHITTY ASS FUCKING OPINIONS THAT NO ONE GIVES A GOD DAMN SHIT ABOUT](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif).

TL;dr: you all suck, but play nice or I'll ban you all.  And just remember, [this is what we think about you don't douchecanoes who complain about mod abuse](http://m.imgur.com/GfAgEfl)

"Let's talk GREEN flags. What are some early (1-3 dates) signs that the person is the real deal? [stolen from AskWomen]


We talk about red flags a lot, but what about greens? What little things tip you off about a person that gives you the feeling that they're a good person, and it's not an act?

Text and title shamelessly stolen from /u/todayonbloopers's post on AskWomen."
"Hard mode question: Men who asked their S.O to marry them and got a no or no answer. How did it happen?


"
"What observation have you made that isn't socially acceptable to talk about?


"
"Men: is it justifiable to talk to multiple girls at the same time when you're single?


I am in a situation where I am interested in 2 different girls and when I talk with my guy friends, they reassure me ""hey man you're single so anything goes until you are in a relationship with someone"" but my girl friends tell me ""that is not okay, you are playing both of them"" so I thought I would see what Reddit thinks. "
"Men, how do you feel about a girl who is actually thousands of venomous insects clad in a visage of flesh?


I mean, I know it's the 21rst century and all, but I find it a little off putting. "
"What book made your life better?


Fiction or non-fiction, how did it improve your life?"
"Which way does your penis angle when erect?


I never thought I would be asking a bunch of internet strangers about this but here goes.

So I've noticed that many many penises bend on an upward angle when erect. However mine angles downward. I'm just wondering if this is some sort of condition or if its just a 50/50 chance of which way your penis angles.

Edit: wow my most upvoted post is talking about my erect penis. Nice."
"Where's the best place to meet guys who aren't into drinking?


I'm not a huge drinker myself (I like a glass of wine with my friends sometimes, but not to get too drunk) but I always have trouble meeting guys who don't regularly drink too much? Any help? :)"
"What are some common advice that women give to men which are actually statistically unlikely to yield positive results?


One of the big ones we stumbled on today was the whole ""hitting on women in the gym"", some love it but most don't and are pretty explicit about it. And let's face it, every woman is different but impossible to distinguish superficially mostly so our best option is to just have a system where the odds are at least in our favor. 

Edit: perhaps we could also amend some of these so they still carry the spirit and intention but perhaps make more practical sense. "
"What's something most people think of as uncool but you think is cool?


I was looking at zip off walking trousers last night and my SO told me I would look like a granddad if I wore them. I think they're pretty awesome myself! What's something 'uncool' you like?

EDIT: this got popular! You guys are all pretty cool! "
"What makes your life worth living?


What do you look forward to?"
"My girlfriend has asked me to wax her asshole, what do I do men?


I mean she's never asked me that before, is this a normal thing for boyfriends to do? I'm scared."
