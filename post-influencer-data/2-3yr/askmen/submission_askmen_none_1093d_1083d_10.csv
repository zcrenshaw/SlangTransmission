"Why doesn't the constant urge to have sex go away?


My GF and I have a healthy sex life with but I fantasize about sex whenever she's not around. I have no desire to cheat but the idea of having sex with gorgeous women is tantalizing. I hate it because I think it is distracting.

Does it ever go away?"
"Why is peeing outside so awesome?


Listen, a private bathroom is great and all, but there's something fun about peeing outside. It's way more enjoyable than a toilet. Whenever I'm out on a hike or somewhere in the woods, there is no greater pleasure. Who's with me?"
"Women of ask men, being honest, what do you want to know about men?


Fire away. I will answer what I can. 

Thanks askmen! This has been freaking awesome, the turnout is better than I ever would've expected!  And it was a billion times better off than the threat like this on a similar subreddit!

**Hats off to the moderator team for having a touch like the caress of the wind**"
"I noticed that some men think a woman can go from a 10 to a 3 because of her personality. In what situations can a 3 get to a 10 because of her personality?


Some of you say that if a woman who's a 10 is rude, unkind, or vapid, she can instantly go from a 10/10 to a 3 or 4/10. So, is it possible for a 3 or 4/10 to get to a 10/10 by being kind, intelligent, funny, passionate, with a great personality? "

"How to turn a girl OFF?


I gave this girl my snapchat since she asked for it and I really wasn't attracted to her. What can I say to make her go away gently? "
"How would you feel if you found out a girl you liked had really kinky fantasies?


I fantasise about being a dominatrix and I am scared to tell the guy I'm seeing about this. He's really curious about my fantasies. He is vanilla-ish, but leans towards lightly dominant like most guys. I am submissive in real life sex and love it that way, but yeah in my fantasies I'm dominating the guy. Would this turn you off if you found out a girl had those kinds of fantasies?"
"Why would you keep asking a gal if she is okay during sex?


What reason(s) would you keep asking a gal, multiple times, if she is okay during sex?"
"What non-sexual item would be a deal breaker for you if you found it a girl's house


I would say if I met a girl who owns a ""Male Tears' mug, I would instantly cut off all ties with her. The stuff you own can say a lot about the type of person you are"
