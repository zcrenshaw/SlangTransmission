"How many of you got shafted on father's day?


For Mother's day a month ago I was warned several times that if I didn't give breakfast in bed, and all sorts of other shit that I'd be in trouble.

Fast forward to father's day and I didn't even get a card. Literally jack shit. I'm not asking for a lot, I'm just curious how many of you father's out there got jack dick as appreciation for your ""holiday"" that is supposed to be for you. "

"When was the first time you had unprotected sex?


Raw-doggin' is the epitome of risk/reward.

When was your first time? Care to share any funny stories/unique experiences?

I've no underlying reason to ask this question, just throwing it out there. 

Edit: to contribute, my first time was at age 18 with my first girlfriend. She was on birth control but Jesus I always think about how much I ran the risk of screwing up my life.

Edit 2: I was referring to unprotected as in no condom. If you had sex fully unprotected, that is also fine to post obviously. "
"Men of Reddit, how do you deal with anxiety affecting your sexual performance?


So, the past couple times my girlfriend and I have attempted to make love, I've been unable to get, or in some cases maintain an erection. We never had this problem before during the course of our now 6 month relationship but all of a sudden I'm starting to get nervous when it comes time to get intimate and I don't want this anxiety ruining our relationship. Sex was always one of the best parts of our relationship and we had some amazing sexual experiences together, but now my penis almost feels numb when I try to get hard for her.
Some background: we recently did go through a bit of a rough patch where we fought some but we're moving on and both growing immensely, but part of me thinks that rough patch is what's first of all causing the anxiety, which in return is causing the inability to perform the way I used to. Also, I'm a 28 year old male with no medical history that would potentially point to this issue.

Any help or advice from anyone who's experienced something similar is greatly appreciated, I don't want my anxiety to ruin this relationship."
"Where do I meet friends who consider me their 'first option' ?


I apologize if this seems kind of dumb. I've been in college for a while now, entering my last year, and I feel like I still haven't made any friends who treat me like I'm their first chiice to hang out. The only person I've actually become close to is my girlfriend. I have some friends/acquaintances from class, but I always feel like I'm the second choice - like they always have plans with their main friend group, but if I really push sometimes I can get them to hang out. 

It's been especially bugging me with Fourth of July coming up. I've always been jealous of the people who can get a big group of friends together and drink and grill all day - if I invited everyone I knew, my girlfriend and maybe one other guy would show up. 

How do I fix this? How do I find friends who I actually become friends with, not just a second choice when their real friends are busy?"
"How much attention should you expect from your girlfriend in a group setting?


Sometimes I find myself spending a whole day out with my group of friends (including my girlfriend) and I feel like I'm the person she gives the least attention to. It makes me feel like utter shit and it seems as if I'm just another one of her many guy friends. It feels like the attention we give each other just isn't in balance.

Any words of advice?"
"When is the last time you broke down and really cried?


My poor old lady cat fell off the bed this morning and now she cant walk without falling over. Her head is stuck looking at her tail. Shes in the pet hospital for a few days with either some nerve infection or a brain tumor. My poor fur baby is sick and i cant fix it. Im just laying in bed before my work shift crying like a toddler. 

It took me 5 years to get her to acknowledge me and 2 more years before she looked at me like she looks at my girlfriend. (My girlfriend has had her for 18 years). Im not ready to give that up. If i could trade years of my life for years of hers i would. She never hurt anyone. She just meows for treats and wet food and looks comfy on the bed...

Im blubbering mess and I'm not ashamed about it. My angel is sick and I'm a fucking wreck.


Edit: luna is doing a little better. She isnable to sit up and move her head but she still cant walk. Shes eating and drinking again was excited to see us visit her.

Thank you all for your kind words and sharing your stories with us. It's oddly comforting to read about other peoples problems. I think it makes us feel less alone. I tried to respond to everyone but I started having 25 new replys everytime id finish responding to 3 or 4 stories. I read everything new post you wrote . Im sorry for all the deaths you've experienced,  all the lost loves and the moments of fear. Good luck to you all in the future."
