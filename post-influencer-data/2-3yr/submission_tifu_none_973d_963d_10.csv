"TIFU by pooping on my police academy hat.


Been in the academy 3 months, we have to wear baseball caps that say ""POLICE ACADEMY"" on them whenever we are outside. When we go inside we tuck the caps into the back of our pants to hold them. I ate mango habanero wings at BDubs last night and had explosive diarrhea this morning so I decided to poop before going into class. Went to the stall, pulled my pants down and spewed lava for 20 minutes. When I was done I stood up, turned around to flush and noticed something under all the shit. Then noticed the words ""POL"", was confused for a good 30 seconds before it hit me. Drill instructor yelled at me for being outside without a cover, asked me why, and instead of the usual ""no excuse sir"", I told him. He laughed for 5 minutes, first time I've ever seen him smile. He gave me a new cover and told all the other instructors who now call me ""shit head"". 

TLDR: dropped hat in toilet without noticing, explosive diarrhea, drill instructors call me shit head now. "
"TIFU by letting a guy use my bathroom during our garage sale


Happened over the summer.

So, we're in the process of moving and I figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and I have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. Last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. Considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, I took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. Midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn't think he'd be able to make it home. Now, my wife and I had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be NO BATHROOM for customers. However, I had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. I also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we'd all be fat, dumb, and happy. But I'm not a complete idiot. I told him he'd better check with The Boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. He chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, I see him leaving. I figured all is well.
A few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. I assumed it was because I shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said ""no"". I couldn't be more wrong. Apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. He tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. He simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. He. Blamed. My. Dog."

"TIFU by melting my mother's wedding gift and getting my house infested with tarantulas.


This happened about two years ago in the summer when I was home from college. 

So background story, I am infamous among my friends for being horrible at cooking because I get really impatient when it comes to food. I hate waiting for water to boil or waiting for the oven to preheat and I'm bad at following directions. I have flooded microwaves trying to make microwave mac n cheese, burnt soups, and unforgettably melted my mom's $400 wedding gift pot. 

My mom loves to cook and often makes these delicious broths that she boils for hours on staying up during the night which she boils through the morning and turns the stove off in the afternoon. 

On this particular morning, she made it on a weekday and therefore had to go to work in the morning and put me in charge of turning the stove off in the afternoon. I was like okay mom no big deal I can't fuck this up, wrong. After standing in the kitchen for a solid 2 minutes I get bored of waiting and take a nap setting the alarm for noon, fuck up number one. 

When I wake up, I hear fire alarms going off and look at my phone feeling betrayed because my alarm never went off only to realize I had set the alarm for 12 AM instead of PM. I run downstairs to the kitchen to find it filled with smoke. I immediately turn off the stove and run to open all the windows and doors. I go back to the stove and lift the pot and lo and behold the bottom of the pot melted off from the rest of the pot, bubbling and hardening into molten metal. 

I quickly bring the pot outside and try to scrape off the molten metal off of my glass stove with a spatula, fuck up number two. As I frantically scrape up a chunck of the hardening goo I hear my stove crack. I think ""shit, I just melted a pot and cracked my stove all in one day this cannot get any worse"", wrong. 

Because I had opened all the doors and windows a freaking tarantula, A TARANTULA??!! (By the way this is in Georgia so tarantulas are not common here and I had never come across one until this day) crawled in through the door and made its way into the kitchen. Now this was when that viral video of the guy swatting a tarantula with a broom resulted in it exploding into million baby tarantulas. I had the maybe I shouldn't smack the tarantula thought in the back of my head but when that mother fucker moved I screamed and smacked it with a fly swatter, fuck up number three. 

All hell breaks loose and it explodes into millions of baby tarantulas. I was mortified and tried to spray ant poison at it but by the time I found the spray can many of the baby tarantulas had made it way to different parts of my house. 

I now had to call my mother telling her I almost set the house on fire, wasted her time and efforts going into the broth, melted her wedding gift pot, cracked the stove, and infested the house with tarantulas. My mom came home immediately and after getting an earful of anger and confusion she told me to make myself useful and move the bed in the third floor guest room to my room on the second floor. I rush over in shame and begin to move the box for the bed down the stairs until I see a baby tarantula crawling on the wall and drop the corner of the bed box on my foot. I wailed in pain and just broke down and cried like a bitch. 

My mom rushes over and starts laughing at how ridiculous I am and said ""poor sharonoelee nothing ever goes right does it"" and deems I had enough and makes me sit on my bed and keep my hands to myself so I don't cause any more accidents. 

It was a horrible day and I had a persisting limp for a good 2 weeks, but I can laugh about it now. 

TL;DR: forgot to turn off stove, almost burn down my house, melted my mom's wedding gift pot, cracked the glass stove by scraping the melted pot off with a spatula, tarantula entered in through opened door, when I smacked it, it exploded into millions of baby tarantulas infesting my house, fun stuff.


Edit: The wolf spider looks almost even more terrifying than the tarantula/spider demon I encountered in my house. The mother and the babies were all black, hairy, and the mother was bigger than my hand. Thankfully, hopefully, none of the baby tarantulas grew up to be that size *shudder* but I do not need more pictures of spiders in my life, please do not send me any more pictures of spiders please and thank you.

Edit #2: Some people are confused as to why my mom sent me to move the bed. I came home from college for the summer so my bed was in my apartment in another town so I had to move the extra bed from the guest room to my room, sorry for the confusion.

Edit #3: To those saying the stove was long gone before I scraped it with the spatula, there is a crater in my stove because the stove actually melted too and the crack grows every year. We still use the stove, three out of the four heating spots still work! I think I managed to do about $3,000 in damage in one day (sorry mom and dad, I love you).

Edit 3.5: I will relink my photos of the incident into the edit tomorrow, afternoon, whenever I wake up... thank you for all your kindness and not kindness they all made me laugh throughout the day!

Edit 4: [pictures from that day] (http://imgur.com/a/kVno8) I don't have pictures of the tarantula/spider demons because it was such a chaotic day and the last thing I would have wanted was to have pictures of them on my phone. I go home in about 2 weeks so I'll post pictures of the crater in my stove which I named Timmy."
"TIFU by going for a booty calls at the tender age of 14


This happened about 6 years ago and I feel like everyone should know
Anyways, I started dating this girl when I was 13. It was the typical lovey dovey early teenage relationship and it actually lasted quite awhile. Around 8 months we decided to start having sex. In order to do this, I had to wait till 1AM, take my parents car keys from their room, bust out of the guest room window, roll the car out in neutral down the driveway, and then make a 40 minute trip to her house. Then I'd do the sex, and be back home just in time to beat my parent's alarms. Clarification, this was the only way we could find to do it since both of our parents were hardcore Christians and were never allowed to hang out alone.
Anyways, on sneak out attempt number 12 I remember thinking to myself, ""Wow this is getting easy"". Fuck up #1. I get to my girlfriends house, have more of the sex, and then leave. Get in my car and the ride starts getting bumpy. I pull over and see that I have a flat tire. Tried changing the tire, but my tender young body couldn't loosen the lug nuts . I make the executive decision to just try to ride it out. I lived 20 miles away. Fuck up #2. I get on the highway and turn on the emergency lights and slowly make my way home. Halfway through the ride I see sparks flying by my right tire. I look over and see that there is no rubber on the tire and I'm riding on bare rim. I take the nearest exit and as soon as I do, my car dies out. Apparently cables run from the steering wheel to the engine over the right tire and the shards of rubber from my tire ripped through and cut the cables clean. Couldn't turn on the car and all power was gone. Great. Check my watch, it was 3AM. Even better, my phone was dead (left it on Pandora all night). So I make my way down the road and try to walk to a gas station. I look to my right and see a church and the lights were on and someones inside. I think, ""Jesus can definitely save me in this situation."" WRONG. Cleaners think Im a junkie trying to loot the place. Oh well. Keep walking down and Im trying to wave down some cars to give me a ride. Finally see a car and I wave it down. It just happened to be a police officer. Fuck up #3 He turns around and then questions why a scrawny 15 year old is walking on backroads at 3 in the morning looking like a grease monkey. I tell him the story, and he agrees to help. He asks for my license and realizes that I barely have a learners permit. He feels so bad for me at this point that he overlooks it. I get into the back of his patrol car and start freaking out because Im thinking Im going to jail. He helps me change the tire, and then lets me borrow his phone to call my parents. At this point I'm in bawling trying to explain to my dad what I did and where I was. Pretty sure the officer is laughing the entire time. I then wait 2 hours for my parents to arrive (they weren't going to miss out of their sleep) so I just sat there thinking about the impending doom. To add insult to injury, I locked my self out of my car so I sat on the side of the street waiting. After my parents picked me up, I didn't see the light of day for 4 months. Im close to turning 21 and I think Im still technically grounded. My parents have gotten over it, but Im still exclusively known as the ""Car Thief"" in my family.
TL;DR Drove 40 minutes for sex when I was 15 and then caused thousands of dollars in damage to 
my parents car and pride

EDIT: For those of you who think it's made up, I can understand. To be fair my timeline is off, but I relatively accurate. I tried my best to guesstimate the times. If you don't believe it oh well!"
"TIFU by tipping in the tip jar.


Very minor fuck up, but I thought I'd share it anyway. 

First off, I'm in Australia, and tipping isn't a thing here. But some local businesses will have a tip jar on the counter. I was at this bakery which I frequent a lot, and I'll tip some of the coins in change I get back in the jar. Today however, I get my $5.50 change back - in a note and a 50c coin - and go to drop the coin in the jar. Instead I drop both the coin and the note in. I needed that $5 for a bus to get back home. I didn't want to be the guy who reached into the tip jar with the cashier right in front of me to get my money back, so I just left. I walked for 30 minutes instead of a 10 minutes bus drive."
"TIFU: A Reptile Dysfunction


Happened a few years ago. Every word is true. Wish it wasn't.

At the time, I had a good-sized Florida kingsnake named Gumbo. She was about four and a half feet long, about as thick as a broomstick. Despite her size and fierce looks, she was tame as a puppy. Even though she was as friendly as a snake can be, I had rules about when I'd handle her. If she'd eaten within the last day or two, the movement of being handled would make her poop. And snake shit is some NASTY stuff. On the other hand, if it had been a while since her last feeding, she would be really fidgety and squirm around, looking for food.

Luckily, on this particular Monday evening, it was prime Gumbo snuggle time. She had eaten on Friday, pooped over the weekend, and wouldn't eat again for a week. I grabbed her from her aquarium and plopped down on the couch to watch a few episodes of Futurama on the Netflix. My then-wife (now ex) sat on the other couch, doing her school work. But Gumbo was being a pain in the ass. She kept trying to get away. Over my shoulders, behind the couch, in between the cushions (ever had to pry a struggling snake from the recesses of your couch?), into my shirt, back out the collar... I spent most of an episode trying to get this little lady to chill out. I would've put her away, but I'll admit, this was back when I used to smoke pot and I was feeling pretty lazy at that moment.

Finally we reached a very uneasy settlement-- she curled up and stayed put just inside the left leg of my shorts. Now, I wasn't a fan of this idea. But I was feeling kind of lazy, and she was finally holding still, and I had just started wearing briefs instead of boxers. The elastic band around my thigh would keep her away from my junk if she tried getting frisky. I watched my show in peace. Until she moved north. I felt her reach a zone of my body where she was not welcome, felt her push against the elastic band of my Jockeys. I started to reach down to pull her away.

Most of you will never know the white-hot, electric pain that I felt in that moment, and I'm envious. Gumbo was an instinctive killer, old enough to have mastered the art of rodent death, and she had decided to make a meal of slumbering trouser mouse. A gaping maw of recurved, needle-sharp teeth overtook the head of my cock in the same way I'd seen her overpower so many mice and rats. I gasped, and my right hand shot down the front of my pants to pull my poor dick away from the ravenous serpent.

Now, a snake whose meal is being taken from it will react in one of two ways. A shy, small snake will give up, let go, slither away. But Gumbo was a fighter. I felt her tense all four-plus feet of her body, steel herself against my thigh, and pull backward. My vision blacked out for a second. Still, my left hand dove into the breach (breeches?), and grabbed her by the neck. And now my pickle was in a pickle. I couldn't let go with either hand, because she might pull more or swallow deeper. But if I didn't let go, she couldn't either.

Somehow, my ex had missed the whole thing. With more calm than I felt, I called her over and explained the situation. She gingerly helped me slide my pants off. Her eyes went wide.
""Wow. She's uh... she's really got you there.""
We discussed the situation; I felt helpless. Luckily, she remembered that many zoos keep rubbing alcohol near the cages for their large constrictors. If the snake attacks, pour alcohol in its mouth and it'll let go. We were out of isopropyl, but we had some Bombay Sapphire gin. She ran and got it.

In that moment, I learned that there is only one pain worse than a large snake trying to devour your penis. It's pouring alcohol into the wounds being created by the large snake trying to devour your penis. Luckily though, Gumbo and I shared a disgust for gin. She unhooked her teeth and backed away. My wife took her over to the sink and rinsed out her mouth while I pinched my glans to staunch the blood flow. I ran to the bathroom and showered, cleaned my wounds, assessed the damage. If there's an upside to a snakebite, it's that the teeth are thin and needle-like, and don't mash or tear their prey. I suffered some tenderness and bruising for about a week, but no infection or scars. But since that day I've had a firm rule: only one snake in the pants at a time, and there's already one there.

TL;DR: I let a large snake snuggle in the leg of my shorts. It took a mouthful of my dick and wouldn't let go. My ex-wife saved the day with a bottle of gin.

EDIT: This dude narrated and animated my story, and it cracked me up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ly2xkOrcuM&amp;app=desktop
If anyone else is interested in doing something similar, please message me-- I'd love to narrate it myself if somebody wants to help. I've been told that I have a perfect voice and face for radio!"
"TIFU by spraying Diet Pepsi all over strangers at the airport at 6am.


I need to wake up gradually with plenty of coffee if I’m going to have a good day.  One day, in a strange city, I overslept and had to make the airport IMMEDIATELY.  Through superpowers that I didn’t even know I had, I managed to pack, get the rental to the right place after fueling it, grab a shuttle to the airport, get through security and made it to the gate with ten or so minutes to spare.  Although I had squeezed in a shower, I hadn’t had any food or, more importantly, caffeine, since the day before. 

With my few leftover minutes I went scavaging for food and although I was looking for a coffee and hopefully a pastry or something, but at 6am not everything was open and all I could get was a Diet Pepsi and a hot dog.   I find that Diet Pepsi has just a little too much fizz for my liking and I have this habit of taking a slug and then putting the cap back on, giving it a good shake to fill the space I made with my drink with fizz and then slowly bleed the fizz off by cracking the cap.  This reduces the fizz to the perfect amount for me.  So I was in a strange airport at 6am after an hour and a half of frantic scurrying without caffeine, completely discombobulated, and I take the slug, give the bottle a good shake, and then completely uncap the bottle, spraying Diet Pepsi in about a ten foot radius.

Even though the airport was only half open, the gate was completely packed.  Everyone was in fresh, clean clothes on their way to meetings far away.  I completely drenched at least 8 people, getting Diet Pepsi all over the front of them, soaking their faces and hair.

And all I could say was sorry.

EDIT: One of the best and most comforting things about Reddit is that no matter how weird you are, no matter how sick and twisted your porn, no matter how disgusting your favorite recipes, no matter how strange your habits, there's someone out there that does EXACTLY the same, or, worse than you.  Except this little Diet Pepsi habit of mine... no one else does this - I thought for sure all kinds of people would relate.  But it works!

TL;DR My weird technique of tweaking the carbonation in my soda resulted in me drenching strangers at the beginning of their very important days.

"TIFU By closing down I-40, the sheriff was shot


This happened 6 years ago...
I used to sail sunfish. To keep my mast from scratching the hull of the boat during transport I would tape together pool noodles and wedge them underneath as a cushion. I usually tie them all on good but I noticed after this drive that I lost one. No big deal it's just foam noodles. A couple days after this, someone with prior military service thought that my noodles looked like and IED. I-40 was closed for the whole afternoon. Also, somehow the sheriff shot himself in the arm. The bomb squad robot shot my ""noodle bomb"" with a jet of high pressure water it went flying up in the air. I guess you could say I'm the noodle bomber.

"TIFU by calling a multiple parenting bloggers fucking idiots.


This happened about half an hour ago.

I run an education website and was looking for bloggers to partner/advertise with. I follow a pretty basic formula in all of my emails, and was trying to send out as many as possible so I just made a template in Microsoft Word and copy pasted that to each one. Then I finish by telling them what I like about their site, and asking them if they want to work with me. Most people don't respond, so speed is key.

What I didn't know, was that my girlfriend installed a Chrome extension that made it so any time I typed ""?"" it would change it to "", you fucking idiot?"". 

So, any time I asked someone if they wanted to work with me, I also called them a fucking idiot. I somehow didn't realize until about 15 emails in. [Here's the greatest hits:](http://i.imgur.com/nG3t1CK.png)

&gt;Thanks for reading this email, I really appreciate it. Does this seem like something your readers would be interested in, you fucking idiot?
&gt;
&gt;Let me know! And have a great day!

-

&gt;I really like how you preach the importance of one on one work with the parent and think my product could help your readers. Do you think they would be interested, you fucking idiot?

&gt;I really enjoy reading your blog and would love to work with you. Does this sound like something you would be interested in, you fucking idiot?

"TIFU by not disabling Amber/Weather Alerts


So I'm in the shop rocking out at decent volume to some awesome Spotify concoction. In my groove, singing off key, with my super-duper bass wireless headphones. Now, tangentially speaking, but ill get back to my point, your phone is designed to broadcast these amber/weather alerts whenever the powers that be decide there is something you should know immediately. Your phone does this with an extremely shrill, high volume, repeating sound and rapid vibrations so you are unable to miss said alert. I don't know if I've ever come as close to being scared to death as I did when that flash flood warning just came through. My earphones, close to full volume, broadcasted that shrill sound at a volume that can only be described as, the sound the SpaceX Rocket would make if it actually took off from your inner ear and exploded before getting off the platform. I fell back, running power tool still in my hand, tripped on the garbage can and went ass over tea kettle into an area of my shop that rarely gets swept. So here I am, laying in sawdust and filth, ear drums figuratively bleeding, telling you the story about the time I was almost killed by a weather alert."

"TIFU by telling my father-in-law I was going to do anal with his daughter.


This happened roughly six months ago. We were on a family vacation down in lake havasu. My father-in-law and myself are really close and we work together so we see each other almost every day. 

We were making our way down Parker river stopping at each of the bars getting more and more drunk. At the last stop we were chatting at the bar giving each other shit as usual when he called me buttmaster or something along those lines, saying to me that I love to do butt stuff and that's when my stupid drunk ass said, ""yeah with your daughter."" I cringe just typing this, idk what compelled me to say that but I got the biggest look of disbelief and our conversation just kind of stopped.

TLDR; got drunk, father-in-law called me butt master, told him I was a butt master with his daughter."
"TIFU by getting arrested over a meme.


Like many posts this did not happen today, but roughly seven months ago. This is the first time I can talk about it for reasons you will find out.

Let's start here, I was coming home from a college tour (17 at the time) and decided to go on Twitter and [post this edgy-ass meme](http://data.whicdn.com/images/164538658/large.jpg), accompanied by the caption ""Me when I come home from school."" This sort of dark humor was not out of the ordinary for me, and was something that made me stick out from the bunch amidst my peers. I sat at work later that night and pondered deleting the post, but I just thought *Nah, no one is gonna get all bent out of shape over this. I wasn't even at school today!*

But boy was I wrong, while driving home from work and passing my high school, I watched two cars from the local police pull out from the school lot and I ended up following them all the way to my house. I nearly shit myself when I saw their turn signals come on before my driveway. Once I get out of the car they informed me someone had contacted the school over my Tweet, and was genuinely concerned with my intentions. I immediately retort that it was only a horrible attempt at dark humor, and quickly deleted the post. They then asked to search my bedroom and car to make sure I had no weapons, which I let them do because I could understand their concern and probably cause seemed real enough. They obviously found nothing and were out of my house in minutes. They then contacted my principle and I was told to not go to school on time next day, but to come at 9 o clock and go immediately to the office.

This is where my bad decisions start up again. As soon as I pull in I can tell they had extra officers at the school, meaning they really presumed I was some threat. My parents and I went into the office and my principal informed me I was suspended for the rest of the year, as only 8 days were left, and would have to appear for an expulsion hearing.

I became nearly hysterical, as I am a relatively prominent student and had never had any major disciplinary action brought down upon me, and all of this over a fucking meme? There was no way this was happening to me.

After this the principal informs me that the police would come in and ask me a ""couple of questions"" Moments later a detective walks in with another officer, and I am told, ""This is a pretty serious situation and there is not much else we can do. So I will ask you to please stand up,"" and that was when I was put in handcuffs and walked out of the school; the township charged me for **terroristic threats** and some form of disturbing the peace.

I was immediately put on house arrest with electronic monitoring, I was not allowed to leave the house for almost a month. This month was a real shock for me, and I spent most of it solemnly and feeling totally drained. Fast forward a bit and I'm given a curfew, I start working again, but other than that not a word to the outside world or any of my peers from school. By the time of my hearing  July 7th I had lawyered up, and already had walked out of my expulsion hearing with a win. With my clean record and model behavior, Juvenile Probation offered me a consent decree. This meant that all I had to do was serve a 6 month probation, do 25 hours of community service, pay my court fees, and stay clean to have all of this wiped away. We went this route and I had that damned bracelet cut from my ankle that very day, I had now regained some fraction of my freedom, freedom I had lost over a stupid meme.

Six months go by of good behavior (I had a pretty chill PO who I only had to see once a month) and I receive my letter in the mail officially terminating my service. It has been a long, dreadful seven months of my life that I am happy to have behind me. But I really do believe I have become a much better person in the mean time, and have no major regrets looking back. 
It is still ridiculous seeing how much can happen when you upset the wrong person.

TLDR: Tweeted a dumb meme that made people think I was gonna shoot up my school. Got arrested and spent six months on probation.

EDIT: For those wondering, I am very aware that the school and police had to react in the manner they did, and fully understand the severity of what I said. I had plenty of time to think my actions over. "

"TIFU by using a fallen tree as a bridge


This didn't happen yesterday - in fact, it happened in the summer of 1984.

I was 11 years old, and I went to a summer program at the University of Virginia. It was fun and educational, particularly a nature class which involved going into various nearby woods, streams, etc., and investigating the plants and creatures in those environments. A few days before the class ended, we students had to do an in-depth project in one of the areas we'd studied.

I chose to do my project on a particular stream, and nobody else picked that environment, so I was out investigating on my own. (It didn't occur to me at the time that it might not have been the best idea to send an 11-year-old boy out on his own in those circumstances.)

Having finished with one side of the stream, I naturally wanted to cross over to the other side. The stream was very shallow (though fairly wide) and I could easily have walked through the water, but I noticed a nearby tree had fallen over and provided a perfect bridge across the stream. So of course I went for that, because it was a tree bridge and I was 11 years old.

I put one foot on the near end of the tree. As soon as I shifted my balance to take another step, there was suddenly an incredibly loud buzzing sound. This was followed by a huge angry swarm of yellowjacket wasps from the hive that was clearly attached to the underside of the tree.

I turned and ran, the yellowjackets following and stinging me on every available patch of skin, including in my ears. Happily, I was not allergic to their stings, because I'm sure I would have died from anaphylactic shock if I had been. But holy crap did that hurt. I probably ran faster than I ever had before, and as I approached the check-in area the yellowjackets mostly left. I'm sure the look on my counselor's face when he saw what had happened to me was priceless, but I was too busy being in intense pain to notice.

The pain didn't completely go away until about three weeks later. The memory of the pain is still vividly with me, nearly 33 years after it happened.

TL;DR: When I was 11 at a summer program, I angered a hive of yellowjackets by stepping on the tree trunk their nest was attached to. I got stung all over, including in my ears."
