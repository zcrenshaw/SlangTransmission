"The time I fooled a woman into thinking I quit


Sorry for formatting, I hardly post on TFR

It's about 4:55PM, and I had been scheduled for a 9:30 to 5PM shift. My management is lenient with it. If the replacement cashier is here and it's quiet, you can leave no more than five minutes early, but I never do that since it technically reduces how much you're paid. 

At around 4:58 I'm prepping to leave, and chatting with my other cashier. We're in the slowest department in the store so I can afford to take a few minutes. 

Cue crazy woman. (CW)

&gt;CW: Hi, I have a return?

&gt;Me: Sure! Can I just see the receipt real quick?

&gt;CW: Oh, I forgot it at home.

Now this is okay, since if you paid via card, or have a rewards account, we can look you up for the return.

&gt;Me: Oh that's okay, do you have a rewards account with us?

&gt;CW: Yes, my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.

&gt;Me: Great, I'll just scan the item to look up the receipt.

The order doesn't appear.

&gt;Me: The order didn't show up; did you use a different phone number?

&gt;CW: Yes, try YYY-YYY-YYYY or ZZZ-ZZZ-ZZZZ.

Neither of these work.

&gt;Me: None of those two numbers worked either. When did you buy the &lt;product&gt;?

&gt;CW: I bought it for my nephew's birthday in 2011.

&gt;Me: Well unfortunately we have a 30-day return policy, so even if I were to try to force it through, I would need some form of proof of purchase, which is purged from the system 6 months after the purchase. 

&gt;CW (raised voice, attracting the attention of my coworker): **You mean to tell me that I can't return this??**

&gt;Me: Un...fortunately the computer won't allow me.

&gt;CW: **Can SHE do it?** (pointing to my coworker)

&gt;Me: No, not even the district manager can do it. I can provide a phone number you can call to see-

&gt;CW: **Well maybe you're both just too stupid to work here!**

I look at my coworker and unseen by the customer, I wink and give a smirk. I turn back to face the customer.

&gt;Me: You're right! I should leave. &lt;Coworker&gt;, please tell &lt;Manager&gt; I quit, would you?

I proceed to take off my nametag and place it in the drawer, clock out, and walk out. I text my coworker later and she tells me that the woman was speechless and apologized for the insults before leaving.

&gt;TL;DR: Woman's a crabby bitch about a return, I pretend to quit"
"Congratulations, you played yourself


It was a typical day, on the register checking out customers at「Clothing Store」when a couple approached with their purchase. We exchanged pleasantries and I began to scan and bag. At 「Clothing Store」, we have a little screen on other side of our registers that displays the prices of each item as it's being rung. Typically, customers will occasionally glance at the screen to be cognizant of their total, but some customers will stare like Narcissus in a mirror. The lady I was checking out, who will henceforth be referred to as ""Wife"" belonged in the latter category, her eyes were *locked* on that screen. It seemed like she was waiting for something to happen almost, lo and behold, I was correct. 

Wife: Wait wait wait wait, how much were those pants?

My internal monologue: Here we fucking go

Me (in reality): They're $10.99

Wife: That's not right, there was a sign that said those were 50% off.

Me: Oh, that's fi-

Wife: Go get the sign sweetie, show em the sign

Me: Haha, like I was saying, you d-

Husband: I'll be right back you hold your horses

I wish they would have just let me finish my sentence, because I was just going to knock 50% off of the price, but the second he hopped out of line to go rip a sign off of the wall any courtesy that was previously extended was now gone. I waited with Wife for what felt like an eternity, while the growing line began to stare daggers at the back of her head.

Husband returned with a triumphant smile as if he had just won the lottery.

Husband: Here we go, I got the sign, check it out.

He held up the sign with pride, and in return, I met him with a smirk. The cause of my smirk was none other than my ability to read. Evidently, my smirk tickled the Wife's brain and caused her to further examine the sign. Thankfully, her reading ability was also up to snuff, I know this because her face was that of a dog with chocolate on its' jowls, shame and defeat.

Wife: Honey, put down the sign

Husband: Why, it says right here that-

Wife: Honey, read the sign

How he removed the sign and carried it all the way back to the register without reading it is beyond me. Regardless, he followed his wife's instructions and read the sign. His face turned sour as he read the sign, which said ""50% off pants, original price: $19.95""

We finished the transaction in silence."
"""No one wanted to talk to me""


At one point I was a cashier at large grocery store chain. Most of my coworkers were miserable bastards each day, poor guys, but I was newish and had made it my mission to try and make every customer smile. It passed the time faster than zoning out.


Cue SadLady. She seemed a bit down as she got into my line, so I flashed her one of my nicer smiles as I gave her my usual (store mandated) greeting.


&gt;Me: Hi, how are you doing today? 


I ask everyone that question, but that day was one of the rare days when I got a real answer. The lady's expression dropped with her shoulders, and she looked down.


&gt;SadLady: Not good...


&gt;Me: What's wrong?


&gt;SadLady: A week ago I had a miscarriage. I was in my third trimester and... I lost him.


Cue awkward silence as she struggles not to burst into tears and I frantically try and think of something comforting to say


&gt;Me: I'm so sorry to hear that...


Immediately I kick myself. How many times has she probably heard that already? My heart went out to her though, and wondered if there was anything else I say to help.


&gt;Me (hesitantly): Have you... gone to see anyone about it? Sometimes it's good to talk to someone who isn't family or friends.


&gt;SadLady (looks up all shiny eyed): I just started. I've found it does help a little...


I won't get into details, partially for her privacy and partially because I don't remember, but she ended up talking a lot about how she felt after the miscarriage and we shared our thoughts on therapists, as I'd gone to one at some point as well.


By the end of her grocery order (for I'd been scanning her long list of items the whole time) we were both a little tearful, but the Lady seemed a lot more relaxed.


&gt;SadLady: Thank you. You're the first person who I could talk about this with besides the therapist. No one wanted to talk to me about it.


&gt;Me (somewhat shocked): Not even your family?


She shook her head.


&gt;SadLady: Every time I brought it up they'd look uncomfortable and change the subject.


&gt;Me: Oh... um.. I guess they didn't know what to say.


&gt;SadLady: You did. Thank you.


I smiled and told her I was happy to help, packed her up and waved her out the door.


Days like that day are what made that job decent for me. It's why I tried to sound genuine when I asked how they were doing. Sometimes people are going through terrible things in their lives. I just find it kind of awful that the woman needed a cashier to talk to because her own family wouldn't.


Also, mobile post, and first time poster so sorry for the format.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for the kind comments. I've had a rough week (an old friend of mine died suddenly) and I can't express enough how great it is to read all your responses. Have a wonderful day and be good to each other!"
"""Quite possibly the most ridiculous complaint I've ever heard come out of a customer's mouth.""


In honour of me leaving my job at a supermarket to go off travelling, I thought I should share this story with you all!

This happened only a couple of weeks ago, and I actually heard it second hand from my manager. 

As anyone who's worked in a supermarket knows, the weekends are busy. Saturday evenings are usually super busy in my store, but there are usually only a few tills open at this time because they can't get the staff for it! 

Anyway, it's a typical Saturday and my manager is keeping busy with helping customers on top of her duties when this occurs.

&gt;Manager: {*on the work pc*}

&gt;Customer: {*Walks up*} You need to deal with this right now.

&gt;Manager: Deal with what sir? How can I help?

&gt;Customer: One of your staff is blocking our way to be served and is not letting us through. Make her move so we can be on our way.

So she walks over with the customer, and sees a member of staff, not working but still in uniform, at the till waiting to pay for her shopping.

&gt;Customer: See? Move her now! Staff should be banned from shopping after their shifts, all they do is take up space for actual customers like me!

&gt;Manager: {*Bit confused at this point*} Sir, she's not currently at work, she's a customer the same as you are right now, I can't and won't make her do anything, you'll have to wait.

At this point she walked off trying not to laugh, and avoided his eye contact for the rest of his wait. 

This is easily the worst case of customer logic and narcissism I've seen while working in retail, and I had to share it! I am also super happy I wasn't there to deal with him as I wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face for sure!"
