"If you're rude and refuse to pay, we have the right to refuse services, even after they're done


So I was in the shop one day, a customer was in getting some keys copied, nice and simple job. Suddenly while I've got the machine running, some shirtless guy comes in looking really frantic. I tell him I'll be just a minute longer, then I finish the keys, and send the first customer on his way.

&gt; Frantic dude: ""jeez, took you long enough, I need you to come unlock my car""

I'm already a little annoyed since its almost closing time, but I just figure he's got a kid/dog/groceries in the car and give him the benefit of the doubt. 

&gt; Me: ""No problem, where is it?""
&gt; FD: ""A couple miles that way, my girlfriend drove me over here. You can follow us to it.""

I get some info from him, the kind of car it is, his name/number/address in case we get separated, etc. 

&gt; FD: ""My phone's in the car so if you call it I won't answer""
&gt; Me: ""Then how about your girlfriend's number?""
&gt; FD: ""Hers is in there too""

Well ok then

Since it's pretty much closing time, I just go ahead and set the alarm and lock the doors as I leave, he doesn't like this and starts saying how I'm taking forever. Yeah yeah, take a chill pill, 5 extra seconds won't kill you.

I get in my truck and follow him out there, when we get there I grab my tools and head to the car. Surprisingly, there's nothing in there except for the keys on the seat. No kids or dogs, so now I'm just hoping it's actually their car. 

&gt; FD: ""You'd better not mess up my doors, this is a classic""

Yeah, a classic Ford POS

I open it up in about 10 seconds and check the insurance card, and yup it's their car. I pick up the keys and go over to him, tell him it's $40, and he just looks at me dumbfounded.

&gt; FD: ""Wait you mean I have to pay for this?""

Ummm, yeah?

&gt; Me: ""Yes sir, we charge a service call when we have to go out to the location.""
&gt; FD: ""Well I'm not paying for that, you did it in 10 seconds, I could've done that myself if I'd have known""
&gt; Me: ""Well I'm sorry, but I can't do this for free.""

I could've, but there was no real urgency like a life endangered, plus he was rude about the whole thing. We normally would just bill someone in the situation, but we've been burned too many times, so we'll only do that for companies.

&gt; FD: ""I'm not paying for that, I don't have any money""
&gt; Me: ""Then if you think you can do it yourself, go for it.""

I throw his keys in the car, lock the doors, shut it behind me, and leave. 
I get home about ten minutes later, then after probably an hour he calls back.

&gt; FD: ""I can't get it open, come back and open my car again""
&gt; Me: ""I can go out again, but I'll have to charge you for two service calls.""
&gt; FD: ""F- you A-hole, I'm not paying you 80 bucks""
&gt; Me: ""Then you can call out *other locksmith nearby*, I'm sure he'll be happy to help y-"" *click*

I didn't tell him, but they charge $100 to unlock cars. 

Never heard back from him"
"""You can't un-cut keys, ma'am""


So I'm a locksmith, I both go out on calls and stay at our shop where we sell locks, keys, safes, all kinds of stuff. It's just me and my dad that work here.

This happened a few years ago but you usually remember the really fun customers. We were doing some cleanup around the shop when a middle aged woman comes in and slams a (rather expensive) key down and says she wants to return it. CL for crazy lady and M for me

&gt; M: ""Is there a problem with it?""

&gt; CL: ""No, you made this key for me when I lost my car keys last month, but I found my keys so I don't need this one anymore""

&gt; M: ""I'm sorry but if there's nothing wrong with the key we can't refund you.""

I said it was an expensive key earlier, it was for a mid-2000s Mitsubishi, and it had a remote head. The chip keys we sell are $20 plus programming, and the remote heads are more depending on the make/model of the car. If I remember correctly her key was around 80 for the key itself, not counting the service charge to go make it when she lost hers. Total cost was somewhere around 220, which she wanted the full refund of for whatever reason.

&gt; CL: ""Well can't you just un-cut the key and sell it to someone else?""

&gt; M: ""No ma'am, we can't un-cut keys. Plus it's been programmed to your car so we couldn't reuse it anyway.""

&gt; CL: ""Go get your manager so I can speak with him""

My dad is around the corner in the back room and heard the whole thing, so as she said this he poked his head around the corner with a chipper ""Hi! What can I do for you?""

He then gives the same answers, pretty much word for word, until she's visibly angry that we won't give her 200 bucks

&gt; CL: ""is the owner here? I'm not leaving without some kind of refund""

My dad's more amused than irritated by this point so he just says ""Sure, let me get him for you"" and heads into the back.

He's back there for a few seconds, then he pokes his head around the corner, this time wearing his reading glasses, and says ""Hi! What can I do for you?""

&gt; CL, fuming now: ""Do you think I'm an idiot?""

Me internally: ""yes, a little bit""

Me externally: ""No, not at all. Unfortunately neither of the three of us will be unable to give you a refund though, seeing as it's been over 30 days and there's no actual issues with the key. I'm sorry we couldn't help you any further.""

&gt; CL: ""Well I hope you're happy that you just lost a customer""

Then she leaves, forgetting to pick up her key sitting on the counter. About 5 minutes later she walks back in without saying a word, picks up the key, and leaves. But not before my dad chimed in with a ""have a nice day!""

TL;DR: lady wants a refund on a key we made for her because she found her old ones, she can't understand that we can't un-cut keys and gets mad.

Edit: I have more stories, a couple more from the shop, but a few from going out on calls too. I'll share if you're interested, not sure of the mods would be cool with the service call stories though

Edit 2 because some people can't seem to grasp that both services and goods cost money:

Service call = $40, this is the basic local ""gas and services"" charge. An extra $10 is added on for every 10 miles away, so her total service call was 50

Fitting a key to a car when they've lost it = $35 usually, and this involves either peeking inside the lock and reading the pins, or taking apart the lock. In this case it was the latter, so we're charging for time spent also.

Key programming = $40, this is a set price because some cost more, some cost less, and we only charge to program keys that require us to hook up our machine(which by the way costs several thousand dollars, plus several hundred per year) to their car.

And then there's the price of the key itself, which I mentioned at the beginning of the post.

So yup, sorry if you can't grasp that things aren't free"
"No, you don't get a free phone for putting yours in the microwave.


Sorry if the formatting is wrong - I lurk, not post :-)

For clarification I work for a company specialising in mobile phones and electronics, I work in their retail store which also does servicing and repairs. Since the whole debacle with phones blowing up we get a lot of questions about these kinds of incidents regarding ours and other companies, which is fine, people have the right to be concerned and make informed decisions.

Today a lady (L for lady/liar) came into our store to pick up her phone which she booked in for a public liability (PL) assessment. A few days prior she came in to give us her phone, in which she told my colleagues that her phone **blew up** in her kitchen whilst she was sleeping, and demanded compensation for her microwave which caught fire due to being *next* to the phone. Fair enough in my opinion, this is a horrible situation. 
I don't think that's unreasonable, so we book it in and send the phone to our head office with the PL team.

Today she comes in because we called her and said the phone was ready to be picked up, assessment was completed. I look up the interaction history between her and head office so I have an understanding of everything that's happened since.

Interaction 1:
&gt;Customer has stated she will go to the media if we do not replace and refund her phone. Assessment has not been completed.

Interaction 2:
&gt;Customer is seeking refund for device and accessories and compensation for microwave oven, dish cloths, a floor mat and a pair of shoes. Assessment has not been completed.

Interaction 3:
&gt;DO NOT GIVE CUSTOMER REFUND SHE PLACED IT IN THE MICROWAVE WHICH CAUSED THE PHONE TO EXPLODE AND CATCH ON FIRE. Traces of food, particles and damages consistent with a device being placed inside a microwave oven have been found. Customer would not answer phone so she is unaware of the outcome of this investigation. 

I take the phone out and sit with her and explain what the PL team has found. 

Me: Hey there, L. Our head office tried to contact you to let you know the outcome, but couldn't get through. Your device is being returned unrepaired due it being found that there's been customer induced damage which has caused the phone to combust. I'll be honest with you - it's been found that the device has been placed into a microwave or an oven of some sort and will cost the amount of a brand new device for repair which you can go ahead with if you like.

L: What, so I'm not getting a new phone? This is f***ed. If I took it to /competitors company/ they would just REPLACE the phone on the spot AND I'd get a refund!

Me: I'm sorry, we just can't give you a replacement and refund for someone putting your phone in a microwave.

L: Well I think that thing should kind of be in the warranty manual.

She walks off, flipping me the finger as she steps out of the store.
