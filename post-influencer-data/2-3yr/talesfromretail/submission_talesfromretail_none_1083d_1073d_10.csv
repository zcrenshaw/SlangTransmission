"Woman wants a refund because she's filled up the memory on her three month old phone, fun ensues.


I work in a UK phone shop. One day a couple of months ago, I'm stood outside the shop at 08:50 waiting for my manager to come down and let me in. There is a middle-aged woman standing outside as well, glaring at me, tapping her foot and huffing impatiently. Uh-oh. Bad sign.

At 9am we open the doors and she comes stomping in, straight up to me. I open my mouth but she doesn't give me a chance to speak. She bought her phone three months ago, and it doesn't work anymore, apparently. She wants a refund. 

Now before this conversation goes any further I feel I have to point out to her straight away that a refund is not going to be possible after this length of time. After 30 days we can send it off for repair, but that's it. 

&gt;""Don't argue with me!"" she screeches. Okay. 

I ask her if I can have a look at her phone. She rolls her eyes and hands it over. After a few seconds it becomes clear that her internal memory has been filled up with photos of her grandson etc, and so there isn't any space to install a software update. So there isn't actually anything wrong with her phone at all. With my best retail smile, I begin to explain this to her, and mention that she can always buy an SD card and move her photos onto that and hey presto, problem solved. 

Nope, she wants a refund. We're back onto that. I tell her I'm going to go and speak to my manager, I go upstairs and we laugh at her, the usual. But he still comes back down with me to back me up because she's getting pretty horrible and we then spend another ten minutes or so trying to convince her that literally all we can do is send her perfectly working phone off for repair. She's now telling us she's going to go to Trading Standards, quoting the Consumer Rights Act at us, basically she's the biggest clich√© going. Unreal.

Eventually she admits defeat. But she still wants it ""repaired"". So I sit her down and start to take some details. 

&gt;""Why do you want my details?"" 

I am literally on the edge here. 

Eventually she tells me her first name. I start to type it in (she can see the screen) as Gill, and then she says ""no you stupid girl, it's spelled J... I... L... L"" (speaking slowly). I raise my eyes to her and give her a big sickly sweet smile and apologise profusely. I then ask her for her surname. 

&gt;""Let's see if you can spell THIS right, shall we?""

At which point I sit back and I say ""I'm sorry but I'm not going to serve you"".

She goes bright red and starts sputtering. Kicking off, calling me thick, rude, etc etc. My manager comes over and tells her calmly to leave. 

&gt;""I'm taking this all the way to the top!"" 

&gt;""Feel free, but please leave."""
"My town banned plastic bags. Some customers were not happy.


I'm an assistant Front End Manager (recently promoted to full time, and given a bit more authority as a result) in a chain grocery store, and as the title says, my town banned plastic grocery bags. The ban went into effect yesterday, and I had to explain it to customers. This is the story of one particularly unpleasant one.

I was working the close shift and one of my cashiers called me over at the request of the customer, an older lady. She asked me to tell her why there were no plastic bags at the register (after the fact I asked the cashier; he had tried to explain it multiple times and she wasn't buying it.) I explained that town law no longer permitted us to use them. ""So what am I supposed to do then?"" I pointed to the stacks of paper on the register and told her she's also welcome to bring in reusable bags.

""Well I don't like paper, it's too hard to carry. I certainly didn't vote for the change.""

""Well, ma'am, we also have reusable bags for sale if you'd like to use those instead.""

""I'm not paying for bags, that's ridiculous. I want plastic. So what are you going to do for me?""

""Nothing."" *Cue shocked look, and the loud gasp of someone who's never been told no in her life.* ""If you won't accept paper, and you won't buy a bag, what do you expect me to do? Break town law and give you plastic? I mean, we can just put the unbagged groceries in your cart but there's nothing else we can do."" So she asks to see *my* manager... Who tells her the same thing.

She did settle on paper, bagged lightly to make it easier to carry, but glared at us the whole time. As she was leaving, she said ""I'm shopping at [competitor] next time, they know how to take care of their customers.""

""They won't be using plastic either!"" I replied, as she walked out angrily.

My manager actually told me I handled it well, so I felt pretty good since it was basically the first time I got to use my new position's authority to essentially tell off a customer instead of caving to their demands."
"I wasn't even mad. I was more impressed she held onto a receipt for that long


So this happened fairly early into my promotion as ASM for a retail store. At the time, I was still kind of unsure about some of my decisions, but I knew for a fact I could not help this woman.


A woman came into the store with like 8 bags full of deco pillows. I wasn't looking forward to this, as our deco pillow section was super full, but I liked doing returns so I wasn't upset or anything. I'll be M, the customer will be T.


&gt;T: HI!!!! I'd like to return these pillows please!

&gt;M: Were you going to do any other shopping with us today? I'd be happy to hold those for you if you'd like to process all transactions at once :)

&gt;T: Not today! I've just been meaning to return these for a long time

&gt;M: No problem! Do you have the receipt?


She spent 5 minutes digging through her purse to find the receipt. She hands it to me and the date on it was FROM FOUR YEARS AGO.


&gt;M: Oh gosh, I'm sorry ma'am, but this receipt is too old, I can't do this return for you.

&gt;T: You're still going to return it though, right?

&gt;M: No, I'm sorry, I can't. For one, we have a fairly strict 30 day return policy, and also this receipt is literally so old the computer won't be able to process this.

&gt;I scanned the receipt and showed her the error message


I was usually pretty generous with the return policy to nice customers. I would have returned all 8 bags of pillows had the receipt been as old as 6 months. But 4 years?! Also, this is where she gets a little unreasonable.

&gt;T: No. Listen here. I drove all the way out here on my day off to return these damn things. You're going to return them or risk losing a customer. 

&gt;M: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I literally cannot process a return on a receipt that is four years old. Our return policy is 30 days.

&gt;T: I WAS PREGNANT. You don't honestly expect a pregnant woman to carry all these bags in here and drive all the way here.

&gt;M: You were pregnant for four years?


That comment kinda made her lose it and she resorted to calling me names and threatening to call corporate. I gave her the corporate number and offered to help carry the bags to her car. She stormed out yelling she'd never come back. 


Never heard back on that one."
