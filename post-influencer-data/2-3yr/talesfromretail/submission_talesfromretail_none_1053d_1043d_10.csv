"When DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM goes terribly wrong


A few years ago, I was working at a used videogame store.  

I was behind the counter, doing morning inventory, when a teenager came in.

TC: Teenage Customer
Me: Me

TC:  Hey, I preordered a copy of INSERT NAME OF GAME HERE last week.  Is it in yet?

Me:  Let me check for you.   Do you have an ID?

Check his ID, and he is only 16.  The game he preordered was rated M, so I couldn't sell it to him.

Me:  Sorry buddy, looks like this game is rated M.  I can't sell it to you because you are under the age of 18.  Is one of your parents in the car?

TC:  NO!  I PAID FOR THE GAME!  I WANT IT!

Me:  Believe me, I want nothing more to give it to you.  You are right, you are paid on it.  Company policy restricts me from selling it to you.

TC:  DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?  DO YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS?

Me:  Buddy, I'm on your side.  I want to sell the game to you, but my hands are tied.  Just come in with your parents or a big brother or even an older friend.  I can give it to you then.

TC:  Enjoy the unemployment line.

He exits.  And I think nothing more about it.  This happens once a week.

The next day, my boss calls me and asks to meet me at the coffee shop next door before my shift.  He commonly does this to go over monthly numbers.

Manager:  Thanks for meeting me.

Me:  Sure thing.

Manager:  Yesterday, did you have a kid come in asking to purchase a game that he preordered?

Me:  Sure did, he was underage so I didn't sell it to him.  

Then I go over the conversation with my boss.

Manager:  I know you followed policy, but that kid's father is a well respected businessman in the area.  The boy's father called my boss's boss, which in turn called me.  I'm sorry, I have to let you go.

Me:  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  For following company policy?

Manager:  Yeah, it sucks, but the father is influential in town and he suggested we let you go, and here I am.  But you get two weeks severance.  Don't worry about your shift today, I'm covering for you.  I need your keys and your badge.

Just like that I was unemployed.  All because I followed corporate policy.

"17 year old leg hair??


So I work in a supermarket as a cashier part time, and the other night we had an obviously drunk guy coming in to buy more alcohol. 

The supervisor really didn't want to serve him, so the bastard left it to me. Sigh. Our policy is not to sell drunk people alcohol, but our supervisor for some reason has no problem with it, and since she's the one to authorise the transaction, she takes all the blame. 

Anyway, at the end of the transaction, I asked for ID. In my country, the legal age is 18, but we *must* ask for ID for anyone who looks under 25 or we're not legally allowed to sell it. 

Me: ""Do you have ID with you tonight, sir?""

Him (patting his pockets): ""oh I think I left my wallet at home. But I have some cash"" (shoves it at me) 

Me: ""sorry, man, I can't sell you this beer if you don't have ID. Store policy.""

Him: ""but I'm clearly over 18. Why the big fuss? I just want my box of beer."" 

Me: ""I know, and I'd love to let you have it, but you're definitely under 25 so I have to see your ID before I can sell it to you. You can go and get it and come back later if you like.""

Him: ""what? No. I want my beer now. I'm over 18!""

Me: ""I know, and I'm sorry, but I need your ID first."" 

He backs away and starts rolling up his pant legs. I looked over at my supervisor in disbelief, and just got a smirk in return. 

The customer, having successfully got his pant legs above his knees, stretched his leg onto the counter, pulled at his leg hair and slurred, ""*Does this look like the leg hair of a fucking 17-year-old to you?*""

I tried to ignore my supervisor, who was splitting his sides, and asked him politely to leave before I had to call security. 

Seriously, though, wtf? Since when is leg hair a form of ID? 

**Edit: So I said that we have to prove people are drunk. Not true. My manager, for some reason, has no problem with serving drunk people, and she authorises all transactions so the onus is actually on her if she gets caught.**"
"Like finding milk at an office supply store


I used to work at an office supply store as a tech. I would repair computers and sell computers, printers, shredders, etc. Nothing crazy, but it paid for college.  
I wore a gray polo with khakis. The company logo and brand was plastered across my polo, name badge, and of course, *outside of the store*.   
One day, a man approaches me and asks where the milk was. ""It's usually in the back but all I can find are office supplies!"" You see, we were directly adjacent to a small grocery store. I started to explain this to him, but he was just angry that we were hiding his milk from him. ""Look look, I don't *want* you to explain to me where this is, I just want the milk! Take me to the milk!"" He was a bit older and hard of hearing. Probably just having a bad day. My manager was a great guy and saw what was happening. He goes over the walkie and tells me to just take care of it.   
So that's what I did. I smiled, apologized, and asked the man to follow me toward the milk. We went outside, looped into the grocery store, and back to the milk. At this point, he understood his error and was apologetic and embarassed. He took his milk and shuffled off toward checkout.   
A lady then approached me and asked where the grapes were. I walked her to produce."
