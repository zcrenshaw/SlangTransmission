"""Sorry ma'am, I cannot let you leave the store with unpaid merchandise.""


In high school I was a cashier for a large arts and crafts chain. I would usually work closing shifts after school. This particular night was pretty normal until this lady I will appropriately call 2Chainz came up to my register.

She was holding two different jewelry chains in front of me.

2Chainz: Hey can I just run these out to my car really quick? I need to see if they match a chain I have in there.

Me: I'm sorry, I can't let you walk out of here because they aren't paid for. I can hold them up here while you go grab the chain from your car.

2C: No you don't understand, I can't go get it. I need to bring them to my car. 

Me: I can go ahead and ring these up for you, and you can return them if they don't match.

2C: I will bring them back. Will you ask your manager?

At this point I was a little bit annoyed because a line was forming and she was starting to make a bit of a scene. On my radio, I called for someone to help ring and called my manager.

Me: (being nice as the customer was in front of me) Hey manager, is it ok if this customer takes a couple of chains to her car? She will bring them back.

Manager: Has she paid for them?

Me: No she hasn't.

My manager laughed and said no as expected.

Me: Sorry ma'am, I cannot let you leave the store with unpaid merchandise.

I don't know what I did to make her start bawling. Tears are running down her face like crazy. She yells ""FINE"", throws both chains at me and storms off.

My next customer comes up, puts his merchandise on the table and says ""is it ok if i leave the store without paying for this?"""
"""I've been shopping here for the last ten years.""


I work as a security guard at GroceryStore. I spend most of my shift at the front entrance. 

The store is located at a busy downtown intersection so we have no parking lot outside of the store. We do however have a underground parking lot. 

We used to let customers take the carts to the curb and to their home (if they left valid ID with us), but had to stop doing so because people kept stealing the carts (they cost $300 each for us to buy so we lost around $10,000). The wheels always locked if the carts reached a certain point. I or a grocer would have to manually unlock the wheels.

This is week three of having the no carry-out policy and a customer tried taking the cart out to the curb. We put a sign up mid-April to let customers know about the new policy beforehand.

C will be customer. SG will be me.

SG: Sir, we actually cannot do carry out anymore due to a new policy. 
C: I bought $200 worth of groceries and I can't even take the cart out? Ridiculous. You should have a sign up.
SG: The sign is actually right in front of you. It has been there for a little over a month. The new policy was implemented as of June 1st.
C: I have been shopping here for the last ten years! You just lost a valuable customer.
SG: We've actually only been open for five years.

His face got red and he stormed off.

Edit: Forgot to mention that we have an elevator that goes to the parking downstairs. Also forgot to mention that the carts do not lock when going down the elevator. People are just too lazy to find the entrance or genuinely don't know where it is (even though it's literally between both entrances to the store)."
"Don't call me THAT, its so outdated!


I was on the Register for the evening, all was going smoothly until she entered my line. I asked her how her day was, if she'd found everything, then I made the mistake of of calling her ""Ma'am"". ""Don't call me **THAT**! Its so outdated, no one uses those words anymore!"" I just smirked, rolled my eyes, handed her her items and said, ""Have a nice day, Ma'am!""  She insisted to speak to my Supervisor since I was ""Sassing"" her and that I be reprimanded for my choice of words. My supervisor said the appropriate actions would be taken, then told her, ""Ma'am, have a good day!"" She almost lost it. 

TL;DR: I call woman ma'am, she says my manners are offensive to her."
