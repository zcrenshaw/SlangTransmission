"We closed at 5.


I work in a camera store and if you're in the store before closing we'll take care of you until you buy something or wander out. Lately I've been counting minutes to close and then right on the hour the doors get shuttered/locked, open sign turned off and the phones set to night ringer. 

Today we closed at 5. I made a beeline for the front doors and was halfway across the floor when the doors open. A man and his wife start to enter. The man sees me, leans back outside to read our hours, turns to his wife and says the words I never thought I'd hear a customer say:

""Oh they just closed. Let's come back tomorrow"".

Thank you sir, you are my hero. Also we're closed tomorrow, but it is the thought that counts. "
"No ma'am, I can't sell you $100 of merchandise for $5


I work at a clothing store, we have packs of underwear hanging on a wall near the front of the store. The wall is split into two sections, the bottom is single pairs of underwear that go for $2, and then there's packs of 8 that cost $20. They are no the same brand, they are different materials, they look different, and are on different parts of the wall. On the part of the wall that only contains single pairs, is a sign that says ""5 for $5""

A woman walks up to our register with five 8-packs of underwear, I make casual conversation before presenting her with her total.

Me: That will be ~$100.00

Her: No, that will be $5.00

Me:...Well, no, that'll be ~$100.00

Her: No! They're five for five it says so on the sign!

At this point I know what sign she saw, and I know what mistake she's making, but in an attempt to show her the error of her ways I ask her to show me the sign

Her: Look, there it is right there it's 5 for $5.

Me: Actually, the 5 for $5 is referencing these single pairs that are only $2.

Her face lit up with anger and disgust as if I had defecated on the floor and asked her to clean up with her tongue. 

Her: Well why is that sign there?! Why are those packs with these packs?! These packs are on this wall and that sign says it's 5 or $5 and I'll take them at that price.

Me: Usually I could adjust your price, but I can't sell you $100 of merchandise at $5

Her: Well you need to remove that sign then because that's false advertising.

Me: No

Her: No?!

Me: Yup, no.

At this point my heart was in my throat and I actually could have gotten in trouble for how I spoke to her (depending on which manager she spoke to) but instead she just kind of walked out of the store.

Even if the sign was ambiguous, assuming a sale of that magnitude is just silly."
"""I'll call corporate!!"" ""Corporate doesn't exist.""


Hey tfr! I work at a now-mostly-defunct video rental chain, one of the few franchised locations left.


Today, a lady came in reeking of alcohol and clearly drunk. So youre aware, we sell a few assorted electronics accessories at the front of the store-- chargers, styluses, etc. 


Drunk lady shall henceforth be known as DL.


DL: ""HEY do you have ... A uh... Um... *Fumbles around* a phone charger I can use for a few minutes?


Me: ""no, but we do have chargers for sale! Right here.""


DL: ""Oh, awesome. I'll take one.""


Me: ""okay, that'll be eight dollars.""


DL: ""it says 5.""


Me (looking at the same display she is): ""it.. it says eight dollars on the display. Right there. Next to the picture.""


DL: ""Well I... I read five so you HAVE to 
sell it for five. It's like.. the law.""



Me: ""The price is eight dollars.*


DL: ""Well you've just lost a customer, and I'll be calling corporate. You'll get *fired*.""


Me: ""Actually, corporate doesn't really exist anymore. You can file a complaint with the store manager on duty, if you want.""


DL: ""Ugh, please.""


Me: ""So, what's your complaint?""


She then stormed out. God it felt so good to finally be able to say something like that."
