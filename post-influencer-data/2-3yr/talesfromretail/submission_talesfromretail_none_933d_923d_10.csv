"""You are lucky I am on a job cause I would have kicked your ass.""


I work at a hardware store with a garden department.  Said garden department sells bales of pine straw that is in a trailer in the parking lot locked behind a gate.  I get called outside to help the guy with 50 bales, no problem. I was on the phone when I went out there with another customer and when I arrived he had jumped the gate and was inside the locked trailer . I waved him over and asked him politely to get out, he mumbled how he had been waiting forever and whatnot.

TG= Tough Guy customer from now on

Me:  Sir you can't be in the trailer, that's why it is locked.

TG:  I have been waiting for over half an hour I need to go, time is money.

Me:  Yes sir I'm here to help.

*We continue to load he 50 bales without one word being said, it takes around ten minutes.  After we are finished he proceeds to yell at me:

TG:  I didn't appreciate you waving me over.  From a customer service standpoint that is terrible service and you are lucky I don't kick your ass for the insult.

Me:  Um, what?  I don't think I said anything insulting I just asked you to get out of the locked trailer.

TG:  When you were on the phone which was incredibly rude too, you used your phone to wave me out of the trailer

Me:  Yes, well I was on the phone with another customer and if that offended you I cant help you any further.  On the second note, I asked you to get out of the trailer because 1) it's not safe and if you would have tripped on some straw we would have been liable and 2) you jumped a locked gate so you are at fault anyways.

TG:  You better hope I don't come back here after I finish my job and kick your ass.


Anyways, after this outburst but a guy who got mad at me for talking on the phone and telling him not to break the law, I informed my manager if the incident who calmly called the guys company and told them we do not want them back at our store anymore and if we spot that guy we will issue a trespassing charge and call the cops.  Obviously the owner was pissed and tried to get us to change our decision but I don't know what happened next. 

Here's an idea, next time you threaten someone at a store, don't wear a shirt with your company's name on it to trace it back to you."
"""I demand that the price be changed to 12 dollars!""


A few months ago when I worked as a cashier, a woman placed 2 large pots on the conveyor belt and told me to check the price of each pot. So, I checked the first pot and it comes up 12 dollars. I checked the next pot and it comes up 18 dollars. Then, in the rudest voice imaginable, she said:


&gt; ""Why is that 18 dollars? That shouldn't be 18 dollars if the other pot is 12 dollars. That's ridiculous, I'm not paying that. They're literally the same item. No, change it, I'm not paying 18 dollars for the same item.""


I didn't interject during her little outburst, I just let her keep talking. When she finished, I took a look at the pots. The 18 dollar one was noticeably larger than the cheaper one and was grey rather than black like the other. Also, when I read the tags for them I noticed that they weren't even made by the same company. So, I began attempting to explain this to her:


&gt; Me: ""Ma'am, these two items are not the same. The more expensive one is larger and if you look at the tags here -"" 


&gt; Her: ""Why are you showing me the tags? I'm a teacher, I can read, honey.""


&gt; Me: ""Because they're not the same item. Look at the tags, they're not even made by the same company.""


&gt; Her: ""But they're clearly the same item, it doesn't matter what the tags say.""


&gt; Me: ""Then why do you think they came up as two different items with two different prices when I scanned them?"" 


&gt; Her:  ""It's obviously a mistake. Send for the manager because I'm not paying 18 dollars, I demand the price be changed to 12 dollars."" 


&gt; Me: ""No, I'm not calling anyone for this. Either buy something or step aside so that the next person in line can be serviced.""


At this point she simply refused to move from the register, blocking the next person in line from coming up. This, of course, left me with no choice but to do what she wanted and call for the assistant manager. When he arrives, I start explaining the situation to him, but while I'm talking she interrupts me again and orders him to change the price, saying:


&gt; ""Those are the same items, they should both be 12 dollars, change the price. "" 


Then the assistant manager scans the items in, changes the price of the 18 dollar one to 12 dollars, gives her the pots and tells her to have a nice day. The exchange that followed between me and the next person in line summed the situation up perfectly:


&gt; Him: ""So, if I just throw a tantrum I can get whatever I want in this place?"" 


&gt; Me: ""Evidently."""
"""Take that off or I'll complain to your corporate office, right now.""


Disclaimer: This tale deals with a particularly upset woman over a religious pendant that I wear. I do not intend this story to in anyway reflect my opinion of any religious faiths or traditions nor do I intend to start a debate about any faiths or traditions. This is not the sub for that, let us instead take entertainment from this customers threat to call corporate. P.S. yes, she had a soccer mom cut.

Ok so I work at a thrift store and I had a woman come into my store and look around for maybe 3 hours so I went over to see what was taking so long, especially after many coworkers had tried to help her. She looks at me and begins asking what color suites her more (to which I instantly give a mental ""are you serious"" face) and then she looks up at me and before I can answer she points to my neck and YELLS at me ""TAKE THAT OFF RIGHT NOW!"" And me, very confused look at my neck and realize she's pointing at my necklace (I wear a pentacle pendant daily as a sign of my faith) and I tell her if it's making her that uncomfortable I can put it under my clothing or find another associate who can help her but that I will not take it off. She flat out refuses to accept that I will not remove my necklace and continues yelling at me.

""NO, YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT OFF RIGHT NOW. I WILL NOT TAKE THIS DISRESPECT FROM YOU!""

""Ma'am, it's clear I've upset you and for that I apologize. I'll go get another employee to assist you.""

I begin walking away to find my AM and honestly just want to get away from her when I she literally runs to the first employee she sees and starts yelling AT THEM to make me take off my necklace or make me leave the store. 

""Ma'am, I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do to help you with that problem.""

After that she runs over to me and starts yelling.

""TAKE THAT OFFENSIVE PIECE OF SH*T OFF RIGHT NOW!""

So now I'm super pissed but we have other customers who are trying to go about their business and not being complete jerk offs.

""Ma'am, I'm sorry you find my religious expression offensive but I find it slightly disrespectful that you don't have the decency to accept my compromises and address me in a civil tone, please leave my store and never return.""

""TAKE THAT OFF RIGHT NOW OR I'M CALLING YOUR CORPORATE OFFICE!""

""Please do, I'm sure they'll resolve this issue for us."" I give her the number.

In front of me she whips out her phone and starts dialing the number. She instantly starts berating the operator on the other end about how an employee had been so rude to her and refused to take off jewelry that promoted ""devil worship""

Apparently the conversation was short lived because she hung up and slammed her phone into her pocket and stormed out all huffy puffy. 

She hasn't returned since and all employees know to tell her to leave if they see her again.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for gold!"
