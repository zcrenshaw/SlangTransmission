"So three kids and a scooter came into the store...


Let's set the scene real quick. I'm a supervisor at one of the main grocery stores in Australia. I'm currently filling in a shift at another nearby store. 

At the time i was manning the self serve checkouts and i notice three kids come in by themselves (no parent) one pushing a scooter. Now these kids were about 10-15yr old probably.

They looked like your typical trouble making kids you see running around everywhere, although they did comply with instructions when i told them they couldn't ride their scooter in the store. 

Ome of them grabbed a kitkat and purchased that and started to eat it while the others grabbed a 24 pack of soft drink cans. The two with the soft drink proceeded to come through self serve and start to put money into the machine, but then they noticed they were short.

While they are discussing urgently about why they were short and did the kitkat guy spend their money, one realised he had lost a $5 note. 

I was feeling in a good mood and spontaneously decided to cover the $3 for them. They were polite and said thanks...

.. but the reason I'm writing this is for what happened next...

One of the kids found their $5 they dropped on the floor outside the store, came back and offered it to me, which i refused and said they could keep it.

They then asked that i take it and if any other customers were a few dollars short i use it to cover the extra, as their way of paying it forward. 

I accepted, put the money in our loose change tin and sort of wished their parents were around so i could tell them they had raised some awesome kids "
"When the item was ACTUALLY free


Oh my goodness, I can't believe I almost forgot about this. 

So, I work at your local ""sells everything"" store as a cashier. One day I'm ringing up a customer as usual and grab my hand scanner to scan the two cakes he had in his cart. The one large sheet cake was no problem. However, there was a smaller, circular cake that did not have a barcode. The label on the larger cake didn't say anything about another cake either. 


Customer: It must be free then, right?
Me: Probably not, sir. One moment, please. 

I then call the bakery department to clear this up only to be told, THE SMALL CAKE WAS ACTUALLY FREE. It's a smash cake, which is I guess some small waste of good cake they give out for the birthday toddler to destroy/eat/wear with the purchase of a normal sheet cake. 

I look the customer dead in the eye and say ""Sir, in all my time here the item has NEVER been free. You are the first. Savor it."" I laugh, he laughs, I marvel at the fact someone was right with that stupid joke. 

It was a good day. "
"""Customer"" sends her groundskeeper to buy 4XL and 5XL shirts, becomes furious when we don't carry them.


I worked at my university's bookstore for two years as a register monkey. I say register monkey because ""cashier"" didn't cut it: we had to do anything our ~~handlers~~ team leads told us to do, like trained monkeys. Our ""bookstore"" was about 30% textbooks and 70% ""anything we can put our logo or school name on and sell for a 200% markup"". 

So, one slow summer day, I'm sitting and talking with the other monkeys, when an old man walks into the store. He looks to be about 80 years old, his back is bent and he can't stand up straight, and he's got a little crumpled piece of paper that he apparently tore out of one of those pocket notebooks held up to his face so he can read what he scrawled there. He starts looking in our apparel section and I leave him be--no one wants someone bugging them right when they start looking--but note that he doesn't seem to be finding what he's looking for. He looks for about 10 minutes before my handler tells me to go help him out. The following conversation takes place between me (ME) and the old man (OM):

ME: Can I help you find something, sir?

OM: Oh, yes, thank you son! I have these shirts I'm looking for... (He fishes out the crumpled piece of paper) 

--He then lists six or seven styles of shirt, complete with SKUs from our website.

OM: And for each of those I need one in a 4XL and one in a 5XL.

ME: Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I don't think we carry those in those sizes.

OM: Well, could you at least take a look? 

ME: Of course. Give me a few minutes to check the stockroom.

So I head to the stock room, knowing damn well that the largest size we carry is 3XL, and not many of those to boot. I actually do check, and sure enough, no 4 or 5X. I walk back out to the sales floor and see the old man on his cell phone. Almost like a cartoon, I can hear this high-pitched voice talking loudly even from about 15 feet away as I walk up to him. He excuses himself without hanging up and asks me if I found them.

ME: No sir, I was right. We don't carry anything that size. I'm sorry, can I help you find anything else?

OM: Well, I've got my boss on the phone--(He sheepishly gestures with his phone)--and she's a bit upset that you don't carry the shirts. Could you explain to her?

ME: Um, sure. 

He hands me the phone, and I try to greet the woman on the other end, henceforth referred to as Cranky Fat Bitch (CFB), but she cuts me off before I get two words out.

CFB: Alright, I'm going to take this *very* slowly so you understand what I'm looking for. I need *these* shirts--(she lists the SKUs painfully slowly, asking ""Did you understand that?"" snootily each time). Now, do you think you could go get those for me?

ME: Yes ma'am, he told me what shirts you're looking for. As I was explaining to him, we don't carry those shirts in 4X or 5X. 

CFB: Oh I'm sure you do. Now I need you to go get them for me.

ME: Ma'am, we don't carry those. We only carry up to 3XL.

CFB: Then I need you to order them for me. This really shouldn't be this difficult for you, you know. My husband and I would like to buy your shirts, and you should have the sizes your customers request.

ME: No ma'am, these shirts are not *made* in 4X or 5X. It's not just that we don't carry your size.

CFB: Okay, I'm going to explain this slowly again, you don't seem to get it. I need, *four XL* and *five XL* to fit me and my husband.

At this point I'm trying to restrain the rage building inside me like this woman restrains basic human decency and dietary regulation.

ME: Yes ma'am, I understand what you're looking for, *but we don't have it.*

CFB: Can I talk to someone who isn't slow?

ME: Unfortunately no, ma'am. We exclusively employ slow people. Can I help you find something else?

CFB, giving over to anger instead of her holier-than-thou attitude now: Alright listen here. I'm getting annoyed with you. Give me my shirts or let me speak to your manager.

ME: *We do not carry your size, ma'am.*

CFB: Now that is just rude! How dare you discriminate against my weight? Where is your manager! I--

At this point, the old man reaches out and plucks his phone from my hand. He's heard the whole conversation, because CFB had been screaming in my ear basically the entire time. He briefly tells CFB that he's coming back to the house, and they'll have to find something else, then shuts the phone.

OM: Sorry about that, son. She gets like that sometimes.

ME: I'm sorry if I've caused you any trouble. She seemed like a real treat. She always treat her family like that?

OM: Oh no, I'm not family. I'm her gardener. 

ME: Oh.

OM: Yeah, and I'm done. The next time she wants to buy a shirt, she can roll her own fat ass down here and get it herself. 

He walked out of the store as I laughed like a loon. My manager got a call that afternoon from CFB, and told her exactly what I had. She eventually filed a complaint with corporate about ""fat discrimination"" and was told to special order the damn shirts. I never saw the old man again, but God bless him, I hope he's somewhere her shrill little voice will never reach him again."
