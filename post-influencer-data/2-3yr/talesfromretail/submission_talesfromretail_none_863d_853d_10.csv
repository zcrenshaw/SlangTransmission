"""Don't let my wife see.""


First post (to TFR), let's see how this works.

I work in a small, locally owned toy shop in little college town, however we have a lot of down to earth people and families.

Couple comes in with three kids and immediately the kids go crazy, wanting to show their parents every single toy in the store. 

It's a small store but is broken into three distinct sections, rooms connected by walkways. We have a card rack next to the cash wrap that has all sorts of cards.

As the wife is being dragged by her kids around the store, the husband comes up to me and quietly goes ""Don't let my wife see, we are big star wars fans"" and slides me [this](http://imgur.com/a/rLtK7) card and cash to pay for it. I quietly make small talk with him about the weather and ring him up. I finish just in time as his wife and kids walk around and then grab their dad to go beg and ask for toys. 

I'm chatting with the mom and she sees a card on the card rack and says ""This would be perfect for [husband] but don't let him see this,"" and slides me cash, finishes the transaction and winks. It's the exact same card. 

They finish their shopping, purchase a few toys for their three kids and walk out, both chuckling to themselves about how clever they are. 


edit: aw geez guys, this is the best post I've ever had on Reddit, ever. It made me so happy to share this with y'all. Have a bomb ass day!

Edit 2: changed to ""first post in TFR"" because I'm a little goon who ended up confusing some people. Thanks for putting a smile on my face, guys, Reddit has never made me so happy to share a story :) and HOLY MOLY! My first ever gilded post too! Guys you're all too nice! I hope your kids make you breakfast in bed once a week! "
"Diet Coke Ladies


Worked at a fast food chain when I was in high school. Many stories to be had about the work, but the only one really worth mentioning is a happy one. 

One of our recurring customers was ""the diet coke ladies"". Every afternoon, they would come through the drive thru and order 2 medium diet cokes. It was two older ladies, with their dogs in the back of their little Rav 4. Always nice, always wanting only 2 medium diet cokes. Occasionally, if things were super slow, we'd have a little chat as they paid (only a minute or two), and they would drive up to the second window for their drinks. Everyone in the store knew them, and you just had to shout ""diet coke ladies are here!"" and the person up front would get the drinks ready. 

As I was getting ready to go to college in a couple weeks, I happened to mention it to them. They were glad for me, and wished me well. 

Two days later, they came through the drive-thru per usual, but when they paid, they also handed me a little box, wrapped with a little silk ribbon. Inside was a silver pen, and engraved on the side was ""2 Medium Diet Cokes"". 

They told me they wanted me to pass my first test with it. "
