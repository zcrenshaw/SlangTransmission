"911: She went for it.


I work for a car rental place. I am the only employee at a location in a very small town. I often have to leave the store to go pick up customers, pickup/drop off oil changes, etc. etc. When I do, I leave between reservations, lock-up, and put up a sign on the door with a number where customers can reach me immediately. 

I usually never get any calls. 

However, yesterday a women called while I was out dropping off a customer to a body shop. She seemed perfectly reasonable at first. 

Me: Thanks for calling *****. How can I help you?

Her: Hi. (Apparently having read my notice) Will you be back soon? I don't have much time. 

(For the record, she had no reservation and had not previously contacted the store.)

Me: Yes ma'am. Just dropping off a customer. It should be about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Her: I'll be waiting . . . 

*hangs up*

Literally 2 minutes later she calls back. 

Her: Sir, I just can't let you do this. 

Me: Do what

Her: You abandoned the store and I am going to call the cops if you don't show up soon. 

Me: *laughing from confusion*

Her:

Me: That won't be necessary ma'am. I'll be back very soon and the cops aren't . . .

*she hangs up*

I show up 4 minutes later and swear to god, THE COPS WERE WAITING WITH HER, visibly unsure about why they were there. If your counting, she waited a total of 6 minutes MAX after I knew she existed; which is longer than I've waited for fresh nuggets in a drive through. She had no reservation, with not having previously contacted a business that operates based on reservations and literally called the cops. 

Cops: What's the problem here?

Me: *astonished* I have no idea. You'll have to ask her. 

Cops: *having already talked to her and unable to seriously address her, they look at us and back at each other, then back at me* we hope you have a better day. 

She doesn't even try to come in. Maybe she realized she had just gone through a manic episode and decided to give herself some time. "
"When the lawyer steps in to make everything better


Worked a decade as a salesman at a stereo shop. I've had hundreds of people threaten to sue, not a single one has. A few stand out, and I was just reminded of this gem.

Sold a kid (18/19 years old) a speaker, mentioned it has a  manufacturers warranty against defects. If it's not working, we just swap it out.

Kid comes back later that day, says the speaker doesn't work, he wants a warranty replacement.

Open the box and the speaker has a gaping hole in it. He was screwing it in, slipped, and put the entire drill bit and chuck through the speaker cone. It's obvious that's what happened. (The shape and position of the hole, the fact that not all the screw holes had marks from being used, etc)

I gave him a ""I'm sorry, but this is clearly physical damage, not a manufacturer defect. I can't warranty this.""

He debates, I hand him the warranty information from the manual, he reads it and accepts his fate ([it specifically notes ""damage due to improper installation...accident"" as not being covered](http://www.kicker.com/warranty)). Walks out with his destroyed speaker.

Half an hour later, his parents are in the shop screaming that they're going to sue us, it's our responsibility to replace it, it has a warranty, we ""formed a verbal contract with our client that we'd swap it out if there was an issue"". Dad mentions he's a lawyer a few times during his tirade.

&gt;Me: ""Sir, have you read the warranty information?""

&gt;Him: ""No, that doesn't matter""

I cut him off to say 

&gt;Me: ""So you're not a lawyer then?""

&gt;Him: ""Of course I am! Are you accusing me of lying?""

&gt;Me: ""Lawyers always read a contract before debating it. Misrepresenting yourself as an attorney in order to obtain benefit for another is a criminal offense sir.""

I pointed out the cameras, and mentioned they have audio.

He went silent, looked a bit shocked, and walked out with his broken speaker muttering something about how he's never coming back.

My manager leaned over and asked 

&gt;MGR: ""Is that true? It's illegal to impersonate a lawyer?""

&gt;Me: ""Damned if I know, I'm not a lawyer."""
"Your floor broke my water bottle.


So...  I work in an outlet mall... Today is super busy and everyone is super stressed, but were making an effort to stay polite and friendly. 


Customer walks up to me at the register as im working on ringing someone up, 


""your floor broke my water bottle! ""


""... What?"" 


""your floor,  it broke my bottle! ""


I grab another employee to take over the customer. 


"" show me... ""


I get over and see her friend trying to hide broken glass...  Now,  i work at a shoe store... Broken glass is bad for business. 


""... So you dropped your bottle?"" 


""... Yes... ""


God damnit folks,  if you screwed up,  just ask for help.  Dont blame my floor! Its been dealing with stinky feet all day.


TLDR: floors have feelings too."
