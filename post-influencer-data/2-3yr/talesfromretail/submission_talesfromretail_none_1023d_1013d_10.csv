"Get a job you hippy!


I work at a fairly popular paint supply store. I love my job and the people I work with. While I'm there, I'm allowed to have my tattoos showing, as long as they're not offensive or obnoxious. 

During the middle of the day, my usual customers are general contractors and foremen. This particular day, I had a long sleeved shirt on under my work shirt which covered my tattoos. Well, as I was helping on particular contractor, I decided to roll my sleeves up because it was getting warm in the store from all of my running around, trying to get this order done.

He takes one look at my arm tattoos and flips out on me, calling me a hippy and so many other insults. Now, I can take some heat for it because I'm a pretty well-mannered dude. However the best insult came as I was ringing him out. This guy told me ""Go get a job"" as I was ringing him out.

**He told me to go get a job, while I was at my job, taking his money.**

Edit: THANK YOU TO WHOEVER GAVE ME REDDIT GOLD. I LOVE YOU."
"The concept of ""self"" checkout just doesn't click with some people


We have three sets of self checkouts at our store; the slow, the busy, and the dead. I was supervising the busy set (and they were *busy* that night) when a guy wheeled up a massive cart full of groceries.


I took a second to greet him and scan his case of water and bag of dog food so he wouldn't have to lift them, then went back to driving myself crazy trying to babysit six machines.


The guy was there for maybe 5-10 minutes scanning and bagging, and a couple of times I helped him by having him put some of the bagged groceries in the cart and clearing the weight difference when he ran out of room in the bagging area.


When he finally finished scanning and paying he looked at me and scowled.


&gt;Customer: Thanks so much for all your *help*


&gt;Me: ....


&gt;Customer: \*walks away, muttering* Just standing there while I do all the work...


Like... my dude... Did you see me running from customer to customer trying to help 6 people at once? I'm running 6 registers right now, I don't have time to hold your hand like in a regular checkout lane. 


If you want someone to hold your hand there's a checkout lane 5 feet to the left of here where we will literally do everything for you. Someone will even unload your cart onto the belt *and* take it to your car for you...  You came to *self checkout...*"

Im on mobile, but dont worry my formatting and spelling will be fucking *pristine* because I dont have sausage fingers. 

A few years ago, I worked in a certain mall store that retails massage chairs. You can probably guess which one, and they have a pretty strict no social media policy but who cares I dont work there anymore. 

One of the managers and I were running people through the chairs (10 minutes for everyone, no kids, no shoes, no food, etc). 

A very very pregnant lady comes in and beelines for the hardest hitting massage chair we have. People let ger cut in line because nobody is going to stop a pregnant woman from sitting down. 

She starts to turn on the remote to turn on the massage and my manager sees this and heads on over. 

He says says ""Hello ma'am, feel free to use the leg massager for 15 minutes or so, but Im going to set up the remote in a way that it does not cause medical complications for you or your child""

She asks ""why cant I get a full massage?"" 

""Well, there is a possibility that it could induce labor prematurely"" he says, starting to dread the following interaction. 

""Im ready"" 

""Excuse me?"" 

""The due date is tomorrow, might as well give birth now""

The manager is silent for a couple of seconds. This guy is a veteran, but he did not know how to handle the situation. 

""Ma'am, please dont give birth in my store"" "
"Not everything you bring to an IT shop has to be fixed.


Quick one today I just remembered.

I got the closing shift at the IT shop I used to work at when I was still in school. 10 minutes till closing and I decided to get the sign inside already and start cleaning our display. That's when I heard the door opening and in comes a guy from school.

He's living at another part of the small town and since we were both the same age I knew he had no license (I'm from germany, I was nearly 16 time of the story, so no driver's license) and it could have been a real pain to get here.


I dislike this guy. Always trying to show of his dad's money and since he's not too bad at sports, the stupid girls all like him. And since he got brains too he hit the jackpot. No chance for like everyone. So I was quite irritated when $GuyPerfect entered the store.


&gt;**$Me:** ""Welcome at $Store! But I have to tell we are closing really soon. It would be best if you would just return tomorrow at an earlier time.""


I tried to be polite and did hope he got the message. But he just shook his head and went for the desk. I followed him, because well, I'm closing in 7 minutes and I don't want you to ruin that.

When I reached the desk I noticed he had placed a bag there and bite me if I'm wrong, but that bag was moving. Last minute repair orders for a bug-rotten laptop. Thanks ~~Schr√∂der~~ Obama.


&gt;**$GuyPerfect:** ""Sorry. But I have to ask you for a favor. I know we don't get along really well but this has to be top secret and my parents needn't know this!""


I was curious so I opened the bag and inside was... a puppy. Not a badly damaged laptop or monitor or something. No. A cute little Golden Retriever puppy. They're definitely not IT, what would make him think bringing it to us would be a good idea?


I asked him exactly that while petting the puppy. *I mean, come on! It was just so cute!* And he started to stutter while trying to explain.


&gt;**$GuyPerfect:** ""Okay, you see, I was not looking for an IT store, I was looking for you. That's when your mom told me you were here and here I am. I know this is sudden and you don't really know me but I know some of your friends and they told me I could trust you with this. So please help me!""

&gt;**$Me:** ""Woah, wait a moment! What help do you need?"" 
*And who would recommend me as the go-to guy if ever having a puppy? That's not bad at all, I just want to thank that person.*


So he explained. He told me he found this little guy when walking home, trapped inside a carboard box, and took him to a vet as soon as he could. The puppy was not hurt but he just thought better safe than sorry. It was alright but now he had one problem: His mother hates animals. She would scream whenever she saw something bigger than a fly.


So for him it would be impossible to take the little guy home. But he didn't want to bring him to a shelter. That's when he heard from one of my friends that I live beside a farm and used to help there when I was little. So I would have the possibility to keep the puppy there and he would visit him everyday. He knew he was selfish but he at least wanted to try.


I was touched. I really was. So I told him to grab the puppy and wait outside while I closed the shop. As soon as I was done we both went to the farmer and told him everything. He laughed but since he knew me for ages he agreed. $GuyPerfect was grateful, promised to pay us for our troubles and went home.


And this is the story of how I got to know my best friend of 9 years and now coworker.


*PS: The dog still lives with the farmer. When the dog grew older (and we too) we realised it's best to keep him at his used surroundings, even though $GuyPerfect wanted to take him with him when he moved out.

EDIT: WOah guys! I never expected this story to get so many upvotes! I was gone for the weekend and just came back to see this! Thank you all so much! Now up to the question I will answer here:

1. Yep, I know this story wasn't a quick read. I just typed it quickly when I remembered.
2. This story and my love for tech and dogs inspired my username, yes.
3. Actually the name $GuyPerfect I used here is a joke we both share, because he always hated the fact, that girls called him perfect. That and the thing that he is gay. Unfortunately I am not, so it would be hard for us to marry *and* live a happy life. A puppy live would be more realistic though...
4. And no, the dog is not my coworker. But the dog I owned was it sort of. He died this year so I'm going solo again.
5. I consider posting this to the other subs you recommended, thanks!"
