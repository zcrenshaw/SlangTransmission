"But I returned it…


I used to work in a video store. We had a woman call because we had charged her credit card for a DVD that was never returned. We had been calling her every day for 15 days and leaving messages warning her of the increasing late fees and that her card would be charged on day 16. When she got the Thank You for Paying The Late Fee And The Item Cost letter she finally called in to argue. I explained the charges and she proceeded to argue.

Customer (C): “But I returned it.”

Me: “We don’t have it here. Maybe you returned it to another store or another location?”

(C): “No, I dropped it in the mailbox.”

Me: “You.. mailed it to us? ”

(C): “Yes.” 

Me: “Like.. in an envelope? With stamps? ”

(C): “No. I just put it in the mailbox.”

Me: “You just put the DVD case in the mailbox? No envelope? No stamps? ”

(C): “Yeah”

Me: “That’s not how you mail things”.

(C): “But the case has your address on it. ”

Me: “But mail requires postage to be paid. Okay, anyways, we never got it. So it was never returned. So the late charges and replacement fee stand. ”

(C): ”BUT I RETURNED IT. ”

Me: “Ma’am, you ‘returned’ it like you left it in a field and called us 2 weeks later to say it’s in a field somewhere. When you rent an object  it is your responsibility to ensure it is returned to the business. We do not have our DVD, so you owe us money. ”

(C): ”Can’t you call Canada Post and get it from them? ”

Me: “Ma’am, I think you missed the ‘your responsibility’ part. If you call them and you manage to get the DVD back from them and bring it to us we can refund you the replacement cost. ”

(C): “And the late fees?”

Me: “No, it’s still late.”

(C): “But I returned it on time.”

Me: “I think we’re working with two different definitions of the word ‘returned’. We only consider an item returned when all components of the rental are returned, dvd, box, everything. Zero pieces of your rental are in our store. So it is not ‘returned’. Even if you were to find the dvd and return it right now, it would be crossing our threshold *two weeks later* than it should have been.”

I mean he was nice and polite at least.. but wtf is he trying to do.. this was on boxing day..  

And by boxing day I mean there are 20 people in a line making cranky faces. If he wanted a usb stick he would have seen them on the way out.  Sorry to all those here who feel I should have gone the extra mile but it was hectic and I needed to help the people that knew exactly what they wanted get their gear and get out fast.  

Merry Christmas!"
"DO NOT TALK TO MY ASSOCIATES LIKE THAT


This happened a few days ago and I'm still incredibly pissed off about it.

Our store which is in the land of soaps, lotions, and candles, has a semi annual sale. This sale has made us crazy busy and our backroom is pretty much empty.

Last week I was closing with three associates and desperately trying to make our store look ""full"" I had my two experienced employees pulling stock from our offsite and our backroom while my one new seasonal employee helped me on the floor. After making sure Floor Associate was good at register, I went to the front to greet people and start a list of product that we needed to rearrange or fill. 

We only had three customers. One was an older woman shopping by herself. The other two were a couple, older man and woman, woman was shopping, man was standing there with a look that some men get in our store.

We have tons of stuff on different tables but occasionally it gets switched around. We honor it if it accidentally gets put on a lesser price table.

Single Woman walks up to my Floor Associate to ring up. After a couple of minutes, I hear her yelling at my Associate and immediately walk back. My FA is standing there shaking and has tears going down her face. This woman is yelling at her that the candle needs to be a lower price and that she's incompetent at her job.

I walk up to FA and tell her to go to the backroom to sit down for a few minutes. She wordlessly walks back while trying to not cry.

SW ""THIS CANDLE HERE...""

Me ""I'm sorry ma'am, it's difficult to understand you when you're yelling. Could you please repeat that?""

SW ""THAT LITTLE BITCH RANG THIS UP AS THE WRONG PRICE.""

Me ""Excuse me?""

SW ""SEE, SHE..""

Me ""No ma'am, Excuse me, do not speak that way about my associates.""

SW ""I'LL DO WHATEVER THE FUCK..""

Me now uncharacteristically being forceful and talking over her, ""Nope, nope, nope. I'm sorry but no. You don't speak that way to my associates, you don't speak that way to me. I'm sorry but you now need to leave. You will no longer be purchasing this candle. Here's our corporate number, you're welcome to call them and I've listed my name here.""

SW ""How dare you?! I want that little bitch's name too!""

Me ""I'm not releasing her name but I'm giving you mine. I will be calling my store manager and my district manager to let them know the situation.""

SW calls me all sorts of things and walks out.

Other couple approaches counter and the woman says ""I'd like your corporate number too. That woman acted atrociously toward that young lady and I don't want that sweet girl to get in trouble.""

I thank them and immediately add a coupon onto their transaction for making me feel better.  The woman also gives me her number to give to my manager. 

I can't get over how the first woman acted. I've seen a lot of crazy stuff go down as a manager but never anything quite like a woman verbally attacking my Associate.
