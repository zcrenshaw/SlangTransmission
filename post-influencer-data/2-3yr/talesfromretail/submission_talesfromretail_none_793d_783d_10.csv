"In which I lose my job over $0.10


So, After Christmas Sale '08, I'm working as a cashier in a big box retail chain store. We're clearing out all of our holiday inventory and most of our items are marked down in the computer. It's a busy day, and that's good because it keeps the line moving and keeps me from getting too bored. Anyway, a customer, let's call him AC, comes through with a bag of holiday themed M&amp;M's, one of the big ones you buy when you're filling a dish at parties or baking them into cookies. In any case, the amount that food items are marked down is considerably smaller than that of things like lights, trees and ornaments, so I've for several years short handed the discount at ""about ten cents.""

Some of this is dramatized (it was almost a decade ago), but you'll get the idea of what happened. 

Me: Hi, did you find everything you were looking for? 

*AC puts M &amp; M's on the conveyor*

AC: Yeah, just this.

*I ring it up, and it shows the marked price as $2.99*

Me: All right sir, your total is gonna come to $2.99.

AC: It was supposed to be marked down!

Me: Okay, let me get my manager.

AC: Why isn't it in the computer?

Me: Sometimes these things just happen. Probably an oversight.

AC: *Getting unreasonably angry* Well, change it for me now!

Me: I'm sorry, sir, I have to have a manager to override this. 

AC: *sarcastically* Oh, you're gonna call a manager so they can tell me it's not on sale too?

*I pick up the phone to page a manager*

AC: Can't even do your fuckin' job...

Me: You know what? BITE ME.

AC: *Furious, looking like he's gonna hit me.* What did you say?

Me: *Now realizing what I've done and both scared I'm gonna lose my job and that this ass is gonna hit me* You...you heard me. 

He glares at me for another second like he's gonna hit me, and then storms off with the bag of candy in his hand. He heads over to customer service and yells at the girl there. I cut off my light and slump behind my desk. I was pretty shaken up and almost crying. I finish my shift as usual, and the next time I come in for work, I get fired. It was unprofessional, but seriously. Do not FUCK with cashiers during or after Christmas. I still hadn't destressed from Christmas Eve at that point.

"She called in a complaint to corporate about us because we would not break corporate policy for her


I work in a chain convienence store that has a gift card that gives you a $0.03 discount off each gallon of gas when used at the pump or inside. You would not believe how many customers DO NOT UNDERSTAND the policy on this card, and how unbelievably upset they get for not getting their way (or you probably would understand, this is Tales From Retail after all). This story is about one of these many customers. 

So this woman walks in wanting gas on a pump. The transaction is going smoothly until I noticed that in addition to pulling out her credit card, she has also pulled out a store gift card and laid in on the counter. Now a lot of people don't realize that you have to pay cash to reload/put money on these cards, but she hasn't said anything about it so i just let it slide hoping that she just gets her gas and leaves and I dont have to go through another spiel about these damn cards.

Nope.

Her card goes through, I tell her to have a nice day. Before she leaves she asks if her discount went through.

Me: ""oh no ma'am, you have to use the gift card to buy the gas to get the discount.""
Lady: ""oh alright, can we redo and use the card then?"" 

I say no problem, ring her up again, she swipes the gift card and it declines.

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, this is saying insufficient funds.""
Lady: ""yes but i just want the discount.""
Me: ""Well there needs to be money on here, i have no way to just give you the discount.""
Lady: ""But there's no money on there!""
Me: ""...then I can't give you a discount.""
Lady: ""where is your manager?""

So I grab my assistant manager (AM) who repeats exactly what i said to this woman who is now asking for my general managers personal cell number. AM explains we cannot and will not give her that information, which absolutely baffles miss rude. She then asks us to CALL HIM until he picks up so that she can personally talk to him, and when that doesn't work she asks for corporate. By this time I walk away, as shes now telling my AM that I was extremely rude as she didn't know who was open (my cashier was helping another customer, I was in the back but walked up when she approached the register) and she couldve sworn I was lying to her because She felt ""something wasn't right"". 

So i go on break, she calls corporate and goes back to her car. I come back just in time for her to come back for a receipt for whoever is on the phone, AND a receipt for her money going back on her card, because she doesnt believe we actually told her the truth (when we refund gas from a card it can take up to 30 minutes to reappear in your bank account). Which she can only get from her bank. Which again, she doesn't believe me and demands a manager. After talking to AM, she rants about how she passed up [major grocery store] gas station specifically for OUR prices and were going to be VERY SORRY about lying to her and we are ALL LOSING OUR JOBS before she finally stormed out and drove off."
"Came in for 10 in gas, ended paying over $2000 in damages


During my time as a Cashier at a gas station I have seen many baffling things, but this by far takes the cake.

It was a normal spring (Happened a couple of months ago)afternoon when a gentlemen comes in and asks for 10 on the pump. He seemed nice enough and I had no indication of what was going to happen next. As I finished out the transaction, I was tending to a growing line of customers when I see that this dude drops his phone. I say the standard ""Aw that sucks man"" and then, out of no where, this dude straight up punches the window of the door as he goes out. The whole window is cracked and my manager runs out to yell at him and catch his license plate. He didn't even finish pumping his gas.

The maintenance guy comes to assess the door and tells me that the dude will end up having to pay over $2000 to fix the door since they have to replace all of the glass. Ill add a pic of the door for to show how bad it was
