"""I put the chips on the baby""


I was bagging groceries last night when a lady came through with a baby in a car seat in the basket of her cart. She had a LOT of groceries that I'm assuming she'd had under and around the car seat, so when I bagged them I was putting them back under and around the car seat. I wasn't sure where else to put them if not there, right? It's not like I could put them on top of the baby, right? 


Well. As I'm placing stuff carefully under Baby, Baby's mom says ""oh hon, you can just put some of this stuff on top of him"" and pats the canopy.


The phrase ""but ma'am that's a *baby*"" almost escapes me but I choke it down, nod, and continue putting stuff under the baby, under the cart, in the seat of the cart, etc. At this point the cashier (my favorite cashier) is trying and failing not to laugh at both the absurdity of me being told to put groceries on a baby, and my increasingly desperate attempts at finding places for the bags.


I got all but a bag of chips squared away, and there was just no more room, so as they walked away I set the bag of chips on top of the car seat, turned back to the cashier and whispered in horror ""I put the chips on the baby."" Which I believe is the most absurd thing I've said on the job so far."
"Today I encountered a Unicorn of Retail


Hello! I'm coming in with a story that happened earlier today, in my little mall shoe store.

The policy at my store is 30 days for a full refund. The whole thing is franchise based, so for stupid-system reasons, we cannot do refunds or exchanges on other franchises receipts.

Cue Unicorn Lady (UL), walking with determination to my register. I'm on my own today, and half braced myself for the wrath of another disgruntled soccer mom.

&gt;UL: I need to return these three shoes, but all are on different receipts. Is that okay?

&gt;Me: Yes it is, it may just take a moment. Lets see here... oh,I see this one is from *Other Location*, so unfortunately I cannot do that return here for franchise revenue reasons.

&gt;UL: Oh, no that's not true, the other girl said I can. *Other Location* is another 2 hours drive!

I brace myself and start to pray this all goes smoothly.

&gt;Me: I know, and I apologize, but I actually cannot ring it through my system, it will be rejected. And, well, I see that this item was 25% off- that renders it final sale.

&gt;UL: NO NO WAY THAT THAT IS- 

And then she did it; she took a deep breath, and calmed her voice.

&gt;UL: I apologize, but are you sure? The teller at the other store said I could return these here, and never mentioned the final sale part.

&gt;Me: Here, what I'm going to do is refund the pairs I can, and throw in a free car freshener, then give you a voucher for the next time you shop with us; I hope that's a bit better. I think you may have gotten a new employee at *Other Location* who made a mistake or two. 

&gt;UL: Well, thank you for doing what you can. I guess it's not a newbies fault for making a mistake. You're a really sweet girl, thank you for everything today.

Then she simply wandered back off after her refund, back in the the abyss of a Wednesday evening in a mall. No yelling, an actual apology, understanding of a cashiers mistake- the works. 

Wherever you are, Unicorn Lady, thank you, from all of us. 



Edit: Spelling, thanks for pointing it out!"
"""Don't you think it's very expensive??"" ... ""Yeah I do, that's why I don't shop here a lot""


I work in a gourmet supermarket/deli in the upmarket part of town.  It's part of a department store that also includes a clothes boutique and a general homeware section.

Everything in the store (be it a mug or a pre-prepared dinner) is of a pretty high quality so naturally, it's a bit more expensive than your average shop. I'm a college student who needs to save money so I don't really take advantage of my employee discount a lot - just sometimes for little gifts for my parents and birthday presents for friends.

Customers often complain about the prices and if you usually just smile at them and change the subject to the weather or if they'd like a gift bag, that ends the conversation.

But one woman the other day was DETERMINED (for some reason) to get me to admit that the shop was expensive.

""That'll be forty-four ninety-five altogether please.""

""Urgh, that's *ridiculously* expensive!""

""Mmhm. It's really rainy weather today - shall I double-bag this for you?""

""Yes, you better! I want to keep these items dry considering I'm paying *SO MUCH MONEY* for them!""

""No problem - can I get you anything else while you're here?""

""Oh, haven't I spent enough already? It's all way too expensive in here!""

""Right, so you can pop your debit card into the machine there when you're ready...""

""Don't you think it's very expensive??""

It had been a long day already and I was exhausted, this woman's tone was extraordinarily rude and she was just annoying in general - so I decided to give her a polite (but honest) answer.

""Yeah I do, that's why I don't shop here a lot. I'm in university and I need to save up money. *But* for the odd treat, I think this place is great. Everything is of a high quality and lasts forever. The food is delicious too! In my opinion, it's well worth the price.""

Thankfully, that seemed to shut her up."
"""I just spoke to a manager and ...""


So I work in the meat department of a grocery store, and for the summer we have this sale on kebobs and souvlaki but we only advertise it every few weeks so people don't suspect anything. I don't actually know why. 

So this lady comes up to me and she'll be referred to as KL (kebob lady).

&gt;KL: I'm looking for some of the kebobs that you have that are on sale.

&gt;Me: Well, we don't have any out right now, but if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes I could make you some. What kind of meat did you want - chicken, beef or pork?

&gt;KL: OH! That'd be wonderful! Could I get 8 of the beef kebobs? 

&gt;Me: Sure.

&gt;KL: Thank you SO much, I REALLY appreciate it! 

&gt;Me: Yep, just come back in a bit and I'll have them for you.

I head into the department and start assembling these kebobs for the lady, who comes back after 5 or so minutes and checks up on me. 

&gt;Me: They're not quite ready yet, but they will be soon! I'm really sorry they're taking a little while longer.

&gt;KL: Oh, no worries! I'll come back. Thanks again!

Eventually I finish making the kebobs but the lady is busy talking to someone else in the department, and so I wait for her to finish chatting and I bring her the kebobs.

&gt;Me: Here you are, 8 freshly made beef kebobs! Enjoy!

&gt;KL: Oh my gosh, thank you so much for going out of your way to do this for me! I just spoke to a manager and told them about how great of a job you're doing back here! 

&gt;Me: Oh, uh, thanks!

&gt;KL: Have a great one, my dear.

And walking back into the back room the only thing I can think is, that's probably the first time I've heard a customer say ""I spoke to a manager"" and I actually was glad to hear the words after it..."
