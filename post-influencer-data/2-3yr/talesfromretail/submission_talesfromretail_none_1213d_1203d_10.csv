"Should I feel bad? Probably. Do I? Not really.


First time post here, literally my second post ever. 
Other new poster stuff, etc, etc. 


So, a little backstory. My previous retail job was in a UK cheap clothing store. Now, instead of plastic, we used these grocery-style paper bags that are completely awful. They break so often that I'd double-bag pretty much every other purchase. 



Now, this one day, a woman came up to my till with about ~£140 worth of clothes. Big joy. I tried to get through these as quickly as possible, especially since I was hot and tired, (our air con didn't work) but this wasn't fast enough for Impatient Lady (IL). 


&gt;IL: ""Can't you hurry up?""


&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry, I'm going as fast as I can.""



She begins huffing, tapping her foot, checking her watch, all the charming quirks of a person who thinks their time is more important than it is. Now, all this time, I'm scanning things through, folding them properly, and removing the coat hangers to endure the bag doesn't tear. 


&gt;IL:""Look, I'm in a *hurry*, just chuck them in the bag on the hanger."" 

I finish scanning and bagging up her stuff, and lift it onto the counter. 


&gt;Me: ""Okay, all done. Do you want me to double bag this? Our bags can b-""


IL snatches the bag out of my hands before I have a chance to finish.


&gt;IL: ""Why would I want that? Stop trying to waste my time, and let me pay.""


I simply shrug and tell her the total. She pays and stomps out, and I catch her muttering something about incompetent teenagers. 


Now, we have these large glass double doors where we can see the road outside and most customers leaving. I follow IL as she leaves the store, and as she starts to cross the road, I see a coat hanger break through the side of the bag, and tear the bag right open. 

*All* of her stuff falls out onto the road, and I watch her as she hurriedly scrabbles around on the pavement trying to grab it all together. 

I probably should feel kind of bad, but I'm sorry, if you want to be rude and ignore mw trying to help you then I'm not going to be shedding many tears when it bites you in the arse. 

**tldr**; Rude lady is impatient so tells me to bag stuff on hanger. Paper bags rips and all her stuff falls over the road.

"Lady throws her engagement ring away, wants us to dig it out.


This was several years ago when I was a mid-level manager at a popular American retail chain. I had slowly climbed my way after years of retail to a level of management where I could finally make some decisions that weren’t immediately overruled by a supervisor. This was especially true on days when I was the Manager on Duty (MoD).  

It was a hot July day in the the Deep South. I was MoD.

(IL – Incredulous Lady)
(Me – Yours truly)

IL: *“Excuse me, I just accidentally threw away my engagement ring in that garbage can out there.”*

She is angrily pointing to a garbage can in the parking lot that is nearly full. Note that people will often throw whatever refuse they have in their vehicles into these trash cans. It’s filled with who knows what. It’s a very hot and humid day, flies are swarming, and I’m sure the smell is unbearable.

Me: *“Wow, that’s terrible! I’ll make sure we don’t empty the trash until you find it.”*

IL: *“Uh, no. You guys need to get it out for me. I want to complain about your cart pusher, by the way, because he said he wasn’t going to dig through the garbage for me”*

I look over at my cart pusher and he’s shaking his head no and sternly looking me in the eyes behind this woman’s back. I think he actually believed I was going to try and make him do this. I could tell he was ready to quit on the spot.

Me: *“Ma’am, I’m sorry but I cannot ask any of my associates to sort through a trash can for you.”*

IL: *“Then YOU need to dig through there and get my ring! That’s an $8,000 ring!”*

Me: *“Ma’am, there is no way I’m digging through that mess to look for a ring you tossed into the garbage.”*

We go back and forth in this manner for a few more minutes before she turns away and marches to another associate demanding that they retrieve her ring from the garbage.  I, of course, stop her.

Me: *“Ma’am, none of my associates are going to help you with this. Please stop asking them. That is likely a violation of a health code.”* This was very much made up on the spot. 

Realizing I’m not backing down, she stomps over to the trash can and begins throwing trash angrily to the ground in a fit as she searches for her ring, the entire time telling me she will be calling corporate. She actually found the ring fairly quickly and left immediately a huff.  Even though I had to help my associate clean up the garbage afterward, I felt very good about the situation.  I do not miss retail one bit.

"""Give me some of your paycheck to make up for my mistake!""


I work at a retail store that is going out of business. We are currently having a liquidation sale, which is making customers even worse than usual. We are not allowed to provide typical customer service per liquidation rules. We can't give discounts for merchandise or hold merchandise, so customers get very mad about these new rules.

A woman called me to over to the weight-lifting section of the store. She was looking at a weight-lifting bench, and wanted to buy a new-in-the box model. I explained to her that we only had the floor model of that particular bench, and that's when the she got mad.

&gt;Woman (W from now on): You have to have a new bench in the back.

&gt;Me: No, ma'am. We have all of our stock on the floor for our liquidation sale.

&gt;W: That's ridiculous. You had three more just yesterday! And the sales people wouldn't let me put them on hold.

&gt;Me: Yeah, they must have sold. Sorry about that.

&gt;W: Can I at least speak to a manager about getting a discount? I don't want to pay full price for something used.

I called my department manager over. The only good thing about going out of business is that we can say and do pretty much anything get away with it. I knew my DM would not be sympathetic.

&gt;W: I can't believe this bench is full price! It's probably been on the floor forever.

&gt;DM: I'm sorry, I can't give a discount on this. We aren't capable of additional discounts anymore.

&gt;W: Well, I don't want a used bench.

&gt;DM: We have a different model that's new. It would be $100 more than this one.

&gt;W: Do you have a hundred extra dollars laying around?

This comment made my DM's face turn into a terrifying scowl. Just the day before, he told me that he might not make his car insurance payment. He was working this shift overtime for extra cash, so I knew that he did not in fact have a hundred extra dollars. He was pissed.

&gt;DM: I'm the one who is going to lose my job in three months! I'm going to be out of a job! I'm the one who has to worry about money! No, I don't have any money for your bench!

At that point, he just walked away. The woman ended up buy the  ""used"" bench for full price."
