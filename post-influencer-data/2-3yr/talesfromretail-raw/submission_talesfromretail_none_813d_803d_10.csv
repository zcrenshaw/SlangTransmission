"A customer comes in 5 minutes before closing...


As I'm sure you guys are familiar with some customers like to come in right before closing and buy a huge cart of shopping. These people are generally oblivious to the fact they're keeping staff past closing.

So this women runs up to my checkout with a small basket of items and begins apologising for coming in so late. I assure her it's ok. I learn that she used to work retail too and understands the blight of this.

She was incredibly nice the entire time and it only took a minute or two to ring up her stuff. We shared a few laughs about oblivious customers and she again apologised for keeping me.

I looked at the clock and it was only a minute after closing. I wish more customers were this considerate."
"Someone called corporate about me and a coworker.


Sorry for the delay! I don't think Reddit likes it if you post stories you typed up in Notes lol. 


Anyway, some background information; one of my coworkers (C) and I get along *super* well. Like, we're the same person with similar senses of humor so when we work together the atmosphere is friendly and light. My manager tries to schedule us together because there's a legitimate rise in sales when me and C are together lol. 


Like I said in my previous post my store is basically dead between holidays so I'm able to follow customers and help them one-on-one without having to worry about a line. 


One day this lady (N for nice) came in and you could tell she had money. She held herself confidently, smelled like leather and flowers, and had designer clothes, and she was *beautiful*. So I greet her and ask her if she needs any help. She says yes and me and C walk over to help her. 


We learned she's buying for a retirement party and a work anniversary party so we help her pick stuff out based upon her color scheme. I make small talk and learn her son is learning about noble gasses and his favorite gas is sulfur hexafluoride (makes your voice deeper. Opposite of helium) and I reply, ""my least favorite gas is my dads."" I know, it's a dumb joke but everyone loved it. 


N was fairly short so she thanked us for helping her (I'm 6'0 he's 6'4) and asked where the retirement and gag stuff is. I point it out and offer to keep her two carts of stuff in the front which she thanks me for. 


I stay up at the registers now because somehow a small line formed and I heard more chatting and laughing coming from C and N. 


N comes up and cashes out. Nearly $450 worth of stuff! Our average purchase is around $30 so this was a godsend. I get to the end and scan a coupon (25% off entire purchase) and brings her total down about $120 and she almost hugs me she's so happy (she would have but she couldn't reach me lol). 


I offer to help her take everything to her car and C holds open the doors for us and she talks the whole time about how she's doing all the errands today so she's sorry if the truck is a little messy. I say it's fine with a little laugh. 


Guys, I'm not a car person but this thing was huge. It was the same size as a pickup truck with a cool hatchback trunk! AND IT WAS SOOOOO CLEAN. I climbed in and played Tetris around dry cleaning and groceries. Like, I legitimately climbed in at least 4 feet into the trunk. 


She kept thanking me and complimenting me and C and asked for the number to corporate so she could compliment us. Unfortunately it's not on the receipts and I don't know it off the top of my head. 


She ended up googling it herself and my district manager came in a few days later to thank us because the lady left a stunning compliment about us! 

TL;DR: I made a fart joke, customer spent over $300, I climbed in a trunk, and got a compliment from corporate!

"I did something truly horrible...


This story happened quite a number of years ago, I havenÂ´t worked in retail for a long time...

I was working in a grocery store in Sweden and this is the worst encounter with a customer I have experienced. I worked behind the deli counter and was approached by an old lady and her friend.

She wanted to buy ham and I started slicing it for her. When I was almost done she started screaming at me, calling me useless and stupid and a lot of other things. 

What was my crime? You see, I had worked in another grocery store before and  just started working at this one. At my old store we always stacked the slices of ham on top of each other, wrapped them in paper and folded all the slices once. At this store they apparently folded each slice separately  before stacking  them. And of course no one had told me this.

I tried to fix it but got screamed at some more for touching her ham. I was almost in tears when she finally left.

That's my story of the nasty ham-lady, who screamed at me because of the most ridiculous thing. "
