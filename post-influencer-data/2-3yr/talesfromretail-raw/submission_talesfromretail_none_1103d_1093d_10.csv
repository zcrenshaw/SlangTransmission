"Woman wants a refund because she's filled up the memory on her three month old phone, fun ensues.


I work in a UK phone shop. One day a couple of months ago, I'm stood outside the shop at 08:50 waiting for my manager to come down and let me in. There is a middle-aged woman standing outside as well, glaring at me, tapping her foot and huffing impatiently. Uh-oh. Bad sign.

At 9am we open the doors and she comes stomping in, straight up to me. I open my mouth but she doesn't give me a chance to speak. She bought her phone three months ago, and it doesn't work anymore, apparently. She wants a refund. 

Now before this conversation goes any further I feel I have to point out to her straight away that a refund is not going to be possible after this length of time. After 30 days we can send it off for repair, but that's it. 

&gt;""Don't argue with me!"" she screeches. Okay. 

I ask her if I can have a look at her phone. She rolls her eyes and hands it over. After a few seconds it becomes clear that her internal memory has been filled up with photos of her grandson etc, and so there isn't any space to install a software update. So there isn't actually anything wrong with her phone at all. With my best retail smile, I begin to explain this to her, and mention that she can always buy an SD card and move her photos onto that and hey presto, problem solved. 

Nope, she wants a refund. We're back onto that. I tell her I'm going to go and speak to my manager, I go upstairs and we laugh at her, the usual. But he still comes back down with me to back me up because she's getting pretty horrible and we then spend another ten minutes or so trying to convince her that literally all we can do is send her perfectly working phone off for repair. She's now telling us she's going to go to Trading Standards, quoting the Consumer Rights Act at us, basically she's the biggest clich√© going. Unreal.

Eventually she admits defeat. But she still wants it ""repaired"". So I sit her down and start to take some details. 

&gt;""Why do you want my details?"" 

I am literally on the edge here. 

Eventually she tells me her first name. I start to type it in (she can see the screen) as Gill, and then she says ""no you stupid girl, it's spelled J... I... L... L"" (speaking slowly). I raise my eyes to her and give her a big sickly sweet smile and apologise profusely. I then ask her for her surname. 

&gt;""Let's see if you can spell THIS right, shall we?""

At which point I sit back and I say ""I'm sorry but I'm not going to serve you"".

She goes bright red and starts sputtering. Kicking off, calling me thick, rude, etc etc. My manager comes over and tells her calmly to leave. 

&gt;""I'm taking this all the way to the top!"" 

&gt;""Feel free, but please leave."""
"""You think that's acceptable?""


I work in a grocery store and the bane of my existence is people putting their grocery baskets away incorrectly.
We have a pile for them to be stacked onto, but people don't care, it's usually left alone while their baskets are placed to the side, or inconveniently in a way that hinders anyone else's basket.

Last Friday, a mother comes in and does just that. She places her basket into the pile halfway, with one half in and another half out, making the pile look awful.

Her 7 year old daughter sees her do this, and stares at the basket. She turns to her mother and loudly says ""What is that? You think that's acceptable?""
Her mother sheepishly fixed the basket and that girl became my hero."
"I'm five minutes into open and I had to call the police.


Hi, small mall board game store again. This one happened about an hour ago. (We're allowed to browse the net when no one's around)

So I got in at 9:45, cause we open at 10. I do my thing, vacuum, make some coffee you know the usual. Ten rolls around and I open my gate and go behind the counter to wait for the early comers (We don't pick up till about 1.)

So here I am checking my counter and I hear these two ladies coming down the hall. They stop about fifteen feet from my door and are SCREAMING at one another about how one slept with the other's husband. They start to FIST FIGHT next to the fountain.

One rips off the other's weave and I'm already reaching for the phone to call security. Next thing I know ONE OF THEM HAS A KNIFE AND IS THREATENING THE OTHER. I told security who told me to call the police while they rushed to the scene.

THE MALL HAS BEEN OPEN FOR FIVE MINUTES.

Edit: Time frame I didn't realize what time it was when I posted this. 

Edit to my Edit: A Few typos also RIP inbox lol. Really though it was insane"
