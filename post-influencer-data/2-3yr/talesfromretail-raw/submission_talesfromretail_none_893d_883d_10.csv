"""Last time I checked only doctors made $4 a minute.""


This happened a few years ago when I worked in a bead shop. We did jewelry repair too. Mostly simple stuff like reattaching clasps, restringing beads, or pearl knotting. Occasionally, when we weren't busy we would do repairs on the spot. Our minimum charge for any repair was $4 plus the cost of the materials.


So one day a lady comes in and she needs this necklace repaired ASAP because she wants to wear it that night at a dinner party. I saw that the necklace just needed the clasp reattached, which is something I can do in under a minute. I told her the store policy and said I could fix it for her while she waited. She seemed cool with that, so I grabbed a jump ring and reattached the clasp for her.


I rang her up and she took her necklace, leaving without a word.


The next day we got a call from the lady asking to talk to ""the manager"". She told the bead shop owner she was upset about having to pay $4 for the jewelry repair because I fixed it in under a minute. Her words, ""Last time I checked only doctors made $4 a minute.""


It's something you didn't know how to do lady. I did it quickly because I've done it five hundred and sixtytwo million times. If you didn't want it fixed professionally then do it your damn self."
"""FINE"" does not, in fact, mean things are fine


I've worked at a cute, family-owned ice cream shop in New York for around 5 years now. It's mostly alright, I get to work with close friends, but the customers have always been a little... much. (I have so many stories to share now that I've found this sub)

Anyway, it's important to note that we are right along a popular intersection. It gets pretty busy, busy enough that you can't just rush across the street to get to the other side, you've really gotta wait by the crosswalk.

One day, myself and my coworker (he will be CW and I will be, uh, ME) were working a night shift, 4 pm to 11 pm, and our first customer was a dad with his kid (dad will be DAD, kid will be KID.)

&gt;DAD: ""Tell the nice lady what you want.""

&gt;KID: ""Cherry!!!""

&gt;ME: ""Okay! What size should I get you?""

&gt;DAD: ""He'll take a small.""

I go ahead and make the order. Hand it to them, and it's a nice idea out, so they're sitting outside our store sharing it. 10 minutes later, the dad comes back.

&gt;DAD: ""He hated this. Can we get a different flavor?""

I look down to see the ice cream is... 2/3 finished. There are maybe five dainty spoonfuls left.

&gt;ME: ""I can scoop you another ice cream, but I can't just give it to you for free, if that's what you're asking.""

&gt;DAD: ""WHY NOT? He HATED it.""

&gt;ME: ""Sir, most of it is gone.""

&gt;DAD: ""Just put the rest of it back, and give us another flavor.""

At this point, I'm just staring at the dude, completely unsure of how else to explain this to him. My coworker steps in. He's a big dude, pretty intimidating, so I'm hoping that maybe the dad will listen to him.

&gt;CW: ""Sir, if you ate the ice cream, we can't give it back. It's technically contaminated. We can scoop you more, but you do have to pay for it, I'm sorry.""

&gt;DAD: ""... FINE.""

Dad proceeds to grab the ice cream off the counter where he had previously left it, He turns, and with a triumphant ""hhhYYUUUHHH!"" sound, HURLS the rest of the ice cream into oncoming traffic. It hits the ground, splatters, and proceeds to get run over.

His child SCREAMS, attempts to run after the ice cream, and nearly gets splattered himself by oncoming cars. His dad grabbed him in the nick of time, and turned back to us, only to yell.

&gt;DAD: ""You could've gotten my kid killed. Thanks for that.""

And then he leaves.

Came back next week.

"""Wii U games cannot play in a Switch. DISCS ARE NOT CARTRIDGES...""


Hey guys! Another tale from the video game shop! I haven't posted in a while, not many weirdos lately.

This guy came in and wanted a Switch. Pretty normal. He got Breath of the Wild for WiiU and asked if it would play.

Me: No sir. The Wii U will only use optical discs. The Switch uses small cartridges. The exact game is on the Switch, with better performance. 

SG (Switch Guy): Oh. I'll buy this. *holds up WiiU copy*

I rang him up, knowing that he would be back. He did come back.

SG: This game you sold me doesn't work.

Me: Sir, I told you that the WiiU games can't play on a Switch.

SG: I wanna refund.

Me: I can also swap it out with a brand-new copy, for the Switch. I can't give you $60 since you already opened it. It will be taken back as a preowned game. 

SG: Never MIND! *storms out*

Customers are weird. 


EDIT:

I left some details out because I did not think they would be important. I was wrong.

I informed him OVER AND OVER AND OVER again about the copy he was buying. I said the same thing, so I did not want to drag on the post. 

He still said ""It'll work"" the times I said it. 

I am NOT a rude, lazy and fat, or bad worker. I do my job and I do it right.
