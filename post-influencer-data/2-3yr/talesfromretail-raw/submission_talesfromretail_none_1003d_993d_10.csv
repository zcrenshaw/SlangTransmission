"""No... Not right now.""


Lady was talking to a friend of hers while making eye contact with me the whole time, I was on the till. Her friend asked her what she was doing,""I'm discarding what I don't want."" She was leaving miscellaneous food items on the Jewelry counter, and then promptly got in my line. I asked her, ""Can you bring me those items you just discarded on the Jewelry?"" I don't like my store looking like a disaster. She snakily replies, ""No... Not right now, I have places to be.""(which is a big, fuck no! to me) She places her items on my counter, as I just stand there looking at her. She asks if I'm going to ring her up, I reply, ""No... Not right now."" I step out from behind the till, walk slowly over to the Jewelry counter and pick up the items in question. I take my time putting them in the returns cart. Nothing else is said for the transaction. 

tl;dr: Don't be a bitch to customer service while drinking your juice in the hood."
"The One Time I Talked Back


Okay, I haven't worked in retail in quite awhile, and unfortunately don't have any really interesting stories that you all haven't read a million times, besides one that I'm still unashamedly proud of today.

At the time, I was a shift lead at a gas station, which basically meant I got paid $0.50 more to do twice as much work as I had as a cashier. But, it was a franchise run by the owner, his daughter, and her husband, and I knew all of them really well. The husband was the GM, and he was fantastic and actually taught me a lot about the inventory and sales side of the business! But I digress.

I almost always worked the Sunday afternoon shifts by myself, and this particular Sunday I had come in a few hours early as our morning shift had decided that working at a gas station was beneath them, so in I was called to take over. While I was getting over a cold. But I needed the money, so I loaded up on dayquil and packed as many cough drops as I could fit into my purse and hoped for the best. The whole day went surprisingly smoothly, everything had been quiet except for the occasional customer (lucky thing about being next to 2 busy roads, most people don't want to stick around and chat. Our regulars could be in and out in under 30 seconds if they knew what they were doing), until...

Me is me, and UM is Unreasonable Man.

&gt;UM: Hey, uh, something's wrong with your soda machine, this coke tastes like piss ass juice **(his actual words)**

&gt;Me: Oh, sorry about that, go ahead and get any of the others you want for free and I'll go check and see if the bib needs to be replaced. If you want you can wait up here to see if it's better!

&gt;UM: **(stares intently for a minute)** ...and?

&gt;Me: Oh, was there something else?

&gt;UM: Well I fucking hope there is, this is a gas station, the one fucking thing you should have is a working fucking drink machine. I'm asking, and what else are you going to do for me?

&gt;Me: Sir, I'm not charging you for the drink, our machine doesn't tell us when the bibs need to be replaced we just have to eyeball it and wait for one to go bad... Like I said, I am sorry bout that and I'll go check and replace it for you.

&gt;UM: Well fuck me, aren't you so nice, letting me drink this garbage for free. Give me your fucking name and your manager's number, let's call them and see what somebody who knows what customer service ACTUALLY is can do.

Now, at this point I don't know what got over me, I honestly don't. I never confronted customers because I usually just didn't care enough. Maybe it was the exhaustion or the cold medicine or something, but I just decided I'd had enough.

&gt;Me: Yeah, no I'm not gonna do that.

&gt;UM: **(eyes practically bulge out of his head)** WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

&gt;Me: Look, sir, I don't know what you expect to happen from calling my manager, but I'm sick and have been working at this place for the past 11 hours straight, and will be here for another 2 before my relief comes in. I don't want to deal with you, and neither does he. It's 8:30 at night, he's eating dinner with his family, I'm not bothering him with this because frankly it doesn't matter to him. You could literally never come back and nobody here would ever care. I know the manager and the owner personally and the worst that'll happen is they tell me I shouldn't have given you a free drink because that affects our sales. So yeah, I'm not gonna do that. Have a nice day.

Unreasonable Man said a few more choice swears, but then stormed off when I decided to just ignore him. Still have no idea what came over me, but damn if I'm not still proud of it."
"But I returned it…


I used to work in a video store. We had a woman call because we had charged her credit card for a DVD that was never returned. We had been calling her every day for 15 days and leaving messages warning her of the increasing late fees and that her card would be charged on day 16. When she got the Thank You for Paying The Late Fee And The Item Cost letter she finally called in to argue. I explained the charges and she proceeded to argue.

Customer (C): “But I returned it.”

Me: “We don’t have it here. Maybe you returned it to another store or another location?”

(C): “No, I dropped it in the mailbox.”

Me: “You.. mailed it to us? ”

(C): “Yes.” 

Me: “Like.. in an envelope? With stamps? ”

(C): “No. I just put it in the mailbox.”

Me: “You just put the DVD case in the mailbox? No envelope? No stamps? ”

(C): “Yeah”

Me: “That’s not how you mail things”.

(C): “But the case has your address on it. ”

Me: “But mail requires postage to be paid. Okay, anyways, we never got it. So it was never returned. So the late charges and replacement fee stand. ”

(C): ”BUT I RETURNED IT. ”

Me: “Ma’am, you ‘returned’ it like you left it in a field and called us 2 weeks later to say it’s in a field somewhere. When you rent an object  it is your responsibility to ensure it is returned to the business. We do not have our DVD, so you owe us money. ”

(C): ”Can’t you call Canada Post and get it from them? ”

Me: “Ma’am, I think you missed the ‘your responsibility’ part. If you call them and you manage to get the DVD back from them and bring it to us we can refund you the replacement cost. ”

(C): “And the late fees?”

Me: “No, it’s still late.”

(C): “But I returned it on time.”

Me: “I think we’re working with two different definitions of the word ‘returned’. We only consider an item returned when all components of the rental are returned, dvd, box, everything. Zero pieces of your rental are in our store. So it is not ‘returned’. Even if you were to find the dvd and return it right now, it would be crossing our threshold *two weeks later* than it should have been.”
