"""Some idiot put this cake's writing in cursive!""


In college, I worked for a floral shop that shared a space with a bakery. We had the space for both businesses to operate and it naturally was a good partnership. This story takes place near the end of my senior year. I was six weeks shy of graduating with two degrees. Although I cared about the stores and wanted them to do well, my nonsense-tolerance had dropped significantly. One day, a woman came to me for balloons for her son's 2nd birthday party. She had already picked up her cake.

Woman (grumpily tossing her balloon choices at me): Ugh, I can't believe the bakery. 

Me: Oh, is there something wrong?

Woman: Yes! LOOK at this cake! 

She opens the box. It's a nice looking cake, decorated with icing and trains. A scrolling script says: ""Happy 2nd Birthday Jackson!""

Me: ...

Woman: DON'T YOU SEE IT?! 

Me: I think it's a lovely ca-""

Woman: IT'S IN CURSIVE! WHY THE ***F#CK*** WOULD THEY PUT IT IN CURSIVE? HE'S TWO!

Me: Oh...well, it'll take me a couple minutes to fill these balloons. I bet you could take it back, and they could scrape off the old lettering, re-frost the blank space, and rewrite it for you. 

Woman (clearly hasn't heard a word I said): I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE IS SO STUPID TO THINK THIS IS OKAY! 

Me (yelling above her): CAN YOUR SON EVEN READ?! 

She immediately fell silent, blushed a deep purple, and was silent while I filled her balloons. She paid without a word.

"The dumbest shoplifting scheme that nearly succeeded


One more from the community college bookstore files.

We were getting ready for the rush at the start of the fall semester. Not many customers came in. Most of our work was just taking deliveries and organizing stock. We'd hired a lot of people for this which meant after we'd finish unpacking a delivery, there would be very little to do until the next one came.

I'm usually not one for chitchat unless there is ABSOLUTELY nothing to do and usually I find something to keep me busy. As I'm dusting shelves and straightening textbooks, these two girls walk into the store. They're each about 5ft tall, blonde, about 18; not something most people would find sketchy but the first thing I noticed was that they were both wearing empty backpacks - like flat to their backs empty...with the zippers open. One of my coworkers asks them if they need help finding something and one of them says ""No, we're just looking around. We don't go to this school.""

I'm still busy around the bookshelves when I notice that they've been in the store a weirdly long time. One of the girls is perusing the shelves and the other is at the front chatting with ALL 9 of my coworkers. I walk past a particular aisle and see the girl at the bookshelves shoving books into her backpack. She doesn't see me. Girl at the front, meanwhile is talking in the loudest most obnoxious way possible.

""Do you go to school here? COOL!!!!""
""Do YOU go to school here??? COOL!!!!""

To. Each. And. Every. One. Of. Them.

 I'm assuming the volume was meant to signal to her partner that all the staff were still distracted. And sadly it was working. I could NOT believe that 9 of my coworkers were having their attention monopolized by something so stupid.

I went to the back to tell the manager what was going on and he phoned campus police with a description and tells them they're still in the store. (We aren't allowed to confront shoplifters ourselves.) 

Soon after, the girls walk out - with their previously empty backpacks now dragging down past their asses.

We'd been hoping campus police would arrive in time but it seemed like they'd gotten away.

But they came back.

""Hey can you tell us where the exit is? We can't find our way out.""

They came to steal from a school they didn't go to whose bookstore is on the basement floor of a huge building and they didn't bother with an exit plan.

My manager decided to walk them to the exit. I phoned campus police again to tell them where they were headed and they met them at the door.

The stolen books were about $1200 altogether. Stealing $250+ is a felony here.

My manager then gave my coworkers an earful for missing something so obvious.
