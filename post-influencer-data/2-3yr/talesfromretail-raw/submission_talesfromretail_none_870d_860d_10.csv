0,"Two Chinese men and a translator enter a store.


I work at BBQ shop here in Australia, I've dealt with all kinds of customers in my 3 years of experience until today I had the most memorable experiences yet.

Today I had two Chinese men walk in and they looked to be in their early 20's or so. They walked around for a bit before I approached them and asked if they needed any help, it suddenly became clear they didn't know a word of english when one pulled out his phone and started using a translator. Soon fleshed out they were looking at a BBQ we have in stock and some accessories, after about 25 minutes going back and forth with the translator they had all they wanted. 
Normally this transaction only takes about 5-10 minutes on average but I didn't mind as we were all being patient with each other.

I rang up all the items and showed them a full break down of the items which total around $500. I had all the products ready to go in a pile next to the register when he finished paying. When it all finalised he leaned in to shake my hand and said in perfect english.

&gt; ""Oh, just so you know, we speak perfect fucking english mate""
 
Both these men erupt into laughter while I'm sitting shaking my head and laughing as well thinking how the fuck did I fall for it. After we all slowly regained ourselves one of the men leaned in and said how well I took it. May not seem all that funny in writing, but its totally made my week.

1,"How to mortify a tween kid


I work part time in a mid-sized retail store, pretty close to a local school, so we get a lot of school kids in around 12 buying snacks and candy and what not during recess. A lot of the same kids, so over time i've come to recognize a lot of them. One of the groups were quite loudly talking about dabbing, and about how fun it would be to see an employee dab while working.

I could have taken the easy route and just dabbed right there and made his day, but i didn't, and it would turn out to pay off.

A few days later the same group of kids come in, but this time with the dab-kid's mom as well. They're still talking about dabbing, and getting an employee to bad, probably hoping i overhear it. I was about to do it, but then their mom walks towards me, with the kind of mischevious grin only a mother can muster. The kid, the mom, and myself share a moment - we all know whats about to go down. The mother and i with mischievous grin, and the kid with a mortified look on his face.

""Wanna Dab with me?"" She plainly asks. 

I dab.

She dabs.

The kids friends are looking in awe.

dab-kid is mortified, then hangs his head in shame, as his friends start to laugh.

A plan that started out as a way to get a little bit of street cred suddenly backfired, as his friends watched his mom commit the ultimate act of embarrassment.

Made my day though."
2,"""Last time I checked only doctors made $4 a minute.""


This happened a few years ago when I worked in a bead shop. We did jewelry repair too. Mostly simple stuff like reattaching clasps, restringing beads, or pearl knotting. Occasionally, when we weren't busy we would do repairs on the spot. Our minimum charge for any repair was $4 plus the cost of the materials.


So one day a lady comes in and she needs this necklace repaired ASAP because she wants to wear it that night at a dinner party. I saw that the necklace just needed the clasp reattached, which is something I can do in under a minute. I told her the store policy and said I could fix it for her while she waited. She seemed cool with that, so I grabbed a jump ring and reattached the clasp for her.


I rang her up and she took her necklace, leaving without a word.


The next day we got a call from the lady asking to talk to ""the manager"". She told the bead shop owner she was upset about having to pay $4 for the jewelry repair because I fixed it in under a minute. Her words, ""Last time I checked only doctors made $4 a minute.""


It's something you didn't know how to do lady. I did it quickly because I've done it five hundred and sixtytwo million times. If you didn't want it fixed professionally then do it your damn self."
