"If you're rude and refuse to pay, we have the right to refuse services, even after they're done


So I was in the shop one day, a customer was in getting some keys copied, nice and simple job. Suddenly while I've got the machine running, some shirtless guy comes in looking really frantic. I tell him I'll be just a minute longer, then I finish the keys, and send the first customer on his way.

&gt; Frantic dude: ""jeez, took you long enough, I need you to come unlock my car""

I'm already a little annoyed since its almost closing time, but I just figure he's got a kid/dog/groceries in the car and give him the benefit of the doubt. 

&gt; Me: ""No problem, where is it?""
&gt; FD: ""A couple miles that way, my girlfriend drove me over here. You can follow us to it.""

I get some info from him, the kind of car it is, his name/number/address in case we get separated, etc. 

&gt; FD: ""My phone's in the car so if you call it I won't answer""
&gt; Me: ""Then how about your girlfriend's number?""
&gt; FD: ""Hers is in there too""

Well ok then

Since it's pretty much closing time, I just go ahead and set the alarm and lock the doors as I leave, he doesn't like this and starts saying how I'm taking forever. Yeah yeah, take a chill pill, 5 extra seconds won't kill you.

I get in my truck and follow him out there, when we get there I grab my tools and head to the car. Surprisingly, there's nothing in there except for the keys on the seat. No kids or dogs, so now I'm just hoping it's actually their car. 

&gt; FD: ""You'd better not mess up my doors, this is a classic""

Yeah, a classic Ford POS

I open it up in about 10 seconds and check the insurance card, and yup it's their car. I pick up the keys and go over to him, tell him it's $40, and he just looks at me dumbfounded.

&gt; FD: ""Wait you mean I have to pay for this?""

Ummm, yeah?

&gt; Me: ""Yes sir, we charge a service call when we have to go out to the location.""
&gt; FD: ""Well I'm not paying for that, you did it in 10 seconds, I could've done that myself if I'd have known""
&gt; Me: ""Well I'm sorry, but I can't do this for free.""

I could've, but there was no real urgency like a life endangered, plus he was rude about the whole thing. We normally would just bill someone in the situation, but we've been burned too many times, so we'll only do that for companies.

&gt; FD: ""I'm not paying for that, I don't have any money""
&gt; Me: ""Then if you think you can do it yourself, go for it.""

I throw his keys in the car, lock the doors, shut it behind me, and leave. 
I get home about ten minutes later, then after probably an hour he calls back.

&gt; FD: ""I can't get it open, come back and open my car again""
&gt; Me: ""I can go out again, but I'll have to charge you for two service calls.""
&gt; FD: ""F- you A-hole, I'm not paying you 80 bucks""
&gt; Me: ""Then you can call out *other locksmith nearby*, I'm sure he'll be happy to help y-"" *click*

I didn't tell him, but they charge $100 to unlock cars. 

Never heard back from him"
"""You can't un-cut keys, ma'am""


So I'm a locksmith, I both go out on calls and stay at our shop where we sell locks, keys, safes, all kinds of stuff. It's just me and my dad that work here.

This happened a few years ago but you usually remember the really fun customers. We were doing some cleanup around the shop when a middle aged woman comes in and slams a (rather expensive) key down and says she wants to return it. CL for crazy lady and M for me

&gt; M: ""Is there a problem with it?""

&gt; CL: ""No, you made this key for me when I lost my car keys last month, but I found my keys so I don't need this one anymore""

&gt; M: ""I'm sorry but if there's nothing wrong with the key we can't refund you.""

I said it was an expensive key earlier, it was for a mid-2000s Mitsubishi, and it had a remote head. The chip keys we sell are $20 plus programming, and the remote heads are more depending on the make/model of the car. If I remember correctly her key was around 80 for the key itself, not counting the service charge to go make it when she lost hers. Total cost was somewhere around 220, which she wanted the full refund of for whatever reason.

&gt; CL: ""Well can't you just un-cut the key and sell it to someone else?""

&gt; M: ""No ma'am, we can't un-cut keys. Plus it's been programmed to your car so we couldn't reuse it anyway.""

&gt; CL: ""Go get your manager so I can speak with him""

My dad is around the corner in the back room and heard the whole thing, so as she said this he poked his head around the corner with a chipper ""Hi! What can I do for you?""

He then gives the same answers, pretty much word for word, until she's visibly angry that we won't give her 200 bucks

&gt; CL: ""is the owner here? I'm not leaving without some kind of refund""

My dad's more amused than irritated by this point so he just says ""Sure, let me get him for you"" and heads into the back.

He's back there for a few seconds, then he pokes his head around the corner, this time wearing his reading glasses, and says ""Hi! What can I do for you?""

&gt; CL, fuming now: ""Do you think I'm an idiot?""

Me internally: ""yes, a little bit""

Me externally: ""No, not at all. Unfortunately neither of the three of us will be unable to give you a refund though, seeing as it's been over 30 days and there's no actual issues with the key. I'm sorry we couldn't help you any further.""

&gt; CL: ""Well I hope you're happy that you just lost a customer""

Then she leaves, forgetting to pick up her key sitting on the counter. About 5 minutes later she walks back in without saying a word, picks up the key, and leaves. But not before my dad chimed in with a ""have a nice day!""

TL;DR: lady wants a refund on a key we made for her because she found her old ones, she can't understand that we can't un-cut keys and gets mad.

Edit: I have more stories, a couple more from the shop, but a few from going out on calls too. I'll share if you're interested, not sure of the mods would be cool with the service call stories though

Edit 2 because some people can't seem to grasp that both services and goods cost money:

Service call = $40, this is the basic local ""gas and services"" charge. An extra $10 is added on for every 10 miles away, so her total service call was 50

Fitting a key to a car when they've lost it = $35 usually, and this involves either peeking inside the lock and reading the pins, or taking apart the lock. In this case it was the latter, so we're charging for time spent also.

Key programming = $40, this is a set price because some cost more, some cost less, and we only charge to program keys that require us to hook up our machine(which by the way costs several thousand dollars, plus several hundred per year) to their car.

And then there's the price of the key itself, which I mentioned at the beginning of the post.

So yup, sorry if you can't grasp that things aren't free"
"17 year old leg hair??


So I work in a supermarket as a cashier part time, and the other night we had an obviously drunk guy coming in to buy more alcohol. 

The supervisor really didn't want to serve him, so the bastard left it to me. Sigh. Our policy is not to sell drunk people alcohol, but our supervisor for some reason has no problem with it, and since she's the one to authorise the transaction, she takes all the blame. 

Anyway, at the end of the transaction, I asked for ID. In my country, the legal age is 18, but we *must* ask for ID for anyone who looks under 25 or we're not legally allowed to sell it. 

Me: ""Do you have ID with you tonight, sir?""

Him (patting his pockets): ""oh I think I left my wallet at home. But I have some cash"" (shoves it at me) 

Me: ""sorry, man, I can't sell you this beer if you don't have ID. Store policy.""

Him: ""but I'm clearly over 18. Why the big fuss? I just want my box of beer."" 

Me: ""I know, and I'd love to let you have it, but you're definitely under 25 so I have to see your ID before I can sell it to you. You can go and get it and come back later if you like.""

Him: ""what? No. I want my beer now. I'm over 18!""

Me: ""I know, and I'm sorry, but I need your ID first."" 

He backs away and starts rolling up his pant legs. I looked over at my supervisor in disbelief, and just got a smirk in return. 

The customer, having successfully got his pant legs above his knees, stretched his leg onto the counter, pulled at his leg hair and slurred, ""*Does this look like the leg hair of a fucking 17-year-old to you?*""

I tried to ignore my supervisor, who was splitting his sides, and asked him politely to leave before I had to call security. 

Seriously, though, wtf? Since when is leg hair a form of ID? 

**Edit: So I said that we have to prove people are drunk. Not true. My manager, for some reason, has no problem with serving drunk people, and she authorises all transactions so the onus is actually on her if she gets caught.**"
