0,"""Wii U games cannot play in a Switch. DISCS ARE NOT CARTRIDGES...""


Hey guys! Another tale from the video game shop! I haven't posted in a while, not many weirdos lately.

This guy came in and wanted a Switch. Pretty normal. He got Breath of the Wild for WiiU and asked if it would play.

Me: No sir. The Wii U will only use optical discs. The Switch uses small cartridges. The exact game is on the Switch, with better performance. 

SG (Switch Guy): Oh. I'll buy this. *holds up WiiU copy*

I rang him up, knowing that he would be back. He did come back.

SG: This game you sold me doesn't work.

Me: Sir, I told you that the WiiU games can't play on a Switch.

SG: I wanna refund.

Me: I can also swap it out with a brand-new copy, for the Switch. I can't give you $60 since you already opened it. It will be taken back as a preowned game. 

SG: Never MIND! *storms out*

Customers are weird. 


EDIT:

I left some details out because I did not think they would be important. I was wrong.

I informed him OVER AND OVER AND OVER again about the copy he was buying. I said the same thing, so I did not want to drag on the post. 

He still said ""It'll work"" the times I said it. 

I am NOT a rude, lazy and fat, or bad worker. I do my job and I do it right.

1,"""here's a picture of her, what size does she wear?""


Just remembered this gem from Christmas, Lots of grandparents wanting to buy shoes for grandkids. LOTS of not knowing anything about the kid in question. 

&gt;Grandma (GM): hi, I need these for my granddaughter, do you think she would like them?

&gt;me: Sure, I think so, they're simple, and will go with a lot of outfits, and we have a 60 day return policy so if she doesn't like them they can always be exchanged

&gt;GM: Okay, this is a picture of her, what size does she wear?

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I can't possibly tell someones shoe size from a photo. Could you possibly call her and ask? 

&gt;GM: No! It has to be a SURPRISE!!!

&gt;Me: Okay, well I don't want to take a guess and be completely wrong, and have her feelings get hurt.  (This has happened before where a guy has bought his GF shoes and she came in offended because ""He thinks I have Fat feet!"" )

&gt;GM: Well she's 22, and a bit taller than you! 

&gt;me: Ma'am, that doesnt actually help me at all, I know people 4 inches shorter than me who wear shoes twice my size. Age and height are not relative to foot size. 

&gt;Gm: Well what am I supposed to do!? 

&gt;Me: well, as I said, you can call her and ask, or you could always get her a gift card and let her come in herself that way you are 100% sure that she gets exactly what she wants. 

&gt;Gm: Gift card! thats not a present! 

&gt;Me: well, If you do a gift card and then put it with some candy she likes, or some accessories, it can be! 

&gt;GM: oh.... I guess? What kind of candy does she like? 

&gt;Me: well, I have no idea, because I've never met her. 

&gt;Gm: right. yeah... yeah.


Repeat this about 500x over the month of december. "
2,"Druggies don't like Windex


Long time lurker, first time posting. Quite a short story but wanted to share it. 

So about 3 years ago I had just started working at a butcher shop in my local mall. As the newbie I was sent out front to clean our glass display and deal with all the customers who couldn't tell we were obviously closing (we closed at 6, other shops at 7). Only equiped with a piece of cloth and a bottle of windex I began my duties.

About half way through the job I hear someone screaming:

""YOU'VE USED TO MUCH WINDEX YOU F---ING C---""

Taken back by surprise I look up to see the local mall druggie approaching full speed with the mall security tailing behind. As he gets closer he takes a swing at me which I dodge, thus throwing him off balance and sending him flying into a trashcan. As he gets up he turns to look at me and give his last final words of wisdom:

""Stay in school.""

Before finally being tackled by security.

And that's how I got the nickname Windex Kid."
