"My town banned plastic bags. Some customers were not happy.


I'm an assistant Front End Manager (recently promoted to full time, and given a bit more authority as a result) in a chain grocery store, and as the title says, my town banned plastic grocery bags. The ban went into effect yesterday, and I had to explain it to customers. This is the story of one particularly unpleasant one.

I was working the close shift and one of my cashiers called me over at the request of the customer, an older lady. She asked me to tell her why there were no plastic bags at the register (after the fact I asked the cashier; he had tried to explain it multiple times and she wasn't buying it.) I explained that town law no longer permitted us to use them. ""So what am I supposed to do then?"" I pointed to the stacks of paper on the register and told her she's also welcome to bring in reusable bags.

""Well I don't like paper, it's too hard to carry. I certainly didn't vote for the change.""

""Well, ma'am, we also have reusable bags for sale if you'd like to use those instead.""

""I'm not paying for bags, that's ridiculous. I want plastic. So what are you going to do for me?""

""Nothing."" *Cue shocked look, and the loud gasp of someone who's never been told no in her life.* ""If you won't accept paper, and you won't buy a bag, what do you expect me to do? Break town law and give you plastic? I mean, we can just put the unbagged groceries in your cart but there's nothing else we can do."" So she asks to see *my* manager... Who tells her the same thing.

She did settle on paper, bagged lightly to make it easier to carry, but glared at us the whole time. As she was leaving, she said ""I'm shopping at [competitor] next time, they know how to take care of their customers.""

""They won't be using plastic either!"" I replied, as she walked out angrily.

My manager actually told me I handled it well, so I felt pretty good since it was basically the first time I got to use my new position's authority to essentially tell off a customer instead of caving to their demands."
"I wasn't even mad. I was more impressed she held onto a receipt for that long


So this happened fairly early into my promotion as ASM for a retail store. At the time, I was still kind of unsure about some of my decisions, but I knew for a fact I could not help this woman.


A woman came into the store with like 8 bags full of deco pillows. I wasn't looking forward to this, as our deco pillow section was super full, but I liked doing returns so I wasn't upset or anything. I'll be M, the customer will be T.


&gt;T: HI!!!! I'd like to return these pillows please!

&gt;M: Were you going to do any other shopping with us today? I'd be happy to hold those for you if you'd like to process all transactions at once :)

&gt;T: Not today! I've just been meaning to return these for a long time

&gt;M: No problem! Do you have the receipt?


She spent 5 minutes digging through her purse to find the receipt. She hands it to me and the date on it was FROM FOUR YEARS AGO.


&gt;M: Oh gosh, I'm sorry ma'am, but this receipt is too old, I can't do this return for you.

&gt;T: You're still going to return it though, right?

&gt;M: No, I'm sorry, I can't. For one, we have a fairly strict 30 day return policy, and also this receipt is literally so old the computer won't be able to process this.

&gt;I scanned the receipt and showed her the error message


I was usually pretty generous with the return policy to nice customers. I would have returned all 8 bags of pillows had the receipt been as old as 6 months. But 4 years?! Also, this is where she gets a little unreasonable.

&gt;T: No. Listen here. I drove all the way out here on my day off to return these damn things. You're going to return them or risk losing a customer. 

&gt;M: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I literally cannot process a return on a receipt that is four years old. Our return policy is 30 days.

&gt;T: I WAS PREGNANT. You don't honestly expect a pregnant woman to carry all these bags in here and drive all the way here.

&gt;M: You were pregnant for four years?


That comment kinda made her lose it and she resorted to calling me names and threatening to call corporate. I gave her the corporate number and offered to help carry the bags to her car. She stormed out yelling she'd never come back. 


Never heard back on that one."
"That time I just decided to speak another language to a customer


This happened pretty early in my retail career. I’m a fairly big introvert and have social anxiety so at this point I wasn’t used to having to talk to complete strangers, let alone be the person starting the conversation.


My store attracts a lot of foreign people and I’m not sure why. Anyways, this elderly woman came in one afternoon and was browsing our food section. I walked up and asked her if she needed any help. I noticed she had a very thick accent while she said she’s just looking, so I used all the strength I had to ask her where she’s from in what I thought was her mother tongue, German. It would be really funny at this point to say I assumed wrong, but lucky for me I was right. This is a part of the conversation we had, all translated from German:


&gt; M: Are you German? Where are you from?


&gt; T: *face lights up* I am! I was born in Berlin. 


&gt; M: Interesting! Do you have many friends who speak German with you?


&gt; T: I do not :(  How long have you been learning German?


&gt; M: Not very long! I started a couple of years ago, but I stopped a few months ago. Sorry, I’m sure my accent it terrible


&gt; T: It is! But that’s okay! I am just happy to have a conversation!


We ended up talking for a while, mostly about my cats. She really liked cats. 


She thanked me in English as she was leaving and got a little teary eyed. She came back pretty regularly for a while and would always ask about me and talk to me in German. I had to transfer stores pretty suddenly one day though so I haven’t seen her in a long time.
