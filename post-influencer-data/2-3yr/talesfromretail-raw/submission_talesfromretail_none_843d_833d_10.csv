"Why closed registers need to stay closed


During this time, I’m working in the men’s department in my store. Typically because of the lack of foot traffic in this department, it’s registers stay closed. Now the registers are blocked off and have signs stating they are closed and to head to another department.

But no one reads. So I end having to tell nearly everyone who stands there obliviously that it’s closed. at this point me and my manager are setting up signature assortments for Fourth of July when I see an old couple walk up to the terminal. 

OL = Old lady, me=Me

Giving an internal exasperated sigh, I tell them it’s closed.


&gt; OL: *Angry Sigh* “Where are we suppose to go then? He has bad knee and can’t walk that far.”


Now I’m all for opening the terminal for the sake of customer service. But the attitude she starts giving off ticks me off.
I give a quick look to my manager who’s looking to see what I’m gonna do.

&gt; Me: “ I can open the register for you. “

&gt; OL: “THANK YOU”

Setting the business date and counting up the starting float. I check them out. Not wanting to get off task too long I silently pray that no one gets in the line.

Next thing I know I get a line of customers

FML

Next customer comes up, she wants to split her transaction up to use up both her coupons. 
That’s fine. It’s time consuming to do so, but still it’s fine.

I get through the second lady fine. But instead of leaving immediately. She sticks around to look for her keys in her purse.

Blocking the ability for another person to checkout. 

I ask if she can move so I can take some one else and she exclaims she needs to empty her purse to look for her keys.

I wait five minutes hoping she finds them quick, but I quickly lose patience  with the building line of customers

I move over to another terminal and open it.

By this point all four terminals are open with associates from other departments manning them to quell the building line.

Except one new guy that I’m training. To which I’ll mention never got an assigned associate number for the terminal.

Not his fault, but it only adds to the frustration as he needs help getting setup while I take customers

FML

Cue difficult customer three.

Rudely she states.

&gt; Cu: “ Are you open?”

&gt; Me: “Yes Ma’am.”

&gt; Cu: “Are you sure?”

&gt; Me: *Internally* “You can walk your ass to another register if you keep up that attitude.”

&gt; Me: “Yes Ma’am”

She’s buying a pair of sunglasses and they come to about $14.

She pays with a hundred.

Meanwhile I only have a hundred in fives, ones, and a ten.

FML

&gt; Cu: “Do you have any fifties to give me?”

&gt; Me: “ No Ma’am, I only have small bills.”

&gt; Cu: “Okay” *Still pays with $100*

Great now I’m gonna get cleaned out.

I get all my tens, all my fives, and most of my ones, and give her the change.

&gt; Cu: “ Ohhhhh, that’s a lot of change. Don’t you have anything bigger?”

&gt; Me: “No Ma’am.”

&gt; Cu: “Can’t you get some bigger bills from there?” 

She points to my coworker’s register.

&gt; Me: “No ma’am, it would cause a variance.”

&gt; Cu: “Okay... I’ll pay with my card then. I’m not taking that much change.” *Pushes change towards me*

Are you fucking kidding me!

&gt; Me: “I already processed the purchase miss. I’ll have to return it.”

&gt; Cu: “Oh, okay.”


One return and a purchase later and All the customers are gone. I’m stuck with closing all the terminals.

I need a drink.

Edit: Well I never expected this much traction. Thanks for all the support despite the frustrations I had."

So, this story happened 3-4 years ago, but I completely forgot about it until recently. 

I used to work in the paint department of a big box hardware store. It was a really slow day, and I had already finished most of the stuff I had to do for the day, from what I remember, there was some pretty heavy snow, and people were pretty much just traveling for emergency needs, and there's no such thing as a paint emergency. So, anyway, this guy wanders by my department, and he doesn't seem to be all there. He gets about halfway past my desk, and he stops, and stares at The paint swatches. He comes closer to them, and starts inspecting them, like, really closely. I just think ""whatever, guy might either just like color, or wants to get a good one."" We try not to bother people during the color selection process, since that's all personal preference. 

So, this guy is there for almost an hour, going from color collection to color collection, and he has his phone out, and appears to be taking notes, but doesn't take any swatches off the wall, which is weird, but, again, I've seen weirder. Then he heads back to where we keep the unmixed paint (side note: if you're buying paint, don't grab the can for the employee, it might be a different one than what you grabbed, and then we have to put it back. I get the idea, but please, we don't even know what it will be sometimes, we just have a guess, and then the computer tells us). 

He comes up to me after about half an hour and he asks me ""hey, man. Those boxes up in the high shelves, do they have more paint in them?"" 

Me: Yes. 

Him: How many are in there?

Me: Four gallons to a box. 

Him: oh, alright. 

And then he goes back to the paint. 

I could tell he was high by the way he was talking, very slowly, incredibly delayed reactions, and his eyes were super red. Why he came here high during a blizzard was, and still is, a mystery. But I finally realized what he was doing. *He was counting the number of  colors, and how many paint cans we have.* 

He came back up after another fifteen minutes. 

Him: Hey, so... There are way more colors than there are paint cans. What happens if someone wants a color that you don't have? 

Me: Well, I make the colors. 

Him (in all seriousness): Are you a wizard!?

Me: ... Yes... 

Him: Don't worry, color wizard, your secret is safe with me. 

He then wandered off, never to be seen again. I still have many questions, none of which will ever be answered, but at least I was blessed by the high color counter. "
"It tastes like pen.


This is my first post here. I’ve owned a small candy and ice cream shop in a Podunk town in Utah for 15 years, I have dealt with many strange people but this remains my favorite story. This happened around 5 years ago.

A young girl, maybe 11 or 12, comes in and purchases a novelty candy pen. [Like this] (http://imgur.com/TVotHYb) It's a pen on one side and a sucker on the other. It lights up when you press the tip of the pen down.

About an hour or so later she comes back in with ink all over her hands and all around her mouth. I immediately think something has gone terribly wrong until she says ""Excuse me, I just bought this here and it tastes like pen!""  She places the pen on the counter for me to inspect.  She's dissembled the pen side, pulled the ink tube out and sucked it dry. 

I kindly show her the sucker on the other side and inform her that’s she eating an actual pen.

""Oh."" Then she turns around and walks out. 

Man, I fucking died. 

I might have felt bad if this was a little kid but she was clearly old enough to recognize a damn pen. I’m completely terrified of this next generation of humans being raised.
