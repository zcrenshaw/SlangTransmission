"""I put the chips on the baby""


I was bagging groceries last night when a lady came through with a baby in a car seat in the basket of her cart. She had a LOT of groceries that I'm assuming she'd had under and around the car seat, so when I bagged them I was putting them back under and around the car seat. I wasn't sure where else to put them if not there, right? It's not like I could put them on top of the baby, right? 


Well. As I'm placing stuff carefully under Baby, Baby's mom says ""oh hon, you can just put some of this stuff on top of him"" and pats the canopy.


The phrase ""but ma'am that's a *baby*"" almost escapes me but I choke it down, nod, and continue putting stuff under the baby, under the cart, in the seat of the cart, etc. At this point the cashier (my favorite cashier) is trying and failing not to laugh at both the absurdity of me being told to put groceries on a baby, and my increasingly desperate attempts at finding places for the bags.


I got all but a bag of chips squared away, and there was just no more room, so as they walked away I set the bag of chips on top of the car seat, turned back to the cashier and whispered in horror ""I put the chips on the baby."" Which I believe is the most absurd thing I've said on the job so far."
"I've got a nice one, for once.


I work in a big box retail store. A few months ago, a man came in and wouldn't speak to me. Wouldn't answer any questions, wouldn't look me in the eyes - again, I work in an unusual part of town, and I just assumed he was being a jerk. I know he could hear me - he responded properly to swipe his card and followed through with the pin pad questions.

Again, I just brushed it off, no big thing. Twenty minutes later he came back in and bought a pack of gum, looked me in the eyes, and said, ""I'm sorry about my behavior earlier. I have panic attacks, and this was too much for me. I called my wife because I felt so terrible, and she told me to come back in and apologize."" I told him no biggie, I understand, I've had them my entire life.

But even sweeter - 2, 3 months go by. I see so many customers that I generally dont remember faces. This man and his teenage son come through my line yesterday and he says, ""You don't remember me, but I remember you. I had a panic attack and you understood. I try to come through your line every time you're here.""

Idk, sometimes there is a silver lining in retail."
"Yes Ma'am I know they are called ""Animal"" crackers but...


I'll keep it short and sweet...
This lady comes up to one of our registers to checkout and begins asking the cashier about one of our products:

Lady: These animal crackers are so adorable! Do you know if they are safe for all animals or just dogs and cats?

The Cashier just laughs a bit thinking she was joking... only to realize the lady has gone totally deadpan.

Lady: Well are they or not?! I don't want to get any of my animals sick!  

Cashier: N-no Ma'am they're not... They're for people...

Lady: *rolls her eyes* Then why would they call them ANIMAL crackers?!  

Cashier: Because... they're shaped like animals.

Lady: WELL THAT'S JUST MISLEADING! Your store needs to label things like this better! How else is anyone suppose to know what they're for?!

...

She did not buy the crackers."
