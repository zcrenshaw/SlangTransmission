"Still in shock


Sorry but I have to make this quick, I ran out on break after this happened and had to post it here. Ltr;ftp and all that. Mobile too. 

So I work at a mostly west coast grocery chain (the one with near godlike status in Hawaii I'm told) and as we all know, the holiday season is approaching and us retail drones have to work on overdrive to get through the insane crowds all wanting our stuff. 

I was working register this past hour, and while our store is great about a lot of things, unfortunately we are too small to have baggers. This often clogs up lines as customers come through with large cartfuls of food and stand there daydreaming as we scramble to bag and ring through items quickly enough not to get screamed at. 

The way our registers are positioned, we have two cashiers back to back in pairs, so if one has no people in their line we just turn around and help our partner bag. Obviously this wasn't happening today, as every register had at least 5 people waiting for their turn. 
So a customer comes through my line and I start my spiel (how are you, how was your weekend, blah di blah blah), when I see someone come stand next to me and start bagging. I turn, and there is a nicely dressed woman quickly grabbing items and bagging them with the efficiency most of us only dream of having. She finishes with my customer and spins on the spot and starts helping my coworker. 
I glance at the lines and they are looking just as confused as I am. 
One calls out ""did you get the bagging bug?""

""No,"" she replies, ""I'm late in picking up my kid so I thought I'd speed this along."" 

So there you have it, instead of complaining and tapping her foot, this random woman became the hero of the day for our two lines, simply by helping out two over stressed retail workers. 

Just had to say, yeah, the holidays are tough, but there are some gems hidden in the rubble. 

Edit: I just got off work, and holy shit this blew up fast. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to read this!"
"It's 24/7 emergency service. This is not an emergency, sir.


So as stated in previous stories, we advertise 24/7 emergency service. This is stuff like keys locked in cars/houses, lost keys, stuff like that.

So yesterday morning I wake up to my phone ringing at 2am. 

&gt; Me: ""Locksmith""

&gt; Guy: ""Yeah how much are your keys""

At this point I'm just guessing he lost his car keys, because why the heck would you be calling me at 2am if you didn't

&gt; Me: ""What kind of keys? What do they go to?""

&gt; Guy: ""My house""

&gt; Me: ""Oh, so you lost them then?""

&gt; Guy: ""No I just need a couple copies made, I'm at your shop now""

At this point I'm just really flipping annoyed because it's obviously not an emergency

&gt; Me: ""Well normally they're $1.50, and if you come back Monday morning I'll be able to make them for you""

&gt; Guy: ""Can't you come now?""

&gt; Me: ""It's 2 in the morning""

&gt; Guy: ""But your sign says 24/7 service""

&gt; Me: ""Yes it does, but that's emergency service, and this doesn't sound like an emergency. Things like making keys can wait until office hours""

&gt; Guy: ""But I need keys now""

&gt; Me: ""Then in that case, I'll be happy to come down, but I'll have to give you an emergency service charge of $60 on top of the keys""

&gt; Guy: ""That's stupid, I'm not paying you that""

&gt; Me: ""Goodnight then"" *click*

Some people, man"
"No, you don't get a free phone for putting yours in the microwave.


Sorry if the formatting is wrong - I lurk, not post :-)

For clarification I work for a company specialising in mobile phones and electronics, I work in their retail store which also does servicing and repairs. Since the whole debacle with phones blowing up we get a lot of questions about these kinds of incidents regarding ours and other companies, which is fine, people have the right to be concerned and make informed decisions.

Today a lady (L for lady/liar) came into our store to pick up her phone which she booked in for a public liability (PL) assessment. A few days prior she came in to give us her phone, in which she told my colleagues that her phone **blew up** in her kitchen whilst she was sleeping, and demanded compensation for her microwave which caught fire due to being *next* to the phone. Fair enough in my opinion, this is a horrible situation. 
I don't think that's unreasonable, so we book it in and send the phone to our head office with the PL team.

Today she comes in because we called her and said the phone was ready to be picked up, assessment was completed. I look up the interaction history between her and head office so I have an understanding of everything that's happened since.

Interaction 1:
&gt;Customer has stated she will go to the media if we do not replace and refund her phone. Assessment has not been completed.

Interaction 2:
&gt;Customer is seeking refund for device and accessories and compensation for microwave oven, dish cloths, a floor mat and a pair of shoes. Assessment has not been completed.

Interaction 3:
&gt;DO NOT GIVE CUSTOMER REFUND SHE PLACED IT IN THE MICROWAVE WHICH CAUSED THE PHONE TO EXPLODE AND CATCH ON FIRE. Traces of food, particles and damages consistent with a device being placed inside a microwave oven have been found. Customer would not answer phone so she is unaware of the outcome of this investigation. 

I take the phone out and sit with her and explain what the PL team has found. 

Me: Hey there, L. Our head office tried to contact you to let you know the outcome, but couldn't get through. Your device is being returned unrepaired due it being found that there's been customer induced damage which has caused the phone to combust. I'll be honest with you - it's been found that the device has been placed into a microwave or an oven of some sort and will cost the amount of a brand new device for repair which you can go ahead with if you like.

L: What, so I'm not getting a new phone? This is f***ed. If I took it to /competitors company/ they would just REPLACE the phone on the spot AND I'd get a refund!

Me: I'm sorry, we just can't give you a replacement and refund for someone putting your phone in a microwave.

L: Well I think that thing should kind of be in the warranty manual.

She walks off, flipping me the finger as she steps out of the store.
