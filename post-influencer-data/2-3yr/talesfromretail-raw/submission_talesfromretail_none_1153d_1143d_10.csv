"No ma'am, I can't sell you $100 of merchandise for $5


I work at a clothing store, we have packs of underwear hanging on a wall near the front of the store. The wall is split into two sections, the bottom is single pairs of underwear that go for $2, and then there's packs of 8 that cost $20. They are no the same brand, they are different materials, they look different, and are on different parts of the wall. On the part of the wall that only contains single pairs, is a sign that says ""5 for $5""

A woman walks up to our register with five 8-packs of underwear, I make casual conversation before presenting her with her total.

Me: That will be ~$100.00

Her: No, that will be $5.00

Me:...Well, no, that'll be ~$100.00

Her: No! They're five for five it says so on the sign!

At this point I know what sign she saw, and I know what mistake she's making, but in an attempt to show her the error of her ways I ask her to show me the sign

Her: Look, there it is right there it's 5 for $5.

Me: Actually, the 5 for $5 is referencing these single pairs that are only $2.

Her face lit up with anger and disgust as if I had defecated on the floor and asked her to clean up with her tongue. 

Her: Well why is that sign there?! Why are those packs with these packs?! These packs are on this wall and that sign says it's 5 or $5 and I'll take them at that price.

Me: Usually I could adjust your price, but I can't sell you $100 of merchandise at $5

Her: Well you need to remove that sign then because that's false advertising.

Me: No

Her: No?!

Me: Yup, no.

At this point my heart was in my throat and I actually could have gotten in trouble for how I spoke to her (depending on which manager she spoke to) but instead she just kind of walked out of the store.

Even if the sign was ambiguous, assuming a sale of that magnitude is just silly."
"The time I fooled a woman into thinking I quit


Sorry for formatting, I hardly post on TFR

It's about 4:55PM, and I had been scheduled for a 9:30 to 5PM shift. My management is lenient with it. If the replacement cashier is here and it's quiet, you can leave no more than five minutes early, but I never do that since it technically reduces how much you're paid. 

At around 4:58 I'm prepping to leave, and chatting with my other cashier. We're in the slowest department in the store so I can afford to take a few minutes. 

Cue crazy woman. (CW)

&gt;CW: Hi, I have a return?

&gt;Me: Sure! Can I just see the receipt real quick?

&gt;CW: Oh, I forgot it at home.

Now this is okay, since if you paid via card, or have a rewards account, we can look you up for the return.

&gt;Me: Oh that's okay, do you have a rewards account with us?

&gt;CW: Yes, my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.

&gt;Me: Great, I'll just scan the item to look up the receipt.

The order doesn't appear.

&gt;Me: The order didn't show up; did you use a different phone number?

&gt;CW: Yes, try YYY-YYY-YYYY or ZZZ-ZZZ-ZZZZ.

Neither of these work.

&gt;Me: None of those two numbers worked either. When did you buy the &lt;product&gt;?

&gt;CW: I bought it for my nephew's birthday in 2011.

&gt;Me: Well unfortunately we have a 30-day return policy, so even if I were to try to force it through, I would need some form of proof of purchase, which is purged from the system 6 months after the purchase. 

&gt;CW (raised voice, attracting the attention of my coworker): **You mean to tell me that I can't return this??**

&gt;Me: Un...fortunately the computer won't allow me.

&gt;CW: **Can SHE do it?** (pointing to my coworker)

&gt;Me: No, not even the district manager can do it. I can provide a phone number you can call to see-

&gt;CW: **Well maybe you're both just too stupid to work here!**

I look at my coworker and unseen by the customer, I wink and give a smirk. I turn back to face the customer.

&gt;Me: You're right! I should leave. &lt;Coworker&gt;, please tell &lt;Manager&gt; I quit, would you?

I proceed to take off my nametag and place it in the drawer, clock out, and walk out. I text my coworker later and she tells me that the woman was speechless and apologized for the insults before leaving.

&gt;TL;DR: Woman's a crabby bitch about a return, I pretend to quit"
"I want a sundae with nothing on it!


I live in a small New England tourist town where every summer we are completely overrun with tourists, especially in August. With so many tourists, I have to deal with a lot of interesting people every day. This literally just happened. My summer job is working at a little ice cream stand.   

""Can I get a small sundae?""  
""Sure! Whip cream, fudge, a cherry and nuts?""  
""No, none of that!""  
""....oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said sundae.""  
""I did.""   
""So what do you want on it?""  
""Nothing, I just want the ice cream.""  
""So you want vanilla ice cream in a dish?""   
""No! I want a sundae with none of that!""  

I reluctantly handed her a dish of vanilla ice cream and she was as happy as could be. Sigh... oooookay lady. "
