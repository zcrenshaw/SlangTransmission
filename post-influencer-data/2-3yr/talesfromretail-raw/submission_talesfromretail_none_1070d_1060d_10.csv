0,"I could do this myself, but it's part of your job so you can do it for me.


So I work at [large clothing chain], and I'm trained in most areas of the store, so I could be in any section of the store on any given day. From cashiering to customer service to folding clothing on the floor to the shoe department... Wherever they need me. 

I was a cashier the other day, and part of our job on the registers is to take the clothing that people don't want and placing it in customer service when I go on break so the associates on the floor (which might end up being me) can place it in the right place later. 

So I had a customer and her daughter come up to me with a massive pile of clothes. The mother looked mid-30s, daughter was about 17. The daughter piled a massive amount of clothes onto the desk and started working through them, taking some out and piling them togeher, telling me which ones she wanted and which ones she didn't. 

About half of them she chose to put back, which she held out at arm's length for me as I was scanning her other items, telling me ""Here, I don't want these"". 

The mother asked her ""Honey, you're right next to where you got these, why don't you put them back yourself while he checks out your other clothes?""

The daughter rolled her eyes and told her ""Mom that's part of their job, it's no big deal.""

Now, while that IS technically part of my job, it's just a common courtesy thing to put it back if you have time, especially if you're right next to where they go. Obviously it's not too big of a deal to me, but... You know. It's the principle of the thing. It was the end of my shift, so I was looking forward to getting out of their, but obviously I threw on the retail smile and took them from her, saying ""Sure! I can get those back for you.""

At this point, the mother reached out, took them back, handed them to her daughter, and said ""He has other things to get done, and I'm sure his time is better spent helping people on register than putting your things away that you're too lazy to put away yourself.""

I made sure to throw on every eligible discount I could for her. It's people like that that make my day 10x better. "
1,"That time I just decided to speak another language to a customer


This happened pretty early in my retail career. I’m a fairly big introvert and have social anxiety so at this point I wasn’t used to having to talk to complete strangers, let alone be the person starting the conversation.


My store attracts a lot of foreign people and I’m not sure why. Anyways, this elderly woman came in one afternoon and was browsing our food section. I walked up and asked her if she needed any help. I noticed she had a very thick accent while she said she’s just looking, so I used all the strength I had to ask her where she’s from in what I thought was her mother tongue, German. It would be really funny at this point to say I assumed wrong, but lucky for me I was right. This is a part of the conversation we had, all translated from German:


&gt; M: Are you German? Where are you from?


&gt; T: *face lights up* I am! I was born in Berlin. 


&gt; M: Interesting! Do you have many friends who speak German with you?


&gt; T: I do not :(  How long have you been learning German?


&gt; M: Not very long! I started a couple of years ago, but I stopped a few months ago. Sorry, I’m sure my accent it terrible


&gt; T: It is! But that’s okay! I am just happy to have a conversation!


We ended up talking for a while, mostly about my cats. She really liked cats. 


She thanked me in English as she was leaving and got a little teary eyed. She came back pretty regularly for a while and would always ask about me and talk to me in German. I had to transfer stores pretty suddenly one day though so I haven’t seen her in a long time.

2,"Ma'am, I watched you break it.


I'm currently working at a pop up Halloween store, and today I met the dumbest thief in Canada. Obligatory apology for mobile posting format issues!

I was working the front area when Oblivious Lady (OL) came in inquiring about discounts on damaged merchandise. I'm really relaxed about price cutting a ripped costume or scratched decor, because in a pop up store the sheer amount of stock and the quality of a lot of it means that damages are common. I told her of this, and that she should bring the mask she was talking about to me for inspection.

However, the mask she wanted I had put on the floor earlier that day so I was surprised it was already damaged. I decided to keep an eye on her, and watched her go to the mask and rip the strings off the back on one side. She just grabbed it, and casually broke it to where it would need to be glued back together; I just stood there is disbelief as she brought the mask back my way.

&gt;OL: Here it is! See, the strings here are ripped.

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I just watched you break that. I can't honor the discount when you've damaged it yourself, in front of me and the cameras.

&gt;OL: Oh, sorry.

And then she high tailed it like her feet were on fire out the front door, leaving me stunned and confused and looking for the hot glue gun for a poor innocent skeleton mask. "
