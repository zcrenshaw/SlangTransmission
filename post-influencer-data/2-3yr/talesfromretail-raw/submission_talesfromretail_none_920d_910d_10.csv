0,"You're discriminating against people who don't drive!


This literally just happened.

I work at a higher end clothing store and I tend not to get too many out-there customers, but this guy took the cake. A man came in with about 3 small children, shopped around for about a half hour (while running me completely ragged in the process) and then went to pay for his items. He has a store credit card with us, but he didn't have it on him. I said, ""No problem, I can look it up with your drivers license or a state ID.""

""Oh, I don't drive. Here, I'll show you my passport.""

""Sir, our computer does not scan passports as a valid form of ID. The scanner only responds to drivers licenses or state IDs.""

""But a passport is a better form of ID than a drivers license. This is Uncle Sam right here!""

""I understand, but our computer system only scans drivers licenses or state IDs.""

""But a passport is a government issued ID!""

""Yes, but our computer physically cannot scan a passport. I can only scan a drivers license or a state issued ID.""

""Well I'll just take my business elsewhere then!""

He proceeded to storm out of the store, and honestly I was a little bit relieved, until about 5 minutes later he comes barging back into the store.

""Here, I found my ID, now please look up my credit card!""

He pulls out his passport.

""Sir, I cannot accept this as a f-""

""Scan it! This is my ID! You are discriminating against people that don't drive!""

""Would you like me to call customer service and see if there is anything they can do for you?""

""No, I don't want you to call customer service. I want you to scan my ID and look up my credit card!""

At this point, my manager sees the commotion going on, comes over to help me out, and tells this guy exactly what I've been repeating to him for the last 10 minutes. We apologize to him for the inconvenience, and even offer him a coupon, but he just keeps yelling and ranting and raving. Finally he takes his kids, swears he will never shop with us again, is reporting us for ""discrimination"", storms out of the store for a second time...

And gets into a car and drives away."
1,"...really?


I work at one of the 24 hour big retail stores as a 3rd shift stock person. The best part of my job is how few customers I actually interact with on a nightly basis, usually it doesn't even go past saying hello to them. 

The other night I was in the process of putting up packs of paper towels. I picked up two of them and walked down to where they were at. I then did what I usually do, I dropped one pack on the ground so I could use both hands to put the other up on the shelf. (they arn't heavy, just easier to handle and finesse this way) 

A customer had been standing nearby as I did this and she piped up. 
&gt;You shouldn't do that

I turned to look at her
&gt;do what?

&gt;Drop the paper towels like that. It bruises them and makes them less effective.

I just stared at for a moment before putting the second pack on the shelf and walking away"
2,"Why are you calling my boyfriend?


A few moments ago i received a call. It went like this.  AL is angry lady Me is myself. 

Me: hello this is x store how can i help you

Al: hello

Me:x store

Me: i am not calling your boyfriend, i ask x store. 

Al:no no you listen to me now. I see you call my boyfriend, why, why you call him?
