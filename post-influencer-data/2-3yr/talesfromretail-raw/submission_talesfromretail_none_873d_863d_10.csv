"Diet Coke Ladies


Worked at a fast food chain when I was in high school. Many stories to be had about the work, but the only one really worth mentioning is a happy one. 

One of our recurring customers was ""the diet coke ladies"". Every afternoon, they would come through the drive thru and order 2 medium diet cokes. It was two older ladies, with their dogs in the back of their little Rav 4. Always nice, always wanting only 2 medium diet cokes. Occasionally, if things were super slow, we'd have a little chat as they paid (only a minute or two), and they would drive up to the second window for their drinks. Everyone in the store knew them, and you just had to shout ""diet coke ladies are here!"" and the person up front would get the drinks ready. 

As I was getting ready to go to college in a couple weeks, I happened to mention it to them. They were glad for me, and wished me well. 

Two days later, they came through the drive-thru per usual, but when they paid, they also handed me a little box, wrapped with a little silk ribbon. Inside was a silver pen, and engraved on the side was ""2 Medium Diet Cokes"". 

They told me they wanted me to pass my first test with it. "
"""Whining won't get you what you want!""


I had a woman and her young daughter in my line. As she was stacking her merchandise onto the counter, her daughter holds up a Frozen Barbie and asks ""Can I get this????"" 

Mom: NO! I said no toys. 

Daughter: Buy MOOOOOOOOOM

Mom: I said no. Now go put it back. 

Daughter: PLEASE MOM!

Mom: No. 

Daughter: *proceeds to scream and throw tantrum* I WANT THE BARBIEEEEE!!!

Mom: Whining won't get you what you want. 





The daughter sort of calmed down at that point, and the mom starts asking about the prices of things.





""How much are these pants???""

Me: Those pants are $34

Mom: They were supposed to be ON SALE

Me: Yes, they are on a buy one get one for a penny sale. 

Mom: But they rung up $34!

Me: Yes, you have to buy 2 to get the sale. 

Mom: Well I only want ONE. 

Me: Well, you have to buy 2 to get the sale...

Mom: BUT, like I said, I only want one!

Me: then they will be $34...

Mom: But, I want them on sale. 

Me: Again, ma'am, because they are buy one get one for a penny, if you only buy one, there is no sale. 

Mom: That's not fair! I only want one, I should still get the sale price. 

Me: I'm sorry, there is really nothing I can do.

Mom: *proceeds to scream and throw and throw tantrum*

Me: *not aloud* Whining won't get you what you want...."
