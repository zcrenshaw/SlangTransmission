"The time I ""didn't know what I was talking about""


Setting the stage:

I work in a garden center. I am  Certified in my field, with many years of experience.

The weather has been hot and windy lately.

A customer brings in some Japanese Maple leaves that are dry and crispy around the edges and starting to curl.

Customer:  “Can you tell me what is wrong with my tree?”

Me: (Examining leaves)  “It looks like windburn, see how the edges are…”

Customer:  “It’s NOT windburn!”

Me:  “Sir, Japanese Maples are very prone to windburn in this kind of weather…”

Customer:  “No way is this windburn!  I water it correctly, so it has to be something else!”

Me:  “It doesn’t matter how much water it’s been given, Japanese Maple leaves will scorch in hot dry windy weather…”

Customer: (Interrupting)  “Can you get me someone who knows what they are talking about??”

Me:  (Offended, but externally keeping my cool)  “OK sure… one moment…”  (I page back-up customer service to the desk)

While we are waiting I remain at the desk, completing some paperwork.  The customer asks me another question about different gardening problem….

Me:  (Not looking up. I'm done with this jerk.) “Well, since I ‘don’t know what I’m talking about’ maybe you better wait until my coworker gets here.”   (I continue with my paperwork)

My coworker comes up and they walk off into the nursery.
She later told me that she had also told him it was windburn.   He asked a few more questions, and she was not able to answer one.   She said he should ask me since I knew all about the subject.

Customer:   “Umm…. I can’t ….. I think I pissed her off….”

"It's under warranty


Customer=C Me=me

*Customer walks to me*

&gt;C: I need warranty for something, can you help me?

&gt;me: Sure, what's the problem?

&gt;C: A part is bad, I don't know what part. Can you just come out to check it out?

&gt;me: Ok. *walks with him to the car*

*front end of car is smashed*

&gt;me: What's the problem?

&gt;C: This! Can't you see? I have a 5 year warranty. I have the papers. I just crashed my car I need you to fix this asap.

&gt;me: Sir, you would need to file an claim with your insurance. This wouldn't be under warranty.

&gt;C: Why not?! I have a *5* year warranty. It's only been 1 year!

*C points at a different car*

&gt;C: Can't you just switch it with that one. I can't drive this one.

*he can't possible be serious*

&gt;me: *sigh* You went to the wrong dealership. We're *****. Your model is a ***, they are across the street.

*now they're someone's else problem*"
"""But Dad..."" - Tales from the Gun Store


Hey guys, AvgJoe again, back from the dead. Sorry for the lack of stories, but all has been relatively nice and quiet. So once again, I'm the guy that used to work at a sporting goods retailer in southern California that shut down. I now currently work at a firearms store where I am much happier at.

So this particular story actually occurred today. It was relatively quiet today and I was just tooling around the store straightening product when in walks a father (F) and his daughter (D) who I'm guessing was 6 years old.

&gt;Me: How's it going today guys?

&gt;F: Pretty good, man. So I'll get right down to it, we have a large property (*out past city limits and a good amount of acreage*) and we have a major rabbit problem. I've tried all the non-lethal ways of getting rid of them but they keep showing up. I'm sick of having my property get destroyed and I'm worried my one of my horses is going to break it's leg stepping into one of their holes.

&gt;Me: Ok.

&gt;F: Yeah, they have to go. And I don't want to get a dog to deal with them either cause that's just one more animal I'd have to pay vet bills for. Do you have any Ruger 10/22's in stock? I'm just looking to kill the rabbits at this stage.

The moment he said this, the father had the look of instant regret in his face and kept his eyes locked forward at me. In my peripheral I saw a tiny hand reach his and tug.

&gt;D: But Dad?

I looked down over the counter and saw his daughter with the biggest puppy dog eyes I've ever seen, welling with tears .

&gt;F: Yes? (*still staring at me, trying to avoid looking at his daughter*)

&gt;D: I don't want you to kill the bunnies, though...

I burst out into an uncontrollable laughter as the father gave an exasperated sigh.

&gt;F: Of all days I bring her along...

In the end, he consoled her by giving the typical parent white lie about them ""going to sleep and running away."" This was perhaps the most adorable and darkly funny situation I had ever encountered thus far."
