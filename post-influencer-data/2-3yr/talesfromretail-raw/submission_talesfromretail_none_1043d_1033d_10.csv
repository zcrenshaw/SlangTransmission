"Tales From a Former LP: As if Black Friday could get any worse.


Hey everyone.  With the Retail Holiday from Hell approaching, I wanted to re-tell a tale of the worst Black Friday I've gone through.  Hopefully put a little perspective on how much worse things could be for you. I've told this tale before, but new rules won't allow me to repost, so I'm going to type it up as best I can.

It was the good ol' year of 2007. Barry Bonds broke the HR record and was then indicted for steroid use.  The iPhone was unveiled.  The last Harry Potter book was released in stores.  Oh and some sort of mortgage crisis.  But you know, mostly a good year.

I was working at a major electronic retailer, as an LP agent.  Mostly standing at the front of the store, watching the cameras, checking receipts.  Not the best LP job I had but far from the worst.  It was late October when my Manager pulled me into the back office.  Store Manager (SM) was concerned.  Corporate was being flooded with calls from people complaining about fraudulent credit card purchases.  He needed me to investigate.  I would get additional hours to work in the office and he needed it done ASAP. Holidays were coming up, sales to be made, yada yada.

Well, I wasn't to happy about the extra hours, but I like a challenge.  I started looking at the complaints and the transactions associated with them.  Turns out the complaints were all the same. See a few months previous, around July, the company was pushing magazine subscriptions at the register.  You'd come up with your ""gold plated"" $200 HDMI cables or one of those new high falutin GPS systems everyone was raving about, and during the check out, you'd receive an offer for 3 free months of a magazine, or magazines, of your choice.  The store was pushing these hard.  At the end of every pay period, the associate with the most sign ups would get at $25 gift card to the store.  If the same associate won 3 weeks in a row, they'd earn a pizza party.  

Of course, being a shitty retail environment, it wasn't enough that they push these magazine.  They HAD to sell these subscriptions!  It was vital to the future of the company!  Any good loyal employee would be able to sell these easily!  And oh yea if you don't sell enough your hours would get docked.  After all, holidays were coming up, which meant many new hires.  If you were getting docked hours, there was a good chance one of the newer associates would take your position come January and you'd be boned. 

Of course none of this was ever said out loud, but we all knew the game.  

Well, each and every one of these fraudulent charges revolved around magazine subscriptions.  People saying they said no, and then were charged 3 months later for magazines even though they never received anything.  And the biggest issue was as the months went by, more and more people had complaints. 

Through some long investigating we noticed several key things.  1.) One associate was responsible for the first month.  She was the weekly winner and won 3 pizza parties in a row.  Eventually, every other front end associate started doing it as well.  One week they'd have 10 subs, the next, they'd have 50-60.  Each.  The Front End Managers were ecstatic.  They were the #1 store in the country for Subs.  Our store was killing it!  How could this be a bad thing.

Well, as you have all probably guessed, the first ""Golden Associate"" was signing people up for magazines without their permission to inflate her numbers.  Eventually, she let some people in on what she was doing, and they started as well. Even the new hires for the holidays started doing it.  We started monitoring the Front End with cameras, and caught several employees on camera doing it.  On top of that, the Corporate Retail discovered one of the geniuses was just sending the magazines to her house.  We used that as leverage to get her to talk.  We had all the proof we need for Corporate.

This is almost done I swear.

It's a Monday.  Next week is Black Friday.  I get pulled into the office again with the entire management team.  SM tells me that Corporate has reviewed what I gathered, along with Corporate LP.  The entire Front End staff is getting fired. Today.  Only one associate wasn't involved with this scam, some new kid who started about 2 weeks ago.  Everyone else was getting fired immediately, in order to avoid lawsuits.  The entire management team is aghast.  Black Friday is 10 days away.  The Front End management starts protesting until SM tells them that they are partially at fault for not paying attention.  If our associates were that successful they should have found out why and been using it to teach other stores. Instead they sit all day in there eating and only come out when called.  SM doesn't want to hear any protests from anyone. They are going to work out call in all the Front End associates immediately, and fire them.  They will work doubles this weekend,  1 regular shift and 1 shift strictly for hiring.  OH and instead of 10 hour shifts for everyone Black Friday, the entire store must work 16 hours. 8 in their department, 8 in register.  Anyone who refuses will be fired.

It's dead silent in there.  SM thanks me for my work and asks me to stay late to help escort people out.  I'm kinda stuck there anyways so I might as well.  Every cashier we have is called in and fired.  Word gets out and some of them don't come in, until they are threatened with police involvement.  There are tears, curses, one person being physically restrained.  It wasn't pretty. The management is scrambling to hire people and train them with less than a week of training.

Now, the Front End manager and I didn't get along to begin with. Long story but basically she was lazy and terrible at her job. After all this, I was Public Enemy #1 in her book.  It all came to a head the Tuesday before Black Friday.  She comes up and hands me a schedule.  It has me on Register from 3am-3pm, and then my previously scheduled LP shift of 3pm to midnight.  I laughed and crumpled it up and threw it out.  She goes on a tear.  I'm called in SM's office again and she's raving about how I'm not a team player and I should be fired for refusing.  

Me: LP isn't allowed to handle money except for investigations.  It would be against Corporate Regulations for me to work as a cashier.  And we wouldn't want to upset Corporate at this critical time would we?  

*Insert the world's biggest shit eating grin*. I've never seen someone look like they would blow a vein in anger but this woman was 3 steps away from becoming the Red Hulk. 

Needless to say, Black Friday was the biggest fiasco you'd ever seen.  Untrained employees on registers making mistakes.  Old employees leaving after their shift in their department and skipping the shifts on the registers.  Lines circling the store and taking an hour plus to get to the cashiers themselves.  Management running around like the sky is falling.  It was glorious to watch in a way.  Some men just want to watch the world burn I guess.  Especially when those men make minimum wage.

**Tl;DR- Can I interest you in a magazine subscription?**

EDIT: Guys for the love of god please stop guessing what store, or hinting at the store name.  We don't allow hat in the subs rules and I'm a Mod.  We are going to remove all those comments so please knock it off! 


**Double Edit: Apparently this made it to r/all. Maybe it'll even make front page.  But I'm going to take the time to wish everyone in America a Happy Thanksgiving. Take the time to spend with loved ones. Don't spend it shopping and making other people's holiday a living hell because you have to have that $3 toaster.  Take a day to relax, and reflect.  Oh and as a Redskins fan, I cant wait to watch them win Thursday!**

"Get a job you hippy!


I work at a fairly popular paint supply store. I love my job and the people I work with. While I'm there, I'm allowed to have my tattoos showing, as long as they're not offensive or obnoxious. 

During the middle of the day, my usual customers are general contractors and foremen. This particular day, I had a long sleeved shirt on under my work shirt which covered my tattoos. Well, as I was helping on particular contractor, I decided to roll my sleeves up because it was getting warm in the store from all of my running around, trying to get this order done.

He takes one look at my arm tattoos and flips out on me, calling me a hippy and so many other insults. Now, I can take some heat for it because I'm a pretty well-mannered dude. However the best insult came as I was ringing him out. This guy told me ""Go get a job"" as I was ringing him out.

**He told me to go get a job, while I was at my job, taking his money.**

Edit: THANK YOU TO WHOEVER GAVE ME REDDIT GOLD. I LOVE YOU."
"The concept of ""self"" checkout just doesn't click with some people


We have three sets of self checkouts at our store; the slow, the busy, and the dead. I was supervising the busy set (and they were *busy* that night) when a guy wheeled up a massive cart full of groceries.


I took a second to greet him and scan his case of water and bag of dog food so he wouldn't have to lift them, then went back to driving myself crazy trying to babysit six machines.


The guy was there for maybe 5-10 minutes scanning and bagging, and a couple of times I helped him by having him put some of the bagged groceries in the cart and clearing the weight difference when he ran out of room in the bagging area.


When he finally finished scanning and paying he looked at me and scowled.


&gt;Customer: Thanks so much for all your *help*


&gt;Me: ....


&gt;Customer: \*walks away, muttering* Just standing there while I do all the work...


Like... my dude... Did you see me running from customer to customer trying to help 6 people at once? I'm running 6 registers right now, I don't have time to hold your hand like in a regular checkout lane. 


If you want someone to hold your hand there's a checkout lane 5 feet to the left of here where we will literally do everything for you. Someone will even unload your cart onto the belt *and* take it to your car for you...  You came to *self checkout...*"

Im on mobile, but dont worry my formatting and spelling will be fucking *pristine* because I dont have sausage fingers. 

A few years ago, I worked in a certain mall store that retails massage chairs. You can probably guess which one, and they have a pretty strict no social media policy but who cares I dont work there anymore. 

One of the managers and I were running people through the chairs (10 minutes for everyone, no kids, no shoes, no food, etc). 

A very very pregnant lady comes in and beelines for the hardest hitting massage chair we have. People let ger cut in line because nobody is going to stop a pregnant woman from sitting down. 

She starts to turn on the remote to turn on the massage and my manager sees this and heads on over. 

He says says ""Hello ma'am, feel free to use the leg massager for 15 minutes or so, but Im going to set up the remote in a way that it does not cause medical complications for you or your child""

She asks ""why cant I get a full massage?"" 

""Well, there is a possibility that it could induce labor prematurely"" he says, starting to dread the following interaction. 

""Im ready"" 

""Excuse me?"" 

""The due date is tomorrow, might as well give birth now""

The manager is silent for a couple of seconds. This guy is a veteran, but he did not know how to handle the situation. 

""Ma'am, please dont give birth in my store"" "
