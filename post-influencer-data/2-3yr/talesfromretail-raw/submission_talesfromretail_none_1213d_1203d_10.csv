"Thanks Ashley ☺️


First post+mobile=obligatory apology for formatting. 

I work as a cashier at a huge chain department store, and one of my main responsibilities is to inform/harass people about our credit and debit card programs and get them to sign up. Our store sucks at this and thus all of us cashiers get ""coached"" by management all the time, I usually meet my quota but it's been a rough week.

A few weeks ago I helped a girl and talked to her about our credit card program and she agreed to sign up but didn't have any of her information, and like everyone else promises that she will be back and will look for me. 

Cut to this morning, I am dying inside and haven't slept more than 3 hours a night this week. Work is the last place I want to be. I'm covering the guest service desk and who should run up, so excited to see me, that girl. She had been in the store a few times this week but waited until I was there to do the sign up with me. She could have saved money every time she came in but she waited to see me because she said she would.

No management meeting for me this week, thank you Ashley ❤️"
"It doesn't matter to me how much you put on a giftcard..


This just happened a couple of hours ago and I'm not sure what to make of it..

A little old lady came in right before 12. She came right up to the register and since I was by myself I rang her up. She wanted a gift card for $5. 

She looks directly at me and says ""Want to know why it's $5?""

Me ""Um... Well...""

She ""I'm giving my friend a birthday gift, it's six different giftcards for $5 a piece at different stores. It's not enough to actually buy anything so it should annoy her.""

Me ""Oh ok.. Well have a nice day.""

She ""I will. She's going to be so pissed."" She looks absolutely delighted and walks out.

Well ok then.."
"""I went to Harvard""


Just found this sub and had a short one from my youth that always stuck with me.

15ish years ago, in High School I used to work at the local Fast Food place on Sundays. I was working the front register during breakfast and the main rush had just ended. There was an older gentleman who came in and laid a handful of change on the counter.

""One senior coffee. You don't need to count the change, I went to Harvard"".

I kind of looked at him for a moment, incredulous, and proceeded to count the change slowly and thoroughly before putting it into my till. He looked annoyed, but I was not going to not count a handful of change and have my till be off.

I always look back to this story as my personal Costanza ""jerk store"" moment with the amount of things I could/should have said... though it was probably better that I didn't say anything after all."
