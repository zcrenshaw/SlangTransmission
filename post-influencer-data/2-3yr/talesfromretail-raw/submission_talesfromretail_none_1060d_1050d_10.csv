0,"7 years and the only good story that's has ever come out of working retail happened to me 2 days ago.


Sorry in advance for mobile formatting mess wall of text. 

I work in a travel goods store. There were a few customers browsing around the store, no one needed any help at the moment so I was just standing by the front desk. A customer came in, elderly man with a deep Haitian accent and okay English. He came up to me and said that he wasn't looking to buy today, but he was planning on visiting family in Haiti that he hasn't seen in over 20 years. He said that he has been saving up money for a while and finally started planning his trip albeit still a few months away. He just wanted something inexpensive for the 1 trip. So I pointed him in the right direction and he told me he was going to look around. 


As I walked away another customer waved me down (a younger guy in what looked like a pretty expensive suit) and started asking me some questions about some high end brands. After about  15 minutes of talking to this other man the Haitian man walks over and said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry to interrupt but thank you for the help, I'm not ready to buy it yet but I'll come back in a few months when I have all of my trip money together."" 


The man in the suit then asked him what suitcase he was looking at. And the Haitian man pointed to the cheapest one we had in the front of the store for $20. Suitman said ""you don't want those, they don't last very long the way the airlines throw stuff around. How about one of these."" and he walks over to a mid-range $70 suitcase. 


The Haitian man laughed a little and said ""I can't afford those!"" 


Suitman blew my mind and said ""don't worry about that I will pay for it."" 


The Haitian man kinda laughed it off, thinking it was a joke or something or maybe he misunderstood. Even I was a bit skeptical. But Suitman insisted he was serious, handed me his credit card, and said to let him pick out a color. 


The Haitian man reluctantly picked out a suit case and walked over to the desk with me. He practically burst into tears when the credit card went through.  After some handshaking and many thank yous the Haitian man left. Suitman proceeded to buy $600 worth of luggage for himself and his family. 


Not only was it one of my biggest sales ever, it was also the biggest random act of kindness I had ever seen in my life. After working in retail hell for so long, this is something I will never forget.


Edit: I've been in a pretty bad spot recently, and when suitman did his good deed it really hit me hard. Made me feel like there are still good people out there. I can't believe how much attention this has gotten and how many people have taken a liking to this story. Thank you all for brightening my day :) "
1,"Shoplifting and You: Rule 1 - Don't Be Attractive


So this story took place on the weekend in the consumer electronics store I work at here in Australia. This story will be told through the eyes of my assistant manager, the way he has told every single person in the store since it happened.


Our store consists of a male-dominant sales floor, and we're all pretty close. Most of us are in committed relationships but it is our job to approach every customer as they enter the store, from the most homely to the downright gorgeous. This particular ""customer"" falls into the latter category. Our assistant manager, we'll call him Tim, falls into the typical assistant manager archetype - overweight, single, can't grow a moustache but heaven helps him he tries.


So it's Saturday morning in the store, right before our busy period. This young lady enters the store and immediately catches the eye of most of our sales force. She's tall, slim, busty, blonde hair and dressed rather revealingly. For all you Northern Hemispherians out there, remember how Australia is in Spring at the moment which means we get average temperatures of about 25C-30C (77F-86F). This young lady was wearing a crop top and short cut off denim shorts. This is important information to the story, I swear.


She comes in and makes her way over to the Fitbit display. Has a bit of a look when the first sales associate approaches. She's fine browsing thanks, so the associate leaves her alone. He leaves to tell everyone else ""Dude, check out the hot chick in Fitbits!""


Within about ten or fifteen minutes, the whole sales floor has done a lap and checked her out. Tim however has not left his glass office and has not taken his eyes off her. He is not being discrete at all but I don't think this girl notices.


She makes her way over to the Bluetooth speakers and starts inspecting a UE Boom speaker. She looks around and notices nobody seems to be nearby, doesn't see Tim staring, and shoves a speaker in her handbag. Now our speakers are a high theft item and are covered in security things that will beep on her way out so it was clear she was planning on bolting, but the second that speaker was in her bag, Tim was on his feet.


He rushes over to her before she could make a move and starts talking about how great the UE Booms are! 


&gt;They're fantastic!
&gt;Did you hear it in action?
&gt;Here, let me demo it for you!
&gt;Do you have your phone on you?
&gt;Let's pair it up and have a listen!!


The girl nervously pulls out her phone and goes into her Bluetooth settings. Tim grabs her phone and says


&gt;It'll be quicker if I do it!


pairs up the phone, plays a song, and let's her hear it.


&gt;You like that?
&gt;You wanna grab one? No worries! 


He still has her phone and says,


&gt;Tell you what, if you wanna grab one today you can buy that one in your handbag. Then I'll give you your phone back. Or you can put it back and you can be on your way


All of a sudden the girl had ""every intention of buying it but not after the way she's been treated today"" and pulls it out of her bag, puts it back, snatches her phone and storms out. 


Tim is feeling pretty proud of himself. Got a perve, stopped a shoplifter. It was a good day for Tim."
2,"I had to apologize. For eating.


Long time lurker, first time poster!  

Walking out of work today after a meeting, had a donut in my hand.  I was walking with one of my other managers to the front door to get my bag checked and as we were talking I took a bite of my donut.

All of a sudden I hear a gasp and when I look up towards the register (it's a good 5 feet away and not facing in the same direction as my front door) a customer glares at me and says ""Do you always eat in front of your customers?""

So I had to apologize.  For eating.  And that's basically retail in a nutshell.

edit: Holy crap you guys are amazing!  I'm saving a lot of these responses for the day when I decide to leave retail with a bang (and some choice curse words).  Godspeed my fellow comrades!"
