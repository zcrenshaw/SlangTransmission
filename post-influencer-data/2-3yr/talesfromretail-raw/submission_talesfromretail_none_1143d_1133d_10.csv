"It finally happened.


As I was closing up the store tonight and my cashier was getting the last of the carts from the parking lot, a gentleman parked his car and walks towards the door. It is 5 minutes past closing and the doors are wide open. I am thinking I am either going to have to tell this guy ""sorry we're closed"" or wait for him to shop.

Then it happens. He looks at the hours sign posted next to the door and then at his watch. He says ""Well, I guess I'll see you guys in the morning. 



TL;DR I found a unicorn"
"""No one wanted to talk to me""


At one point I was a cashier at large grocery store chain. Most of my coworkers were miserable bastards each day, poor guys, but I was newish and had made it my mission to try and make every customer smile. It passed the time faster than zoning out.


Cue SadLady. She seemed a bit down as she got into my line, so I flashed her one of my nicer smiles as I gave her my usual (store mandated) greeting.


&gt;Me: Hi, how are you doing today? 


I ask everyone that question, but that day was one of the rare days when I got a real answer. The lady's expression dropped with her shoulders, and she looked down.


&gt;SadLady: Not good...


&gt;Me: What's wrong?


&gt;SadLady: A week ago I had a miscarriage. I was in my third trimester and... I lost him.


Cue awkward silence as she struggles not to burst into tears and I frantically try and think of something comforting to say


&gt;Me: I'm so sorry to hear that...


Immediately I kick myself. How many times has she probably heard that already? My heart went out to her though, and wondered if there was anything else I say to help.


&gt;Me (hesitantly): Have you... gone to see anyone about it? Sometimes it's good to talk to someone who isn't family or friends.


&gt;SadLady (looks up all shiny eyed): I just started. I've found it does help a little...


I won't get into details, partially for her privacy and partially because I don't remember, but she ended up talking a lot about how she felt after the miscarriage and we shared our thoughts on therapists, as I'd gone to one at some point as well.


By the end of her grocery order (for I'd been scanning her long list of items the whole time) we were both a little tearful, but the Lady seemed a lot more relaxed.


&gt;SadLady: Thank you. You're the first person who I could talk about this with besides the therapist. No one wanted to talk to me about it.


&gt;Me (somewhat shocked): Not even your family?


She shook her head.


&gt;SadLady: Every time I brought it up they'd look uncomfortable and change the subject.


&gt;Me: Oh... um.. I guess they didn't know what to say.


&gt;SadLady: You did. Thank you.


I smiled and told her I was happy to help, packed her up and waved her out the door.


Days like that day are what made that job decent for me. It's why I tried to sound genuine when I asked how they were doing. Sometimes people are going through terrible things in their lives. I just find it kind of awful that the woman needed a cashier to talk to because her own family wouldn't.


Also, mobile post, and first time poster so sorry for the format.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for the kind comments. I've had a rough week (an old friend of mine died suddenly) and I can't express enough how great it is to read all your responses. Have a wonderful day and be good to each other!"
"This Lane is Closed


Some years ago I worked at a large chain retailer.  As there are some serious labor laws in the state regarding breaks and my former employer had settlements with former employees on the matter, break times were strictly enforced.  In fact, being late to break was more likely to get you written up than taking a long one.  I was still fairly new at the time and had heard horror stories of good employees fired for it.  

In the middle of a rush I was getting to that critical point where if I kept letting customers into my lane, I'd turn into a proverbial late-to-break pumpkin.  I turned off my lane light and started ringing up my second to last customer. 

An older gentleman in an electric wheelchair (decorated with flags on the back and a bunch of stickers all over expressing his patriotism) set his items on my lane, directly behind the ""HEY!! THIS LANE IS CLOSED!"" sign.  He only had a couple things, so I said, ""Oh, sir! I'm actually closing up. I'll give you a pass this time but you're it!  If anyone else comes into my lane, bop them in the nose for me."" and gave him a wink.   

Usually, this kind of thing was met with silence or a smile; however, this customer took it seriously.  He saluted me and started pacing back and forth, as if patrolling my lane.  I returned my attention to checking out the two customers in front of him with a huge smile on my face.

As soon as I was done with one customer, a young guy with a handcart full of stuff came up to my lane and set his basket down.  My wheelchaired friend put his hand up and said,  ""Nope! I can't let you do that.""  He pointed to me, ""She gave me permission to punch the next person in line.""  

I laughed as I told the young guy I was closing and directed him to another lane where there was no wait.  As he was walking away, a couple starts walking towards my lane.  The young guy stops them and says, ""Be careful! She's got a bodyguard.""  They looked perplexed as my enforcer shook a fist at them with a big smile and cackled.   

I ended up making it to break on time and never saw my champion again.  I like to think he was off saving other hungry cashiers from the ""Sorry! This lane is closed!""/ ""But I only have one thing!"" conversation."
"Customer asks me to give her a vital part of an item for free and gets upset when I don't.


I work at a large department store, we sell lots of stuff, blah blah. This was pretty early in the morning and I was just walking around putting stuff back when I saw a customer (C) standing in front of a shelf with different kinds of spray bottles (mostly same model as hairspray bottles usually have)   

&gt; Me: Hi there, can I help you with anything?  

&gt; C: Oh, Im just wondering if you sell any spray caps seperatly?  

&gt; Me: Im afraid we dont do that. Do you need it for any particular reason?  

&gt; C: Well I bought this bottle and I didnt realise it was missing a spray cap until I got home.  

&gt; Me: Oh, right. Did you buy it here? Cause in that case we can probably get you a new one.  

&gt; C: No, it was at [completely different store]  

&gt; Me: Oh, okay. Maybe you could go there and see if they can give you a new one then?  

&gt;C: I guess... cant you just take it off one of your bottles here and give it to me?  

&gt; Me: Uhm no, I cant do that. Sorry.  

&gt; C: Why not?  

&gt; Me: Cause then if someone else wants to buy that bottle, it's going to be missing a spray cap and they will have the exact same problem as you are right now.

&gt; C: But I am having this problem now!    

&gt; Me: I know, Im sorry, but Im really not allowed to do that.   

&gt; C: What if Im the one taking it off?  

&gt; Me: (???) No? There would still be the same problem with a missing spray cap for us, no matter who takes it off.  

&gt; C: Yeah, but that isnt my problem. 

We went back and forth for a bit longer until I flat out told her that I cant break one of our items just so I can help her, for free, with something she didn't even purchase here. She left after that but she looked like I had just told her I was going to eat her firstborn or something, so I don't think she quite understood why it was a problem."
