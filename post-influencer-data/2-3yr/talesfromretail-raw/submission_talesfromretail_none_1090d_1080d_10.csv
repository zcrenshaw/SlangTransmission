0,"""You think that's acceptable?""


I work in a grocery store and the bane of my existence is people putting their grocery baskets away incorrectly.
We have a pile for them to be stacked onto, but people don't care, it's usually left alone while their baskets are placed to the side, or inconveniently in a way that hinders anyone else's basket.

Last Friday, a mother comes in and does just that. She places her basket into the pile halfway, with one half in and another half out, making the pile look awful.

Her 7 year old daughter sees her do this, and stares at the basket. She turns to her mother and loudly says ""What is that? You think that's acceptable?""
Her mother sheepishly fixed the basket and that girl became my hero."
1,"I'm five minutes into open and I had to call the police.


Hi, small mall board game store again. This one happened about an hour ago. (We're allowed to browse the net when no one's around)

So I got in at 9:45, cause we open at 10. I do my thing, vacuum, make some coffee you know the usual. Ten rolls around and I open my gate and go behind the counter to wait for the early comers (We don't pick up till about 1.)

So here I am checking my counter and I hear these two ladies coming down the hall. They stop about fifteen feet from my door and are SCREAMING at one another about how one slept with the other's husband. They start to FIST FIGHT next to the fountain.

One rips off the other's weave and I'm already reaching for the phone to call security. Next thing I know ONE OF THEM HAS A KNIFE AND IS THREATENING THE OTHER. I told security who told me to call the police while they rushed to the scene.

THE MALL HAS BEEN OPEN FOR FIVE MINUTES.

Edit: Time frame I didn't realize what time it was when I posted this. 

Edit to my Edit: A Few typos also RIP inbox lol. Really though it was insane"
2,"The best customer shutdown I've received


I work as a keyholder for a retail store, been in various locations for this company for over two years. We have a loyalty card we have to pitch to customers. In all that time, I've never had a more diplomatic refusal than the other day.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Me: Do you have a membership with us I can look up?  
Him: No, and I'll decline the offer, thanks.   

&amp;nbsp;  

I loved it. He managed to answer both the immediate question and the one following, in a polite manner, saving us both time yet I can't get in trouble for skipping it!"
