0,"""What about the candy your kid put in his pocket?""


I just remembered an old story from when I worked at a grocery store. I was a cashier, and a woman came through my line with her two children. 

The girl was smaller than the boy, and the boy was tormenting her as a result (hitting her, poking her, pulling at her, just bothering her basically). To her credit, she never hit him or poked him back and instead kept yelling at him to stop. The mom was basically doing that monotone ""Cut it out. Stop it."" that extremely checked-out moms have perfected. Pretty par for the course at this point.

Except as mom is putting up the groceries, her son takes a pack of candy (I think it was some kind of Hershey's chocolate) and sticks it in his pocket. When he sees me watching, he smirks at me and sticks out his tongue. So, of course, game on.

I put on my cheery, retail smile, and start scanning. As the order flies by, the kid starts to look around and get bored. I guess he thought he got away with it. 

I wait until the very end, and as the woman pulls out her card to pay, I smile and say, ""How about the candy as well?"" This kid's head spins around from looking at the end of the register and he gives me the most incredulous expression.

The mother looks at me and goes, ""What candy?"" Looking in her son's eyes the whole time, I say, ""The candy your son stuck in his pocket earlier.""

This woman goes from 0 to 100 in 1 second flat. She spins around, and starts SCREAMING at her son, waving her arms, just flipping out, and spanked him. The kid is freaking out, and his little sister is just looking on with the most satisfied expression I've ever seen. She pays and hauls him out of the store; the candy bar at the edge of the register as a homage to the craziness that just occurred.

As horrible as I feel about that kid getting spanked, I hope it makes him think twice before acting like such a little jerk again!"
1,"Children - speechless one moment ...


So it's almost Easter and at the chocolate shop I work at, a certain popular product is sold for $4.95. Therefore I've been getting many instances of excited small kids racing to my till with exactly $5 so that they can pay for their own chocolate. And every time I give them all the time I can - they're always without fail the most polite customers I'll get in the day and I think it's nice to give the kids practise at this kind of thing.

Today I had a little girl come and buy some chocolate, giving me her $5 very proudly. I gave her a bag, put her receipt inside etc. Our shop gives out free tastings to each customer so I leant over and said 'I have an important question for you - would you like some chocolate to eat now?'

The girl looks at me gravely with big eyes, like 'I didn't expect this', then nodded. We have an awesome easter chocolate range and I gave her a bit with her bag, wishing her a happy easter. Once again she just nods at me; no problem, kids get shy. She walks out of sight; 5 seconds later I hear a high pitched girl's voice yell 'MUM THE LADY GAVE ME THIS AND IT'S REALLY GOOD!'

This is what I go to work for. :)"
2,"The tale of my final day in retail.


As my last tale seemed to be enjoyed I will share with you the story of my final shift in the world of retail. 

I was manning the customer service desk and feeling pretty chipper as it was my final shift, I had a shiny new job awaiting me where I wouldn't have to deal with the Great British Public and I was going from a job where I had been paid monthly to one where I would be paid weekly so would be being paid twice for the first month. All pretty sweet. 

Cue man who is about to change my day. You've all dealt with the type, more (homemade) tattoos than teeth. He has a small cylinder vacuum cleaner in a bag. It's broken, he wants a refund. Receipt? Nah, he doesn't want a receipt, he just wants a refund, isn't he funny? 

This vacuum looks, in a word, knackered. It also looks to be made by one of our competitors looking at the nice big brand logo on it so I refuse the refund. He informs me that this is unacceptable to him and slams it down on the desk. At this point I press the security buzzer. The gentleman then asks me why I felt I needed security when he hasn't threatened me...yet. 

Security arrive and call a manager and I'm escorted from the desk to the back office. I only have the word of the security guard for what happened next but I believe that he invited the manager to ""go outside and settle it like men"" at which point he was escorted from the premises but wouldn't leave the car park until ""that bitch"" had left because he was going to ""fuck her up"". After that Management decide to just pay me for the rest of my shift and I get a police escort home. 

I do no miss working in retail.
