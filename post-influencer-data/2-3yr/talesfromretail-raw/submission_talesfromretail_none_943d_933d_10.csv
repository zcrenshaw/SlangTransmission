"You're discriminating against people who don't drive!


This literally just happened.

I work at a higher end clothing store and I tend not to get too many out-there customers, but this guy took the cake. A man came in with about 3 small children, shopped around for about a half hour (while running me completely ragged in the process) and then went to pay for his items. He has a store credit card with us, but he didn't have it on him. I said, ""No problem, I can look it up with your drivers license or a state ID.""

""Oh, I don't drive. Here, I'll show you my passport.""

""Sir, our computer does not scan passports as a valid form of ID. The scanner only responds to drivers licenses or state IDs.""

""But a passport is a better form of ID than a drivers license. This is Uncle Sam right here!""

""I understand, but our computer system only scans drivers licenses or state IDs.""

""But a passport is a government issued ID!""

""Yes, but our computer physically cannot scan a passport. I can only scan a drivers license or a state issued ID.""

""Well I'll just take my business elsewhere then!""

He proceeded to storm out of the store, and honestly I was a little bit relieved, until about 5 minutes later he comes barging back into the store.

""Here, I found my ID, now please look up my credit card!""

He pulls out his passport.

""Sir, I cannot accept this as a f-""

""Scan it! This is my ID! You are discriminating against people that don't drive!""

""Would you like me to call customer service and see if there is anything they can do for you?""

""No, I don't want you to call customer service. I want you to scan my ID and look up my credit card!""

At this point, my manager sees the commotion going on, comes over to help me out, and tells this guy exactly what I've been repeating to him for the last 10 minutes. We apologize to him for the inconvenience, and even offer him a coupon, but he just keeps yelling and ranting and raving. Finally he takes his kids, swears he will never shop with us again, is reporting us for ""discrimination"", storms out of the store for a second time...

And gets into a car and drives away."
"...really?


I work at one of the 24 hour big retail stores as a 3rd shift stock person. The best part of my job is how few customers I actually interact with on a nightly basis, usually it doesn't even go past saying hello to them. 

The other night I was in the process of putting up packs of paper towels. I picked up two of them and walked down to where they were at. I then did what I usually do, I dropped one pack on the ground so I could use both hands to put the other up on the shelf. (they arn't heavy, just easier to handle and finesse this way) 

A customer had been standing nearby as I did this and she piped up. 
&gt;You shouldn't do that

I turned to look at her
&gt;do what?

&gt;Drop the paper towels like that. It bruises them and makes them less effective.

I just stared at for a moment before putting the second pack on the shelf and walking away"
"You can't sell what you don't own...


Backstory: I play drums and had left some stuff at a friend's house a few weeks ago.

Story: I work at a music store where we buy in instruments and gear. I come in to work and see another employee taking pictures of these two cymbals that got bought in on my day off. 

Me: ""Oh those are sweet! I have those exact same... wait."" 

Yup, they're mine. I look up the name of the guy who sold them to the store, call my friend, and ask, ""Does the name [Billy Bob] mean anything to you?"" He says, ""Yeah, he was My drummer until recently."" 

Ok, so now I have the confidence to contact Billy Bob. After talking with my managers, we decide that we can try to settle this internally and ban him from the store. I send him a text telling him that the cymbals he sold us weren't his and are in fact, mine. I also tell him if he comes and gives the money back to the store, we won't contact the police, but he will be banned from any store in our chain. You bet your ass he calls me not 10 seconds later. He says he's on his way right now.

So Billy Bob comes in and does the right thing. He's very apologetic, and tells me he knew the cymbals weren't his or our mutual friend's. We tell him that we won't pursue legal action, and we decide not to ban him, but we won't buy anything from him again.

Billy Bob: ""Why?""

Me: Well, when you sold these, you signed a contract that said you owned the property you sold, and since that was a lie, we can't trust you."" 

Billy Bob understands and leaves peacefully. 

TLDR: Guy sells my store my drum cymbals that he took from a friend's house where I had left them. Relatively happy ending for everyone."
