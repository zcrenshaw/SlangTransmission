"It's $0.36, no big deal.


So I used to work at an ice cream chain where we prepared the ice cream with various toppings on a frozen piece of rock.


On this particular day, I was working with one other person and it wasn't too busy. Two young guys came in, about high school age. They ordered a large bowl of ice cream with a few toppings, I mixed it for them and went to ring them up. I'll use use G for guy, since I really just talked to one of them.


Me: Okay, so that'll be $x.xx

G: Okay, I have a giftcard.

Me: Great! *scans card* so it looks like you owe another $0.36 after the giftcard.


At the point, they both look at each other and shrug sadly.


G: Oh...I'm sorry, I don't have any money with me, never mind....

Me: Oh hey, it's cool, only $0.36 *I take the $0.36 out of the tip jar and put it in the till* no big deal!

G: Wow, thanks!


The two guys leave, and I thought that was that. Felt good doing something nice.


So the one guy comes back several hours later. I saw him come in, and went to the register to meet him.


Me: Oh hey! You're back. Did you need anything el...


Before I finished, and without looking at me once or saying a word, he dropped a $20 bill in the jar and immediately turned and left.


I was so shocked I just stared after him until he walked out the door.


So that was pretty cool :)




Edit: Holy crap this blew up! Thank you for the gold stranger!"
"We closed at 5.


I work in a camera store and if you're in the store before closing we'll take care of you until you buy something or wander out. Lately I've been counting minutes to close and then right on the hour the doors get shuttered/locked, open sign turned off and the phones set to night ringer. 

Today we closed at 5. I made a beeline for the front doors and was halfway across the floor when the doors open. A man and his wife start to enter. The man sees me, leans back outside to read our hours, turns to his wife and says the words I never thought I'd hear a customer say:

""Oh they just closed. Let's come back tomorrow"".

Thank you sir, you are my hero. Also we're closed tomorrow, but it is the thought that counts. "
"""I'll call corporate!!"" ""Corporate doesn't exist.""


Hey tfr! I work at a now-mostly-defunct video rental chain, one of the few franchised locations left.


Today, a lady came in reeking of alcohol and clearly drunk. So youre aware, we sell a few assorted electronics accessories at the front of the store-- chargers, styluses, etc. 


Drunk lady shall henceforth be known as DL.


DL: ""HEY do you have ... A uh... Um... *Fumbles around* a phone charger I can use for a few minutes?


Me: ""no, but we do have chargers for sale! Right here.""


DL: ""Oh, awesome. I'll take one.""


Me: ""okay, that'll be eight dollars.""


DL: ""it says 5.""


Me (looking at the same display she is): ""it.. it says eight dollars on the display. Right there. Next to the picture.""


DL: ""Well I... I read five so you HAVE to 
sell it for five. It's like.. the law.""



Me: ""The price is eight dollars.*


DL: ""Well you've just lost a customer, and I'll be calling corporate. You'll get *fired*.""


Me: ""Actually, corporate doesn't really exist anymore. You can file a complaint with the store manager on duty, if you want.""


DL: ""Ugh, please.""


Me: ""So, what's your complaint?""


She then stormed out. God it felt so good to finally be able to say something like that."
