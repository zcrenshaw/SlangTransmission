"My most disgusting cashier experience


This happened a few weeks ago. Over the summer before I head off to university I've been working at a grocery store to have enough money to live on. My job entails quite a few responsibilities but I'm mainly at the tills.

So I'm sitting at my till, halfway through a 10 hour shift. I'm about 15 minutes away from my break so that's pretty much all I'm thinking about. A pregnant woman walks up to the conveyor belt with a full cart of shopping. She has two young kids, one walking alongside and the younger one in the fold out seat in the cart. It's obvious that she is in a rush and has her hands full with the kids, so I offer to take the bags that she brought and pack the items as I scan them. She is very thankful but I tell her that it's no big deal.

This is where things got interesting.

She began to lift the younger child out of the seat because he was in the way of her getting the shopping. She turns him around to put him down and he proceeds to projectile vomit directly over all the shopping. I'm not talking a little bit of baby sick; more like Charlie in the limo in Always Sunny. This stuff just keeps coming, completely covering her shopping.

The woman was almost in tears, apologising as much as I think is humanly possible. I tell her that it's not her fault, after all there is no way to predict when your baby will be sick.

Now usually my team leader (pretty much my boss) would be there to help in a situation like this, but it was a very busy day and she was away dealing with something else, so I had to take charge.

Firstly I called the in-store cleaner to clean the sick from the floor and I closed down my till. Next I got a hold of my friend who was stacking shelves and got him (after some persuasion) to take the hazardous waste container that the cart had become through to the back of the store. I led the woman to some seats near the door and then asked if she had a shopping list, so I could go around and collect her shopping again. She said she couldn't let me do that, but I insisted. 

So I grabbed another cart and raced around the store completing her shopping list. I'd been working there for about 6 days a week for 3 months by then, so I knew where everything was. I got everything in about 10 minutes and was back at the checkout. I got my friend back to help me unload and pack the stuff back up. All in all it took me about 15-20 minutes from taking the list to getting all of her shopping scanned through and packed.

I went to get the woman and told her that everything was packed and ready to go, she just needed to pay. She couldn't believe it! It was great to see the relief in her face after seeing her so close to tears. She paid for her shopping and thanked me about a million times before she went on her way.

I went for my break.

Fast forward to the present day. My team leader comes up and tells me that a lady wrote a letter to her about how I had gone above and beyond the call of duty just to help her when she was stressed. My team leader told that if I ever asked her for a reference, she would just forward that letter, as it was the better than any reference she could ever give. I was just glad to make someone's day.

TL;DR Baby becomes violent vomit volcano, covers his mother's shopping. I fetch her a new cart of shopping and end up with a great reference. Be kind to everyone you meet :)"
"I got sassy.. couldn't help it


I work at a gas station and people always seem to think I'm a mind reader. 

This guy comes up to the window and just puts money in my hand and then he says:

""5.49""
Before I could even open my mouth to speak he says again,

""5.49""
This time a bit more aggressively as if to show that I should have known what to do with the money right off the bat. Keep in mind this is a busy gas station and not only do we sell gas but we also sell snacks, drinks, etc. Once again, before I can ask this tumor of a person speaks again.

""5.49??!!!! I gave you 10.49!!"" At this point I'm a little confused and quite frankly annoyed. When I notice he's about to speak again I cut him off this time and say:

""What do you want me to do with the 5.49?"" Immediately he yells out ""GASSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!"" and throws his hands up in a obviously-that's-what-I-meant-way. Before I could even stop myself I mimicked his same arm gesture and said ""was that so hard?????"" in exactly his same tone. I asked what number pump his car was on and he turned and probably realized that there were 5 other cars pumping gas as well so there was no way for me to know what he wanted and know where he was parked. After this, he seemed to calm down a bit and got really quiet but I couldn't help myself I had to keep going because I'm petty.

""I'm not a mind reader you know? I wish I was"" he didn't even respond to this. I gave him his change and he just muttered a small thank you and walked off. "
"""We tried getting you a cupcake...""


Just a little happy tale from the time that I worked retail.

A few years ago, I was working at a video game retailer. We offered free midnight pick-up for games on release date for customers who had pre-ordered. Two people were always scheduled for this to run smoothly - and guess who was chosen to come back after their 8 hour shift at 11:30pm on their 21st birthday to facilitate the midnight release? 

I understandably was a bit bummed. I had planned to meet with some friends for my first legal drinks at a really neat bar downtown, so it was disappointing. Regardless, nobody else was available to take the shift, so I sucked it up and postponed my birthday plans for the next weekend instead.

A pretty small pool of people came in around 11:45, eager to get their hands on their new game. Two of them were men that I had seen in the store before and was fond of, because they were always really funny and polite. Having a pretty good rapport with the both of them, I told them that it was my birthday and joked that I had tricked them into thinking that there was a game coming out that night; instead, it was actually my birthday party and it was the only way I could get them to come. Jokes in that vein continued between the three of us until the clock hit midnight and the games were available for distribution. They got their games, thanked my coworker and I, and left.

At the time, our policy had us stay until at least 12:30am on midnight releases to ensure that everyone had time to pick up their game. It was about 12:35 when we were shutting off our POS systems and shuttering the doors when a car pulls up in front of the store.

I sighed and turned my computer back on, expecting it to be someone who was late for picking up their game. 

To my surprise, it was the two men from earlier who walked in. Their arms were FULL of convenience store candy and chocolates. ""Here! Happy birthday! We tried getting you a cupcake, but the grocery store nearby was already closed. We hope that this is good enough!"" 

They dumped everything on the counter for me and I was absolutely speechless. I actually cried a little when thanking them, because I was just so blown away. The fact that two near-strangers had gone out of their way to be thoughtful and bring me treats on my birthday so made the midnight shift worth it! I think about them whenever I reminisce about my time in retail. Why can't all customers be this amazing?!"
