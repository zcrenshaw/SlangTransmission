"Pokemon Parenting


First post on TFR so hope all is good. I have plenty of tales to tell sooner or later (5 years in retail now) but this one is a short funny from a colleague today, where we work in a UK supermarket.

So my colleague was on a checkout, and was scanning all the items of a father and younger son. The son was messing about and being a bit of a pain. Usually parents don't bother to control their ~~wonderful darlings~~ satanic spawn in our store, but this father did a wonderful job.

He turned round to the young lad, glared at him super serious, and menacingly said 

&gt;*If you continue to mess around, I will set all of your Pokemon free*.

Didn't hear another peep out of the kid, and he didn't move an inch.

"""If I was the owner I'd kill you.""


This older couple (about 55-60) came in my bakery. Note that I'm the owner of the bakery, but they didn't know. So, they asked for 750 gr of our small pieces of baklava. I showed them our boxes for this particular dessert, and explained that the half kilo box holds up to 650 gr max, and the kilo box holds 800-850 grams minimum, depending on the type of baklava they'd chose and the way I'd arrange it in the box, without making it look empty. Both boxes are perfect as gifts, and most people don't really care for an exact weight. Well, some do, and some are VERY rude about it. I've posted stories like this before.


So, the guy looked at me angrily and said: ""You know, if I was the owner of this shop and I heard you saying this b***t to a paying customer I'd kill you."" He pointed to the big box and continued with his speech: ""THIS is the 750 gr box. Someone has to teach you people how to arrange the pieces inside the boxes"".


I didn't even try to confront him. I was so angry I couldn't breath right. I picked up my phone looking at him and called the police. I gave them the address and said: ""Please send someone. There is this guy here that just threatened to kill me"".


I heard the guy cursing me as he was leaving. His wife looked at me and said ""you know he didn't mean it"". But I think she wasn't really mad at me. And they left. Two policemen came in a few minutes later and I reported the incident. They said that I could even sue him If I wanted. I didn't know his name, so I did nothing more. I hope I won't see him in my shop again."
"The law doesn't apply to regulars.


This happened to me years ago but I was just talking about it there.

I live in Ireland where we have country wide alcohol laws, can't be sold before 10.30am or after 10pm. I was working the 3 - 11pm shift in a petrol station and it was about 10.20pm. I was stocking drinks because the shop was empty and had earlier pulled down the shutter over the wine display so customers couldn't access the bottles.

A man enters and immediately makes his way to the wine display, crouches down, and pulls up the shutter to get to the bottles. I have a mini heart attack because I'm a teenager and start to stutter that I can't sell him alcohol.

'It's fine, I'm a regular.'

He grabs two bottles and stands at the till. I make my way across the store, get behind the till and tell him, more firmly this time because I'm getting peeved, 'I'm sorry I can't sell you alcohol because...'

He cuts me off. 'It's grand, just scan it, I'm a regular. (Manager) knows me.'

Fine. I scan the first bottle. Angry noise emits from register.

'Yeah, like I said. I CAN'T sell you alcohol. Not that I don't want to. The tills don't accept them after 10 because of the alcohol ban.'

He just walked out."
