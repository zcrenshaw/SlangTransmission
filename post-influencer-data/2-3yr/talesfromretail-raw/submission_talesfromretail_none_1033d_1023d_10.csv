"Not everything you bring to an IT shop has to be fixed.


Quick one today I just remembered.

I got the closing shift at the IT shop I used to work at when I was still in school. 10 minutes till closing and I decided to get the sign inside already and start cleaning our display. That's when I heard the door opening and in comes a guy from school.

He's living at another part of the small town and since we were both the same age I knew he had no license (I'm from germany, I was nearly 16 time of the story, so no driver's license) and it could have been a real pain to get here.


I dislike this guy. Always trying to show of his dad's money and since he's not too bad at sports, the stupid girls all like him. And since he got brains too he hit the jackpot. No chance for like everyone. So I was quite irritated when $GuyPerfect entered the store.


&gt;**$Me:** ""Welcome at $Store! But I have to tell we are closing really soon. It would be best if you would just return tomorrow at an earlier time.""


I tried to be polite and did hope he got the message. But he just shook his head and went for the desk. I followed him, because well, I'm closing in 7 minutes and I don't want you to ruin that.

When I reached the desk I noticed he had placed a bag there and bite me if I'm wrong, but that bag was moving. Last minute repair orders for a bug-rotten laptop. Thanks ~~Schr√∂der~~ Obama.


&gt;**$GuyPerfect:** ""Sorry. But I have to ask you for a favor. I know we don't get along really well but this has to be top secret and my parents needn't know this!""


I was curious so I opened the bag and inside was... a puppy. Not a badly damaged laptop or monitor or something. No. A cute little Golden Retriever puppy. They're definitely not IT, what would make him think bringing it to us would be a good idea?


I asked him exactly that while petting the puppy. *I mean, come on! It was just so cute!* And he started to stutter while trying to explain.


&gt;**$GuyPerfect:** ""Okay, you see, I was not looking for an IT store, I was looking for you. That's when your mom told me you were here and here I am. I know this is sudden and you don't really know me but I know some of your friends and they told me I could trust you with this. So please help me!""

&gt;**$Me:** ""Woah, wait a moment! What help do you need?"" 
*And who would recommend me as the go-to guy if ever having a puppy? That's not bad at all, I just want to thank that person.*


So he explained. He told me he found this little guy when walking home, trapped inside a carboard box, and took him to a vet as soon as he could. The puppy was not hurt but he just thought better safe than sorry. It was alright but now he had one problem: His mother hates animals. She would scream whenever she saw something bigger than a fly.


So for him it would be impossible to take the little guy home. But he didn't want to bring him to a shelter. That's when he heard from one of my friends that I live beside a farm and used to help there when I was little. So I would have the possibility to keep the puppy there and he would visit him everyday. He knew he was selfish but he at least wanted to try.


I was touched. I really was. So I told him to grab the puppy and wait outside while I closed the shop. As soon as I was done we both went to the farmer and told him everything. He laughed but since he knew me for ages he agreed. $GuyPerfect was grateful, promised to pay us for our troubles and went home.


And this is the story of how I got to know my best friend of 9 years and now coworker.


*PS: The dog still lives with the farmer. When the dog grew older (and we too) we realised it's best to keep him at his used surroundings, even though $GuyPerfect wanted to take him with him when he moved out.

EDIT: WOah guys! I never expected this story to get so many upvotes! I was gone for the weekend and just came back to see this! Thank you all so much! Now up to the question I will answer here:

1. Yep, I know this story wasn't a quick read. I just typed it quickly when I remembered.
2. This story and my love for tech and dogs inspired my username, yes.
3. Actually the name $GuyPerfect I used here is a joke we both share, because he always hated the fact, that girls called him perfect. That and the thing that he is gay. Unfortunately I am not, so it would be hard for us to marry *and* live a happy life. A puppy live would be more realistic though...
4. And no, the dog is not my coworker. But the dog I owned was it sort of. He died this year so I'm going solo again.
5. I consider posting this to the other subs you recommended, thanks!"
"""Hey mom, why not just put it up?""


Second post on the sub

At little bit about me and my job: I'm a bagger / cart-getter at smaller grocery store chain and it was recently Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving = busy store = lot's of carts for us baggers to get. 

So anyway, I was the only bagger in the store at that time so my  head cashier told me to get carts so we could prepare for a massive influx of people coming in later to stock up on last minute buys. I get my vest and cartclip and walk outside to fetch carts. 30 minutes go by and it's all smooth but more people are entering and leaving. This is where it gets good, a mom and her daughter (no more than 8 maybe) are leaving the store with their cart in hand and the mom promptly pushes up a curb and lets it sit there for us to get. 

&gt;Daughter: ""Why'd you do that, the thing (cart corral) is right there?""

&gt; Mom: ""It's ok, he (referring to me) can pick it up later.""

&gt;D: ""Hey mom, why not just put it up. He's busy and the thing is right there anyways""

&gt;M: &lt;sighs&gt; Fine, I'll do it.

I'm just watching them put their cart up and I throw up the biggest retail smile I possibly can.

Though it's only 1 cart out of a whole bunch, it makes my job *that* much easier.

TLDR; Girl sticks up for me and tells her mom to put her cart up

"...Do you understand how traffic lights work?


Card machines. I used to give customers about three tries to get it right. The failed tries would print on the receipt, so in lieu of a 5km receipt, I'd take over if they fucked it up that many times.

Lady comes up, I put her purchase through, she puts her card in the reader, chooses her account, puts her pin in. Yay, a customer who knows how to work things.

BOY WAS I WRONG.

Puts in her pin, presses a button. Cancelled.

""Oh, I say, the machine must've stuffed up, let's try that again."" Always a good idea to blame ""the machine"" in retail, it's like the eternal, unfailing scapegoat.

Repeat process. Cancelled.

Lady starts getting a bit annoyed, ""I have money on this card, it worked before, yadda yadda yadda.""

""Third time's the charm,"" I say, ""I'll watch the screen this time, maybe it'll show a specific error message."" (screen was pointed at the customer on an angle, so I'd have to swivel the machine if I wanted to see, good privacy thing.)

Look away as customer puts in pin.

Look back.

Customer presses the red button with an X on it. It is next to a small, small yellow button with a backspace arrow on it, which in turn, is next to an ENORMOUS GREEN BUTTON WITH A BIG CIRCLE ON IT.

I'm sure I don't need to explain that red, like in pretty much all contexts, means bad, negative, go back, stop.

""Oh,"" I said, ""You must've hit the red button, that means cancel.""

""I thought it was enter,"" she replies disbelievingly, ""How am I supposed to know? They're not labelled!""

I worry that she drove here. I wonder how many pedestrians she hit."
"""I don't want an alternative.""


A short, but sweet one this time.



A middle aged man enters our video game store. He looks through the games for PS4, when I approach him. (Me= M, C= Customer)

M: ""Hello, can I help you find something?""

C: ""Ah, hi! You know, I am searching for [newest entry in popular racing car series]. Do you have it?""

M: ""That one has not been released yet, but will come out next year.""

C: ""Too bad, well.""

M: ""But there are great alternatives on the console!""

C: ""I know, but I don't want an alternative. It's like with woman, you know? There are great ones on this planet, but I don't want any alternative. I only want my wife."" 


He then smirks, points out of the store where I see his wife, says bye and leaves the store.


My cold retail heart melted a little that moment.


Edit: Thanks for the positive responses. Yes, he was looking for Gran Turismo Sports, since people were asking which it was."
