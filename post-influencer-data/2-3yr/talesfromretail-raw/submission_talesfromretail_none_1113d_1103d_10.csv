"911: She went for it.


I work for a car rental place. I am the only employee at a location in a very small town. I often have to leave the store to go pick up customers, pickup/drop off oil changes, etc. etc. When I do, I leave between reservations, lock-up, and put up a sign on the door with a number where customers can reach me immediately. 

I usually never get any calls. 

However, yesterday a women called while I was out dropping off a customer to a body shop. She seemed perfectly reasonable at first. 

Me: Thanks for calling *****. How can I help you?

Her: Hi. (Apparently having read my notice) Will you be back soon? I don't have much time. 

(For the record, she had no reservation and had not previously contacted the store.)

Me: Yes ma'am. Just dropping off a customer. It should be about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Her: I'll be waiting . . . 

*hangs up*

Literally 2 minutes later she calls back. 

Her: Sir, I just can't let you do this. 

Me: Do what

Her: You abandoned the store and I am going to call the cops if you don't show up soon. 

Me: *laughing from confusion*

Her:

Me: That won't be necessary ma'am. I'll be back very soon and the cops aren't . . .

*she hangs up*

I show up 4 minutes later and swear to god, THE COPS WERE WAITING WITH HER, visibly unsure about why they were there. If your counting, she waited a total of 6 minutes MAX after I knew she existed; which is longer than I've waited for fresh nuggets in a drive through. She had no reservation, with not having previously contacted a business that operates based on reservations and literally called the cops. 

Cops: What's the problem here?

Me: *astonished* I have no idea. You'll have to ask her. 

Cops: *having already talked to her and unable to seriously address her, they look at us and back at each other, then back at me* we hope you have a better day. 

She doesn't even try to come in. Maybe she realized she had just gone through a manic episode and decided to give herself some time. "
"The best customer shutdown I've received


I work as a keyholder for a retail store, been in various locations for this company for over two years. We have a loyalty card we have to pitch to customers. In all that time, I've never had a more diplomatic refusal than the other day.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Me: Do you have a membership with us I can look up?  
Him: No, and I'll decline the offer, thanks.   

&amp;nbsp;  

I loved it. He managed to answer both the immediate question and the one following, in a polite manner, saving us both time yet I can't get in trouble for skipping it!"
"""Bet you wish you'd worked at school now.""


This happened many years ago, before I escaped retail but it still pisses me off when I think about it. 

I was 18 or 19 and worked in a supermarket while I was at college. I often worked a Sunday morning and one time I was especially bored, sticking tickets on reduced to clear items. As usual there was a crowd around waiting to see what would be on offer today. I must've had my resting bitch face on because this old guy came up, uncomfortably close and said, 

""Bet you wish you'd worked in school now.""

As I remember I just looked at him in shock, actually I got good grades in school and was working on a diploma, but no, he'd made a judgment on me that I was a dropout and they was why I was working retail... even if he's thought that, why SAY it to someone? Customers suck..."
