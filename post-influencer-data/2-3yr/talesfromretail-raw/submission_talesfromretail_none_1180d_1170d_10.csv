0,"Your ""34"" items comes to a grand total of...


I was working express (fifteen items or fewer) at the grocery store I work at today and a woman comes up with one of our small carts packed to the brim.

&gt; Me: excuse me ma'am this is an express lane for only fifteen items or fewer

&gt; Lady: I have about 17, is that ok?

&gt; Me: Are you sure that's 17 you have quite a bit

&gt; Lady: No I counted its seventeen its fine

Without a response she unloads all her groceries onto the cart. I am dealing with another customer in front of her at the moment so I have no time to make a fuss.
 
She has a lot of items on the belt, way over 17. How inconsiderate to the people behind her. There was no use telling her to reload her cart that would take more time. I ring her up with a deadpan angry face as she smuggly watched me bag her copious amount of groceries. I look at the item counter and she bought 34 items. What happened to ""17"" ""I counted""

&gt; Me: Ok, your **thirty-four** items will come to a grand total of 117.90

I said this in my most beautifully cheery sarcastic retail voice. Her face turned bright red. Customers seem to think there isn't an item counter, my register tells me how many items i've scanned. "
1,"""I Have a Crisis.""


Hi everyone! If you haven't read my stories before, I own a small business where I hand make items for adorable dogs and cats. And now you're all caught up! 

One hot summers day I was set up at a local Farmers' Market. This particular market didn't allow dogs, but no one argued when a woman brought in an adorably large St. Bernard that wanted nothing but all the hugs. 

The woman made her way over to my booth and went through the dog neck ties, trying to find something she thought would suit him. The entire time she did this, I tried to give her dog all the hugs, but he was too busy staring intently at my table full of toys. He was so large that it was just at the right height to where he could see everything, yet he never attempted to grab anything. He was so marvelously well behaved.

The woman picked out her tie and happily went on her way, only to return as she passed me on her way to the car. She handed the dog off to the girl who was with her, walked in the booth alone and approached me as if she were on a super secret mission. She will be SAL for Super Awesome Lady and I will be me. 

&gt; SAL: ""I was wondering how much your dog toys are. I want to surprise my dog. I saw him staring at the toys earlier and didn't want to leave without getting him one."" 

&gt; Me: ""It depends on which ones you want. There's some rope toys and pom pom balls for $4, and some rubber squeaky toys and bones for $5."" 

For those of you who don't know, pom pom balls are essentially gigantic balls made from a mix of cotton, fleece and flannel fabrics that stick out in all directions and look like a big pile of fluff. They're made specifically for dogs to play tug of war with and chew apart, and they seem to love them. 

&gt; SAL: ""I know this is a strange question, but would you mind if I let him pick and then pay you? I promise I won't let him wreck your table.""  

&gt; Me: ""Of course! That's not a problem at all. I assure you worse things have happened to my table. One time a min pin took a flying leap onto it just because he wanted to see what was for sale. I make things for dogs, so I understand things happen and I always find it adorable when a dog attacks my table to choose something for themselves."" 

In case anyone is wondering, the min pin sat on top of my basket of rubber squeaky toys and refused to move until his owner bought him one. The owner had initially picked the toy up and squeaked it, which is what had prompted the flying min pin. I know I shouldn't want dogs on my table, but it was so cute that it made my day. 

Every so often I also have people whose dogs will choose their own toys, and it always makes my day. 

&gt; Her: ""Thank you! He's going to be so excited!""

She turns around, grabs her dog's leash, brings him back into the booth and says to him, ""You can pick whatever toy you want."" It was as if he understood and the Heavens opened up and someone had just gifted him with the one thing he wanted - an opportunity to pick his own toy. His eyes got wide and he sniffed around the table, before anxiously but gently picking up one of the large pom pom balls out of the basket, touching it and only it and wrecking nothing else. The woman handed me the money for it, thanked me and went on her way. 

The entire walk to the car the dog was tossing the toy up and trying to catch it, failing, and picking it up off of the ground as happy as could be. This dog was, by far, the most polite dog with the most accurate and quick decision making skills I've ever seen. 

The following week the same lady came back, sans the dog.

&gt; SAL: ""I have a crisis. I don't know if you remember me, but I was here last week with the St. Bernard. He loved the toy I got from you so much. He thoroughly enjoyed playing tug of war with it and chewing it to itty bitty pieces so much that he's spent the last day crying because it no longer exists. Can you just put all of the pom pom balls you have into a bag for him and tell me what I owe you?""

&gt; Me: ""Of course. I'll give you a discount on them because you're buying in bulk. I'm so glad he liked them so much!"" 

&gt; SAL: "" Me too! He loves to tear things apart, but he's picky about what he likes to tear apart. He really seemed to love the soft fleece fabric. I'm so glad to finally find something that he can have so much fun playing with!"" 

&gt; Me: ""Me too! And thank you for understanding that the pom pom balls are specifically made to be torn apart. A lot of people won't buy toys for their dogs because they will tear them apart."" 

&gt; SAL: ""Are you serious? That's the whole point of toys - they're meant to be played with and eventually torn apart. As long as my dog is having fun, I will continue to buy him toys to tear apart."" 

&gt; Me: ""I'm glad I could help you with that then!"" 

So took an entire bag of gigantic pom pom balls and left. I no longer do Farmers' Markets, so every so often she'll call me and say, ""I have a crisis."" And in the mail will go a large box of pom pom balls. She's easily one of my favorite customers, as is her dog. 

Edit: A nice Redditor informed me that words are hard. Thank you, nice Redditor! "
2,"""Do you know how to do math?!""


I work at a children's clothing store, which inevitably means that I get to deal with crazy parents on the daily. Our store always has pretty great deals, but people want as much of a bargain as possible.  Cue story.   

I'm ringing this woman up yesterday and she's rude right off the bat. I scan in one of her clothing items, and she immediately stops me.   
&gt;Customer: Um, excuse me, that's supposed to be 75% off.  
&gt;Me: Yes ma'am, this item is 75% off. The ticket price is $12.00, and it's ringing in at $3.00.  
&gt;Customer: 75% off of 12 is not 3!!! That doesn't make sense, do you know how to do math?!  
&gt;Me: -holding back the fire-y pit of rage that is building up inside- 75% of 12 is 9, and 12-9 is 3. The price is correct.
      
This lady still thinks I'm wrong, so she pulls out her phone while mumbling about ""wrong prices"" and ""trying to play games with me."" She's now on the calculator app.  
  
&gt;Customer: SEE, YOU'RE WRONG. 75% of 12 is... 
       
Lo and behold, the glorious number 9 appears on her screen. I smile at her and ask if she'd like to buy the item.  
  
She didn't. The rest of the transaction was silent. Customers like this woman never fail to baffle me; how are you a functioning member of society if you're going to make a huge fuss over simple math? "
