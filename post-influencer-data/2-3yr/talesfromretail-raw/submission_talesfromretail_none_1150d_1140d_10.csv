0,"It's $0.36, no big deal.


So I used to work at an ice cream chain where we prepared the ice cream with various toppings on a frozen piece of rock.


On this particular day, I was working with one other person and it wasn't too busy. Two young guys came in, about high school age. They ordered a large bowl of ice cream with a few toppings, I mixed it for them and went to ring them up. I'll use use G for guy, since I really just talked to one of them.


Me: Okay, so that'll be $x.xx

G: Okay, I have a giftcard.

Me: Great! *scans card* so it looks like you owe another $0.36 after the giftcard.


At the point, they both look at each other and shrug sadly.


G: Oh...I'm sorry, I don't have any money with me, never mind....

Me: Oh hey, it's cool, only $0.36 *I take the $0.36 out of the tip jar and put it in the till* no big deal!

G: Wow, thanks!


The two guys leave, and I thought that was that. Felt good doing something nice.


So the one guy comes back several hours later. I saw him come in, and went to the register to meet him.


Me: Oh hey! You're back. Did you need anything el...


Before I finished, and without looking at me once or saying a word, he dropped a $20 bill in the jar and immediately turned and left.


I was so shocked I just stared after him until he walked out the door.


So that was pretty cool :)




Edit: Holy crap this blew up! Thank you for the gold stranger!"

First post on TFR so hope all is good. I have plenty of tales to tell sooner or later (5 years in retail now) but this one is a short funny from a colleague today, where we work in a UK supermarket.

So my colleague was on a checkout, and was scanning all the items of a father and younger son. The son was messing about and being a bit of a pain. Usually parents don't bother to control their ~~wonderful darlings~~ satanic spawn in our store, but this father did a wonderful job.

He turned round to the young lad, glared at him super serious, and menacingly said 

&gt;*If you continue to mess around, I will set all of your Pokemon free*.

Didn't hear another peep out of the kid, and he didn't move an inch.

2,"Hello... I can't hear you


So this happened back in 2005, when I was working at a fast food place. I'm on drive-thru, when a customer pulls up in a lifted diesel pick up, with what is clearly a very loud aftermarket exhaust system. I can hear the truck from inside the building. I pushed the talk button on the headset and ask that they turn their engine off... No response, engine is still running. If they're talking, I'm not hearing it over the exhaust. Eventually after a couple mins he pulls up, shuts off his engine and the following conversation occurs. I'll be me, he'll be DT (diesel truck).


&gt;DT: What the hell is your problem?!?


&gt;Me: I'm sorry?


&gt;DT: You just going to fucking ignore me all day or you going to do your God Damned job?!? I've been sitting at that speaker for like a 10 mins!


&gt;Me: Sir, when you pulled up, you immediately shut off your engine. Why did you do that?


&gt;DT: So I can hear how much I owe...


At this point, mid sentence he stops, and is clearly mid thought, and it all finally clicks.


&gt;DT: ... The engine was running at the box wasn't it? ... I probably couldn't hear you.... Well... Fuck me, right? Anyway, can I get a large black coffee and a blueberry muffin with butter, please?


&gt;Me: Absolutely!


He hands me (if I remember correctly $8.00)


&gt;DT: Here, keep the change. Trust me, I won't make that mistake again.


&gt;Me: Thank you so much! No worries though, it happens all the time, so you're in good company. Have a wonderful day. 


The guy ended up becoming a regular, and as it turns out he's actually a wicked nice guy. "
