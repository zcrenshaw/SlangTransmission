"Apparently some people don't get the concept of weight.


Hi guys, here’s one more story from my bakery. Please excuse any mistakes, as English is my second language. So, this lady came in with her teenager son (about 15 years old) and asked for candy A + candy B to be put together in a gift box. These candies have about the same size, yet A is heavier than B. They have the same price. Simple? Not so much.

Lady: “I’d like 500gr from A and 500 from B in the same box please, but don’t mix it, put half on the right of the box and half on the left of it”. 

Me: “Ok, but since you want it as a gift, you should know that A weighs more than B. Would you prefer to just put the same number of pieces of each in the box, so it looks even?”

Lady: “What do you mean? I just want half kilo of each in the box.”

Me: “I meant that since A is heavier, it will be less of it in the box. Now If I just put the same number of pieces of each, it will look much better as a gift”

Her son: “Mom, she knows better, let her make it as she says”. 

Lady (impatiently): “Look, I just want 500gr of each! I don’t know why it’s so hard for you to understand.”

I wasn’t going to argue more, so I made the box exactly as she said. She took a look at it and…

Lady: “But there is more of B here than A. I just asked for half of each!”

Me: “Yes, there’s exactly half kilo of each, just like you said. As I told you before, A is heavier than B”.

Lady: “No, I don’t want it that way. Make it even please”.
 
Her son: “Mom, that’s what she was trying to do”.

Lady (angrily): “Just go and wait for me at the car”.

The boy left, and she didn’t say another word. She just paid for the gift box, didn’t thank me, and left.

"No ID=No Game


OK, OK, this is my last story for the day, Saturday was crazy though!
I'm gonna fill in some info that will help you understand why there are no other employees than my bro, M and me.
There are only three employees there, Me, my Brother and the Manager, who is also the owner.

Anyways, we close at 11 PM. At that day only me and M 
It's about 10 PM and we are fixing to close, then four drunk guys come in and start knocking stuff off the shelves and start ripping open packages. One of them comes up to me and wants to buy some stuff, we head over to the register and he wants to buy GTAV 
(DG: Drunk Guy, M: Manager, Me: Me)
    

Me: Sir, I'm going to have to see an ID.
    

DG: *pulls out ID* Come on! Hurry!
    

Me: *looks up to see the store wrecked* Sir, can you get your 
    friends and follow me? I need to see if this copy works, broken  
    games can be issues and I wanna save you some time.
    

DG: sure *he and his friends walk into a closet (not the back 
    room we use to actually test games mind you, I lead them into
    a closet)*
    

Me: *closes and locks door and calls police*


Me and M showed the cops the security camera footage and opened the closet for the cops to arrest the guys. 


ALSO, I'm sorry for any format or text issues in my posts, I'm kinda new to reddit and I'm still learning stuff.

"Another ""think 25"" tale


After the last one was so popular, I thought I'd share another tale from my time in the convenience store and the ""think 25"" policy (cashier needs to ask for Id for any age restricted product if the customer looks under 25).

It was another Friday night so fairly busy with a queue, when a young looking lad came to my till with a couple of packs of beer, a bottle of wine and wanting some cigarettes.  I asked for some Id before I could put it through, and he made a big show of checking his wallet, his phone case and pockets before declaring he's forgotten it.  I explained the policy, and that legally I had to refuse the sale.  He grumbled about having a taxi waiting, and he was on the way to pre-drinks before going clubbing with his mates.

I explained again, and pointed out that he'd need the Id to get into a club too, and he left his stuff behind and wandered off grumbling.

20 minutes later, he came racing back in, picked up the sane stuff and bought it to the till, making another customer go in front of him so he could come to me again.  I braced myself for a mouthful, and called the shift manager over, expecting trouble.

When the guy came over, he said he'd wanted to come to my till to say thanks because if I hadn't asked him for the Id, he wouldn't have realised he didn't have it and it would have messed up his whole night, then showed it to me and bought his stuff.  He was 27, 6 months older than me at the time, and I genuinely had him pegged as about 17.

Then he bought me skittles to make my shift go faster. Made my night!"
