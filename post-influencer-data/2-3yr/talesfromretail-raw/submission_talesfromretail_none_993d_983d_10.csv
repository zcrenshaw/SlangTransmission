"A conversation about Pikachu


Hey All, recently discovered this sub and wanted to share a story. I'm on mobile so obligatory warning about formatting ect. 

Its true there's a lot of bad stories in retail, but I wanted to share one story that even today, about six years later still warms my heart. 

At the time I worked in the electronics section of a big box toy store. It was late summer and very slow, so I used my free time to talk with my guests.

A couple and their son walk into my department and I greet them. The kid is wearing a Pokemon shirt. I'll be me (M) lady (L) and Kid (K) 

I exchange usual greetings and the father goes and looks at the games in cases while the mother and son are looking at Nintendo DS accessories. 

M - hey there I like your shirt! 
K - silence but looking at me
M- (thinking he must be shy, but noticing he's paying attention I continue) who's your favorite Pokemon? 
K- (looks like he's really thinking, and fidgeting, he points to his shirt happy) Pikachu! I love pikachu! And he giggles and runs to his dad. 

Now I notice a shocked look on his mothers face and thought oh no, should I not talk about Pokemon? (He was wearing a shirt so I thought it would be okay) 

L- (leans close to me and I notice she's in tears) my son is severely autistic and he barely talks to us, but for him to talk to a stranger is a miracle. Thank you. 

It's the most stand out moment in my retail history thus far, and to think if I had just gone about a usual ""script"" of hi there how are you. That'll be $X.00 please. Thank you"" it would never happen. It pays to talk to people sometimes.

"You don't understand I'M A GAMER


So our return desk closes at 10pm (24 hour store).  Most people are cool about it and if I'm not busy I will hook them up if they have their receipt.

So guy comes in, throws a fit to the front end about the desk being closed (it's almost midnight) so they call me up

Him: Excuse me are you the COS? (I think Sam's Club has these? Don't know what it is). 

Me: Uhh, something like that 

Him: Oh, you're an actual manager.  Good I need to return this mouse

Me: Ok do you have a receipt?

Him:  I need a mouse! I'm a gamer

Me: Ok this all checks out.  I'll give you your money back

Him: I'M A GAMER I PLAY COUNTER STRIKE 

Me: Alright, well I'll just give you your money and-

Him: NO I WANT TO EXCHANGE THIS 

Me:  Alright that's fine, go ahead and get the one you want.   

So he walks off to get his mouse and comes back

Him: WELL I DIDNT REALLY WANT TO PAY $70 FOR A MOUSE

Me: (then why are you buying Razer?). Well sir after the exchange it is $43

Him:  YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR MERCHANDISE MORE CLOSELY 

He pays and storms out.

He was pretty normal when he asked me if he could do the return then flew off the handle and was pissed at me after I offered him his money back.  Never had someone get mad because I was giving them money before."
"""But I don't feel like it anymore!""


That was about 4-5 years ago. Think jewelery kiosk in a mall. I was a salesperson there for about 2 years, and we also took care of returns, fixing broken jewelery etc. There was this middle aged woman who had a terrible taste in jewelery - everything she bought was very exaggarated and over-the-top (therefore expensive) and she looooved returning stuff. One day she comes in and throws a bracelet on the counter without a word.

Me: hi, how are you? How can I help you today.
Lady: hi, i'd like to return this.
Me: ok, do you have a receipt?
Lady: you can locate it on your computer, the name is [Lady].
I look it up, and I see it a. was purchased over 2 months ago, b. she replaced another item in order to buy the bracelet. c. it was clearly worn and used. Not damaged, but used.

Obviously, the right to replace an item is a one time thing, and obviously you can't replace an item you bought two months ago and used. She argues non-stop and is adament on replacing it. 

My patience started running thin. I told her, ""ma'am, would you have liked to pay for an item that has been used by someone else and wasn't new?""

""no, but-""

""And would you like to purchase from a store that was full of items that people kept buying and returning and werent new?""

""No, but-""

""And do you understand that collections change, and we can't accept jeweleries that were purchased that long ago?""

""Yes, but-""

""But what?""

She seemed really frustrated. ""But don't feel like wearing this bracelet anymore!""

The customer after her in line, looking pissed off: THEN YOU SHOULDNT BUY JEWELERY YOU DON'T LIKE IDIOT!

Yeah. People."
