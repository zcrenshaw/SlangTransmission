"When DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM goes terribly wrong


A few years ago, I was working at a used videogame store.  

I was behind the counter, doing morning inventory, when a teenager came in.

TC: Teenage Customer
Me: Me

TC:  Hey, I preordered a copy of INSERT NAME OF GAME HERE last week.  Is it in yet?

Me:  Let me check for you.   Do you have an ID?

Check his ID, and he is only 16.  The game he preordered was rated M, so I couldn't sell it to him.

Me:  Sorry buddy, looks like this game is rated M.  I can't sell it to you because you are under the age of 18.  Is one of your parents in the car?

TC:  NO!  I PAID FOR THE GAME!  I WANT IT!

Me:  Believe me, I want nothing more to give it to you.  You are right, you are paid on it.  Company policy restricts me from selling it to you.

TC:  DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?  DO YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS?

Me:  Buddy, I'm on your side.  I want to sell the game to you, but my hands are tied.  Just come in with your parents or a big brother or even an older friend.  I can give it to you then.

TC:  Enjoy the unemployment line.

He exits.  And I think nothing more about it.  This happens once a week.

The next day, my boss calls me and asks to meet me at the coffee shop next door before my shift.  He commonly does this to go over monthly numbers.

Manager:  Thanks for meeting me.

Me:  Sure thing.

Manager:  Yesterday, did you have a kid come in asking to purchase a game that he preordered?

Me:  Sure did, he was underage so I didn't sell it to him.  

Then I go over the conversation with my boss.

Manager:  I know you followed policy, but that kid's father is a well respected businessman in the area.  The boy's father called my boss's boss, which in turn called me.  I'm sorry, I have to let you go.

Me:  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  For following company policy?

Manager:  Yeah, it sucks, but the father is influential in town and he suggested we let you go, and here I am.  But you get two weeks severance.  Don't worry about your shift today, I'm covering for you.  I need your keys and your badge.

Just like that I was unemployed.  All because I followed corporate policy.

"I met the greatest customer of my life tonight.


I'm a cart pusher. 


It's pretty cold tonight. I'm by myself and it was a pretty miserable night.  A guy walked by saying that ""You're the hardest worker at this store, I see you here all the time."" I was flattered and said thank you, have a good night.


About an hour later the same guy comes back. He went to another store and bought me a present - a reflective yellow winter jacket. I was shocked, and nervous because I know I'm not supposed to accept a gift from a customer (I warned him of that) but decided, this guy probably just spent $30+ to get this for me. I thanked him, said thank you so much. I still can't believe I met such a nice guy. I asked him if he needed anything and he said no, this is for you, you deserve it.


Made my week. :)


EDIT: Here's the jacket.  http://imgur.com/54owNWW. "
"What do you mean I have to pay for it?!


I've worked at a local shop for two years now to get through college and have only just had my first TFR worthy tale.  This is a store where there are over 100 individual booths whose owners pay the store/building owner rent for the space and the ability to sell items in that space. Just for context. 
 
This happened yesterday (Sunday), which is by far our slowest day. So slow that the owner trusts me enough to essentially open and close the store by myself, with the ability to call for backup if something out of the ordinary happens.  A lady comes in with a fur jacket for her dog, wanting to exchange it for a bigger one, as her Chihuahua was slightly overweight. I know this not only because she told me, but also because Chihuahua the Hutt was pictured on her customized phone case. Not relevant, just funny.

She asks where the fur doggo jackets are (there are lots of booths, it's easy to forget where you got something), so I walk her over to them. The jacket she previously bought cost $12. The next size up was $22. This is when it started. DL- Dog Lady. M-Me.  
&gt;M: Okay, since you've already purchased a $12 pupper jacket, and you're looking to exchange it for a $22 jacket, you'll just need to pay the difference.  
&gt;DL: What?

I hesitate slightly, wondering where my words could've been misunderstood.  
&gt;M: Well, when you originally bought the jacket, you spent $12. You've come back to exchange it for a larger size jacket. The larger jacket cost $22. Since you've already spent money in this booth, it's the booth owners policy that if you wish to exchange for an item within the booth that costs more, you'll only need to pay the difference. So you would only need to pay $10 for the new, larger jacket. Does that make sense? 
 
As I progressed through this explanation, her face did not move. It was as if she was a host in WestWorld that was just paused. Then suddenly, as if she was coming to:
&gt;DL: Yes, of course. Do you think I'm an idiot?  

That comment was unnecessary. When also considering that this shop is located in a Hub City on the West side of the Lone Star State where people are usually very nice and polite, it was also a bit surprising. I say ""No, ma'am, not at all,"" and walk back to the registers at the front. 
 
She wanders around for a few minutes before coming to the front with both pup jackets in hand, ready to exchange. I type the necessary information in the system, which is basically giving the larger jacket a value of $10. 
 
&gt;M: Okay ma'am, that will be $10.83.  

She begins to rummage through her purse, which I assume to be her searching for her wallet. So, I bag the new jacket and wait her to give me some form of payment. But no. She was looking for her keys. She found them, grabbed the bag with the jacket that has not been paid for.  

&gt;M: Excuse me ma'am, you haven't paid for that jacket yet. It's $10.83.  
&gt;DL: What do you mean I have to pay for it?!  

Now, at this point I am trying to think of an explanation for what's happening. Is she hard of hearing and not wearing her hearing aid? Does she have the world's smallest blue-tooth in her ear and was never paying attention to me at all? By her tone and demeanor, I can immediately tell this will be an unpleasant conversation from here on out.  

&gt;M: I mean that if you want to walk out of here with that fur jacket for your dog, you'll need to pay for it.  
&gt;DL: Are you accusing ME of shoplifting?!  

what  

&gt;M: No, I am not. I am telling you that you need to come pay for the jacket in your bag.  
&gt;DL: You leeterally just told me that I could exchange this jacket for the one I brought in. You didn't say anything about paying for it!  

I'm dumbfounded at this point. She had to have been intentionally trying to be this stupid.  

&gt;M: No ma'am, that is not at all what I said. I clearly explained to you twice the steps that we would need to take in order for you to get the new dog jacket. You have to pay the difference for the new dog jacket, otherwise I can't let you take it.  
&gt;DL: This is outrageous. I want to speak to your manager immediately. I can't believe that you would lie to a customer's face like that.  

I'm running the store completely by myself. I am the acting manager. She will not like this news.  

&gt;M: At this very moment, I am the manager of the store. The store owner is not here and has left me in charge. But I can assure you that if he were here, he would tell you the exact same thing.  

The way her face began to contort and turn the reddest of reds was quite the sight. She just drops the bag on the floor and stomps to what she thinks is the exit door. The way the front of the store is set up, customers often blow by the exit door and attempt to go out the entrance. Both the entrance and exit doors are one-way foot traffic, so it's near impossible to open the entrance door from the inside. I will usually tell the customer this, as it is extremely common. Not this time. 

I watch as she spends a solid 10-15 seconds shoving and shouldering a door that is not made to be pushed open from the inside. Like I said, near impossible. She screams out ""WHY WON'T THIS DAMN DOOR OPEN!""  
I very calmly say ""You're trying to leave through the entrance. The exit is over here.""
She looks at me, looks at the exit door, and back at me before storming off through the correct way. 

I still don't understand what she expected to happen, but watching her flail at a door made the whole thing worth it. 

Tl;dr: Lady can't do basic math or understand the concept of an exchange of items with different prices, gets mad, and makes herself look very silly.
