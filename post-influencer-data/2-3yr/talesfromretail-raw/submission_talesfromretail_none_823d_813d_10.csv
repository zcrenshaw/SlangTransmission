"""But is says 50% off!!!""


LTLFTP you know the drill. 

So this happened today. A lady came up to my register to ring up some garden decorations and told me she saw it was 50% off. 

Lady: This said 50% off on the shelf is that right?

Me: If it is, it doesn't ring up immediately it will when I press total. 

I finish ringing it up. 

Me: Okay, your total is $Tot.al. 

Lady: But nothing rang up half off!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but it seems that it is not 50% off. 

Lady: But it said so on the shelf!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am maybe it was in the wrong place?

Lady: But it said 50% off! You can't ring that up for me?

At this point, there were a few people in line behind her. Since it's a small store, we only have one cashier at once. I apologize to the other people in line. 

Me: Can you show me where you found it?

I follow her to the shelf. 

Lady: (pointing at the markdown sticker) Here is says 50%... oh. 

Me: Oh it seems that the sale ended yesterday. I'm sorry ma'am. 

Lady: That's alright. I should've looked at it. 

We proceed back to the register, she has me cancel the not-on-sale items and give her the rest. 

Lady: (to the people behind her) Sorry about that folks!

She then leaves and I continue with the rest of the customers. Thought I'd share a more positively ending story to give a relief from all the negative ones here. Moral of the story: Not every customer sucks. Some are actually reasonable. :)

Edit: I get it guys, I should've honored it. I'm fairly new and still learning my way around handling customers. Just didn't want to get on my boss' bad side."
"""But you're here, that means you're open.""


I work in an electronics repair shop that does all kinds of work, mainly cell phones, and accessory sales for most of the stuff we fix. People just die when they don't have their phones, so customers are either thrilled with the short (usually less than an hour) turn around time, or upset that it takes ""so long.""  Employees get there 20 minutes before the store opens to take care of opening duties, normal for any kind of job. That means that sometimes we have people waiting at the front and only door when we get there.

I noticed someone riding my ass on the way into work one day, a silver SUV. When I got over to turn into the back parking lot, surprise surprise, the SUV turned into the store front lot... And was parked outside of the front door. I don't acknowledge anyone outside like this before open unless they come to me, and if they're just asking if we're open I'll have them wait inside and usually take care of the customer a bit early.  Well this lady, L for short, followed me in as I was disarming the security alarm, and tried to put 2 iPads in my hand. This is how it went.

Me: I'm sorry, but we're not open for another 20 minutes, you'll have to wait until then.

L: But I just need to drop these off, I work at 10.

Me: If you'd like to wait inside, that's fine, and as soon as I'm done with opening duties I can check you in. (I haven't even turned the lights on yet)

L: but I'm here now, I can't wait that long.

Me: ma'am it's going to take me about 20 minutes anyway to test your devices and create tickets, and I need to open the store first. 

L: But you're here, that means you're open

Me: ma'am the store doesn't open until 10. (I gesture to the open sign)

L: Oh it's close enough, just hurry up, I don't have time for this. (She's getting annoyed)

Me: okay, give me about 10 minutes, I'll go as fast as I can to open up for you. (Because iPad screens are pure profit. Just a lot of glued glass shard peeling that takes a while for labor)

L: what? No, do it now. I need to drop these off. 

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but no. If you would like to wait, you can, and it'll be about 10 minutes. Otherwise you will need to come back when the store is open.

L: But you're HERE NOW. YOU ARE OPEN.

Me: (okay. Snarky bitch. Fine.) Ma'am, the store is not open until 10 o'clock. I've offered you a space to wait and said I'd ring you in early. You refused. I can't help you further at this point, please leave.

L: NO. You can't throw me out. You're open.

Me: No, we're not. Please leave.

L: Fine, whatever. (Huff)

Big surprise, she came back later....... Wait for it.... 30 minutes til close with the same 2 iPads. My coworker helped her this time. He took her devices in, offered her a discount for bringing in multiple repairs, and then I hear THIS from up front.

Coworker: alright, the total on pickup is $182.43, they'll be ready for you by early afternoon tomorrow.

L: oh no, I can't come back, I was going to wait for them.

CW: uh... Ma'am these will probably take a couple hours each, we're only open until 7.

L: It's 6:30.

CW: We leave the shop at 7 ma'am.

L: Oh, no, I got here before close. I'll wait, it's okay. (Tone of complete ignorance)

At this point I tell the Man(ager) that it's the lady from this morning, and the Man goes up front.

The Man: ma'am I overheard a bit of the conversation, it's going to take about 4 hours for your repairs, and I'm not making my techs stay until almost midnight. We're leaving at 7 and you will need to leave then, too.

L: (she knew. Immediately entering a customer rage) Your SHOP is a WASTE of my TIME. I'm NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!! (Left without her iPads.)

She didn't come back to pick them up for two weeks. She paid in full, didn't make a peep on payment. I feel sorry for her family."
"""Oh, because your fingers are broken?""


I work in retail. M is me, B is bitch lady.

So I just got back from my lunch, I was just starting to work on a project up near the registers. I notice a couple customers in line, nowhere near a lot. I start to take down some shelves to put in new product when I hear ""Is anyone going to come up and open a register?""

M: Okay, I will head up

B: Good idea

When I get to the registers, I notice there is only one person ringing (this shouldn't happen, someone must have went on break when they shouldn't have) I try to ask for more help over the headset but it isn't working (the volume was down, I later noticed), so I asked the other cashier to call some people up.

B chirps in: She already has, and we're just standing  here. 

At this point, I know B is going to make my life hard, because her attitude is very hostile, but I hop on a register. She slams her things onto the counter, along with her credit card.

B: This is a return

M: Do you have a receipt?

B: No

M: Okay... *Looks up and finds in system* would you like to do an exchange? 

B: No, we better not.

I process the return, and ring up her items, careful to give her no excuse to be rude to me. After her purchase is finished, she asks to make a payment on her account, and hands me a check. I get it all set up for her.

B: Just this and then we'll be finished.

M: Can you slide your card, please? 

B: *muttering* Oh, because your fingers are broken? 

At this point I just want the bitch gone. I'm not really allowed to touch customers cards, let alone slide them, and the terminal is facing her, so why would I do it?? 

I stare at her intently but she won't look at me. After I give her her receipt, I tell her to have a nice day and she leaves.

This just happened a few minutes ago, I'm posting to get this out of my head. Every holiday I work, I deal with a Grinch. üòê

Happy 4th everyone

"This was on the clearance rack for 9.99


I hear this excuse all the time. 

A customer brings up a shirt with no price tag on it. They tell me they found it on the clearance rack.  I tell them ""without a barcode to scan I can't give you a clearance price"" 

It hardly bugs me. People are cheap oh well they'd rather pay 8.99 than a whopping 9.99 for a shirt.  

Well today it actually made me mad.  

&amp;nbsp;

We sell designer brands (North Face, Calvin Klein etc) for discounted prices but still pretty expensive. Normal shirts are 9.99. Designer shirts go for $30 and up. 

Today this lady brings up a designer shirt to me without a price tag. She sees me looking up the designer price on my register and she practically yells ""OH THAT WAS ON THE CLEARANCE RACK FOR 9.99""

Already Knowing she's full of it, I say ""can you go grab another one then because without a price tag I can't give you a clearance price""

""That was the only one back there""

Normally I keep my cool and bury my emotions at work.  But this lady triggered me so bad with her stupid lying. I gave her attitude. ""If it's the only one back there and there's no price tag on it then how do you know it costs 9.99??? This shirt is 30 dollars."" 

She called the manager over and told him I was being rude.  Luckily he likes me, and he saw it all for himself. He says to her ""well he's right how do you know it's 9.99 if there's no price tag on it and no more on the clearance rack?"" 

She threw her bags on the counter and stormed out.  

I'm so sick of people who lie.  Do I really appear to be so stupid that I'd think a Calvin Klein shirt costs 9.99 when I've been selling them for two years priced at 30 dollars? Even when they get marked down the lowest they ever go to is to 20.99. 

*Forgot to mention that we don't hang up signs or anything that says ""all items on this rack $10 and under!"" There's literally nothing there that would say the shirt is 9.99 unless she just grabbed a shirt next to it and looked at that price and assumed that was the price. "
