0,"Binkie Exchange


Once upon a time many years ago I work at a big box store. I was a cashier and dealt with all sorts of nonsense but this is my favorite customer interaction. A dad and his son (about 4ish) comes trough my line holding a Woody (toy story) doll. 

&gt;Me: Hey gentlemen, how are you? That's an awesome Woody you have there!

&gt;Dad: we are great thanks. We are just here to do the binky trade in (he winks at me with a ""please play along"" look)

&gt;Me: that's so exciting! It's been a while since I've done one, can you remind me?

&gt;Boy: when you're don't with binkies you trade them for a big boy toy! (As he says this he proudly gestures with a plastic baggie of pacifiers)

&gt;Me: Wow! You're big enough to trade them in already? This is a really great big boy toy to trade for! Can I see both of those so I can do the trade in the computer? (I grab the doll and the baggies scanning both and hand the doll back to the little boy.)

&gt;Dad: ok buddy I just have to slide my card so they know I think you're a big enough boy to do the trade. 

&gt;Boy: I'm gonna miss my binkie but I have to be a big boy now. (He looks at the baggies but hugs his doll closer. His dad quickly pays and whispers that I can toss the baggie as soon as they're gone.)

&gt;Me: you are a big boy, thank you for doing the switch with me today! Enjoy your new toy!

&gt;Boy and Dad: Thank you! 

It was a magical experience to watch that little boy ""grow up"" in such a quick exchange. You could see him walking out with such self importance and pride as they left. I thought it was a sweet moment to be a part of.

Hi guys, here’s one more story from my bakery. Please excuse any mistakes, as English is my second language. So, this lady came in with her teenager son (about 15 years old) and asked for candy A + candy B to be put together in a gift box. These candies have about the same size, yet A is heavier than B. They have the same price. Simple? Not so much.

Lady: “I’d like 500gr from A and 500 from B in the same box please, but don’t mix it, put half on the right of the box and half on the left of it”. 

Me: “Ok, but since you want it as a gift, you should know that A weighs more than B. Would you prefer to just put the same number of pieces of each in the box, so it looks even?”

Lady: “What do you mean? I just want half kilo of each in the box.”

Me: “I meant that since A is heavier, it will be less of it in the box. Now If I just put the same number of pieces of each, it will look much better as a gift”

Her son: “Mom, she knows better, let her make it as she says”. 

Lady (impatiently): “Look, I just want 500gr of each! I don’t know why it’s so hard for you to understand.”

I wasn’t going to argue more, so I made the box exactly as she said. She took a look at it and…

Lady: “But there is more of B here than A. I just asked for half of each!”

Me: “Yes, there’s exactly half kilo of each, just like you said. As I told you before, A is heavier than B”.

Lady: “No, I don’t want it that way. Make it even please”.
 
Her son: “Mom, that’s what she was trying to do”.

Lady (angrily): “Just go and wait for me at the car”.

The boy left, and she didn’t say another word. She just paid for the gift box, didn’t thank me, and left.

I sell jewelry and a dad comes in yesterday with his son and daughter to look for a gift for their mom. They look around for awhile and the kids see about a thousand things they want for their mom and the dad is being really patient going to look at everything the kids point out that mom would “love”, from a $20,000 diamond ring, down to a gaudy silver swan brooch with abalone inlay. After a few minutes of this, the Dad says to me, quietly, “I should not have brought them, I should not have brought them.""

He starts to give the kids reasons why each of these items would just not cut it (or would prevent them from having college funds), when he notices a silver charm that is a [gift box](http://i.imgur.com/GE0A8j9.png).

He says, “Oh I would love to give my wife a present that is literally a present, just for the irony.” I laugh and agree when the son (maybe 10 years old) pipes up and gives us this gem:

“You can’t sell IRONY!!”

The dad and I look at each other with wide eyes… I’m thinking hmm, that’s kind of an advanced concept for this ten year old. I find myself wanting to argue with him, and apparently his dad had the same thought because he says, “Well, a comedian could sell it on stage, maybe…” but clearly neither of us knew what to do with that. So the kid continues..

“But Dad! That’s illegal!

“What do you mean, it’s illegal?”

“They kill the elephants for it!” "
