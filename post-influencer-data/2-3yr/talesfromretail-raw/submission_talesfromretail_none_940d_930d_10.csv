0,"Glory to Arstotzka!


A lady came into my work to sell something using her passport as ID. Something didn't look right. I stared at it a bit before noticing that the expiration date was in a slightly different font than the other dates on the passport. I held it up to the light and saw a rectangular outline around the date. I ran my thumbnail over it, and the edges of a sticker came up off the passport. Underneath the sticker the date had been scratched out. I pulled the sticker the rest of the way off before handing her passport back and explaining that we couldn't accept altered/damaged/expired ID.  
  
I guess all that time playing ""Papers, Please"" finally paid off.  
  
EDIT: Thanks for the gold!"
1,"Bringing in ""bad"" vegetables weeks after you buy them


I work at a fairly big grocery store. A few weeks ago I had a lady come up to me with a mysterious plastic bag. In the bag was some chopped up chunks of something, and a lot of brown liquid.

&gt; Lady: I want a full refund on these vegetables. They were spoiled when I bought them.

&gt; Me: I'm so sorry, when did you buy these?

&gt; Lady: A little over two weeks ago.

&gt; Me: .....what? 

&gt; Lady: Yeah I couldn't come in until now so I stored them in this bag in the meantime. They were spoiled so I want a refund and extra compensation.

&gt; Me: It's very hard for us to know since it has been so long but we'll take your word for it. May I see your receipt?

&gt; Lady: I don't have it. Who keeps receipts for weeks after buying groceries? 

Keeping rotting vegetables in a bag for weeks though, that's totally normal"
