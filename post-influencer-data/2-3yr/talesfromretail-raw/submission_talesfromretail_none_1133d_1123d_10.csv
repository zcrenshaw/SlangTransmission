"We can no longer issue cash refunds, so this customer has a unique idea.


Our store was liquidating to shut down and we were in our final days, we were no longer giving refunds on goods that customers had simply changed their mind on. It was incredibly stressful and customers were being outright rude despite the fact that everyone they were dealing with was being made redundant in days.

One day a chap came in and asked if we could refund a suitcase he bought and changed his mind on. He swapped it for a few other things but he was still short by about ten quid or so. I prepared myself for today's shake down and told him I was very sorry he couldn't have any money back but we were still exchanging if he wanted something to the value. He started pilling sweets, biscuits, cakes etc onto the counter and asking if they added up to the difference, eventually we were still about 10p short. I told him we weren't quite there but we didn't have anything for 10p so it was the best I could do. His response?

""I think you'll have trouble enough eating all of that! Cheerio!"" And off he went, leaving me with a giant pile of free food. Closing the store was an incredibly stressful time but I'll always remember that friendly dude."
"Not a drop to drink...


I was working as a cashier at a sporting goods store on a fairly crowded day. I had been sick the week before and was still recovering a bit. In the recovery, I would be hit with coughing fits. You know the ones: every time you draw a breath, your throat tickles and you cough it back out. 

Well, as I was ringing people up with half a dozen in my line, I start to feel the tickle. I try to hold it back but eventually can't anymore and begin coughing. I cover my mouth with my elbow and just kind of push through the transaction, unable to breathe or catch my breath. I can feel my face turning red -- from all the coughing and not breathing, but I also flush very easily from anxiety -- and just finish my customer out. At this point, my team lead who is walking by just kind of looks over and asks if I'm okay. She never even stops and she's been kind of rude to me in the past so I just nod as I continue coughing like a maniac. By this point, it had been a solid 90 seconds to two minutes of fighting the cough. 

Then the next couple comes up and sets down three bottles of water. As I ring them up and go to put them in a bag, the woman says, ""One of those is for you."" 

I thank her as best I can and, rules be damned, opened it up and took a sip so I could at least wish her a nice day when the transaction was complete. I did so, and even though there were still a few people in line, I ducked behind my stall to drink a little more and cool down. The people waited very patiently and kindly as I recuperated a bit. This all literally made my entire day, and any time after that when I started to hate customers, I'd remind myself that they're not all bad with the memory of those kind acts. 

I love coming here to this sub and empathizing with the negative stories, but I thought y'all might like a positive one for your Friday morning. "
"Those are 2.99


Obligatory warning, I'm on mobile so please excuse formatting

Used to work at a large grocery store chain. I was in the grocery department; stocking shelves, facing off items, and answering questions for customers.

One day this lady comes in with a small dog in her arms. She can be dog lady (DL) I'm facing off the top shelf items on a ladder when she comes up to me and points at a box of potato flakes, the kind you mix with water.

Me: Those are on sale right now for 2.99, if you'd like a case we have plenty out back.

DL: Those are 2.99

Me: Yes ma'am, would you like me to get one down for you?

DL: Those are 2.99

Me: Yes, yes they are. Would you like a box of them?

DL: Those are 2.99

This went on for another minute or two until I was irritated enough to ignore her and go back to work. She walks away but proceeds to peek her head around the corner of the aisle and stare at me while I work for a solid 10 minutes before walking out.

Found out later that she called the police and complained that I was harassing her in the store. Needless to say they didn't bother coming in to talk to me.
