0,"""I'm not leaving here without the Wii."" Yes you are.


It's been over a decade since I worked in retail but reading this sub lately has brought back so many memories and I thought I would start to share.

I worked in a store selling dvds, cds, games, vinyl and a bunch of other entertainment related stuff. This story took place the day after the launch of the Nintendo Wii. 

Our store had guaranteed that if you had pre-ordered a Wii by a certain date then you would get one. If you had not pre-ordered then it was first come, first served for the remaining stock. No one was able to place an order or reserve one after the release day as we could not guarantee when we would get stock back in.

The day after the release, we had just opened and I was standing by the entrance of the door to greet customers when this big angry looking guy comes charging through the door straight up to me ...

Customer: do you have any Nintendo Wii's in stock ? 

Me: Hi, I'm sorry we sold out of the stock we had yesterday.

...on hearing this the customer stamped his foot and slammed his shopping bags against his side. I knew at that point drama was about to unfold.

Customer: Right, well I want to pre order one.

Me: I'm sorry, we can no longer take pre orders as it's now after release day and we are unable to take orders as we cannot guarantee when we will receive stock back in since the product is in such high demand

Customer: That's a lie! 

Me: What? 

Customer: You are lying to me, I was in here 2 weeks ago and was told if I pre ordered I was guaranteed one on the day of release! 


At this point, I'm thinking maybe I've misunderstood  and he has in fact pre ordered so I make an attempt at clarifying...



Me: Oh, are you here to collect a pre order? Do you have your order slip and receipt?

Customer: No I don't have a slip, you should have one for me because I enquired about wanting one weeks ago! Either give me one now or order one for me! My son wants one! 

Me: That's not how it works unfortunately, we only pre order with a deposit. If you have not paid a deposit then we do not have a pre order for you. I cannot order you one either as our system will not let us. 

Customer: This is ridiculous! Get me a manager right now as you are obviously incapable of sorting this mess out. I'm not leaving here without the Wii!


As angry as this guy already was, he was about to get even angrier as I now had to inform him that I was in fact the manager on duty and the only one around.

(I was a supervisor who did opening and closing - supervisors were designated managers on duty when there were no real grown ups around)

The guy flipped out...pointing his finger in my face, calling me a liar, telling me there is no way some little girl was a manager. 

Just as I was starting to worry this guy was about to physically assault me something wonderful happened. I felt something brush over the top of my shoulder from behind and suddenly the customers face dropped and he was being dragged towards the door.

Unbeknown to me, our security guard had just come on shift and was just entering the shop floor when he heard the customer screaming at me.  He walked straight up from behind me, grabbed the guy by his neck and dragged him outside backwards telling him ""you're done."" 

Once outside, the guy stood between me and the security guard...almost foaming at the mouth with rage for a good minute before turning and storming out of sight.

Hello TFR! I come bearing a tale that is one of the most ridiculous customer encounters I've had in my almost 17 years of retail experience.  So buckle up, kids.  It's gonna be a wild ride.

The characters:  
Me: Assistant Manager/slave

SW: Senile Woman, as there's really no other explanation

Relevant to the story: We are unable to take orders over the phone.  Credit cards must be physically swiped/inserted at the register and we have absolutely no way around this.

The setting: a shoe store.  Just a few days ago.  I had just clocked in for my closing shift.  The phone rings.

&gt;Me: ""Good afternoon, thank you for calling ShoeStore, how may I help you?""

&gt;SW: ""Oh hi.  I was in your store earlier today looking at a pair of shoes, and I'm just kicking myself for not buying them.  I'd like for you to ship them to me.""

&gt;Me: ""Unfortunately we are unable to take orders over the phone, but I'd be glad to put them on hold for you.""

&gt;SW: ""But I live alllllll the way in SameStateInWhichMyStoreIsLocated and I can't make the trip alllll the way out there again!""

&gt;Me: ""uh... I'm sorry about that, but I have no way of taking payment over the phone.""

&gt;SW: ""Can I order them online?""

&gt;Me: ""Possibly, which shoe were you looking at?""

&gt;SW: ""I don't know.""

A little back and forth ensues, with her attempting to explain what the shoe looked like and where it was located in the store.  I'm somehow able to find it.  It's a single pair of sandals from last year that are on super mega clearance because, well, they're old.

&gt;Me: ""unfortunately you won't find these on our website, they're from last year.""

&gt;SW: ""well what am I supposed to doooooo??!!""

&gt;Me: *go back in time and buy them when you were here?* ""I'm not sure, ma'am.""

&gt;SW: ""OH! You can ship them to me, and when I get them I'll mail you a check!""

&gt;Me: ""Sorry ma'am, I can't send out merchandise that has not been paid for.""

&gt;SW, getting increasingly frustrated: ""Is there anyone else there I can talk to? A manager?""

&gt;Me, trying to suppress laughter as my manager is staring at me, shaking his head at hearing my side of the conversation: ""No, I'm the only manager here right now.""

&gt;SW: ""Well then, you can buy it for me and I'll mail you a check.""

&gt;Me: ""Excuse me?""

&gt;SW: ""They're not even $20.  You pay for it and I'll send you a personal check.  I'm good for it.""

&gt;Me: ""I'm not going to do that.""

&gt;SW: ""Well is there anyone else there who would?""

&gt;Me: ""No ma'am, no one here is going to buy your shoes for you.""

*staring from my manager intensifies, we both exchange the 'I can't wait to talk about this one' look*

&gt;SW: ""Well I mean this is ridiculous.  All I want is those shoes and no one will help me.  So there's nothing you can do?""

&gt;Me: ""No ma'am, I'm afraid there isn't.""

&gt;SW: ""Well then THANKS A LOT.""

*click*

I burst out laughing and regale my manager with the full conversation.  A nearby customer overhears and also starts laughing.  I spend most of my remaining shift hiding in the back room, I feel like I earned it.

Edit: GOLD? My first! Thank you kind stranger! And I guess I have to thank the crazy lady too, may she find the shoes she's looking for."
