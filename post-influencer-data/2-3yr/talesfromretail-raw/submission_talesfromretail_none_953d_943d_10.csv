"Glory to Arstotzka!


A lady came into my work to sell something using her passport as ID. Something didn't look right. I stared at it a bit before noticing that the expiration date was in a slightly different font than the other dates on the passport. I held it up to the light and saw a rectangular outline around the date. I ran my thumbnail over it, and the edges of a sticker came up off the passport. Underneath the sticker the date had been scratched out. I pulled the sticker the rest of the way off before handing her passport back and explaining that we couldn't accept altered/damaged/expired ID.  
  
I guess all that time playing ""Papers, Please"" finally paid off.  
  
EDIT: Thanks for the gold!"

I work at a hardware store with a garden department.  Said garden department sells bales of pine straw that is in a trailer in the parking lot locked behind a gate.  I get called outside to help the guy with 50 bales, no problem. I was on the phone when I went out there with another customer and when I arrived he had jumped the gate and was inside the locked trailer . I waved him over and asked him politely to get out, he mumbled how he had been waiting forever and whatnot.

TG= Tough Guy customer from now on

Me:  Sir you can't be in the trailer, that's why it is locked.

TG:  I have been waiting for over half an hour I need to go, time is money.

Me:  Yes sir I'm here to help.

*We continue to load he 50 bales without one word being said, it takes around ten minutes.  After we are finished he proceeds to yell at me:

TG:  I didn't appreciate you waving me over.  From a customer service standpoint that is terrible service and you are lucky I don't kick your ass for the insult.

Me:  Um, what?  I don't think I said anything insulting I just asked you to get out of the locked trailer.

TG:  When you were on the phone which was incredibly rude too, you used your phone to wave me out of the trailer

Me:  Yes, well I was on the phone with another customer and if that offended you I cant help you any further.  On the second note, I asked you to get out of the trailer because 1) it's not safe and if you would have tripped on some straw we would have been liable and 2) you jumped a locked gate so you are at fault anyways.

TG:  You better hope I don't come back here after I finish my job and kick your ass.


Anyways, after this outburst but a guy who got mad at me for talking on the phone and telling him not to break the law, I informed my manager if the incident who calmly called the guys company and told them we do not want them back at our store anymore and if we spot that guy we will issue a trespassing charge and call the cops.  Obviously the owner was pissed and tried to get us to change our decision but I don't know what happened next. 

Here's an idea, next time you threaten someone at a store, don't wear a shirt with your company's name on it to trace it back to you."
