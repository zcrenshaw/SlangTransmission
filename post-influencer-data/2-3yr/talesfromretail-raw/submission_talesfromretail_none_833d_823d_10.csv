"""Discount?"" ""No."" ""Please?"" ""No."" ""Do you treat your mother this way?"" ""Yes.""


LTL:FTP

Working in retail, you will always get people asking for a discount. This is normal. Most will grumble a bit, but accept it. This couple, however, refused to believe I would not give them a discount.

Some background: I work in a department store in cosmetics. My department is the only one that without fail will never have a discount. This is due to the fact that we are technically venders. My store doesn't pay me, my vendor does. So, despite the fact that my store literally prints coupons for the customer at every opportunity, I know without looking at a customer coupon that no, it won't work here.

Now, I am just going to post this as a conversation. I don't think you would get the full effect otherwise. 

Me = me
TH - the husband 
TW - the wife

TH - "" I am a card holder, do I get a discount?""

Me- ""sorry sir we don't offer discounts here.""

TH - "" I shop here, why don't I?"" 

Me - ""sorry, we don't have a discount."" 

TW - ""you can give us a discount.""

Me - ""no, sorry.""

TW - ""we have a coupon, we can get a discount.""

Me - ""coupons don't work here, sorry.""

TW - ""you can give us 20%?""

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""10%?""

Me - ""No."" 

TW - ""5%?""

Me - "" No.""

TW - ""its for my daughter?""

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""You are very pretty."" 

Me - ""Thanks.""

TW - "" discount?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""If your mother came in, and was going to buy this perfume for you, would you give her a discount?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""why? She is your mother!"" 

Me - ""No discount.""

TW- ""Can I get that bag?"" (Some brands send bags to give away with their products. The perfume she wanted did not have a bag. You also cannot get a bag with a gift set.)

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""Why not?""

Me - ""You are buying a gift set. Bags only come with single bottles.""

TW - ""so if I get the bottle I get the bag?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""Why not?""

Me - ""That bag is not for this brand.""

TW - ""Can't you give me it?""

 Me - ""No.""

TW - ""please. It's for my daughter. ""

Me - ""No.""

They finally conceded and followed me to the cash register.


And promptly saw that we offer a discount, that applies to cosmetics, if you open a credit card. so despite the fact they already had a card, under the husbands name, they opened a second under the wife's name.

To save how much? 22 dollars

The thing is though, I could've given them a bag, i wouldn't lose my job over it like giving them a discount, but at that point I had transcended to the point on emotionless retail robot that I wanted them to have nothing. 

TL:DR : ""No.""

"I thought he was joking


I've posted a couple of stories from my grocery store days, but here's one from my later retail days of hell.


I was on one of the bigger checkout lanes, and we were short baggers that day. So, me and another cashier were helping each other bag between our own customers. I'm helping her bag a certain order when I get a customer. She was almost done ringing up items anyway, so I went back to my lane.


Me and the guy had been joking around the entire time, until I moved to go back to my lane.


Guy: ""Where do you think you're going? You're not done bagging my groceries.""


I laughed along, thinking he was joking. Until I saw the deadpanned expression on his face and that one vein in his forehead starting to bulge.


Me: ""Well, sir, seeing as how we're shorthanded I was helping you and the cashier out. I have another customer waiting for me, so have a good day.""


Guy: ""Excuse me? You started bagging these groceries and I expect you to finish them.""


It was one of those moments I debated on how badly I actually needed this job, and decided to go for it.


Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you need to have your groceries bagged right now, you have two functional arms and are more than capable of finishing the job. Again, have a good day.""


He sputtered and did end up finishing bag his own groceries, and left rather quickly. I have another story that is much more satisfying than this that I will post sometime soon.

"Sales Bring Out The Worst In People


This happened the other day I just didn't have time to post. Sorry about the length!

So my store had a sale on hand soap. Buy one get one and you get a couple thousand points. Not a bad deal and the points can be saved up for later. Well good sales usually bring the worst types of customers into the store. The coupon crazed, middle aged women who firmly believe that their expired $0.60 off coupon is worth more than the jobs of whatever poor retail slave gets stuck ringing them up. 

Now our website does this cool thing where it tells you what store is closest to you and how much it has of whatever product you're looking for. It updates it's numbers every night after the computer runs its closing programs. Unfortunately we sold all eight cases of that particular soap within the first hour we were open. Apparently our sale coincided with a coupon for $1 off of 2. Since our website hadn't updated yet we had couponers coming in all day demanding hand soap or they would call corporate. 

So we're ten minutes from close, praying that nobody else comes in looking for that dang soap when a woman walked in. You know the type: yoga pants, motivational saying emblazoned across their chest in rhinestones, one of those binders filled with coupons and the ""let me speak to your manager"" haircut. 

She zoomed back to the soap aisle where she was met with an empty shelf and the signs we put up stating that we were out of stock. She came back up the the register, where I had already sent my cashier to start her closing duties, and demanded a manger. I informed her that I was the closing manager and that I would help her if I could. 

She shall be CL (Coupon Lady-for obvious reasons)

CL: Excuse me but your website says you have 96 of this Brand Soap. Your shelf is empty, so I need you to grab the rest from the back for me. I want all 96 of them. 

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but we've been out of them since this morning. If you had come in earlier-

CL (interrupted): Earlier? How could I come in early? I had to clip 96 coupons for this soap because YOUR WEBSITE SAID YOU HAD IT!

Me: Please don't raise your voice at me. We get a new shipment later in the week. The sale will still be running then, if you want to come back--

CL: NO. (Bangs coupon binder on counter for emphasis) you will go get me my soap. I know you have some you're just keeping it for YOURSELF! 

Me: I asked you not to raise your voice at me. Ma'am it's now past closing time, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. If you want you can call the store tomorrow to talk to the Store Manager he might be better able to help you. 

CL: You best be getting him on the phone RIGHT NOW. You ain't a real manager and I AIN'T LEAVING UNTIL I GET SOME HELP. I CUT COUPONS ALL DAY AND YOHR WEBSITE SAID YOU HAD 96! I'm not leaving until I have 96 soaps! 

At this point she was slamming her binder into the counter with each word she spoke. Because that is how reasonable people communicate I guess. 

Me: If you won't leave I'm going to have to call the police. I'll ask you once more to leave and call back at a time when we can resolve this to your satisfaction. 

CL:  F*** YOU B**** I'LL SIT MY A** DOWN RIGHT HERE AND I AIN'T GOIN NOWHERE. 

She then yanked open her binder and started throwing the previously mentioned soap coupons onto the counter. I called the police and she was still in the middle of her adult tantrum when an officer came in. 

As we went through the standard ""what seems to be the problem"" more police cars show up. His little radio thing on his hip starts squawking. After he answered it his whole demeanor changed. He asked her to come with him outside to answer some questions about the car she was driving. 

She turned and bolted but didn't get far before he caught her. My cashier and I watched as he led her to the police car outside. Five other police cars were parked in a semi circle around the truck she had driven. Several other officers were asking her male companion to step out of the vehicle. 

My cashier and I watched from the window (officers told us not to come outside) as they tried for 20 minutes to get the guy to leave the truck. They had guns pointed and everything. 

I heard from the store manager later that the car she was driving was stolen and the guy she was with was her dealer and he had drugs on him. Apparently she was going to pay him in soap? I don't know how that works. It was a roller coaster of a night. 

TL;DR woman freaks out about coupons until I called the police who arrested her and her dealer for driving a stolen truck.
