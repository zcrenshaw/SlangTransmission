"When the lawyer steps in to make everything better


Worked a decade as a salesman at a stereo shop. I've had hundreds of people threaten to sue, not a single one has. A few stand out, and I was just reminded of this gem.

Sold a kid (18/19 years old) a speaker, mentioned it has a  manufacturers warranty against defects. If it's not working, we just swap it out.

Kid comes back later that day, says the speaker doesn't work, he wants a warranty replacement.

Open the box and the speaker has a gaping hole in it. He was screwing it in, slipped, and put the entire drill bit and chuck through the speaker cone. It's obvious that's what happened. (The shape and position of the hole, the fact that not all the screw holes had marks from being used, etc)

I gave him a ""I'm sorry, but this is clearly physical damage, not a manufacturer defect. I can't warranty this.""

He debates, I hand him the warranty information from the manual, he reads it and accepts his fate ([it specifically notes ""damage due to improper installation...accident"" as not being covered](http://www.kicker.com/warranty)). Walks out with his destroyed speaker.

Half an hour later, his parents are in the shop screaming that they're going to sue us, it's our responsibility to replace it, it has a warranty, we ""formed a verbal contract with our client that we'd swap it out if there was an issue"". Dad mentions he's a lawyer a few times during his tirade.

&gt;Me: ""Sir, have you read the warranty information?""

&gt;Him: ""No, that doesn't matter""

I cut him off to say 

&gt;Me: ""So you're not a lawyer then?""

&gt;Him: ""Of course I am! Are you accusing me of lying?""

&gt;Me: ""Lawyers always read a contract before debating it. Misrepresenting yourself as an attorney in order to obtain benefit for another is a criminal offense sir.""

I pointed out the cameras, and mentioned they have audio.

He went silent, looked a bit shocked, and walked out with his broken speaker muttering something about how he's never coming back.

My manager leaned over and asked 

&gt;MGR: ""Is that true? It's illegal to impersonate a lawyer?""

&gt;Me: ""Damned if I know, I'm not a lawyer."""
"No, I won't wait for you.


I work at a pool place. My job mostly consists of testing pool water, selling chemicals and dealing with customers.

On Saturdays we close at 5.

Yesterday (Sept 3rd) at 4:52 the phone rang. I picked it up with my standard friendly greeting, only to be cut off by a loud man (LM) on the other end.

&gt;Me: (Name of Store) VivaNutella Sp-

&gt;LM: Yah Yah what time are you open till?

&gt;Me: Oh, we are open until 5 today.

&gt;LM: Ok I'll be there at 6:20, I can't make it in at 5 so stay open for me.

&gt;Me: I'm sorry did you just say 6:20?

&gt;LM: Yes that's what I said. 6:20. Six-Two-Zero.

&gt;Me: Unfortunately, like I said, we close at 5. There will be no one here when you arrive at 6:20. We open at 10 am tomorrow.

&gt;LM: No you're going to stay open until 6:20. I have a big pool party tomorrow and I need to get shock and chlorine and have my water tested.

&gt;Me: *getting annoyed* I'm sorry, but once again we are closed at 5. If you can manage to make it here before 5 then I would gladly help you with everything you need, but as things stand, my boss would not allow me to stay a full hour and a half or more (after helping him) just to help one customer. Plus even if I could, I wouldn't.

&gt;LM: Are you serious? What kind of pool place are you guys? I've shopped with you guys for years and I do this all the time. They always let me.

&gt;Me: They? Who is they?

&gt;LM: You know, the guys who work in the store. One of them is tall with longish red hair.

&gt;Me: *Annoyance Intensifies* That's actually really funny because the entire staff that works inside the store are females who are either blonde or brunette.

&gt;LM: Well it doesn't matter because I'm coming at 6:20 and you're going to help me.

At this point it is 5:00.

&gt;Me: No, I won't. Like I said 3 times already, we close at 5. Speaking of 5, that's the current time. So I'm sorry I couldn't help you, I'll be glad to help you at 10 am Sunday morning. Have a nice night.

He started talking again but I just hung up the phone. He didn't come in today, I hope his pool party went swimmingly.

*A lack of planning on your part, doesn't constitute an emergency on my part.*"
"Your floor broke my water bottle.


So...  I work in an outlet mall... Today is super busy and everyone is super stressed, but were making an effort to stay polite and friendly. 


Customer walks up to me at the register as im working on ringing someone up, 


""your floor broke my water bottle! ""


""... What?"" 


""your floor,  it broke my bottle! ""


I grab another employee to take over the customer. 


"" show me... ""


I get over and see her friend trying to hide broken glass...  Now,  i work at a shoe store... Broken glass is bad for business. 


""... So you dropped your bottle?"" 


""... Yes... ""


God damnit folks,  if you screwed up,  just ask for help.  Dont blame my floor! Its been dealing with stinky feet all day.


TLDR: floors have feelings too."
