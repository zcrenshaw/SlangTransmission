"""Don't let my wife see.""


First post (to TFR), let's see how this works.

I work in a small, locally owned toy shop in little college town, however we have a lot of down to earth people and families.

Couple comes in with three kids and immediately the kids go crazy, wanting to show their parents every single toy in the store. 

It's a small store but is broken into three distinct sections, rooms connected by walkways. We have a card rack next to the cash wrap that has all sorts of cards.

As the wife is being dragged by her kids around the store, the husband comes up to me and quietly goes ""Don't let my wife see, we are big star wars fans"" and slides me [this](http://imgur.com/a/rLtK7) card and cash to pay for it. I quietly make small talk with him about the weather and ring him up. I finish just in time as his wife and kids walk around and then grab their dad to go beg and ask for toys. 

I'm chatting with the mom and she sees a card on the card rack and says ""This would be perfect for [husband] but don't let him see this,"" and slides me cash, finishes the transaction and winks. It's the exact same card. 

They finish their shopping, purchase a few toys for their three kids and walk out, both chuckling to themselves about how clever they are. 


edit: aw geez guys, this is the best post I've ever had on Reddit, ever. It made me so happy to share this with y'all. Have a bomb ass day!

Edit 2: changed to ""first post in TFR"" because I'm a little goon who ended up confusing some people. Thanks for putting a smile on my face, guys, Reddit has never made me so happy to share a story :) and HOLY MOLY! My first ever gilded post too! Guys you're all too nice! I hope your kids make you breakfast in bed once a week! "
"Two Chinese men and a translator enter a store.


I work at BBQ shop here in Australia, I've dealt with all kinds of customers in my 3 years of experience until today I had the most memorable experiences yet.

Today I had two Chinese men walk in and they looked to be in their early 20's or so. They walked around for a bit before I approached them and asked if they needed any help, it suddenly became clear they didn't know a word of english when one pulled out his phone and started using a translator. Soon fleshed out they were looking at a BBQ we have in stock and some accessories, after about 25 minutes going back and forth with the translator they had all they wanted. 
Normally this transaction only takes about 5-10 minutes on average but I didn't mind as we were all being patient with each other.

I rang up all the items and showed them a full break down of the items which total around $500. I had all the products ready to go in a pile next to the register when he finished paying. When it all finalised he leaned in to shake my hand and said in perfect english.

&gt; ""Oh, just so you know, we speak perfect fucking english mate""
 
Both these men erupt into laughter while I'm sitting shaking my head and laughing as well thinking how the fuck did I fall for it. After we all slowly regained ourselves one of the men leaned in and said how well I took it. May not seem all that funny in writing, but its totally made my week.

"How to mortify a tween kid


I work part time in a mid-sized retail store, pretty close to a local school, so we get a lot of school kids in around 12 buying snacks and candy and what not during recess. A lot of the same kids, so over time i've come to recognize a lot of them. One of the groups were quite loudly talking about dabbing, and about how fun it would be to see an employee dab while working.

I could have taken the easy route and just dabbed right there and made his day, but i didn't, and it would turn out to pay off.

A few days later the same group of kids come in, but this time with the dab-kid's mom as well. They're still talking about dabbing, and getting an employee to bad, probably hoping i overhear it. I was about to do it, but then their mom walks towards me, with the kind of mischevious grin only a mother can muster. The kid, the mom, and myself share a moment - we all know whats about to go down. The mother and i with mischievous grin, and the kid with a mortified look on his face.

""Wanna Dab with me?"" She plainly asks. 

I dab.

She dabs.

The kids friends are looking in awe.

dab-kid is mortified, then hangs his head in shame, as his friends start to laugh.

A plan that started out as a way to get a little bit of street cred suddenly backfired, as his friends watched his mom commit the ultimate act of embarrassment.

Made my day though."
