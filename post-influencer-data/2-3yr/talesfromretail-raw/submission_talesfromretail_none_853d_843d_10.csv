"""I'm not paying by cash or card.""


Back story is, I work at an Australian grocery store and have done so for 9 years.


So I was recently working in our self-serve area, guiding people where to go and whatnot, and some machines had issues so that they were only taking card transactions, since they didn't have enough cash in them to give change without issues.


Since it's a busy day, customers are coming through, noticing it's crowded, and queuing at the beginning of the area. That's fine, I use that as an opportunity to catch them and ask ""are you paying by cash or card today?"" in order to direct them to the right area.


For the most part, it's fine, until one future wrestling star barges past the line and doesn't see an empty spot. I tell him to go back to the queue since people are waiting, and he does, mumbling under his breath.


As it comes to be his turn, I ask if he's paying by cash or card, his response is one I've not heard before. ""Neither,"" he spits at me. I'm half-considering calling security by this point, but I give him the benefit of the doubt. ""I'm sorry? Will you be using the cash or card facilities today?"" ""Neither mate, geez, I'm paying with coin, what are you, thick?""


In addition to being shocked by his attitude, it took me a while to realise what the heck he just said. Sure, I get that most people equate cash with good ol' fashioned foldin' money, but how do you enter your adult years without realising that coins, and any other form of physical currency, is cash?"
"""IF YOU DON'T MOVE IN TEN SECONDS I'M GOING TO RUN YOU OVER""


So out here in the UK it's been stupidly hot recently, so everyone's feeling super tired on our Thursday evening shift at the Supermarket. We close at 8:00, and it's about 7:20 when the events started. I'm trying to organise the trolleys so I can lock them up in a little bit, when a 30-ish year-old comes out of the shop and sits on the bench opposite the trolleys. Ok. That's alright; slightly inconvenient since it doesn't give me much room to move the trolleys but I'll live.

I walk inside after sorting out the trolleys to get these annoying industrial cable things we use to tie the trolleys and I see the dude starting to smoke on the bench. We've got a strict policy against smoking here since it's outside the door - hence why there's a big red sign on the bench, but maybe he didn't see it. I walked outside and informed him, 

Me: ""Sorry sir, but it's against the rules to smoke on on the premises. There's a bench over there *points* where you can smoke.""
Dude: ""What the F¥#$!? I've just F*#$ing bought your overpriced S#¥$ and I can't even smoke here!"" 
Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but it's against our rules""
Dude: Storms off somewhere

I continue to lock up the trolleys and collect more from each of the bays. Now, I'll be honest here, I'm not the, I'm not the strongest of teenagers so when I'm pushing these trolleys I look like a complete arse doing it super slowly. I'm trying to pushing about 9/10 trolleys up the slope which is the car park going at 0.01mph across the zebra crossing when I hear: *HONK HONK*

Dude: ""GET OUT OF MY F*#$ing WAY!""
Me: I can't move since there's another car loading off an elderly lady which is blocking the crossing - ""There's a car blocking the way. I'll try and be as quick as possible""
Dude: ""IF YOU DON'T MOVE IN TEN SECONDS I'M GOING TO RUN YOU OVER""

I've dealt which crazy threats in the past, but nobody ever does anything, so I repeat what I previous said about being as fast as possible. The man continues to beep his horn at an alarming rate. The car which was blocking my way was starting to move as I release the trolley brakes and start to push the trolleys when I hear the revving of a car engine and the car coming towards me! I ran backwards to get out the way when the massive crash of the dude's car colliding with the trolleys occurs.

To cut the story short he starts trying to blame it on me as my store manager comes out along wth security. After days and a police report, the CCTV proved, along with witnesses, that it was the man's fault and he was fined ~£1250 for the damage to trolleys. Oh, and I got a store gift card because they felt bad I had to be in the situation

TL;DR: I told a smoker he cannot smoke outside the store and he stomped off. Later he tries to run be over and hits my trolleys. Is later fined the cost of the damage and I get a free store gift card


Edit: just going to pop this edit here in case any more questions are asked about what's happened to him. I assume he's been charged or whatever. My store have said they'll keep me updated, but they're speaking to my parents more than me so I maybe I'm missing some big facts on what's happened. So I hope that has kind of cleared it up :)

Edit 2: I'm going to speak to my parents about what is happening and what I should do about pressing charges if that's not already happening

Edit 3: Grammar and punctuation changes

Edit 4: I didn't expect so much response! Thanks for the gold you beautiful human, and thanks for all the advice. I've spoken to my parents they've apparently talked to the police; it's still ""under investigation"" they said which isn't too much help. I'll keep this updated or make a new post when I find out more :)

Edit 5: Found out he was charged around £1250 for trolley damages - but then of course he'll also have to pay for car repairs since he hit a bunch of trolleys"
"""That was never explained to me""


So a while back I worked for a car parts store and a women walked up to my assistant manager (whom I got on with really well) asking for a refund on a headlight bulb. I was manning another till next to him and the day was reasonably quiet so I could hear a lot.

My assistant manager told this women that she couldn't return the bulb because
A. The box was damaged beyond repair
B. It was the blown bulb in the box, completely different brand to the box.
She called him an idiot for not thinking of the customer and demanded to see the manager, once the manager came to the front till he asked her the situation and once she told him everything he repeated almost word for word what my assistant manager said.

She said and I quote ""oh that's fine then, he (pointing at my assistant manager) never explained a word of that to me"" 

Never thought I could hate someone more."
