"""He's too abrasive""


I have the wonderful luxury of working for a company that doesn't tolerate poor attitudes, and isn't afraid to have one back. 

It's holiday season, the Mall is absolutely packed, we've got all hands on deck and everyone in their highest performance zone. 

Customer comes up to my register and the conversation goes as follows. 

C: That guy up front needs to shutup, he's too abrasive.

I peak over and see my coworker doing exactly what he's supposed to do, keep energy high, talk to everyone, keep the mood light. 

Me: Pardon? 

C: He's too much, can you pull him aside?

Me: No. But you can leave if it's bothering you. 

Customer looked at me for a second and then asked if I could grab a manager, I point him in the direction and they both come back to my work area to clear things up. 

Manager: Did you tell him he could leave?

Me: Yes

The customer then reiterates his complaint. 

Manager: Yeah, no. Fuck off. You can leave. "
"""Ma'am I can't complete this sale, as it would be theft.""


Football season had JUST started at my store, so we were putting out flags for our college football team. So no item that has the logo on it would be on clearance (this is important later). We are also a register in an obscure part of the store less than 10ft from an exit. We have a security door and have to press a button to let people out but we still need to be on guard. Enter a woman at our register (C) and a coworker (CW) and myself (M).

M: Can i check you out for today?

C: Yessir. Everything super busy?

M: Yes ma'am. Store is moving quick to get ready for tailgate season.

I get to this 10ft (~3m) tall knife flag. And it has a clearance sticker on it. Thinking that it can't be right i look at the sticker and scan it. It rings up as a beach towel. I quickly void the item and peel the sticker off (which was loose) and put it on my desk. And then ring up the correct barcode.

C: That's supposed to be 15 dollars.

M: Ma'am that price would be for the label that's right here. (Shows her the clearance label) And the item its listed for is a beach towel. You can see the item name on that label. This is a knife flag we just put on the shelves a few days ago. It couldn't be on clearance.

C: But it's on sale.

M: The knife flag is not ma'am. The beach towel that this label belongs to, is. There is nothing I can do except ring you up at this price (64 dollars) for the flag.

C: ITS ON SALE. SELL IT TO ME FOR 15 DOLLARS.

CW (walking up): What seems to be the problem?

M (discreetly): This woman is trying to purchase this item with a label for a different item from the clearance section.

CW: Ma'am this label is for an entirely separate item. We cant sell it to you at this price.

So she rants and raves. We give her the knife flag back, she also snatched the label which i SHOULD have thrown away) and goes toward the garden center register (about half the time customers that do the garden/automotive register dance are usually up to no good to begin with). I call LP and have them follow her. She does the same thing at the garden center register (she reapplied the label) and said it was on sale. They denied it, so she left the flag there, and left the store with haste. I was correct in my standing as the flag was NOT on clearance and she tried it on the electronics register before mine. People think we are so stupid.

EDIT 4: Wow."
"I forgot about a customer on the phone. She was not pleased. She came to the store to tell me about it.


I work at (GAME STORE). The other day, a woman called and asked if we had a specific game available. I was dealing with a customer at the register already, so I told her I could check for her soon, and put her on hold.

Out of nowhere, there's a rush of people and I forget that she's on hold. About ten minutes after she had first called, and the rush is over, she calls again.

""I was on hold for twenty minutes! You forgot about me!"" she yelled.

I was slightly embarrassed. ""Oh, I'm very sorry, ma'am. It got quite busy and I forgot I had you on hold. Let me check on that game for you.""

""No! I don't care about that anymore! What you did was very rude!""

I'm kind of at a loss since I've already apologized to her, and am not sure what to say.

""I... I'm sorry ma'am. It was an accident. Is there anything else I can do for you?""

""What, you want me to ask a question so you can put me on hold and then never come back again? I don't think so!"" *click*

It was a rather strange interaction (not the strangest, though). I thought it was over, until about thirty minutes later when she came into the store.

""Are you Knever?"" (I always give my name when answering the phone at work, as I'm sure we all do)

""Yes, how can I help you?""

""I was the one you forgot about on the phone.""

Now, I'm a bit socially awkward. In certain situations, I don't know what to do. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, it happens hard. I try to process what's happening. This woman called on the phone, I put her on hold and accidentally forgot about her, she was upset, didn't want help anymore, and is now in the store. I figure she was just trying to be funny, and did in fact now want the game she had inquired about. It was the most logical possibility.

""Oh, sorry again about that, ha. It was really busy when you called and things got a little out of hand. But I think we have that game for you-""

""I don't care about the damn game. I wanted to come confront you for what you did.""

She wants to confront me. Now I'm really confused. Like, she wants to fight me, or something? I honestly had no idea why she was there if she didn't want to buy something.

""Uh... I'm sorry?""

""You heard me. You were rude to me on the phone and I want to speak to your manager.""

I'm part of the managerial team, but not the actual manager. She is right beside me, though, and comes over when she hears.

""Hi, ma'am, I'm the manager, how can I help you?""

""Your employee over here was rude to me on the phone.""

I can see that she is also confused.

""Oh, yes, sorry about that. I was here and it was pretty busy, he was actually pretty embarrassed about forgetting about the phone but I reprimanded him about it.""

She hadn't, but she could tell this woman wasn't going to be satisfied by anything less. Little did we know...

""Well, what good does that do me? I want to see you yell at him now! He needs to get in trouble!"" she demanded.

I thought I was on Candid Camera (does that show still exist?). She actually wanted to see me get yelled at. Because I accidentally forgot about her on the phone.

""I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm not going to do that. He's apologized to you, and I've apologized to you. It was an accident and I heard him still trying to help you. What else can we help you with today?""

She looked defeated.

""Nothing. I just wanted to come here to give you a piece of my mind.""

She turned and left in a huff.

My manager and I looked at each other and kind of laughed, while another customer made fun of her as soon as she had left.

""*Oooh, you were rude to me! I want you to yell at him!* What crazy witch!""

EDIT: Okay, let me see if I get this right:

*ahem*

WOAH! This really blew overnight!"
