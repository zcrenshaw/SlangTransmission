"Druggies don't like Windex


Long time lurker, first time posting. Quite a short story but wanted to share it. 

So about 3 years ago I had just started working at a butcher shop in my local mall. As the newbie I was sent out front to clean our glass display and deal with all the customers who couldn't tell we were obviously closing (we closed at 6, other shops at 7). Only equiped with a piece of cloth and a bottle of windex I began my duties.

About half way through the job I hear someone screaming:

""YOU'VE USED TO MUCH WINDEX YOU F---ING C---""

Taken back by surprise I look up to see the local mall druggie approaching full speed with the mall security tailing behind. As he gets closer he takes a swing at me which I dodge, thus throwing him off balance and sending him flying into a trashcan. As he gets up he turns to look at me and give his last final words of wisdom:

""Stay in school.""

Before finally being tackled by security.

And that's how I got the nickname Windex Kid."
"""What about the candy your kid put in his pocket?""


I just remembered an old story from when I worked at a grocery store. I was a cashier, and a woman came through my line with her two children. 

The girl was smaller than the boy, and the boy was tormenting her as a result (hitting her, poking her, pulling at her, just bothering her basically). To her credit, she never hit him or poked him back and instead kept yelling at him to stop. The mom was basically doing that monotone ""Cut it out. Stop it."" that extremely checked-out moms have perfected. Pretty par for the course at this point.

Except as mom is putting up the groceries, her son takes a pack of candy (I think it was some kind of Hershey's chocolate) and sticks it in his pocket. When he sees me watching, he smirks at me and sticks out his tongue. So, of course, game on.

I put on my cheery, retail smile, and start scanning. As the order flies by, the kid starts to look around and get bored. I guess he thought he got away with it. 

I wait until the very end, and as the woman pulls out her card to pay, I smile and say, ""How about the candy as well?"" This kid's head spins around from looking at the end of the register and he gives me the most incredulous expression.

The mother looks at me and goes, ""What candy?"" Looking in her son's eyes the whole time, I say, ""The candy your son stuck in his pocket earlier.""

This woman goes from 0 to 100 in 1 second flat. She spins around, and starts SCREAMING at her son, waving her arms, just flipping out, and spanked him. The kid is freaking out, and his little sister is just looking on with the most satisfied expression I've ever seen. She pays and hauls him out of the store; the candy bar at the edge of the register as a homage to the craziness that just occurred.

As horrible as I feel about that kid getting spanked, I hope it makes him think twice before acting like such a little jerk again!"
"Children - speechless one moment ...


So it's almost Easter and at the chocolate shop I work at, a certain popular product is sold for $4.95. Therefore I've been getting many instances of excited small kids racing to my till with exactly $5 so that they can pay for their own chocolate. And every time I give them all the time I can - they're always without fail the most polite customers I'll get in the day and I think it's nice to give the kids practise at this kind of thing.

Today I had a little girl come and buy some chocolate, giving me her $5 very proudly. I gave her a bag, put her receipt inside etc. Our shop gives out free tastings to each customer so I leant over and said 'I have an important question for you - would you like some chocolate to eat now?'

The girl looks at me gravely with big eyes, like 'I didn't expect this', then nodded. We have an awesome easter chocolate range and I gave her a bit with her bag, wishing her a happy easter. Once again she just nods at me; no problem, kids get shy. She walks out of sight; 5 seconds later I hear a high pitched girl's voice yell 'MUM THE LADY GAVE ME THIS AND IT'S REALLY GOOD!'

This is what I go to work for. :)"
