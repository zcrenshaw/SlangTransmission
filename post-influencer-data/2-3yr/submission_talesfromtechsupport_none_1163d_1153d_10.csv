"""I would never pay someone to do this in a million years""


Hey TFTS, me again with another short one.  
This happened the other day at work where we sell electronics and fix computers/devices.

Characters: $donut, $cust.

&gt; $donut: Hi! What can I help you with?  
&gt; $cust: Well I need some advice.  
&gt; $donut: (thinking this was probably about Windows 10 or something like that) Sure, ask away.  
&gt; $cust: My aunt has a computer that's really messed up, and I need to get it working again. I was thinking of just boot-nuking it and reinstalling Windows from scratch.  
&gt; $donut: Sounds like a great idea if you think it's easier to do it that way. Did you need to get some important data transferred? What else did you want to know?  
&gt; $cust: I was wondering how you go about making Windows 10 bootable and how you install it.  

Now, I couldn't just tell him how do it, mainly because we offer that as a service. He wasn't too happy that I recommend that we do it for him.

&gt; $donut: I can get you a rate for a Windows installation if you like.  
&gt; $cust: Oh, I would never pay someone to do this in a million years! I just need to know how to do it. 

I never ended up telling him..."
"I f'd up and now you're gonna get fired!


Hi there, this is the tale of one of the most incompetent owners of a computer repair shop. This tale is quite old, like 2007-2008.  I worked at that particular computer store, which is odd, because I was the only one in that store who knew ANYTHING about computers.  I had to label all the items, assign them prices (my boss thought an 8800 Ultra was worth $30) and do all things to keep the lights on in this particular store.  One evening, my employer (I'll call him **$Boss**) walks to me:

&gt;**$Boss**: Hey **$Me**, you need to fix this box that makes all my Netscape.  
&gt;**$Me**: Yeah, I'll take a look.  
[I walk into his room, staring at his monitor which has smoke coming from the inside, the back of his monitor has been cut off and there's a VGA cable crammed between two capacitors]  
&gt;**$Me**: Boss, there's smoke coming out of your monitor.  
&gt;**$Boss**: Yeah, I saw a picture of a screen on that Netscape box (His monitor) that looks really cool, so I took the hacksaw and cut the back of mine off.  Now it looks like the one on the picture but it won't show me my Netscape. Part of it went up in flames while I did that.  
[**$Boss** had cut his monitor in half while it was powered on.]  
&gt;**$Me**: Why did you do that? Electronics are not designed to be cut in half. You're gonna need a new one.  
&gt;**$Boss**: No problem, I'm gonna use the screen included in my stereo.  
[**$Boss** wants to use the vacuum flourescent display of his 80's style boombox]  
&gt;**$Me**: That's not gonna work. You have to get a new one.  
&gt;**$Boss**: Can't we just repair this one? I mean, you can fix everything, you're a wizard.  
&gt;**$Me**: **Boss**, it's burning! There's smoke coming out of this thing! Literally everything inside this is shorted out, there's no way of fixing it! it's beyond repair!  
&gt;**$Boss**: I can't do this anymore! All this electronic stuff wants to kill me! F--- this s---! I'm closing this stupid store down!  
[**$Boss** storms outside the building]  
&gt;**$Me**: *Sigh*  

The next morning I got a hand-written letter in the mail which said that I was fired because of ""personal reasons"".  **$Boss** is now working in a library.  

I still can't believe this guy opened up a computer store. "
