"""IF YOU DON'T MOVE IN TEN SECONDS I'M GOING TO RUN YOU OVER""


So out here in the UK it's been stupidly hot recently, so everyone's feeling super tired on our Thursday evening shift at the Supermarket. We close at 8:00, and it's about 7:20 when the events started. I'm trying to organise the trolleys so I can lock them up in a little bit, when a 30-ish year-old comes out of the shop and sits on the bench opposite the trolleys. Ok. That's alright; slightly inconvenient since it doesn't give me much room to move the trolleys but I'll live.

I walk inside after sorting out the trolleys to get these annoying industrial cable things we use to tie the trolleys and I see the dude starting to smoke on the bench. We've got a strict policy against smoking here since it's outside the door - hence why there's a big red sign on the bench, but maybe he didn't see it. I walked outside and informed him, 

Me: ""Sorry sir, but it's against the rules to smoke on on the premises. There's a bench over there *points* where you can smoke.""
Dude: ""What the F¥#$!? I've just F*#$ing bought your overpriced S#¥$ and I can't even smoke here!"" 
Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but it's against our rules""
Dude: Storms off somewhere

---

I continue to lock up the trolleys and collect more from each of the bays. Now, I'll be honest here, I'm not the, I'm not the strongest of teenagers so when I'm pushing these trolleys I look like a complete arse doing it super slowly. I'm trying to pushing about 9/10 trolleys up the slope which is the car park going at 0.01mph across the zebra crossing when I hear: *HONK HONK*

Dude: ""GET OUT OF MY F*#$ing WAY!""
Me: I can't move since there's another car loading off an elderly lady which is blocking the crossing - ""There's a car blocking the way. I'll try and be as quick as possible""
Dude: ""IF YOU DON'T MOVE IN TEN SECONDS I'M GOING TO RUN YOU OVER""

I've dealt which crazy threats in the past, but nobody ever does anything, so I repeat what I previous said about being as fast as possible. The man continues to beep his horn at an alarming rate. The car which was blocking my way was starting to move as I release the trolley brakes and start to push the trolleys when I hear the revving of a car engine and the car coming towards me! I ran backwards to get out the way when the massive crash of the dude's car colliding with the trolleys occurs.

To cut the story short he starts trying to blame it on me as my store manager comes out along wth security. After days and a police report, the CCTV proved, along with witnesses, that it was the man's fault and he was fined ~£1250 for the damage to trolleys. Oh, and I got a store gift card because they felt bad I had to be in the situation

TL;DR: I told a smoker he cannot smoke outside the store and he stomped off. Later he tries to run be over and hits my trolleys. Is later fined the cost of the damage and I get a free store gift card


Edit: just going to pop this edit here in case any more questions are asked about what's happened to him. I assume he's been charged or whatever. My store have said they'll keep me updated, but they're speaking to my parents more than me so I maybe I'm missing some big facts on what's happened. So I hope that has kind of cleared it up :)

Edit 2: I'm going to speak to my parents about what is happening and what I should do about pressing charges if that's not already happening

Edit 3: Grammar and punctuation changes

Edit 4: I didn't expect so much response! Thanks for the gold you beautiful human, and thanks for all the advice. I've spoken to my parents they've apparently talked to the police; it's still ""under investigation"" they said which isn't too much help. I'll keep this updated or make a new post when I find out more :)

Edit 5: Found out he was charged around £1250 for trolley damages - but then of course he'll also have to pay for car repairs since he hit a bunch of trolleys"
"Yes, small child! I am a princess!


A former coworker reminded me of this the other day and I thought I'd share:  
During my long stint in multiple departments of a big box craft store, I spent about 6 months in charge of floral. All of the fall and Christmas flowers seemed to be saturated with glitter. This led to me being dusted in glitter on a daily basis.  
Glitter in my hair... Glitter in my ears... Glitter everywhere.  
So one day at work I'm fully glitterized from moving around product when I get paged to cashier. A mother and her (maybe 4-5 years old?) daughter are in my queue. The little girl stares at me with wide eyes and belts out: ""ARE YOU A FAIRY PRINCESS?""  
I decide to roll with it and in a hushed voice tell her, ""Yes! But we have to keep it a secret!"" She nodded, satisfied that a fairy princess was selling her craft supplies.  
It wasn't until later it dawned on me that the whole exchange was because of the glitter. :/"
"I am a wizard.


So, this story happened 3-4 years ago, but I completely forgot about it until recently. 

I used to work in the paint department of a big box hardware store. It was a really slow day, and I had already finished most of the stuff I had to do for the day, from what I remember, there was some pretty heavy snow, and people were pretty much just traveling for emergency needs, and there's no such thing as a paint emergency. So, anyway, this guy wanders by my department, and he doesn't seem to be all there. He gets about halfway past my desk, and he stops, and stares at The paint swatches. He comes closer to them, and starts inspecting them, like, really closely. I just think ""whatever, guy might either just like color, or wants to get a good one."" We try not to bother people during the color selection process, since that's all personal preference. 

So, this guy is there for almost an hour, going from color collection to color collection, and he has his phone out, and appears to be taking notes, but doesn't take any swatches off the wall, which is weird, but, again, I've seen weirder. Then he heads back to where we keep the unmixed paint (side note: if you're buying paint, don't grab the can for the employee, it might be a different one than what you grabbed, and then we have to put it back. I get the idea, but please, we don't even know what it will be sometimes, we just have a guess, and then the computer tells us). 

He comes up to me after about half an hour and he asks me ""hey, man. Those boxes up in the high shelves, do they have more paint in them?"" 

Me: Yes. 

Him: How many are in there?

Me: Four gallons to a box. 

Him: oh, alright. 

And then he goes back to the paint. 

I could tell he was high by the way he was talking, very slowly, incredibly delayed reactions, and his eyes were super red. Why he came here high during a blizzard was, and still is, a mystery. But I finally realized what he was doing. *He was counting the number of  colors, and how many paint cans we have.* 

He came back up after another fifteen minutes. 

Him: Hey, so... There are way more colors than there are paint cans. What happens if someone wants a color that you don't have? 

Me: Well, I make the colors. 

Him (in all seriousness): Are you a wizard!?

Me: ... Yes... 

Him: Don't worry, color wizard, your secret is safe with me. 

He then wandered off, never to be seen again. I still have many questions, none of which will ever be answered, but at least I was blessed by the high color counter. "
