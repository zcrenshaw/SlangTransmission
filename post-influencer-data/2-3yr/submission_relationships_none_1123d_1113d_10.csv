"UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me &amp; I don't know how to handle this.

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth &amp; nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom &amp; sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

**Edit:** Formatting

**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby &amp; me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. 

Love to you all.


**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

"I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me &amp; I don't know how to handle this.


Well, title kind of says it all. Throwaway because my husband is active on Reddit. He's probably on it now.

Here goes: I've been with my husband for 5 years, married for 1.5. I've never *once* doubted his fidelity. He's great. Super smart, funny, handsome, and, I **thought**, loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt him or be suspicious.

I thought it was kind of odd when he downloaded snapchat; he's not big on social media. I have one, but I'm not very active. We rarely snap each other. He said his friends were really active and he liked it better than Facebook, so. As I said, I've never had any reason not to trust him. So I thought nothing of it. 

This morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said ""Mom"". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named ""Roxy"". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said ""I want your tongue inside me again"".

Now. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are ""best friends"". **WTF**.

I feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.

Here's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.

He's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. 

**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby &amp; me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She ""stalked"" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting). I told him it was urgent; we are meeting tomorrow morning. I will try to update as much as I can and from the bottom of my heart, thank you all again, Internet strangers!

"My [26F] sister's [22F] friend [22F] is a nurse and told my sister some test results of mine. Should I report her?


I had to get a TB test done for some clinic work I'll be doing this year in my grad school program. My sister's friend works as a nurse at the clinic I go to. She wasn't the one who took my blood for the test and as far as I know, the nurses don't actually do the lab work. 

Anyway, I got a call from my sister a few days later saying ""Tina"" told her my TB test was positive. Now, due to the nature of my grad school subject I know that sharing medical information is HIGHLY prohibited and she could get fired or worse. I don't really care if my sister knows my test results, but apparently she was talking about this at a party. It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that. 

Initially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing. 

Thoughts?

TL;DR My sister's friend shared my medical test results. Should I say anything to the clinic?
 
Oh and regarding the TB, I had further testing done and it's latent. I'm going to get treated for it but it's not active or contagious. "

Hi :)

I feel like I should address a very important topic that got a bit misunderstood in my original post before diving into the update.
I know a lot of young girls, much younger than me, read this sub and I don't want anyone going through what I did when I was 15.

I've said my whole life I didn't want kids, and I really didn't, until now. I want this baby because I want this baby, because I know I can be a good mom. I didn't decide to have this baby because I was scared my boyfriend would leave, I didn't decide to have this baby to make him happy and I certainly didn't decide to have this baby due to some romantic fantasy. No woman, no girl should be pressured into having a kid and there's absolutely no shame in not wanting that or getting an abortion. You gotta do what you can, need and want to do, not what other people think it's best.
 
Also, protection. Dick is the only man in my life with whom I had unprotected sex with and relied solely on the pill and the reason for that is because I trust him and he trusts me. I'm not talking about pregnancy, I'm talking about STDs and all that. I messed up on the pills, but it wasn't on purpose, so I couldn't just sit him down and say: 'hey, we need condoms for the rest of this month' because when the month did come to an end, I saw that I had two pills left and I just froze. I told him immediately, and that's why when the pregnancy symptoms started coming up, he knew what was up right away. 

That said, I'd also like to thank everyone who commented. I left a thank you note in the original post, and I wish I could reply to everyone. You guys were amazing and encouraging and kind. Thank you so much.

Now, the update.

So last night Dick came home, and after a few awkward moments where I kept building up the strength to tell him everything, and he kept looking at me knowing I was up to something, I finally confessed.

I apologized for the outburst and for saying I didn't want our baby. I told him I really didn't meant it and went on to explain the reason why I reacted the way I did. I told him that after he left, I was pregnant, didn't know and miscarried. Told him about the stay at the hospital and how everyone thought I was a suicidal teenager and how much worse that made things. Everyone hovered over me, expecting me to just break down, and it was an awful experience. 

He was very shaken, and looking at me without saying anything, processing it all in. I apologized for not telling him back then, and said that I just didn't think it would change anything. We were still minors, and he'd still have to live in another country with his parents and it'd only add more grief to a relationship I cherished more than anything. I was also so angry and bitter and depressed that any rational thought just flew over my head to the point anything related to pregnancy sent me into a crying spell. Told him that I felt betrayed by my own body, that even if I wouldn't have kept the baby back then, it was still my decision to make, it was still my responsability and things just sneaked up on me in such a way that I lost control.

I told him that I really want this baby, and apologized again. I started crying and talking through sobs, and he just hugged me, trying to comfort me. When I was calmer, he was wonderful about it all. He told me it was okay, said he was sorry I had to go through that alone and that if he knew, he would have helped me.

He forgave me for the outbursts and for saying such shitty things.

We're fine, and we booked an appointment with the OBGYN tomorrow. I'm happy, he's happy and I feel a thousand times lighter.

Again, thank you very much for the support, I'll never forget it.

"Erm, my girlfriend [22F] has an issue with the fact that I [26M] walk to work


I feel like I'm going crazy so I just wanted to check whether I'd somehow completely misjudged this.

Literally the only thing to explain here - I've been seeing my girlfriend for 3 months, exclusively for 2. I don't drive as I graduated university and moved to London, where a car isn't needed, and have only just moved back to my more rural hometown.

 I'm currently working in an office which is slightly awkwardly located - if I get the bus, it's two separate buses so the journey takes a total of about 55 minutes. If I walk, it's 1h10m.

I enjoy walking a lot when it isn't raining, and I take quite a scenic route, so I enjoy getting my headphones in with spotify and just enjoying the stroll in the mornings and evenings. I enjoy it more than a cramped bus and find it to be relaxing and a fresh start to the day.

I mentioned in passing that I walk to work to my girlfriend and she keeps bringing it up, saying that if I don't drive I should 'stop being weird' and get public transport like everyone else. She thinks it's too long to just walk each day and she ""just finds it weird"". She said she would be too embarrassed to tell her friends that I walk to work.

That's all I can explain, there's no real other reason but she genuinely seems to have an issue with it.

Am I missing something here? Has she just got a weird problem with the concept of walking?

  **tl;dr**: I walk to work each day and my girlfriend appears to be struggling with the concept. "
"Me (34F) with my BF (41M) of 2 years. Got mad at me because I took my cat (16M) to a park for the cat's birthday. Am I really a crazy cat lady?


I've had my cat since he was 6 months old. He was an ""unadoptable"" rescue. He had so called unsurviveable pneumonia, and when healthy, was nothing but fear aggression. I was basically cat hospice. 

Well, he lived. And he loved. He's the purring-est, snuggliest, sweetest cat. He is now a chubby 16 year old with arthritis (treated with Dasuquin, which has helped immensely, but he's not a kitten anymore).

We used to live in a first floor apartment where we could sit outside and I could read and he could be on his tie out and watch birds. Now we don't anymore.

Shortly before his 16th birthday, he slipped and/or fell off the bathroom vanity. I didn't see it happen, I only saw the cat who couldn't stand without screaming afterwards. We rushed him to the vet and miraculously nothing was broken, but that left the question of what he DID do. Even in a bad sprain, it may always be weak and he may never walk normally again, or walk at all. If he tore a tendon or ligament, it was basically over. Orthopedic surgeries and senior cats don't usually end well. 

For a week and a half, we brought him food and water. We gave him his pain meds. We set him in the litter and held him up. We lifted him onto and off of the bed. It was basically a cat nursing home up in here. 

Just when we thought he would never get up again, he did exactly that. Then he walked a few steps. Then it was cat PT. Making him go a little further every day. Getting his strength back up.

A month later, aside from sitting over on one hip when he sits, you would never know he had ever been hurt.

For his 16th, I loaded him into the car (which he doesn't mind at all) and took him to a park by the lake. He spent a couple hours watching ducks and warming his old bones in the sun. 

My boyfriend was indignant. How the cat doesn't even know it's his birthday, what a waste of time, who does that, etc etc. 

No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys. He knows he feels better than he had been. He knows those things. 

Now it's 3 months later and my BF is STILL on about cat birthday outings. Idgi. He helped care for him when,he was injured and did probably more than I did, because I work 10 hour shifts. So I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is? I mean, there's whole parks devoted to dogs where dogs can see their dog friends. So what's weird about taking a cat out for one afternoon? He's really starting to make me feel like shit about it.

tl;dr Senior cat was seriously injured. He recovered, and I took him to the park to celebrate his 16th bday. BF is acting like I murdered his family over it. Am I crazy?"
"[Update] Too soon to tell my [27m] girlfriend [28f] I love her after 3 months?


da op: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xnc5y/too_soon_to_tell_my_27m_girlfriend_28f_i_love_her/



I ended up getting sick during my flight back so my big plans kind of collapsed and we just stayed in Friday night. She was taking care of me so sweetly, and when we were lying in bed together I felt so happy I just had to tell her. She said for her this is really serious thing and she needs some time, but wasn't weirded out or feeling pressured or anything, and instead was happy. I was perfectly fine with that and mentally accepted that 'OK, if things keep going well I can wait however many more weeks or months it takes her to feel comfortable saying it.' 


We spent a romantic weekend mostly just cuddlin' and fuckin' and taking nice walks. Monday morning when she was getting on the bus to work and we were parting ways she said 'Goodbye, I love you' so matter of factly and out of nowhere my heart almost exploded. I was going around with the goofiest smile plastered across my face all day and wanted to sing and dance in the rain. Happiest I've ever been in my life. 



TL;DR: She loves me back and the whole world is roses and sunshine! :D Thanks for reassuring me it wasn't freakily-too-soon"

"I [24F] found out my best friend [24F] had sex with my boyfriend [26F]; I'm upset and can't believe it


I don't where to begin. I feel so embarrassed coming here and asking for advice.

My boyfriend Steve and I have been dating for over a year in a half. I met him in one of my upper level classes two years ago. At the time he was finishing up his degree, before moving on and working on his masters. Since we started talking, seeing each other, and dating casually; I really loved our entire relationship. Steve and I had a lot of similar interests, which included traveling. We did a small trip to South America a couple months ago for a few weeks (Peru and Chile). We had an amazing time! It was once we got back form our trip that I saw our relationship in a  whole different way. We travelled well together, and bonded in a new way. I knew I was in a great relationship! 

I thought we had a great relationship, until I got some news a few days ago.

Three days ago, I went over to drop a macbook charger over at my best friends house, Chenelle. Chenelle and I have been best friend since we were in high school from the age of 16 years old. I have always considered her to be my number one, and closest person in my life. I have noticed that the past 6 months we haven't hangout in the same capacity that we usually have. Both of us have been busy with our lives (school, work, relationships, etc). But, I kinda got the feeling after this past year of university around April, that she was starting to drift. She had a shitty relationship with her ex that lasted under a year. He cheated on her with a coworker, and the rest is history. They broke ""officially"" around the end of January.

As I went over to drop off her extra charger that she borrowed, I talked with her mom for a bit. Chenelle ended up getting called in to pick up an extra serving shift at the restaurant she has worked at during her degree. Her mom wanted to talk to me about a few things. I was puzzled.. Chenelle's mom was always really outgoing and funny. We had known each other for over 8 years at least. But, she wanted to have a serous talk.

Chenelle's mom, ""Karen"", went on to tell me that she saw Steve and Chenille sneak around the back of the house about a month or so ago. Karen went on to explain that she noticed this happening two other times. At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. She told me that I should talk to Steve and Chenelle ASAP. 

Steve and I were supposed to go out for dinner last night. He picked me up, and off we went. I felt really gross and humiliated the entire time we were out. We ate dinner, had a couple drinks, but we didn't talk much. Steve kept asking me all night what was the matter. I told him ""nothing"".

Finally, when we got back to my place, we sat in my room and I asked him. I asked him, and told him what Chenelle's mom (Karen) told me. He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white. That gave me the answer I needed. I broke down and Steve tried to comfort me. I didn't want him touching me. I didn't even want to hear it! I told him to leave, but I basically had to force him to leave. I tried calling Chenelle and texted her that I needed to talk to her. I got no response. Not one. Basically, two of the closest people I have had in my life betrayed me. This is so terrible and I feel so shitty. I have like no one right now.

Sorry for all of the grammar and title mistakes.

"UPDATE - At what point should I [19F] tell potential partners that I can't have kids and will probably only live to 40?


Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xeqgr/at_what_point_should_i_19f_tell_potential/

First off - I decided to go bug my doctor. He's re-testing me for celiac. FINALLY. After I get the results for that I'm going to be tested for MS and Huntington's disease. Being loud and annoying really can work when you need it to!

Secondly - [23M] and I met up again, we got drunk and watched netflix. I somehow brought it up that my lifespan may be decreased and his response was ""Well that sucks. Just means you have to do more over the next 20 years, right?"" Hell yes.

I have a funny feeling that I'll be seeing him again soon.

TL;DR - Bugged doctor, being tested for more shit! Told [23M], we watched Happy Tree Friends all night.

I got this shit.

Edit - so much hate, whatever. All I can go by is what I've been told and the tests I've had done. Believe me if you want, don't if you don't. That's how the Internet works.

This post might be long, but I'm going to post it anyway. I hope it helps someone else, if they're in a similar situation. If you want the backstory, I'll type it out for reference (my own reference, and for others who may benefit). If not, just scroll down to the ""What I learned"" section. It's extremely important.


First off, Reddit, I'd like to thank you so much. To every single person who replied to me - you were a crucial voice in a chorus of people telling me to leave him.


**The tipping points:**


After my post, things got so much worse. I thought life would be better when I moved back to my hometown and saw him more often - but they didn't. He was just as untrusting, 3 times as clingy, and a million times more dissatisfied with our relationship.


On one hand, I was happy I could finally be with him. But he was not happy to be with me at all. He expected me to put up with so much. For example, one day we went to go pick up a paycheck at my work, then we were going to go to the mall. When I walked into work with him, he was basically acting like a child - tons of PDA, whining, etc. I work with kids, for crying out loud! I didn't want the kids, or my boss to see some guy hanging all over me and doing a baby voice trying to get me to kiss him. I told him to please wait until we got into the car, but he then insulted me, saying that I needed to get over my social anxiety. He sulked the entire day at the mall. I kept asking what was wrong, and he wouldn't tell me. I tried SO SO hard to find out if he was truly okay. I bought some jewelry at a store, and when we got into his car, I tried it on because I was excited. He blew up at me, calling me conceited and saying that it was so rude to be focusing on myself even though he was so sad. Even I knew that was complete bullshit - this was the first moment I had focused on myself all day.


The above story is just one example of the amount of times that I'd tell him to stop doing something --&gt; he'd sulk --&gt; I'd devote hours of energy trying to help him --&gt; he'd insult me for focusing on myself when I finally gave up. This pattern became very clear, especially in the weeks following.


In those weeks following, we both went on vacation. I wanted to enjoy my reunion with my family, but he was mad because I wasn't devoting enough of my time to him. When he went on vacation, a ton of truth was revealed. Long story short, his mom hit his sister one night when everyone was drunk. He was texting me and threatened that he would never forgive me if I went to bed instead of supporting him (it was 3am and I was very tired). He also said that the only person he'd ever loved was his sister, and that he isn't fulfilled by me because I'm not half the woman that she is. I understand he felt very betrayed by many people in his life at this moment, but his lack of appreciation for me in this moment really stood out as just plain rude.


A few days after the incident with his mom and sister happened, he confessed to me that both him and his sister have been hit before, but that he doesn't see anything wrong with it. Still, he claimed that he was ""ready to change"" and that he was going to improve himself as a person. I asked him if he was considering therapy to assure that he could maintain a healthy relationship with me despite his horrible relationship with his mom, and he said no. He said there was NOTHING wrong with him and that he would never go to therapy. Instead, he told me, he was going to join martial arts so that he could become stronger, and kill anyone who ever laid a hand on his sister. This was basically the tipping point. I understand rage and anger. I understand that sometimes you have the urge to hurt people. But I realized, in that moment, that if he ever found an excuse to hurt me - it could very well be permanent, or fatal. He is already extremely strong and big. I was afraid, and I didn't want to stick around and wait until he hurt me.
I told him this - I told him that becoming physically stronger was not the answer, that he needed to figure out how to work through his feelings. He told me, ""No, stop pushing me to go to therapy. If me refusing therapy is a dealbreaker, then so be it.""


At this point, I was feeling very strong and secure in myself. I had been seeing my therapist regularly, I had built up a group of online friends (that he didn't know about, so he couldn't forbid me to talk to them), I had started working out and eating healthy, I was writing a play, I was having a good time at my job. If there was a good time to leave the relationship, it was here - when my self-worth was at the highest it's been the whole relationship. I think, subconciously, I was preparing the strength to leave him.


It took a few days for me to process what he was saying, but in short, I figured out the message: He was not going to change, ever. He would never be fulfilled by me. He would only get worse since he is unwilling to confront his problems. Until the day where he is willing to take a good honest look at himself and his issues, he will not be able to participate in a healthy relationship.


**The breakup:**


Long story short, we both sort of ""gave up"" and broke up. I talked with him and told him that this relationship wasn't good for either of us. He agreed heartily. I unfollowed him on social media and we said our goodbyes. He asked if we could be friends...I said we could remain cordial, but I'd rather take a break for now. This was a HUGE mistake, given what happened next.


**Post-breakup mess:**


I was doing perfectly fine for the next two weeks. I had only cried once, for about an hour or so. Besides that, I was having the time of my life. I didn't know what to do with all the freedom. One night, my self-esteem plummeted suddenly. That's when I fucked up.


So, we shared a tumblr blog, where we would share things for the other person. I had unfollowed all social media at this point, but while ruminating over my low self-esteem, I thought of our memories together. I realized that I had forgotten to remove myself from that blog. I went to go remove myself from it, but that's when I got a huge fucking shock - he had posted, IN DETAIL, about a blowjob he had gotten from some girl on Tinder. I was filled with rage - not because I was upset he had moved on, but that he would be SO DISRESPECTFUL as to post it on our SHARED blog that he KNEW I would see at some point. I was also enraged at the fact that he had berated me for MONTHS about the fact that I'd had casual sex before, but then goes out and does it, then bragged about it. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to drive to his house and scream at him until he cried. I've never been so angry in my life - I scared myself. I made another mistake here - I called him. Luckily, I was calm and composed on the outside. I told him that it was disrespectful as hell to post something of that nature on our SHARED blog, and that I wouldn't accept any excuse. He tried to make excuses, but I hung up. Here's where I fixed my mistake of contacting him...I immediately blocked and deleted him on everything. Gone without a trace. Haven't looked back. I burned the FUCK out of that bridge, and I'm proud of it.


That incident caused me an incredible amount of pain and rage; at the same time, it gave me the final push to get him ALL the way out of my life. He was continuing to try to emotionally manipulate me even though we were broken up - I am never going to put up with that shit, ever again.


**What I learned:**


Here's the good part, Reddit. I hope that someone else reads this and will be able to take an honest look at themselves and their relationship, as I did.

1. He was much, much harsher on me than I thought he was. I couldn't see it because I loved him much, much more in love with him than I should've been. Looking back, I remembered that we had taken a short break at one point in our relationship. During that time, he called me up and YELLED at me, straight-up YELLED that he hated me, that I was a bitch, that he resented me more than anyone else, that I ruined his life. I still forgave him and got back together with him, because I assumed he just didn't mean it. The question that I asked myself, that opened my eyes, was this: ""Out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, there has been ONE person who wanted to hurt you badly enough that he told you he hated you and that you were a bitch. And out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, you somehow love him the most. Shouldn't he have been disqualified from your heart the moment he called you up for the sole reason of hurting you?""


2. I ignored huge red flags, and I'm lucky that I got out when I did. He has already been violent with people before. About a year ago, he got blackout drunk and punched some people, as well as slamming a guy through a glass wall (which shattered it) and breaking two tables in half, one of them being a ping-pong table. This alone should've been a red flag, but coupled with other aggressive behavior...it's haunting. I've gotten drunk with him many times. I trusted him too deeply, and I'm honestly luckily to be physically un-harmed right now.

3. My worth is not dependent on him. My new outlook is based on the idea that ""worth"" is separate from a ""bond"" with someone. A bond is based upon many things, one of them being compatibility. Since we were not compatible, that means that our BOND was unable to work out, but my worth is still intact. Obviously I'm not a perfect person, but I also needed to stop basing perfection on HIS standards. Whenever I do something and then reflexively think, ""wow, I'm too selfish"" or ""wow, I talk too much,"" I add the words ""for him"" at the end. Yes, I was too selfish for him, I was too sad for him, I was too much for him. Then I ask: but what about for ME? There are obviously times when I go overboard and don't act like a great person. But most of the time, I'm enough for myself, and I'm not selfish or conceited or fucked up. There's nothing seriously wrong (and if there was, I have a support system to help me work on those things).


4. I am a loving, kind person, who has many amazing qualities. I didn't realize this when I was with him, but my god am I gentle. I'm empathetic and understanding. I have amazing self-control, I'm considerate, I'm direct and honest with people. I value authenticity, I'm open, I'm a good listener, and I'm dependable. Those are just a few things that I like about myself - I'm sure it'll be easier to think of more as time goes on. I'm not a piece of shit, but he had me convinced that I was. He made me feel like I had zero good qualities, that I couldn't positively affect the world. He was always looking for the worst in me, the bad intentions, the secret darkness that I supposedly had in my heart. But no. I'm not a dark or vindictive person. I'm not saying I'm the best person in the world, but I've seen enough evil to know that I would never stoop to that level.


5. Even if I felt bad for him, that doesn't mean I had to stay. He was very damaged as a person from his childhood, which is probably why he was so horrible to me. But it is NOT my responsibility to be his punching bag. I deserve respect just as much as anyone else. The best way to get him to realize the error of his ways was not to stay in relationship with him. By staying with him, I was sending him the message ""you can hurt me as much as you like, and I'll still love you, so you get to feel like there's nothing wrong with your behavior."" By breaking up with him, I was sending the message that I respected myself and him too much to continue accepting such hurtful behavior. Of course, when he ultimately gets into another relationship, I will feel slightly upset if it's successful. I will probably ask myself, ""why couldn't he change for ME? What makes HER so special?"" But on the other hand, it would be a relief to see him heal as a person. I don't want any other girl to go through what I went through, because it absolutely affected my life for a long while. He held me back from so much, but now I'm exercising, I'm writing, I'm hanging out with people, I'm doing things I never dared do when I was with him (in fear of his anger).


6. Although I'm trying to avoid basing my validation in others, it is helpful to note that people DO love me. So many friends were overjoyed when they heard about the breakup. Many asked, ""Is is okay to say that I'm relieved about this?"" Every single person told me that they were so worried about me but they didn't know what to do, but that they're so excited to have ""me"" back. They're excited that I'm not a huge ball of anxiety, that I don't have to miss events to talk to him, that I don't have to lie and defend him to cover up his bad behavior. Everyone is being very reasonable with me, I'm going out with friends all the time, I'm getting complimented on qualities I didn't even know I had. I'm reaching out to old friends and reconnecting, I'm being introduced to new people, I'm joining things. I'm also going on lots of casual dates/have hooked up with some people. I forgot what it was like to have someone who was enthusiastic about making me feel good, but now I'm basking in it. I'm surrounding myself with different kinds of love - when someone doesn't behave in a loving way, it's so much easier to set limits and boundaries. I am a lot less lenient. I'll admit, this has ended a close friendship (because I realized how toxic she was to me). But I'm also surrounded with so many others who support me. I support myself, as well, so there's no way I will feel alone. If I would've known how absolutely loved I'd feel even without him, I would've broken up with him a long time ago. There is no emptiness in my life - it is fuller than ever before.


7. I trust myself so much more. Not only because my ex is not around to gaslight me, but because I know that I am fully capable of making healthy decisions about myself. I trust my perceptions. I can see red flags much more easily. Just today, my ex messaged me somewhere I forgot to block him. His message was long, and seemed heartfelt on a surface level. But I could see every instance of subtle manipulation, every humblebrag, every backhanded compliment, every instance of blame-shifting. The moment I read it, I DIDN'T feel like he'd changed, and I didn't have ANY urge to go back to him. I didn't buy into that bullshit even for a SECOND, and that's how I know that I've changed. I quickly blocked him on that platform as well, and fully intend to never reply to the message. I trust myself to protect my own heart, and to not jump back into a situation that I know will hurt me. A year ago, I did the exact opposite: I fell into his arms. But now...I feel so incredibly stable, that he could never knock me off-balance like he did before.


Thank you to whoever read this, it means a lot. I needed to vent about the things I learn. Overall, I do have my weak moments. But goddamn, my soul is growing stronger every day. Leaving him, and getting to experience the benefits of being without him...it's worth every second of occasional loneliness.


**tl;dr: I broke up with him, my life is fucking AMAZING now, and I've learned enough to know that I'll never go back to him.**"

"Me [30M] and my wife [36F] of 5 years, have been dealing with my obsessed ex-gf [28F] for years, but it has now started to affect my wife negatively


Hi reddit.

Throwaway because i don't want friends and co-workers that know my reddit account to know details about what i'm going through.

Me and wife have been together for 8 years, married for 5. I am Greek and she is Italian. She was the secretary of a business woman we visited with my boss 8 years ago in Italy, it was something like... love at first sight as they say. Nothing really happened between me and her back then, but we kept in touch through the internet and liked each other a lot. Things escalated and lead us to a long distance relationship. Despite the discouragement of everybody that it will not work and that we should stop wasting our time (and mostly from her parents because she is older than me and a few years with a man that wouldn't end up being with her could be an utter waste of time), we managed to endure the distance (we travelled to each other regularly) and eventually make it work. We are now living happily married in a wonderful city of northern Greece and we enjoy every bit of it.

Of course, our relationship has its ups and downs, but we never really had a big trust issue between us since the foundations of our relationship were honesty, trust, loyalty and fidelity. Before i met Valeria (my wife), i was in another long distance relationship with a Dutch woman, Larisa. I broke up with Larisa 8 months before meeting Valeria, and Valeria had full knowledge of my previous relationship and all the details - pretty much anything that happened between me and Larisa, why we broke up, what went wrong, etc etc.

Our lives with Valeria were peaceful until 3 years ago that we received a weird mail from the Netherlands. We were both surprised because we weren't really expecting anything, and the package/box had only my name written on it. After opening it we realized that it had some (not all, you'll see later) of my older belongings that i had left in the Netherlands (t-shirts that she kept everytime we met to feel me close to her while we would split again, everyday stuff, a perfume of mine, stuff like that). We were both shocked, but Valeria looked way more worried than me. She never felt comfortable hearing anything about my ex-gf, although she was the one to bring her up in the conversation. That used to happen in our first few months together. She would ask me questions about her and i could happily answer them since i was over her and it didn't hurt, but on the contrary, it hurt Valeria, but she kept getting back at it.

Fast forward to July 2016, we have had plenty of these packages delivered to us. After the first few, she started adding notes in the packages and old pictures of us when we were together. Valeria was boiling. I even told the post office to block any incoming mail from Larisa but they said it was against their policy (???) and all mail was eventually delivered to us no matter what.

During the last week of July, i had to travel for business purposes with my boss and a few colleagues to Belgium and the Netherlands. Valeria didn't say anything about me going to the Netherlands although i did expect her to. Everything went fine, nothing important to mention until last Monday.

Two days ago we received another mail, but this time the package has Valeria's name on it. Without any surprise we figure out it's from Larisa. This time it wasn't a big box though, it was just an envelope. It contained pictures of me with Larisa, and they looked really recent. The pictures were pretty intimate to be honest, but they were CLEARLY photoshopped. Some of these pictures, judging by the poses of mine, were taken from social media, but others just look totally unfamiliar to me. Needless to say Valeria was so shaken she almost fainted. After she calmed down, she looked at me furiously and a few seconds later she started crying relentlessly. I tried to explain that i did not meet Larisa and that these pictures were clearly edited. She asked me then how did Larisa know that i was in the Netherlands these specific days, which is an excellent question. The only ones that knew i would be in the Netherlands these days were my close friends, colleagues and of course my wife. Valeria said she wanted  to think, she starting packing a couple of clothes and she told me she would stay in a hotel for a couple of days. I stopped her and packed a few clothes of mine and moved to a hotel myself and have been staying there for the last 2 and a half days.

As obvious as it is, this thing is burning me on the inside. I feel shattered that things have turned like that. I feel totally devastated that my wife doesn't trust me, but i can partly undertand her, since this obsessive mailing that was perpetuating through the last few years might have finally tricked her mind. There is a great question though: How did Larisa know i was in the Netherlands these certain days? There are no chances that she mailed these intimate photoshopped pictures by coinsidence. 

So reddit, sorry for the long post, but what do i do now? How do i convince my wife that nothing has happened? Do i proceed to talk to her ... maybe today, or do i keep leaving her on her own space for as long as she needs? I think i am so stressed that i am having panic attacks all the time thinking of all the possible bad outcomes, and i am filled with unlimited anger and hate towards my ex-gf. I just want everything to be right with Valeria, i love her more than my own self and i would give the world to make her happy. I don't want to see her like that. This really feels like someone is trying to set something up on me.

  ---   

**Edit/Update** : Fixed some typos. Wow, this has totally blown up, i'm stunned. I am overwhelmed by the advices and the support.
I'm trying to read every comment and reply where i feel like it is needed.
As a summary, your advice is mostly as it follows:
1) Contact a lawyer/police and see what i can do legally against Larisa, such as have a cease and desist letter sent to her or a restraining order.
2) To show the real pictures to her, the ones that were used as photoshop material.
3) Secure social media accounts, lock down stuff. Make sure no security breaches have occured and to try to make info harder to find.

So, **update** regarding legal issues:

I just contacted a good lawyer friend of mine. Well, kind of a silly move since i haven't spoken to him for years, but he gladly helped me. He told me that there is absolutely nothing illegal Larisa has done. Note to many of you: do remember that i am Greek and Larisa (the woman that is harassing me and my wife) is Dutch. There aren't even any common European union laws that we both have to obey that give me any ground to press any charges on her. She has practically done nothing wrong. And even if we were not living in different countries, it would still be hard to get a restraining order on somebody just because of some mails. So, all in all, we are powerless legally. He pretty much says that all we can do is send a legal note to her saying that any form of contact with us (mail, e-mail, phone call, text message, anything) is not desirable and that it is going to be delivered instantly back to her unopened. Also, we contacted the Hellenic Post Office and this time they took my request to not receive any mail by the said person in a more serious regard since i was accompanied by a lawyer. They said they will fulfill my desire to not receive any mail and will contact me once again the next few days for more details.

And now **more important update** regarding me and Valeria! :

I was encouraged by your comments and i decided to give my wife a call. She picked up and i was so relieved. We had a small and quick talk on how we are doing and if we are ok, and we decided that we had enough of that shit and that we should talk about everything that is bothering us. She sounded ... ok. I expected her to sound bitter or anything like that, but she sounded really ok on the phone. We arranged to meet in 1 hour and 15 minutes to our favourite place, downtown in the pedestrial area right by the sea. I was really nervous before calling but now i feel more relieved, i hope everything's going to be alright and i have a feeling it really is going to be like that. Fingers crossed i guess... I'll post an update in this post or maybe on a new ""Update"" post after we meet.

And something else. There's a few people saying that i did indeed meet Larisa and now i'm trying to cover my shit. I mean, i personally cannot see why i would make this post if i had indeed met Larisa. And if i had, why would i not tell you the truth and ask for advice, admitting that i had screwed up? Makes no sence to me, but maybe that's just me. Perhaps i'm too naive or not demonic enough to see the reason to do something like that.

Once again, thank you for your support everyone, i'll keep you posted.

**Edit2**: So something regarding Larisa. I'm glad another redditor asked me why would she harass me or if there was any reason behind that. Well, me and Larisa didn't break up very peacefully. I mean, the breakup itself was ""okay"". Mind you, it was a relationship that started with Larisa's initiative, she was the one that made the first step in everything, literally everything. After meeting a few times (we both travelled to each other), she decided that she wanted to break up with me. She didn't really want me anymore. Larisa figured that she was not really physically attracted to me (for example, she wanted me taller.. Dutch women are tall, and i wasn't tall enough for her. She was 179cm and i was 183cm but that was not enough for her. That's one of many things she didn't like about me apparently). I truly loved her, and this is why i decided to respect her decision, to accept that we are over and to move on. She didn't like that i cut contact with her though. Larisa has been suffering from anxiety. After i cut contact with her she would sent me really bitter messages saying stuff like ""I do not need you anymore. You were not needed in my life and i am strong enough by myself. You were wrong"", you get the idea. I never said or implied that she needed me anyway. Needless to say she convinved her whole family that i did say or imply those things. Well, that kept going on for a while until a point that she just stopped. The very last message was a very bitter and resentful message saying stuff like ""good luck to your next victim, i hope she realizes her mistake fast enough so that she can save that time being with a loser and coward like you"". I mean ... ok. She wasn't really friendly....

"Me [26F] with my husband [27M] of 2 years, starting to resent my husband for convincing me to have a small wedding.


Throwaway because he is a pretty avid redditor.


I've always dreamed of a big wedding, not extravagant to any extreme, but that's just how all my family and friends' weddings have been and ever since I was a little girl I knew that's what I wanted. 


My husband is very pragmatic and from the start was very critical of the wedding I'd planned in my head. We debated what we'd do pretty extensively and I thought came to some really good compromises. I always wanted a really great photographer, he thought hiring a photographer at all was pointless, so our compromise was asking a friend to be our photographer as his wedding gift to us. I always wanted a big, Saturday night party reception, he wanted a courthouse wedding with just us, so our compromise was a Sunday brunch with select friends and family. I always wanted my sister as my MOH and my two BFFs from growing up as bridesmaids, he, again, just wanted the two of us, so our compromise was my father got to walk me down the aisle. I wanted a band, he doesn’t like dancing, so our compromise was me making a playlist of background music for the brunch.


The day was wonderful and I was so happy and it really was such an awesome wedding. 


Then my brother got married.


He had, basically, my dream wedding. Ever since then, the resentment has been growing steadily. All of our friends and family were there and everyone had the absolute best time. It hands down was a better day for me than my wedding day. It was such a beautiful celebration of not only the love between my brother and my new sister-in-law, but of them as a couple and everyone they loved enough to include in their special day. My grandfather read a prayer, she had a first dance with her father, they had beautiful flowers and a killer band, everyone danced all night, including my husband!! 


The real kicker was her dress. If I had to pick out the dress of my dreams, it was what she wore. When she came out everyone gasped and my husband actually said, “wow”. It broke my heart. I wanted that moment for myself so badly, I know that makes me sound like a shallow attention queen, but it’s true. I had actually picked out a discount dress for my own wedding, but my husband said it was probably too fancy for the venue, so I went with a white sundress. 


The wedding was awhile ago and they just uploaded the album to facebook and I sat there going through it sobbing. Our friend did take a few nice photos of the day, but it was nothing like what they had. Theirs had captured so many beautiful moments throughout the day, beautiful pictures of them and everyone who I loved but was unable to even have at my wedding. 


I know this is such a stupid issue, and it’s not like he did anything wrong since we did come to logical compromises that I fully agreed with at the time, but I have been feeling more and more resentful and I don’t know what to do about it.


EDIT: Wow, okay I get it. Thanks for the overwhelming feedback. I am being superficial and shallow, he was definitely right. I'm going to do my best to forget about it completely and be grateful for the compromises he was willing to make.

"I [30 F] snooped husbands [29 M] phone, found something but not sure how to deal


We have been together about 9 years now. I work at home with 3 kids (8,3,11 months) it's hectic and I constantly feel like I'm drowning. He goes out every week or two with friends to their houses or out to a bar.. a few months ago I lost it as he stayed out all night with zero contact with me all day long and just waltzed in the next morning at like 10:30am like nbd. After some digging he stayed with his uncle and I checked it out to be true. 
Since he still goes out every now and then I am jealous he gets to leave and have a life, I'm jealous he even gets to go to work and socialize with adults. We only have one person who can babysit the kids and they do so veeeeerryyyyy reluctantly if it ever happens. So he says it's just easier for everyone if he goes out with friends, so we never go out unless it's a super rare special occasion. 

Maybe a week or so ago he stayed up all night drinking at home. I woke up around 6am with the baby and the kids.. he's sleeping on the couch. and he gets some text messages. They display right on the front screen so I saw they were from a woman, and they were in reply to something he had said to her but weren't exactly damning. Still, these are texts at 6 am and he was texting her at night while drunk. 

I pushed it out of my mind until he left his phone at home while running to the store the other day. I looked to see who this person was and what they were talking about. It's a coworker and seemed innocent enough until I scrolled up and saw he sent her ""Did I slap your ass last night? I was feeling the liberties.."" or something like that. she said she didn't remember and that she didn't care if he did..

Husband comes home and I am a mess. He is pissed about me going through his phone. He says he doesn't feel like spending the energy trying to defend himself because nothing happened and it was just a joke like how he would smack guys asses. Ultimately he turned it around enough so that I was the one trying to explain myself why I was going through his phone, why don't I trust him, what is wrong with me. Then starts to guilt trip me like if I'm going to act like this he will just never go out again..

It's been 3 more days since this happened and I have hardly spoken to him since. He knows I'm upset but hasn't tried to talk to me or ask what is bothering me. The idea that he is out getting drunk with coworkers and slapping some girls ass, or thinking he slapped her ass, completely disgusts me. I mean if I was there with him, would he have done that? No. I just have no idea how to proceed from here.

  ---   
  **TL;DR**: snooped through husbands phone, found out he slapped a coworkers ass while they were all out drinking at a bar, he's acting like he just wants to move on and forget but I'm still disgusted.

-----

**UPDATE:** I am really really truly thankful for everyone who has commented. I haven't gone through everything but I do have an update.
I got a bottle of wine to sit and talk with him about these issues today. In a nutshell says this girl is ~one of the guys~ and it was not flirtatious or sexy or anything like that. he agrees that I need my own time out, SAYS he will watch the kids. made some ridiculous suggestion about buying me a plane ticket to leave for a week and that he'd watch them.. I laughed because that is obviously not going to happen for many reasons. He said the last thing he wanted was to be laughed at and went to go pout in the garage. I went upstairs. He eventually came up and said to me do you want to know what really happened that night? He slapped another girls ass. Someone he didn't know. Just some girl. And he was doing damage control by contacting this coworker to see if he had slapped hers too. So he wouldn't have shit to deal with when they went into work together. I started crying. He sat for about 2-3 minutes of that in our room, then went back downstairs to apparently finish his video game as I heard all the sound come back on. I slammed the bedroom door. That's where I am at now.

**EDIT:** to clarify I am a WORK at home mom. He does not support our entire family. I take care of the entire mortgage, the water bill, the gas bill, the cable bill.. I work at night when the kids go to bed. That's why I feel like I'm drowning. I have absolutely no ""Me"" time. "

"My (31M) sister (38F) is sheltering her kid (17M) to extreme levels, the kid has asked me to intervene.


So I moved in with my girlfriend to Philly 3 years ago and my sister moved here a year ago with her kid after she got divorced. Her kid, Aaron, is a sweet funny kid. He is handsome, smart, charming, basically everything good about a 17 year old kid at the prime of his life...

But my sister shelters him to the point of extremeness. I often am at their house and I see Aaron all the time and he sort of looks up to me as the cool uncle. Basically, my sister makes sure he doesn't have any resemblance of a social life. He can't leave past a certain block radius of the house, he can't talk to girls, his mom checks his phone like twice a week for suspicious texts. He can't work a job because she thinks hes too immature for it or she doesn't trust him with it or something. He wanted to go to a college in north philly but she told him she would refuse to pay because the school is too 'ghetto'. The absolute worst part is that when he has friends over she insists that she... just kind of sits there and hangs out with them. I know it is because she can't stand the idea of him having conversations that aren't 'approved' by her. He tells me this stuff and I feel so, so bad for him. I know his friends and they like to go out and hang out like any 17 year old kid would do, but he literally has to be home for dinner at 6 every night and then after be home at 9:30 so he can't do anything with them. He has complained to me about this maybe a hundred times about how unfair it is, and it sucks even worse because he loves hearing stories about the crazy fun shit I did as a kid and it just makes him feel worse in the end. 

I honestly think she is being extremely unfair to him, or she just doesn't know at what point to ease up on him. These 'laws' have been there since he was 13, they should change by the time he's 17. She even has a god damn breathalyzer. 

It hit a bad point when he apparently had a girl over 2 days ago and the mother walked in on them kissing and she flipped a shit. Now... at 17, kissing a girl is totally 100% normal. He is extremely noticeably good looking and fit, I am sure the girls cant get enough of him, but he cant hang out with girls like that because he has to be home right away. I told her she was over reacting and she started going off on me about STD's and how she doesn't wanna pay for his kid if she gets pregnant. She called the girls mother angrily and told the mother, and apparently the mother told my sister that it was fine if they wanted to kiss and my sister was SHOCKED that ANY PARENT would allow such a thing. It seems as if she gets her parenting advice from fucking Nancy Grace. I should note that me and my sister grew up separately with divorced parents. 

The worst part is that he has little to no social life. He has like 3 friends at school and he can't really do anything fun with them. He has resorted to playing video games day and night, and his mother flips a shit on him for being addicted to those. But what the fuck else is he supposed to do... He gets perfect grades, he works out (to my sisters dismay). She has this little thing on his phone that beeps if he goes too far, who the fuck has that for a 17 year old boy?? When I was that age I was doing road trips from nyc to boston every month with tons of beers and girls and everything, and I'm sure he wants that too, but he can't because his mother is fucking insane. Not saying he should become some party animal like I was, but let the kid go loose a tiny bit for crying out loud. 

So basically at this point, he has been begging me for weeks now to say something to her about this. She listens to my advice, not sure why but she really does. I have briefly said things, but nothing direct or serious. I do feel strongly about this, hes going to be living in that household for his college years too because hes going local. It kind of hit a bad point when I witnessed her flip a shit on him for kissing the girl and he was looking at me like ""please say something about this"" and I didn't say anything really. What do I do Reddit? How do I go about passing this message in a way that opens her eyes in how she is hurting her son? I honestly feel as if if he was to rebel and just do what he wants for a bit and go to a party, she probably would eventually give in (she wouldn't ever kick him out), but I obviously don't want to RECOMMEND that to him lol. 

 EDIT: I should also point out that he DOES have a good relationship with her. This might sound weird but they get along very well, they watch TV and movies together and laugh and all that. She is extremely helicopter parenty and he despises that, but besides that he does not resent her, he just wants her to stop being crazy about this.
He didn't even care about the over protectiveness until about 4 months ago when I guess his friends started going to more parties and such. So its not as if this is a long term issue, for most of his early HS years he just played video games all day so the crazy restrictive rules didn't even apply cause he never went out. 
So now that he is trying to go out more and be with his friends, the rules are coming into play more and more and stressing both of them out. I just need her to understand that these rules are for a 13 year old kid, not a 17 year old kid. I think she will understand... but I still don't really know what to do. 

  **tl;dr**: sister is sheltering her son to extreme levels, doesn't let him kiss girls or hang out with friends, is brutally strict with him. Son asked me to intervene. "

My brother personally handed my brother his wedding invitation and asked him to come to his wedding. My brother called me last night and told my boyfriend is allowed no where near his wedding, and if he comes then I must stay away as well.

"My family is calling my older brother [28M] and I [24M] selfish, because we refuse to share his whealth with them to keep them from becoming homeless. I'm starting to feel guilty and have doubts?


Typo *wealth* 

There are quite a few of us in this family (34, 31, 29, 28, 26, 22, 20, 16 &amp; 15) and I am 24. Our parents started when they were very young, to put it lightly. One of my older brothers Ashton (28) is a very successful business owner and makes a lot more money than any of us make in a year at our jobs. He enjoys buying pricey things for himself, and frequently spends quite some money on me, and our two youngest siblings Macy (16) and Danny (15). He gives me my own portion of his money to save/spend whenever I want. He does favor us three out of all of our siblings, and doesn't attempt to hide it from everyone else. 

Our parents were abusive toward him during his childhood, and our other siblings, even some of the younger ones kinda followed along with them when they became older. This followed him into adulthood (not the physical abuse), but being excluded from family events and talking about him behind his back. We were both particularly close throughout our childhood, as well as when our baby siblings came along we became very protective of them.

Of course when he began to become successful and earn more money is when everyone began treating him well. Our parents are still trying to pay off debt and most of our siblings are either still living at home or struggling to pay their bills. Ashton doesn't help them at all, which I understand. I currently live with him, as well do Macy and Danny (who got removed and placed with us due to neglect/abuse).

I've gotton calls and many texts from the family telling me that we're selfish, a ""disgrace""to the family, we ""stole"" their kids,  and that even if Ashton doesn't help, I should at least lend some money to them so they don't become homeless (that's how bad their financial situation is at the moment).

I have been feeling guilty about all this honestly (a fault of mine is being way too empathtic) I'm starting to wonder if I am being selfish? What if they do become homeless, then what do I do...just leave them out there? I don't expect Ashton to help them and with good reason, but how do I get rid of my guilt and not cave in....

"My husband [27] is extremely handsome and successful, and lots of people try to tell me [31F] that he is ""out of my league""


My husband is a successful print model and graphic designer. He has been featured in lots of store catalogs for international companies. Obviously he is very handsome. Think, Swedish cheekbones.


I am a professional photographer and work regularly, but make a much smaller salary than my husband. I'm just average looking. We got married after dating a year and living together half a year more.


I love being with my husband. He's smart, funny, and totally humble even though he is utterly BEAUTIFUL.  He's so gorgeous that strangers have on more than one occasion asked to take a ""selfie"" with him because he's such a prototype of a tall, blonde, model type. I've always been proud of him. Out of respect for me he will usually refuse selfies with people unless they are just silly teenagers or if they specifically say they recognize him. He treats the grown women as if they should know better.


I knew to expect it, but haters are always coming up to me and passive-aggressively insinuating, ""what's he doing with YOU?"" or that he's slumming with me or that I must be blackmailing him or that he must be blind. People also insinuate that I'm robbing the cradle with him. Which means either they think that I'm a geezer if I'm only four years older than him, or that they are saying I look like an old hag next to him.


I just roll with it because I know women can be cruel and jealous and they want what I have.


What I really hate though is that they are hitting HIM with the same kind of questioning.


I know some people are trying to convince him that I am emotionally hurting him by making him not realize his true value as a person. Like I'm ruining his self esteem to make him more on ""my level.""


It's been happening more and more lately since I'm pregnant four months and am having a little bit of trouble putting myself together every day.


It's killing me that he's surrounded basically by these gorgeous Russian and French models and they're flirting with him so hard. It's hurting my confidence and I'm scared because I'm so in love with him and he's dad to my baby and I would fall to pieces without him. These other women have NO shame and NO mercy.


What can I do about this? Or, about these feelings?


My husband keeps telling me he loves me and that he only has eyes for me but sometimes I see myself in the mirror in the morning lately and see someone fatter older and uglier than him and wondering why he's wasting his life with me.


How do I get over it?


tl;dr

Husband is prettier, younger, and more successful than me. People never let me OR him forget it. It's killing my confidence "
"I[27m] broke up with my girlfriend[26f], yet she still maintains on social media that we are in a relationship, and tells every girl I try to date that I am cheating


My ex-girlfriend and I dated for six months. Initially I was worried about things, I found out from just conversations that she slept around a lot. However, she would frame it all as it wasn't her fault because the guys she ran into just ""used her for sex"" that they wanted a relationship but they didn't. 

But over time she shared stories about how she fucked a guy because he had a huge dick, about some guy that was a star college basketball player. And in general she would be very manipulative that she didn't get her way. But what through me off and what really ended up making our relationship last so much longer is that she was very affectionate, and made me really feel like I was the best boyfriend in the world being with her. Eventually I did end things. 
 
It did not go down well, she begged me to stay, told me that she thought we were going to get married. Talked about how she has never had a guy treat her so good. I just told her that we aren't on the same page. 

Since then, things have been tense, she still has photos of me everywhere on her social media accounts. And it makes things really awkward, because if I start for example following a new girl on Instagram, and she thinks we are dating, she will private message them that he is in a relationship and not to get in between. I have talked to women that I have been seeing about this, and while they more often than not believe me, this doesn't look good and it causes unnecessary drama. I don't know what to do. I really just want her to forget about me, but I don't know how I can do that. I have blocked her, yet she still stalks my profiles.

"Getting there: I [23 M] met my estranged sister [11 F] for the first time, need advice on how to raise her properly!


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ue078/i_22_m_met_my_estranged_sister_11_f_for_the_first/)

**tl;dr**: I met my estranged little sister who had been brutally abused on a regular basis in the past. I asked for advice on how to take care of her and raise her given this.

***

Decided to log in to thank you folks for the great advice and support I received last month. They were extremely helpful and using them I've managed to greatly improve my relationship with my sister. 

She's settled in very well at home. Even redecorated her room to her liking and is enjoying living in a relaxed environment and being able to make choices (which I imagine wasn't a thing prior to us meeting). She's great when it comes to routines and organization. In fact, I'm surprised at how incredibly easy it is to raise her. There is no need for me to say anything; she helps me with basically everything from cooking to cleaning up to laundry etc. 

It seems like I've gained her trust. I wouldn't say we're very close just yet but she's a lot more affectionate towards me. I can sit next to her and give her hugs now; a month ago that would've frightened her immensely. 

We've been doing a bunch of things which definitely brought us closer. I've taken her to the beaches, the surrounding neighborhood and local places, and Orlando too which is around 50mins drive away. We've also been going to see rocket launches, which is a common pastime unique to this area, so we've kind of made that our special thing. 

She's still reading a lot, 1-2 books a day on some days. I have some national geographics and picture books which she's gone through already, and the rest is engineering books which she doesn't understand but still picks them from my shelf, and asks me to explain it to her which is kind of cute.

She's seeing a therapist every week and I've taken her to a doctor for a medical checkup - she's quite a bit underweight due to malnutrition; some visible scars on her body; no bone damage or internal injuries; everything else alright; doctor said she'll be fine.

School started last week but I can't say she likes it very much. A combination of not being able to fit in with other kids and finding classes very boring has made her reluctant to go. Fortunately she made friends with this other girl from class who seems to be one of the popular ones, so hopefully she can persuade my sister to be more open and outgoing. On top of that, her mother is actually a therapist and she's also been giving me a lot of support. 

All in all, she's doing great. Regular therapy, making some friends and having various hobbies is putting her in the right direction for recovery. I worried a lot last month because she suddenly came into my life but I have everything under control now. Still feels kind of weird to be responsible for another person out of the blue but we'll be fine. 

So with that I'll end the post. Thanks once again to everyone who gave me advice and PM'd me when I needed it the most. 
  
***

  **tl;dr**: We're a lot closer to each other now. She's making making great strides towards recovery and enjoying her life for the first time. 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice and replies, the PMs, people offering to send me their old e-readers etc. I love this community. Sorry for being rather inactive in the comment section, I was caught up with work the last few days and only just logged in - as with my original post, I do read every comment and even take notes on some of them :p

"My [19M] uncle [32M] pushed my sister [15F] into the pool as a prank. She felt humiliated and called him a jerk. Now everyone demands her to apologize. Am I the only one who thinks this is absurd?


This weekend we were having a small party and my uncle pushed my fully clothed sister into the pool for everyone to laugh. It seemed like I was the only one who didn't find it funny except my sister who felt humiliated and was very angry. I helped her out and took her inside and on the way she said to our uncle ""you're a jerk"" and everyone were like totally shocked!

We didn't come back to the party but when everyone left our parents came and told her that she was out of line and that she needs to call our uncle and apologize to him. She doesn't want to.

We don't know what to do. She asked me for advice and I told her that I don't think she should apologize. She told me she'll do it if I think she should but I want some opinion on what we should do here. I think what our uncle did was very disrespectful. She's not 5.

"My (22F) husband (27M) doesn't trust me to make purchases for myself even though I support both of us financially


My husband has this idea about my being irresponsible with money. He's had it for as long as we've been dating. He thinks this, from what he tells me, because I do a lot of online shopping. I grew up in the middle of nowhere, where the only way to get a lot of things was to order them. I wanted to wear clothes that weren't purchased at the local Walmart or feed store, so I shopped online. I have a lot of food allergies and I wanted to find versions of foods I could actually eat, so I shopped online. I love sci-fi shows and I wanted action figures that I knew I had no change of finding locally, so I shopped online. Even after I moved out of my home town and into the relatively large city we currently live in, I continued to shop online because it was easier. So every time I make a purchase, it shows up at our door. It makes him very aware of what I'm buying, and even when I sit down with him and open the box in front of him and say ""Here is a bottle of my favorite nail polish, remember how often you see me wearing this polish and remember how I was complaining that I was out?"" Or ""Here are some hazelnuts, they were manufactured in a facility that keeps their nuts segregated, so I can eat these nuts because there's no risk of cross-contamination,"" and he sees that everything that I'm buying has a purpose and isn't just frivolous spending, he still sighs and comments on it every time a new package arrives at our door.

To get into our financials a little bit, I work in a field which requires professional licensure, which I have. I have no debt and I have a decent amount of money in savings. He works in retail and is constantly paying off various debts. We were both briefly in college and we both, separately, chose to stop attending, me to enter the workforce and him for financial reasons, and he's still paying bills from his attendance. Until recently he had medical bills from an ER visit. And he has a credit card, so he always needs to pay his credit card bill. Because of this, I've been paying all the rent and utilities. This isn't a strain on me financially at all, and I'm still able to put money into savings at the end of each month. When we had first moved in together we had discussed splitting the rent equally, but when we'd discovered he wasn't in a financial place to do this, I'd just taken over the payments. 

Now...I'm currently six months pregnant. I've recently reduced my work hours because my body just wasn't able to handle it. I've had miserable nausea, fatigue, leg pain, back pain, ligament pain, and although I tried to tell myself that I was a warrior and that plenty of women work throughout their entire pregnancies, it's become apparent that I'm just not one of those women. I did some math and figured out how many hours I would need to work to cover the bare minimum of rent and bills, and then I reduced my schedule to those hours. So I am still bringing in enough money to support us, I'm just not going to be putting any more money into my savings. Which is fine, because I did the math on those too, and I have enough saved up that we could live on it for ten months with no other income, so I'll definitely be able to take maternity leave and I could even extend it past the standard two months if I needed to. I presented all this information to my husband, told him it would make the money stretch even farther if he was able to contribute, but that even if he couldn't we'd still be fine. He was okay with my reducing my hours and he promised to contribute $200 per month, which it's now looking like he's not going to be doing.

I've only had my reduced schedule for two weeks now, but those two weeks have been great. I got so much cleaning done, I started dragging furniture into what's going to be the nursery, it's so much easier to handle the physical pain when I have the option to go and lay down whenever I need to, and I just feel, overall, so much more ready for our child to arrive.

The only problem is that, recently, my laptop broke. This wasn't all that surprising, since it'd been limping along with noticeable issues for almost a year now, but it had finally reached the point where it wasn't functional at all, and since it was an older laptop it would likely cost more to fix than it was actually worth. So, after confirming it was dead, I picked up my purse, told my husband I was going laptop shopping, and headed for the door.

But he asked me to stop, and told me that he thought I'd get ripped off if I tried to go buy a laptop by myself. I said that I didn't think I would, I just wouldn't blindly follow the salesman, and he questioned if I even had the disposable income to purchase a new laptop. He'd just seen my finances two weeks ago, so I responded that of course I did. He repeated that he thinks I spend too much money, that I do a lot of online shopping, and I reminded him that he'd seen me open everything that I'd purchased and that I'd been buying things like maternity pants and books on childcare, not frivolous items. Next he pointed out that I have plenty of other ways to access the internet; I have my phone, the cheap little tablet I'd bought for travel, and my Kindle, and asked me if I even really needed a laptop. I responded that I definitely did need a laptop, and he asked me to at least wait on purchasing one until he'd looked up some specs and had told me what he thought I should buy. I agreed.

A few days later, he calls me over to his computer (he has a desktop) and shows me a laptop which he likes. I said that I didn't really like it, and he said that he did and he was going to buy it for himself. I asked him if *he* had the money to spend on a laptop, and he said that he would put it on his credit card and that he needed a mobile computer for when he was watching the baby. He ordered the laptop and told me that I could use it too. So now he has a laptop and I still don't. 

The complex we live in doesn't have laundry in the unit. Instead the laundry is communal and it's $2.50 to complete a load. I hated this, until I discovered something which made my day so much easier. I'm not sure if this sub allows linking, but if you google ""Panda Compact Washer"" you'll see what I'm talking about. It's basically a teeny-tiny washing machine that you hook up to your sink. My god, I love this thing. No more trekking out lugging a laundry hamper and a bag of quarters. No more brushing my hair on a Saturday morning because doing laundry requires going out in public. And it paid for itself within the first two months of use. My husband has heard me talk about how much I love my washing machine, so he's well aware of how much I love it. Seriously, I never shut up about it.

Well, recently it stopped draining. I tried everything that I could to fix it; I snaked it from both ends, I turned it upside-down in the bathtub and poured water up the drainage hose, I tried that pipe declogging trick with baking soda and vinegar, and I even pried the casing open and took a look inside it, but since the pipes were a visibly thin plastic and the wires to the motor were run right beside them, I decided that trying to open the pipes would probably make the machine unsafe, and I closed it back up again. This was also why I was afraid to try a chemical declogger, in case it weakened the plastic. But, these really aren't expensive machines. They're certainly *much* cheaper than a laptop. So I texted my husband to let him know that I was going to be ordering a new one, and asking if he'd mind if I needed his help to get it inside and set up, since they're heavy and I'm pregnant.

And he responded that he didn't know if I really needed one. 

I don't know, man. Does your wife need a *washing machine?* Which she would be spending her own money on? When you just bought yourself a laptop for no good reason? 

When he got home we talked about it, with my emphasizing that this is a *household appliance* I am looking to replace here, and he agreed that I could order one, which I did. But I'm pissed about it, and more than a little incredulous. I am the one who supports us financially. He trusts me to keep the rent paid, but not to handle my discretionary spending money? I know he's always thought of me as being financially irresponsible, even though I've been going out of my way to show him that I'm not, and an argument could be made that no one really *needs* a laptop, but why the hell wouldn't he want his *wife* to replace her broken *washing machine?* He asks me every couple of days if his work clothes are clean. They're not gonna be clean if I don't have any way to wash them. 

We're about to have a baby together. A baby which I'm going to be the primary caretaker for, since he'll continue to work full time while I take my maternity leave. What if I decide I need to make some semi-expensive purchase on behalf of the baby and he takes issue with it, even though I'll have used my own money to do it? I need to have some degree of freedom here, especially when it comes to *basic household appliances* being kept up and running. 

I just feel disrespected. I've taken him over our financial situation, I've shown him the things that I'm buying, and we still have to have this conversation every time I buy *anything.* We're in good standing with our landlord, the goddamn internet bill is paid every month, *none* of which he has a hand in, and yet his distrust of me with money that I've earned runs deep enough that we have to talk about how much I need to have a functional washing machine. 

TLDR: my husband doesn't trust me to buy myself anything with the money that I have in the bank, but will buy himself a laptop on a credit card when I'm the one with the broken laptop. "
"I [31F] found opened condom wrappers in husbands [35M] underwear drawer. They're ours, but we haven't used them in months, yet the wrappers are wet. Is he cheating?


I'm trying not to freak out.  He's at work right now while I'm at home with our toddler trying to keep it together. I really am. He never seemed like the guy who would ever do this, let alone ever have time to cheat as we're in communication all day long and he comes home right after work, most days I pick him up and drop him off. But I know it's possible. 

I'm 7 months pregnant.  We haven't used those condoms in ages since we began trying for this child, and clearly having sex now we don't use the condoms as we don't need too. 

He was just out of town for 2 days. We didn't speak too much as he was busy with this work conference. When I went to bed the night he left I went to sleep in heavy pj's. I got hot being pregnant and all, so I woke up drowsy and in the dark went to grab boxers in his drawer to sleep in.  I fumbled around all corners of the drawer and only felt bundles of socks, and knowing the condom box is always in there I actually didn't feel it and at that moment briefly thought that was strange. But I was tired, fell back asleep and forgot until now. 

He got home last night, so I went to put laundry away and opened the drawer and the condom box was there. I thought okay maybe I'm crazy, I just didn't feel it that night. But hormones and curiosity got the best of me and I looked in the box and two wrappers were opened and very moist with the lube the condoms stored in. 

My question is, how long would the wrappers stay wet? I mean... I can't imagine them staying wet for almost a year since using them, let alone for 2 days right. 

Talk me off the ledge people, am I being hormonal and irrational, or is this plausible they just stayed moist this long? I can't believe this. He really is the last person I ever thought would do this, even if he used them, maybe it was for masturbation? But no condoms are in garbage cans (yeah, I'm that crazy right now I checked), why go through trouble to hide it if so? 

TL;DR - I found opened and wet condom wrappers in husbands drawer, wondering if that means he has recently used condoms.


**Edit** - He called on his break and I couldn't keep it in.  Conversation was cut short as he's working but he's denying cheating and having used them at all, so no to the masturbation theory. I have no idea what to believe. Can condom wrappers seriously stay that moist and oily feeling in open air for a year!? I don't know what to do.

**Edit updated 2** - Alright folks, I clearly have some problems in my marriage. We spoke again as he told me he couldn't concentrate at work. He told me over and over again he had no idea how they were opened and when and hasn't even looked at or touched the condom box in a year. 

He told me he was offended and how could I accuse him of an affair, how awful that is. I kept repeating what I said, which was ""can you explain why there's opened condom wrappers in your drawer that are still wet/oily?"", I never went nuts, I never said ""you cheated, were over!"" I never said the words cheated even. I just asked him to explain. I told him it's a shocking thing to find, of course I'd ask about it. He kept going on about how I'm ruining his day, how can he possibly continue working, etc. 

Finally I said okay well, I still need to figure out why they're still wet after all this time. And then folks, he goes quiet and weird and says ""okay, well, I used one a couple months ago""...... I asked why he didn't just say that from the beginning. I asked why he used it. He said he put it on,""maybe to masturbate"". Maybe? I asked why he can't just be honest, I could care less if he used them to jerk off, or put a dildo in his ass, but he made me feel crazy even though I spoke very calmly and rationally to him, he denied ever using them, and then suddenly he tells me okay, he did. He also said he used ""one"". I said two were used. He said ""okay maybe it was two"". I said ""just be honest with me, I don't care if you used them to masturbate but you keep half truth telling"". He just wouldn't be totally honest no matter what, it was like pulling teeth. 

So that's where we're at, I'm upset he lied to me with such conviction about never touching them, he may have been embarrassed but to tell me up and down he promises he hasn't used them since me, that he has no idea, that I'm crazy, that's a huge problem. 

Also I am aware immediately thinking your spouse is unfaithful (even if I never told him that) is in itself a problem I need to reflect on. 

Thanks for all your input originally. 

My use of the word ""wet"" when referring to the oily condom wrapper seems to have really struck a cord with some of you. Sorry for ruining your days.

Original post: tl;dr - Was unsure how to proceed with bringing up personal sex preferences with new partner.
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xeqrq/i_31m_have_gone_out_with_a_lady31f_a_couple_times/


Everyone(all commenters and myself)was right, about everything. That's really the only way I can put it.


She came to my house for the first time last night, and while making out, I stopped and asked her what she likes(from oral and PIV) and wants me to do. At first she said the equivalent of, ""I like what you do, do that."" I think she was too horny to think about it right then, because after round 1, she did tell me some specifics she likes. Also, it turns out I wasn't hurting her and her stamina is not low. She was stopping because she was too sensitive from orgasming so intensely, so many times in succession, and couldn't form the words to tell me that in the moment(ego boost x100). So, we pretty much fucked all night...with intermittent breaks.


The head thing seems to be working itself out very nicely, without even addressing it directly. I went down on her for a good while(I get really turned on from it too). She started giving me that same, whack bj, and as suggested, I didn't react(beyond trying to maintain my woody). She started trying different angles and techniques, and boy, did she find what works. 


This morning we talked more, and her ex-hub, had a very low sex drive, but she wants to explore now. We talked generally about some things we'd like to do, and I think it's about to get a little crazy. Thanks to everyone who commented. It really got my nerves up to have, what I thought would be, an awkward conversation. Turned out to be anything but awkward.


TL;DR - Open communication led to better sex, and exponentially better blowjobs, which in turn, led to more communication and even more better sex, and crazier sex down the road."

"My [26M] ex-girlfriend [26F] who I dated for 4 years cheated on me. My friends and family are still close with her and told me to get over it. They're even friendly with the guy she cheated on me with.


Loooooong story short, I dated Kristen for 4 years. We met in college, were friends for a bit, and started dating. We moved in together and were definitely exclusive, I was even thinking about marriage. 

So, Kristen's family lives on the other side of the country. We both moved to the area where my family &amp; friends live. I have a HUGE family and a bunch of friends, and as soon as I introduced Kristen to them, they all loved her. She's ridiculously charming and sociable, and quickly became the social butterfly of this big group of people.

Things were going really well for us, we were living together and I thought we were very happy. A few months ago, I found out that Kristen was cheating on me with a guy she works with, Kenny [32]. My first response was obviously being devastated. I really loved her and wanted to marry her. The second response was jealousy and insecurity. I've seen Kenny around sometimes and the guy is tall, good looking, good job, in shape, funny, etc. It's a little funny in a sad way because he reminds me of the ""you vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about"" joke going around on Twitter.

I confronted her about it, she admitted it and basically said: ""Look, I'm sorry to have hurt you. I don't know if you can forgive this or not, but honestly I think that Kenny and I are really good for each other so it's best that me and you break this off."" I couldn't wrap my head around the fucking audacity to assume that I would want to forgive her and that she gets to ""win"" by breaking up with me first. It's been months and I'm still upset about the breakup.

Me and Kristen break up, she moves out (and moves in with Kenny), and news of the whole thing gets around to my circle of family and friends. At first they were very nice and people were telling me how unfortunate the whole situation was and how life is unpredictable yada yada yada. 

Literally 6 weeks after I find out Kristen cheated on me and she moved out, my oldest sister had a baby shower and invited Kristen. I wasn't at the shower but when I found out she was there, I was pissed. How can my sister betray me and be so loyal to a cheater? I made it very clear to my family how I felt about it but they seemed to blow off my reaction. Then maybe 3 weeks after that, one of my cousin's had a party and (again) invited Kristen. I was there and felt really uncomfortable. What pissed me off was how my cousins and the friends that I introduced to her were all in a circle talking to her, while I was so uncomfortable that I left early.

And the straw that broke the camel's back was yesterday when my best friend and his wife had a BBQ and (of course) Kristen was invited. And she brought Kenny with her. This is the first time Kenny met the group (again, people who I knew first) and they decide he's just a swell fucking guy. They're all laughing and talking. One of my friends came up to me and said ""shit, he's cool. Just gotta make sure I don't leave him alone with my wife."" It's a joke to them. I loved that girl for 4 years and treated her like a queen, but that means nothing. Afterwards I asked my best friend &amp; his wife if they invited Kenny or just Kristen and they said ""Kristen's really great and we wanted to meet her new boyfriend. What's in the past is in the past, let it go."" Keep in mind, everyone there knows that Kristen cheated on me with Kenny. Even my parents are telling me that Kristen's a great girl and ""like another daughter"" to them. My sister point-blank said to me that if she were to get married tomorrow, Kristen would be a bridesmaid and Kenny would be invited to the wedding.

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to give some ultimatum or anything, but I really think my family is treating me horribly. The only thing I can do is stop going to all social functions and that's a shit option. Am I right to be mad at my family and friends about this?

"My [26F] boyfriend [30M] of 11 months is telling me I pee too much, need outside perspective


So this is kind of weird, but to give some background, I grew up with a brother who always maintained that my mom and I went to the bathroom too much. He'd always roll his eyes and scoff whenever she and I had to go before a movie and then after it too, every few hours on a road trip, etc. I always figured that since it was my mom and me going, that it was normal and my brother was being an ass. Or that maybe my mom and I both had small bladders since we're kind of thin women - I'm 5'8"" and 130lbs (which is the heaviest I've ever been and for most my life I've been clinically underweight) - and my brother was still being an ass about it.

But now my boyfriend is telling me the same thing and I don't know how to handle it? Usually it comes up in discussion when we go out to eat, because I normally drink plenty of fluids with my meals and can go through two or three glasses by the time dinner's over - so I usually go to the bathroom right after eating, about an hour after that, and then again an hour after that. I know that's three times, but when we go out I'm drinking a lot of fluid and also eating a lot, so my stomach is kind of pressing on my bladder? I also do my best to keep hydrated on top of that.

My boyfriend keeps bringing it up through. He acts surprised when I say I have to go and gets kind of standoffish about it, especially since when we go out to eat and then try to be intimate afterwards, I have to stop to pee. He's suggested that I not drink so much at dinner, and even given me looks before when I accept refills from the waiter. He's asked me if I have a yeast infection since that's supposed to cause frequent urination. I also mentioned I had a history of diabetes in my family and then he wanted to be sure I don't have that. I know I don't have diabetes or even pre-diabetes (I have another condition that's monitored through blood work every six months) and I'm pretty sure I don't have a yeast infection either. But he keeps bringing it up, sometimes in a way that makes it seem like he's annoyed and sometimes in a way that seems kind but still implies there's something wrong with me. He's brings up stories about people dying from drinking too much water and asks me what I think about them, but never seems satisfied with my answer (that it's sad and wondering how much water they drank). When I go back to visit my family (about a six hour drive) he'll ask me how many times I stopped. Sometimes the answer is three - about every hour, hour and a half, depending on when I left - and then he'll go on a tangent about how that's wasting time and I should've just kept going, etc. I tell him that it's not his business how long it takes me, and that I like to get out and stretch my legs too.

This has been going on since the start of our relationship, but it happened so infrequently that I didn't really pay it much mind. However it really came to a head for me this past weekend when we were driving back from the beach. It was a three hour drive (he was driving in his car) and I had to pee about an hour in. When I told him, he asked, ""What would happen if I just kept driving? And didn't stop?"" I told him that if that happened, I'd pee in his car. He looked at me and went ""Really?"" as though he expected me to be joking. I looked at him and said, ""Really! I have to pee! I can't hold it two more hours!"" And then he found a gas station and we stopped.

I can't help but think about what would've happened if we hadn't stopped though. Like, before he was just kind of questioning, and even the medical stuff could've been him just...being concerned? But this is the first time he's done or said anything that made me worried that he might have prevented me from getting to the bathroom. I'm also feeling really guilty now over the amount that I pee?

So... what's reddit's take I guess? Am I overreacting to the beach incident? Should I just...try to drink less water? I'm going through an average of about 64oz or water or lemonade a day (I have a hydration tracker app). Is there something I can do to get him off my back or at least understand that I genuinely do have to pee? Since both my boyfriend and my brother have brought this up, does that make them both assholes or is something wrong with me?

Tl;Dr I am well hydrated. Boyfriend thinks I pee too much and keep bringing it up."
"I (23F) received an interesting voicemail from my ex's (23M) new girl. I think he has been lying to her. How do I tactfully approach this situation?


The title pretty much says it all. 

I got a call in the middle of the night last night from an unknown number. I woke up to a voicemail. The voicemail goes something like this: 

""Hi [throwawayq44], I'm so sorry if this is weird or creepy. My name is [Girl]. I just have a question for you and please be honest with me, how do you know [my ex]? Please just text me or give me a call when you have the chance! Thanks!"" 

**Some context:** My ex and I broke up in March after 3.5 years of dating after I found out he had been cheating on me. He was pretty emotionally abusive and I started seeing a therapist after the breakup, so for my own good I've maintained a successful no-contact with him for a few months. He still tries to reach out to me often (through phone calls, texts from his friend's phones, used to come to my house sometimes and leave letters) and I have not responded to anything. 

I had no idea he was dating again and frankly it doesn't bother me. I am somewhat concerned for this girl, however. I don't know how she got my phone number or knows my name, and not sure why she would want to know who I am. I'm guessing she found something out about me from his friends/family or possibly snooped through his phone to find he has been trying to contact me. 

My intuition tells me not to touch this with a 10-foot pole but a part of me wants to call her back and gently tell her the truth and set the record straight. Her voicemail sounded rushed and anxious. Any advice?

**UPDATE:** So the general consensus here (and between my friends) was that I should call her back and let her know. I triple-checked that I had my ex blocked on everything, and then I sent her a text saying:

""Hi. I got your voicemail this morning. I am [Ex's] ex-girlfriend. We were together from October of 2012 to March of this year. We are currently no-contact and I haven't spoken with him in months and I hope you can please respect that by not telling him you have contacted me. I am not sure what your motives are for reaching out but in my experience, if you are having suspicions about him, they are generally for a reason. He is a cheater, and an expert manipulator. Don't lose your sense of worth or your sense of self. All the best.""

She immediately called me and I was too scared to pick up. She called back again about a half hour later and we had a small chat. She verified that I was his ex-girlfriend and said she had looked on his phone last night and found that he had been trying to call me late at night for the last month and a half... every night. I have him blocked so I never received these calls. I am honestly not sure why he is still trying to get into contact with me but I told her the story of how we broke up. She just said she ""has a lot to think about."" I think I have done my job here. Thanks for the advice, everyone.

"My dad [45m] thinks he is 'giving me away' at my [23f] wedding. I don't know how to tell him he's not.


So basically I feel kind of bad, but I also feel like I'm justified in my choice, so if I'm not please feel free to take me down a few notches.

Here's some back story before I get to the issue at hand.

My parents got married very young and had kids very young and divorced before they were 27.  My dad left when I was 6 and was in and out of my life until I was 14 and then I went NC until I was 20.  

My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, and one of the reasons I went NC.  He was violent and mean spirited, he would call me drunk in the middle of the night and then scream at me for being up so late even though he was the one that woke me up.  He still to this day says terrible things about my mother that I shut down immediately.  When we were very young, he would either not show up to pick us up for the weekend or he would pick us up and drop us off with our grandparents.  I don't have many good memories of my dad growing up.

My mom is a saint.  She raised two kids by herself, supported us, and we struggled a lot, but she is my rock.  She is the only parent I have ever had and she has sacrificed everything to make sure my sister and I had a good upbringing and became good people.

Now, my problem.

Like I said, for the last 3 years or so, I am in contact with my dad again and so is my sister.  His drinking seems to be under control and he's not as nasty as he used to be.  I have pretty much accepted that he is who he is and I have to accept that if I want a relationship with him.  We talk at least once a week and I try to make time to have dinner with him every so often, simply because he's my dad and I've forgiven him for what I can.  There are some things I won't ever be able to forgive.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt though, he has been trying harder than he ever has to be my parent and I am grateful for it.

I have been with my fiance for 6 years, and we are getting married on October 1st.  My entire life, I always knew my mom would be the one to walk with me down the aisle and 'give me away' at my wedding.  We are also doing a dance together at the reception instead of me dancing with my dad.  Well.  My dad asked me last week what he has to do and says he knows he has to look nice because 'everyone will be watching him walking with me'.  I never asked him to give me away, he just assumed because 'that's what dads do' right?  I didn't know what to say, I just skirted around it and changed the subject.

On one hand, I guess both of my parents could do it to save feelings, but honestly I want my mom to.  Just my mom.  She is who I have been able to depend on for everything my entire life and she is who I want to walk with me on my wedding day, and I feel like anything else is a slap in the face to every ounce of hard work she has put into me.  In my opinion, as much as he has redeemed himself recently, my dad hasn't earned that spot beside me.

So what do I do?  If I decide to only have my mom do it, how do I tell my dad?  Do I compromise how I've always wanted things and how I think it should be to keep my dad from being upset?  I'm at a loss and I really don't know how to approach this.

tl;dr  My mostly absent father assumed he'd be walking me down the aisle at my wedding despite me not ever asking him to.  How do I tell him I don't want that?"

"Me [26F] with my friend[24F]; she's not conventionally attractive but keeps applying for jobs that require a certain level of physical beauty


My friend Ashley [24F] is great. She's sweet and driven and creative and caring. I'm honestly convinced that she could build a good career for herself in most industries. It's just that she keeps applying for jobs that are explicitly hiring really, really pretty people and then being completely devastated by the inevitable rejection. 

Ashley isn't ugly; I want to make that clear. She's tall (about 5'10) and slim (130-ish pounds). That said, she has pretty bad facial acne that's resistant to every treatment she's willing to try. She has dark, thick eyebrows which she doesn't groom or style. Her hair reaches past her waist, and while it's very pretty, it's not really the look most of her preferred careers are looking for. She's not curvy and she dresses quite conservatively, which leads to her looking shapeless. Some of these things are fixable, some are not, but the point is, when you imagine a 'hot girl', you're not thinking of her. 

Here's a list, in no particular order, of the jobs Ashley has applied to over the past four years: brand representative model (i.e. the pretty girls who work at car shows), club promoter model, Disney princess, high fashion model, catalog model, actress in commercials, you get the picture. To the best of my knowledge, she's never gotten past the first or second round of auditions and interviews. 

There are two big problems when it comes to Ashley. First, the rejections really mess her up. She stays in, she stops talking with me and the rest of her friends for a couple of weeks, she refuses to date, and she tries weird crash diets. Her behavior would look like the symptoms of a mental illness if she didn't get over it in a few months, just to apply again, get rejected, and repeat the cycle. Second, Ashley is putting her life on hold to follow this dream. She works retail and she's overqualified for it. But she's convinced that there's no point in looking for any other kind of job, since she'll just have to quit when she makes it big. She's always short on money and working miserable hours. 

So, reddit, any advice? Are there any jobs that are close in spirit to what she wants and are actually attainable? Is there a way to gently hint to her that she might want to consider a different career path? Or, if that doesn't work, how do we get her to react to rejection more constructively?

**tl;dr**: My friend wants to work as a model or similar but doesn't have the looks for it. Not being hired makes her feel terrible. How can we talk to her about this? "

"My boyfriend [24M] despises when I [22F] go surfing, but it's a big part of my life. What do I do?


I won't give out too many details, but I'm an avid surfer and I've been in a few championships throughout my life, yet nothing too major; mostly small tournaments held in my country. I began surfing when I was just twelve years old when my father bought me my first board and we've been surfing together ever since, though in the last few years he's decided to stop due to a back injury. I surf mostly with my cousins now, and sometimes with a group of friends I met through surfing. Basically, I don't know what my life would be like if I didn't surf. I'm in no way 'addicted' to it, and I can undoubtedly go weeks without it, but I do start to miss it after some time. I enjoy being able to go at LEAST once every month, but I won't complain nor become unbearable to be around if I don't. 

I've met some great people down at the beaches and it's a great culture if it's what you're interested in, and I've recently become a kitesurfing instructor down at the beach, so four days a week I work from 2pm-7pm while I'm in between jobs.

Let's get to the issues now! I've been with Mark for seven months so it's a fairly new relationship and up until last week I've been really happy and there haven't been many problems. Last week, he admitted to me he has a huge problem with me going surfing and he asked me stop. He's told me the major issue is his mother drowned when he was just a little boy, and he says he's freaking out thinking he'll lose me to the ocean as well. I told him I understand his concerns but these are risks I'm willing to take, and so he should trust in me and allow me to carry on doing what I love doing. I'm not stupid, I don't go anywhere near the sea when it's not in a good state. I know about under currents, I know when not to swim, but he doesn't trust that I do. 

I understand his worries but I feel like he isn't trusting me. Another major issue is he doesn't like my group of friends who come with me and he says they make him feel small and emasculated, just because they can surf and he cannot. I've told him that's ridiculous and I've never even thought of them as attractive or appealing to me as more than just a friend, but he still tells me he feels jealous and insecure when they're around. He never comes to the beach with us anymore, so I don't think he's even seen them in a while. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want him to feel jealous or worried about me, but I also can't stop doing what I love to do. It's a fun sport, and I know I'm good at it. It feels strange to give it up because my boyfriend doesn't like it. I've thought about it and I'm not sure if he just feels insecure because he's a slightly overweight and doesn't enjoy working out, but that would be so silly. I don't know how to approach this. He's been telling me he doesn't like it for several reasons so now I'm not sure which one to believe?

I want to ask him about this. Yesterday was the first time I've gone surfing in two weeks, and he refused to speak to me when I called him once I got home. He didn't return my calls nor messages, and this morning he explained it was because he was disappointed in me for going surfing again.

I'm getting sick of this attitude and I don't know what to do. Thanks in advance, and I'm sorry for quite a long post.

tl;dr Boyfriend has decided he doesn't like when I go surfing for several reasons. One reason is he's worried something will happen to me like I'll drown, another is he doesn't like the people I go down to the beach with. He wants me to stop but I don't want to, and I want to know what the real reason is. HELP ME!"

**Update** We just had our come-to-Jesus talk.  I explained to him in no uncertain terms that I want to see some concrete improvements, and he says that he understands what I want those improvements to be.  I told him that I am tired of having this argument and seeing no changes, so this time, there are date stamps on it.  If one month from today I am seeing no changes and we are still where we started, he goes to the guest room.  If one month from that we are back here again, he goes to his mom's house.  If one month from that we are still in the same place, we go to divorce court.  He says that he understands and is going to work towards change.  I will keep you guys posted for those that care.

Let me give a little background.  My husband and I met when we were in college.  We were friends for 7 months before we started dating, we dated for 23 months before we got engaged, and we were engaged for 21 months before we got married.  So we didn't exactly rush into things here.

Lately (well, for a while now) I feel like I am having to raise my husband, and I am getting sick of it.  I have a Master's degree and work at a full-time, career-path job that I have had for almost 6 years.  I am training for a marathon and keep an active social life.  My husband does have his Bachelor's, but he is working a part-time job as a delivery driver and is registered as an Uber driver on the side (although I can't remember the last time he turned on the app and picked up a fare).  He plays video games literally 4+ hours every single day and if he could survive without ever leaving the couch, I think he would stay on it forever.

I am a very ambitious and goal-driven person, and he is not.  If it weren't for me, I 100% believe that my husband would be a single college drop-out living with his parents and delivering pizzas for spending money.  And he would be just as content with his life that way as he is with it now.  He seems perfectly happy to just sit around, get fatter, work just enough to scrape by financially, and play video games all day.

If I don't tell him to do something, it doesn't get done.  When I go out of town on a business trip, I come home to dirty dishes, dirty laundry, and an overflowing garbage can.  Because without me there to either do it for him or tell him to do it himself, he somehow doesn't realize that dishes and clothes don't wash themselves and that garbage doesn't take itself out.  If I don't remind him a hundred times that a certain event or obligation is coming up, he will absolutely forget it (and sometimes he still does anyway).  If I don't roll him out of bed when his alarm clock goes off every morning, he will turn it off and be late for work (like he was today).  If I don't remind him to brush his teeth, he'll go days without doing it.  If I don't stand over him and watch him fill out a job application, he won't apply for better jobs at all.

And it's not about the money that he makes at his job.  I make enough money by myself to support the both of us, and I'm not trying to save up for a vacation home in the Hamptons or anything.  It's about the fact that a college-educated grown man is working part-time as a delivery driver, *and he doesn't seem to care.*  When I talk to him about his job, he says he doesn't like it, so I tell him to apply for other jobs.  But he never does.

I have even tried to help him with his job search.  I have polished his resume for him.  I have searched for and found jobs that I think he would like and sent him the application links.  I have asked around in my network and found some connections who have said that if my husband will apply at their company, they'll put his name forward with HR.  I have done everything short of dress up as him and pretend to be him in an interview.  He resists my efforts to help at every turn.

It has come to a breaking point, and last week we went and sat down with a counselor.  In the session, my husband said that he's actually not OK with his current situation and would like a better one, but that he gets overwhelmed and discouraged by the job application process.  The counselor worked with him individually on that, and she encouraged me to step back and not get involved in his job search.  She said that if I tell him that I trust him to do it himself and leave it up to him, it will help his confidence and he will do better at job searching on his own.  Guess how many jobs he's applied for in the last 8 days since the session?

Last night as we were getting ready for bed, I was standing in the bedroom and I heard him yelling from the living room.  He was freaking out and throwing things.  I asked him what was wrong, and he started going off about how the charger cable for his PS4 controllers was broken again and he was tired of not being able to play because the batteries in this controllers were always dead.  (Side note:  this is the second replacement charger cable I have gotten for him that has supposedly broken.  He's the common denominator here, so I don't know what he's doing to break the cables, but I'm not buying him another one.)  I very calmly told him that he needed to calm down, that it wasn't that big of a deal.  He told me that I was being condescending and I needed to shut up.

He then went to bed.  I put on my shoes and went for a drive for a while to clear my head, crying the whole damn time.  My husband, who is supposed to be my partner in life, just threw a temper tantrum because his toy isn't working.  Instead of feeling like he is my equal, I feel like I am raising a 7-year-old with bad manners.

Today he texted me that he is sorry that we fought, but he blamed me for crying (""you didn't need to do that"") and focused the whole time on how I made *him* feel by ""being condescending.""  I texted him back that he needs to get a better job and learn to control his temper because I am done trying to make him grow up.  He hasn't responded.  That was 4.5 hours ago.  I am going out for a beer after work with my 28F best friend.  I don't know what to do or say when I get home.  How do I handle this?  Is there a chance my husband might grow up in counseling?  Or should I just tell him to pack his bags and hire a lawyer?

tl:dr of previous post: My husband doesn't like our daughter's boyfriend because he's black. I'm not really sure what to do.


I would like to thank all of you guys for your responses. Just wanted to update some of you even though the issue is still ongoing.


I confronted my husband and told him that he was the one splitting the family apart and he shouldn't blame me for not going along with his racism. I told him if he continues acting like this he will send both his daughter and myself away from him. He was still angry at me but after awhile until I think he realized that I was serious. He said he wasn't sure if he would ever be 100% okay with it and wants ""the best"" four our daughter but for the sake of keeping the peace he'll let her do whatever she wants.


So our daughter is no longer grounded and is ""allowed"" to hand around Kenton and he is not allowed to say anything about it unless there's evidence of it negatively effecting our daughter. but there is still definitely tension in the house. I feel like our daughter views my husband as kind of ""the evil enemy."" The relationship between them is completely strained. On the other hand I do think Kenton and her are getting very close which is obviously annoying my husband.


Now that school is started, and she and Kenton are in some of the same classes, she spends time with him after school and they study together, or she texts him a lot. For example, on her Instagram and Facebook she posts many pictures of them together (ot inappropriate pictures or kissing pictures, just pictures of them together) and I can tell it annoys my husband but since he promised not to say anything he's keeping quiet


To my husband's credit he asked her to invite him over for dinner but she refused and said that ""she wouldn't put him (Kenton) through that misery"" This again annoyed my husband Now he's claiming that he think they spend to much time together and that she should be focusing on school and applying to college instead, and his race has nothing to do this.


This is bullshit because although they do seem to talk a lot she has always been involved in a lot of activities like cheer-leading, and plays/musicals that kept her out of the house. And most of the time they spend together isn't at his house or anything it's at the school or the library. I told him this and he said that if her grades drop she has to stop seeing him which I agreed with so he's quiet


Anyway to conclude it hasn't' gotten much better, but at least he's not making snide remarks around the house anymore and finding excuses to dislike him.

"My [23M] girlfriend [21F] wants to call me for 6-7 hours every night. Am I wrong to want less?


I started dating this girl about 5 months ago after knowing her for 2 years. I met her in college and we kept in contact after I graduated and dated shortly after. I am in grad school now and we live a few hours away. She is an awesome person and super enjoyable to be around. We have similar hobbies and I love her to death. When she visits for weekends we have an awesome time watching movies or going for walks around the nearby lake.

The only issue is that I am the only person she can talk to while at home. She lives in the middle of nowhere with only her brother. Her mother passed away about a month after we started dating (so about 4 months ago) and she never had a father. Since then, she has been in constant communication day and night.

At first I was completely OK with the situation. While heartbroken about the loss of her mother, I was happy that she was turning to me in her time of need. I love being there for her. I know she needs a shoulder to lean on during these hard times. I don't know what losing a parent is like I can't imagine how hard it must be for her at such a young age. For these reasons, it makes complete sense that she would want to talk so much and I am all for healthy communication to make a long-ish distance relationship work and I am all for supporting her when she needs me most.

Before we were dating, I would tell her that I was going to have a guys night and that I'd either text her later that night or the next morning. She would be totally fine with it. Post-dating, she gets extremely emotionally upset to the point of crying if I do not call her from ~5:00pm-12:00am *every single night.* If I try to hang up early she will become EXTREMELY depressed and talk about how lonely she is and how terrible her night will go if I hang up so I always end up just staying on the phone. If I don't call by 5:30pm, she is calling non-stop until I answer.

I tried having a guys night but she made me feel so incredibly guilty the entire night by constantly texting me about how lonely she was and how she has no one to talk with ect. I ended up cutting the night short to call her. I love her and I understand that she doesn't have a lot to do or have anyone to talk to besides her brother, but I still want at least a little bit of ""me-time"" before bed. I have an internship that lasts from 9:00am-5:00pm which is when she calls. I have not had virtually any time at all to myself for the last 3 months.

Alternatively, I would also like to have a day or so where I do nothing but be a dweeb and play video games for an unhealthy amount of time with the guys (being away from home in grad school, this is my only way to catch up with them. We spend most of the time talking instead of playing anyway). I used to do this semi-frequently as a means of staying in touch, but that has virtually vanished. I don't want to lose my other friendships by only talking to her every day.

So...am I wrong to want some time to myself each night or to want a day to to catch up with friends? I would like to have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend AND my friends if possible, but I feel like I am hurting her by talking to ANYONE else. Thoughts?

"Me [28F] with dad [57M] and step mother [53F]. They told me that I'm receiving half the inheritance my step siblings will receive.


So a few nights ago my dad called me and he told me that he and my step mother are preparing their wills and he wants to talk to me about what portion I'll be receiving.

First let's get this out there that this isn't about money. I'm a high earner and don't need a cent from them. And my dad and step mother are healthy as horses and I hope they'll be with us for 50 more years.

So he told me that they're considering 1/5 of the amount they're setting aside for children. My step brother and step sister (step mother's children) will receive 2/5 each. I asked why not 1/3 each and he thinks that will be unfair as my (stay at home) step mother has contributed a lot to the family and it's unfair if I'll be getting as much as her children. I asked if he has made half the contributions his wife has, as he's now giving me half but he does indeed think her children deserve more.

I lived with my parents until I was 12 when they divorced, and my dad married this woman shortly after. I lived with my mom after that. I visited my dad regularly and have OK relationship with step mother and step siblings, but it's always fair to say I've been an outsider to that family. This decision just cements that. I wouldn't expect my step mother to include me equally as her own children in her will, hell I don't even expect her to include me at all, but I expected more from my dad. This just tells me he considers me half as valuable/wanted as his step kids.

So is it ok to be disappointed here?

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wybm1/my_27m_younger_brother_25m_no_longer_wants/)

So, I didn't have the meeting my parents wanted. They hung up on me when I told them it wasn't going to happen, and said that I was just envious of my brother and always had been. I guess I'm cut off for the time being. However, I see they are liking a lot of grandparents rights articles on Facebook lately. So I doubt they will be learning from this sadly.

I decided to tell Aaron about the forced meeting they planned. He is quite happy that I respected his wishes above there demands. He remains clean and will turn 26 next week. Linnie is fine and remains clean as well. Trent remains healthy and is growing at an astonishing rate.

That's about it. Let's hope it stays that way!

"my [21 F] close friend [22 F] of 15 years has finally gotten into major trouble for shoplifting $1300 worth of makeup. She has been shoplifting on an off since 6th grade. She wants me to write her a character letter. I'm not sure if I should.


[Non-Romantic]

Hi reddit. This situation has left me very confused and it would be nice to have some outside input. Long story short, Marissa and I have been friends for almost 16 years. In most of grade school we didn't really like each other, mostly due to our competitive natures. Eventually we became close friends, and attended the same high school and now a big 10 college. Neither of us are perfect, and she started telling me of shoplifting excursions starting when we were both in 6th grade. I'd go over to her house and she'd show me her vast collection of beauty supplies, and kind of brag about ""I bought that... stole that... oh yeah, that too"" etc. It bothered me, but she didn't get caught so it never became a problem in her life. Her parents got divorced around 9th grade, not sure if that's applicable but it might be?

This apparently continued through to high school as well. I believe I remember her telling me about a time where her and her younger friend Lana got caught at a Walgreens one day shoplifting together but she said they got a slap on the wrist from the cop and a ban from that Walgreens. Later in high school I didn't really go over to her house as much so I didn't see any more stolen stuff or she just didn't tell me about it.

Flash forward to this year. Earlier this year, sometime around March, I get a call from Marissa. She's in tears because she was caught taking about $15 worth of food from a dining hall. She was caught by the manager and was afraid she was going to get kicked out of school, and this was happening on top of her issues with going off depression and anxiety medication, or changing the dosage. She's a fun person to be around and I was aware of her depression issues, as she was aware of my own issues. We shared a lot of secrets which is probably why she felt comfortable enough to let me know that this had happened. Nothing really bad happened after she was caught, only Marissa told me she did this a lot. As in, stealing food from the dining halls. It was very hard for me to understand why, as she had over $1000 on her account for money (her parents are lawyers and very well off). She just ended up going to mandatory meetings a few times about trying to prevent shoplifting and trying to be a better member of our campus. I don't even think it went on a permanent record.

Now, in the past few days, she again called me crying, saying she'd been arrested after going to the mall to the local Lush store and stealing about $1300 worth of stuff. Marissa was read her rights and given a court date after telling the officers that yes, she did take the stuff. She was calling lawyers and planning not to tell her dad. She was terrified that she was going to be convicted of a felony. I can't imagine how she must have felt. She did end up telling her parents because she called her therapist and the therapist told her she probably should. Her dad got so angry apparently, and called her a ""criminal"" and that he could never trust her again. He was going to cut her off completely, (probably after the school incident she was given a final warning) but was convinced to keep paying for college. Marissa was scared he just meant tuition and not housing or food. She still doesn't know and was not planning on getting a job because she needs to hunker down and study (as her grades have been less than stellar), as she was going to get a degree with all the premed requirements (unrelated to her degree, think about getting a psych degree and the premed requirements) and didn't want to get a job in the middle of all that. Marissa has no savings as she spends a lot of her money on shopping. She thinks, and I agree, that she has Kleptomania (none of us are qualified to diagnose her, but the way she described her compulsion to steal sounds right).

She eventually got a hold of a lawyer and that's where my question comes in. Marissa wants me, and a few of her friends and maybe a professor, to write her a letter of character to show at the court date, and since I've known her the longest, she really wants mine. I have a lot of reservations about doing this, for a few reasons. First, she told me she's done this three times this summer and gotten away with it. Similar amounts of stuff. THREE TIMES. I just got home from a summer internship out east a few days ago, and if it wasn't for a plane delay I was going to go shopping with her. To the same store she got caught at. She denies it but I'm scared Marissa would have taken the stuff from Lush if I had been there and I would have gotten into trouble too.

Second, last time this happened (ie stealing from the dining halls) Marissa promised to get help and stop doing it (though that sounds like an impossible promise from someone with kleptomania). She always blames her problems on her meds or her parents or her schoolwork and never seems to want to take responsibility. Somewhere deep down I feel like this is a good thing, that maybe she'll start taking her health seriously now. 

Finally, and this will be the worst sounding one, I'm not sure if I should write her a letter of character because I'm not sure I can vouch for her character. Even when we were little she'd always try to be the center of attention and manipulate people. I remember one time she got mad at me and drew red lines on her arm with a red pen and pretended to hide it when I saw, like she had cut herself. Marissa constantly brings up ""wrongs"" that people have done to her in the past and follows them up with ""but it's no big deal now"", even for stuff that happened when we were in first grade!! It's hard to feel sympathetic towards someone who never seems to want to take responsibility for their actions. She sounds like she has some serious ideas now for taking control of her life back, and that's awesome!!! But I am so skeptical they'll actually happen. Marissa feels super shitty that she keeps doing this and says she wants to stop. 

I'm just not sure what to do reddit. Not even sure if I should stay friends with her. She doesn't really have any other close friends and none of my friends really like her. I guess what I'm asking is, should I write the letter? How do I go about praising someone I believe needs help and who isn't in a praiseworthy spot right now? Am I a huge raging asshole who just needs to help out a friend?? Thank you for your help :) Sorry for textwall!!

TL;DR: Friend from elementary school stole $1300 worth of stuff from a big cosmetics store. This isn't the first time and she's been doing it for years. She was arrested and wants me to write a character letter for the judge. Not sure if I should do it or am asshole. 

Edit1: She just texted me saying ""Don't imply that I've done this before tho. We want to make it an isolated event"" 

Edit2: I'm not writing it. I sent her this:

""Marissa, if you want me to write a letter omitting the events of the past, especially the times you haven't been caught, I can't. That's lying. Especially to a court. I love you and you're my friend but I don't think it's the best idea for me to write you a letter precisely because I have known you so long. You're a kind person but have been doing this for a long time and not mentioning that would be wrong. I cannot write you a letter that would help you so I should not write one at all. Doing so is possibly illegal as well. I'm sorry and wish you the best of luck.""

Edit3: Things went surprisingly well. She told me her lawyer was the one who told her to not mention the other incidents and to make it seem like it was isolated, and she said she wasn't aware it made me so uncomfortable. Also, in regards to the kleptomania, she (again, this is her word and I don't know how honest it is) told me yesterday that she does feel a compulsion to steal, and that it's like a ""pressure"" building until she goes and does it. She then feels awfully guilty and the pressure goes away for a bit but then returns. Thank you for all the comments and advice, y'all kicked my ass into gear.

Edit4: First of all, thank you for the advice in general. I got a few really nice PM's that made me even more sure the majority of you telling me not to do it were right. A few angry PM's too saying I'm an awful friend. I'm definitely not trying to be and I want the best for her, but not for her to slide past on everything, especially because this is a definite pattern. Second, I fudged the details a little in the post to not be recognized, the actual store she took from was **Sephora**, not Lush. So many people commented their confusion I thought I should clear that up! God I hope this is finally a big enough wakeup call for her. There is no indication that she's mad at me yet though she didn't message me back after saying she didn't know writing the letter would make me uncomfortable. Thanks guys :)"

"My [22M] GF [21F] got involved w/ Amway (Pyramid scheme) and I refuse to go to a meeting with her.


Hey everyone,

So we've been dating for ~2.5 years now. About a year ago she got recruited into Amway by one of her extended family members, and she's taken a large liking to their system. For those who haven't had the pleasure of dealing w/ Amway and the likes; It's basically a restructured pyramid scheme, ""make money quick"" type deal. But it is rather massive, probably one of the larger companies out there for this type of crap.

Anyway, there's some sort of meeting in a week or two and my GF wanted to invite me to it. This isn't the first time she's talked about Amway w/ me. She's invited me before to a meeting or two but I've always refused. She's joked about me buying stuff from her like energy drinks and protein powder but she never pushed that. She's joked and made fun of me saying that I have money and I can spend it on myself while still helping her, but they were only side remarks which I didn't take seriously. She really only pushed me on coming to this meeting.

In the begining I reluctantly agreed saying that sure I'll go it's only 2 or 3 hours. But more recently I told her that I really didn't want to go and I don't think I will go w/ her. She took that as an offense saying I never supported her with Amway and she already told her ""upline"" that I was gonna go. I told her straight up that yes, i never supported you and I don't think I ever will. 

I told her before that Amway was a MLM scheme and they'll try to take money from her one way or another. I told her that her meetings will likely involve ""leadership seminars"" which are, you guessed it, pay to enter. She's told me that she isn't there to make money but she's learning a lot about leadership and how to manage her ""independent business"". She clearly hasn't read anything from a non-member/ex-member view. I even showed her legitimate articles and books from previous members showcasing their negative experience with the whole thing. 

Regardless of what I've told her, I even went as far as saying that fine, you can be part of it but please don't involve me with it. I don't want to push my own opinion of the company on you and I don't want you to push Amway on me. She took that even worse than the previous things I've said. 

Now I'm at the point of her not talking to me and blocking me on hangouts and she's not picking up my calls.

What the hell. Am I wrong in my views? Should I support her in this? There is no way that this company can be good for her in the long term. She has bought a case or two of their products to try and sell and they've given her a pack of business cards saying ""&lt;name&gt;, Independent Business Owner"" and her phone number. She's just starting out so I guess they haven't asked her for much money. 


Anyway, Has anyone dealt with family/friends involved w/ Amway? What did you end up doing?


**TL;DR** - My GF has become involved w/ Amway and it's affecting our relationship because I openly don't support her."

My girlfriend Tara and I have been dating for 6 months. I love her a lot and she is everything I could ever want in a significant other. However, she doesn't like the fact that I bake. I'm not talking about getting baked-- I love making cakes, pastries, cookies, and all sorts of desserts. 

Tara said she doesn't feel special when I'm baking. She thinks I bake because I love the activity rather than the reason being that I love her. So I guess she feels inferior to my love of baking, but I like to bake her things because I enjoy making her happy AND because it is one of my favorite hobbies.

She has been really distant lately. I'm afraid she will break up with me, but she's the only woman I've ever thought about marrying. What should I do? (btw, English is not my first language and I have a thick accent, so there may be some type of misunderstandings as well.)

Or maybe she just wants to watch her weight and cannot resist my baked goods.
