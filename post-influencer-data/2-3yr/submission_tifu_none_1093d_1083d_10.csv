"TIFU by freezing my whole banks money.


The WHOLE BANK!
A few years ago I was a teller. Every night we balance our drawer and bank our branches 'holdings' to a ledger. 

About three weeks before, we had rolled out a new operating/banking system. 
Going from an old 'green screen' to a Windows based one.

This one evening. I was the sole operator in our branch left to bank my funds to the ledger. 
I did that, locked up ,alarm on....and off I went home. 

The rest of the branches also did their banking nation wide.

The next morning I turn up to work to be told that there was a major system outage and no-one could collect their funds to start the days banking.

Every branch across Australia was unable to release the banking from the ledger.

We had to resort to our emergency operations. Manual transactions and cash withdrawals limited to a certain $$ amount per customer.

The word was the top dogs were screaming blue murder!!! IT couldn't figure it out. 

Then it was discovered.

A certain branch.... had deposited an amount to the ledger.... 

And it had a double decimal in it.

That is all it took to bring the bank to a stand still. 

An extra decimal point.

All they had to do was reverse the deposit and re-enter it. 

Let's just say I had a stern talking to. 

On the upside IT fixed up the formatting so you couldn't do a double decimal again!

EDIT. Not a major bank. Only our branches were affected.

"TIFU by exposing myself to my professor and my classmates


Never posted here before but I seriously fucked up this time. I walk around naked at home because its hot as hell and I live alone but my apartment is recommended by my university so a lot of schoolmates and teachers also live in the building. Well today I saw the biggest cockroach ever on the wall of my room. In my panic, I tried to shoo it out of my room by opening the door and sweeping it out with my shoe. As I did that, I realized my fuck-up as I saw my professor and some female classmates walking past my room. I realized my stupidity instantly and slammed the door shut. All they saw was me open the door naked and panicked, holding a shoe, and then instantly slamming the door shut. Yea, I'm an idiot.  
  
Worst part was the cockroach flew around my house and hid and now I can't find the fucker.  
  
Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. I wish reddit was bigger where I live right now so they could see some explanation and I don't look like such a pervert wierdo.  
  
Edit 2: I am a man and I live in the Philippines hence the flying cockroach / reddit not being popular / teachers and students living together."
"TIFU by telling my brother to pick a pimple &amp; sending him to the hospital [NSFW]


So, this didn't happen today, it all began on September 7. TL;DR at bottom.

As backstory, my younger brother just went away to his freshman year at college. He goes to school 6 hours away from home.

So - my brother texts me telling me he has a big pimple on the outside of his thigh. It hurts really bad, it's swollen and red, etc. I, being the disgusting person I am, request to see it, and tell him to pick it. So he sends me a picture - it's red and swollen, looks kind of like a bite, has a dark spot in the middle. The next day, Thursday, he FaceTimes me while he picks. It's really gross, he lances it with a needle and it's just bleeding and being generally disgusting. Later he said he took a long shower and squeezed stuff out. Ok, we're done here. Or so we thought...

The next day, Friday, he wakes up and it's huge. It's incredibly swollen, it's red, painful, he limps when he walks. He sends me a picture and I'm like wow - maybe you should go to the infirmary. He goes that afternoon, and the doctor immediately freaks out. Turns out, he had a boil. Boil got infected. He, by lancing and squeezing it, thrust the infection into his leg. Entire thigh is infected, as are his lymph nodes. He has cellulitis. Begins an antibiotic regimen (6 pills a day) and advil &amp; tylenol. She marks it up and tells him if it grows 2cm more, go to the ER. Okay, this sucks and I feel terrible because I told him to pick it, I told him to lance it! 

Saturday night he sends me a picture of it. It's huge, swollen, yellow pus - really fucked up. We determine he should go to the ER. Is immediately admitted. Begins getting IV antibiotics and painkillers. Testing for MRSA, monitoring him for septic shock. He's pretty fucked up.

Sunday he has bedside surgery to cut everything in his leg out. They tell him if it gets too bad, they'll move him to the OR and put him out. Ok, this sucks big time, holy shit. Only problem is that the local anesthetic reacts poorly with the pH of the pus, so it renders it basically ineffective. The surgeon cuts out a ton of dead flesh &amp; a pus pocket, which my brother said felt like 15 knives in his leg. Wow - I may be the worst sister in the world.

Anyway - surgery goes okay, he looks like he has a bullet wound in his leg. Test for MRSA comes back positive. They monitor him for another day and a half and he's finally released on Tuesday afternoon. He has to dress his wound every day and keep it clean (and it really is gross). He's on tons of pills still but he will live!

So, all in all, I'm the worst sister in the world and he will definitely never take advice from me ever again. I do have pictures if anyone is gross and wants to see (or is just really curious)!

EDIT 2: [more recent photos](https://imgur.com/a/lw4qq)

**TL;DR**: My brother had what looked like a big pimple. I told him to lance it and pick it. Turns out it was an infected boil. Entire thigh got infected, had to get admitted to the hospital and have surgery. Oops.

"TIFU by putting my dick to sleep


So you know that pins and needles feeling you get when your arm or leg falls asleep? I got that in my dick. I was sitting with my leg tucked underneath me for a while and my heel was pressed up right behind my balls. I didn't realize it was losing feeling until I stood up and the feeling started to come back. So the pins and needles started in my ballsack and moved up to my dick, and it *did not* feel good. Every little movement felt like I had stuck my dick into an electrical outlet. I was really worried for a second because I didn't know what it was but then I realized and just sat down for a few uncomfortable minutes waiting for it to stop."
"TIFU by suffering explosive diarrhea while my car drove itself into a fast food restaurant


Obligatory ""this didn't actually happen today.""  I don't remember when it was exactly, but it had to have been around 2001.

I'm posting this because I posted it as a comment on an earlier post, and a few people told me they thought my story was WAY worse than the original and deserved its own TIFU...  And yes, what follows is verbatim what I wrote over there.

I was in the fast food drive-thru (building on one side, curb and hedge row on the other - i.e. I can't pull out of line) when my stomach started its death moans... Apparently it was anticipating what was to come and trying to warn me off.

The car in front of me finally moves, I gun it past the window without picking up (or paying for) my food, and almost literally skid sideways into the handicapped spot (illegally) RIGHT outside the door closest to their bathroom. I'm struggling to keep it in at this point, but if I don't get out NOW I'm gonna fertilize the interior of my truck. I get out of the truck and am doing the best I can to sprint for the door while simultaneously clenching my ass muscles as tightly as humanly possible...

I made it to the door before the dam broke... There was a massive trail of liquid shit from the door all the way into the bathroom, and by the time I got my pants down and sat on the toilet I was empty. Not one drop ended up in the toilet. I did the best I could to clean myself and the bathroom up (let's face it, there's no ""cleaning up"" in a public restroom after an event like this) and make a bee-line for the door.

I opened the bathroom door and there stood a very unhappy store manager and a police officer. Behind them was my truck. Sitting inside the entry of the restaurant. In my desperation I forgot to put it in park before I got out and it drove itself through the doors just a few seconds behind me.

Not only did I get tickets for parking in the handicapped spot illegally, and for careless operation of a motor vehicle (for not putting it in park), but I also then had to explain to a judge (and my insurance company) that it all happened while I was shitting myself running through a restaurant, and not because I'm a careless idiot or drunk. The judge actually laughed at me and said ""I don't even care if it's made up, that's the best excuse I've ever heard!"" He dismissed the tickets, which saved me a few hundred dollars. My insurance company was not as amused...

**TL;DR** I shit my pants and all over the floor of a restaurant while my truck drove itself through the front doors.  I got tickets, the judge laughed at me before dismissing them, and my insurance company fought hard to avoid paying for the damages.

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit 2:** This is now my top post...  Glad I could make a few people smile, even though it was at the expense of my dignity.

**Edit 3:** You did it Reddit!  Thank you for completely ruining my internet anonymity!  Apparently this hit the front page some time in the early morning hours while I was sleeping.  I woke up to a text from a good friend who recognized the story, and its taken a considerable bribe to convince him not to tell EVERYONE I know.  In any case, thanks everyone for enjoying my most embarrassing moment, and thanks for the support.  I laugh about it now (and you all probably will too for a long time), but those were definitely the most mortifying moments of my life."
"TIFU By Putting The Wrong CD In The Player For The Prom Processional


So, in true /r/TIFU fashion, this didn't happen today but instead some years back. 

Join me now in a time of wonder during the long fabled year of 2004. I was working my way through college by being a mobile DJ on weekends and I had been assigned a "" Special Ed Prom"". 

As you can expect this was an end of the year dance for a special needs school that wanted the kids to have that iconic prom moment like all the other kids. 

Well, I started as I normally did making an introduction and explaining the events of the evening. The people who organized the dance wanted a powerful opening that the kids would recognize. 

As luck would have it, the Black Eyed Peas had been recently riding the wave of their classic ""Let's Get It Started"" and I figured that would be my best bet. I cued the CD up and began my intro.

This is where the fuck up went downs....

With most censorship, words get bleeped out. However, on rare occasions, the artist will change entire words. This was the latter.

Instead of playing my radio friendly version of ""Let's Get It Started"" I instead put in the OG album and played the songs uncensored version ""Let's Get Retarded""

I was utterly shocked and it all went to hell after that. I was able to recover and save the show but I am not surprised that I want offered the contract the next year.... Or the year after that....

TL;DR : Played the wrong version of a popular song that directly mocked my clients disability. 

Post Script: The local news station was covering the dance and my fuck up was caught on camera and broadcast.

Edit: Thanks for the gold anonymous stranger. You have busted my gilded cherry

Edit #2: I feel I should explain the ""local news station""  bit. They were covering the dance being held as a warm fuzzies puff piece and *supposedly* you can hear my fuck up but I never confirmed as I have not ever seen the video myself. I just know I saw the crew there. Furthermore, I doubt they would let the word ""retarded"" hit the air waves.

 I know it sounds it sounds fishy as fuck but I make no secret of the fact that I have no digital proof of this timely shenanigan. "
"TIFU by sending my gym partner to the ER


So last night, my gym partner and I decided to go on a late gym run to get SWOLE. I also recently met this beautiful girl on tinder &amp; we've been snapchatting each other as if it was our full time job! She's freaking gorgeous. 

So my gym partner and I decide to go full hulk and bench press as much as we can. On his final set of 275lb bench press, I get a snap from the Tinder girl and it's a video! As I opened up the snapchat, my gym partner asked if I'm all ready to spot him but without thinking, I said yes.. Now here is where I royally fuck up.

As he counts down to start benching, I open up the snapchat &amp; it's a video of the girl with NSFW content, suggesting that we should hit it up tonight. I was completely focused on the 10 second video until I heard a thud and a gag for help... My gym partner lost control of the bench which landed on his throat..I immediately dropped my phone and tried to help lift the bar. People around us saw what was happening and everyone rushed to help as well.. Unfortunately, my gym partner started to cough up blood &amp; it got pretty bad..

Reddit, I'm a fucking idiot.. I fucked up so bad that I don't know what to do with myself.. Currently at the hospital with his family and he's getting an emergency surgery. All I know right now is that he's been in surgery for the past 6 hours and counting.. 

TL;DR: Gym partner and I went ham on bench press. Forgot to spot my gym partner because I received a snapchat video from a girl that I met on Tinder..I also forgot to respond to the girl so looks like I'm done with her.. 


MAJOR UPDATE** The family &amp; I spoke with the doctors &amp; this is what happened. A piece of his larynx was damaged along with a minor fracture? Couldn’t really understand everything that the doctor said but my friend will survive &amp; insurance will cover the medical cost. I hope everyone can take away some valuable lesson from this incident. I’m deleting snapchat, never bringing a phone to the gym, and ALWAYS, respecting the bro code. I am genuinely sorry about what happened and I hope my friend will forgive me.  Ultimately, the surgery went really well.

Minor update* Just got home and did not expect this to blow up like this.. Like I said, yes I messed up. I know what I did wrong but the only I can do is pray for a speedy recovery. I'll be visiting him tonight after dinner and keep everyone posted. "
"TIFU by screaming ""Vagina!"" to a 10th grade English class.


So, I am 23 and a new English teacher. I look like a kid myself, and I'm barely 5'1"" so I always try my best to be professional. I want my students to take me seriously. I don't think they will after today.

I was reading an Emily Dickinson poem to my class of 10th graders, and I got to the line that says ""Shuts the door--to her divine majority,"" and I got tongue-tied in the worst way. Here's where my students lose all respect for me.

Very loudly I said, ""Shuts the door to her VAGINE-"" and cut to students falling out of their chairs howling with laughter at me. I just sat down. I gave up. I literally have no idea how I replaced ""divine"" with ""vagine.""  How?! It will haunt me forever.

Perhaps the worst part? I sent a kid to the principal two days ago for screaming ""Penis!"" while going over answers in class. On his way out today he high-fived me and said, ""Mad respect.""

EDIT: Aw, snap! Front page! So far, none of my students have called me out for posting this.

Also, some people are super upset that I sent Penis Kid to the principal. Trust me, I am a pretty chill person, but some kids (especially huge teenaged boys) like to test the limits of the teacher who looks like a seventeen-year-old girl. It was mostly a warning shot because he had been causing some major issues. He got a slap on the wrist and has been an angel to me since then. ;)"
"TIFU by shooting my friend in the head


Like the majority of tifu, this didn't happen today but actually a few years ago. It was the summer of 2012 and my best mate was round my house and my dad had gone out with my brother for the day. We thought it would be a fun idea to put some targets up in the field and shoot them with the air rifles from the scaffolding in my house. 

All was going great except that we hadn't put enough water in the milk cartons and they kept falling over every few hits. So every couple shots we had to put them back up, being extra careful to unload the guns before running in front. So after a couple times of putting them back up we started to get relaxed and instead of unloading the guns we began to point them away from the targets when one of us ran up.

 Now, the targets were about 30m away and the scaffolding was about head height, and the final time we went to put the targets up, we forgot to move the guns and had left one loaded. It was my mates turn to put the targets up and when he was almost there I panicked and noticed the guns and went to move them so my friend wasn't in the line of fire. As I slid the older gun across it fired, now this thing was a break-barrel rifle with a hunting trigger that would fire if you breathed too hard on it and being an air rifle, I didn't hear it as I was shouting to my mate. Suddenly he yelled, grabbed his head and took a knee. I ran over and asked what has happened and he said he'd been hit in the head by something, I started gently looking round the back of his head and found a small trickle of blood and followed it up to find a small hole on the lower left side of his neck. 

It was at this point I literally shit the bed.  I ran back to the house, grabbed the phone and called an ambulance, who also informed me that they'd have to send an armed response unit due to it being a firearms incident. I then called my dad who rushed home and arrived the same time as the ambulance who then called an air ambulance as they thought he may require a head scan in the hospital that's an hours drive away. 

The armed response unit then turned up,  some six feet odd blokes step out of the car and take me for a walk up the garden so that they can understand what happened. I was absolutely bricking it,  worried that my friend could die, I'd go to prison and that two lives had been ruined in one day.

Luckily my friend didn't need to go in the air ambulance and was then taken to hospital where they told him if the pellet was a couple inches to the right he'd have been paralysed from the neck down. Thankfully he's okay, I didn't go to prison and now we joke about it every so often, but since that day I haven't touched the gun again. 

TL;DR 15 year old me accidentally misfired gun, almost paralysed my friend and was escorted by armed police officers.

"TIFU by alerting my father that I bought a sex toy

"TIFU writing a poem for second grade English...


I grew up in a very religious house hold.  I went to a private church school in Iowa and to church every Wednesday and Sunday.  Not only was our school a christian school but it was also located in a church, go figure.  

My older brother had created a music group that played worship songs called SSW, secret society of wretchedness.  He drew a picture of a smiling clown on his guitar and I loved it.  I would always tell him to play guitar for me.  

A few days prior to this fuck up, I had heard that another name for a church was a steeple.  With that in mind, we began learning rhyming schemes in English class.  The teacher asked us to write a poem from 4 different schemes and to draw pictures for each line.  

I wanted to write a poem about the clown some how.  So I put down my first line, then drew a picture of a clown.  The second line was the same picture, only him frowning.  The next line was a car, then a church, then the clown behind bars with tears coming down his face.  So the poem was this:

There once was a plumb mad clown
Who wore on his face a frown
He went to a steeple
Killed lots of people
Until the cops came and beat him down.

Not only do I remember the look on the teachers face, how hard she was gripping my hand as she dragged me to the principals office, the look on the principals face as he mashed the phone's key pad to call both my parents from work, but I remember other people I didn't know showing up to talk to my parents.  They were convinced I was the devil and, this is true, prayed for me before we left school.

It was only a few weeks ago that my mother told me that the other people who showed up were CPS investigators which makes sense because they showed up at our house the next day and asked me all these dumb questions like if anyone was hurting me or what I thought of my parents.  

I still remember the car ride home. I asked if I was in trouble and my dad laughed and said no.  I said, ""What did I do?""

""You wrote a good poem.""  "
"TIFU by thinking that my car wouldn't start when it was actually in Drive instead of Park.


Actually happened today. My car wouldn't crank, so I walked 4.5 miles home to get another car. I drove to my 'dead' car to get some stuff out of it and see if maybe I could get it to start again. Still nothing. 

As I was about to get out of the 'dead' car, I noticed that the gear shifter was on 'D' and not 'P' (short for Drive and Park)  I shifted to 'P,' and she started right up!

Next, I drove car #2 home and walked back another 4.5 miles to get the car that I originally  thought was busted. 

I got a good walk in, though. "
"TIFU and had to call the paramedics for my naked boyfriend


Actually, it was the other day - but, I had to wait until the weekend to share my story with all of you.
So, here it is again... Have you ever wanted to try something you saw on a porn? Well, I did. My BF and I are physically fit, and it didn't seem like that big of a deal.  Here's what happened...   
I've always thought it looked sexy for a guy to pick up a girl and hold her during sex. So, I wanted to try it too. After going strong for about 15 minutes, I asked my BF to pick me up, which he did.
But, I guess I didn't take a few things into account: 

1) how easily things pop out in that position (never happens in the movies);   

2) how worn out my BF already was;   

3) how far the nearest available wall space was from my bed;   

4) how slippery a sweaty body can actually be (even with fans).  

Because, as soon as he picked me up, I started slipping down his body. So, I tried to crawl back up his body, by gripping tighter around his neck and waist. He tried to waddle over to the wall for extra support, but I guess I had a death grip on him. After maybe two minutes of struggling, he started swaying side to side. Then, his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out, with me still on top of him. I didn't know a full-body ""bear hug"" could do that.

He's fine now, but imagine trying to explain that one to the paramedics. If there's a next time, I think we'll just start against the wall. - Yeah, TIFU.   
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
TL;DR. caused my BF to pass out during sex, had to call ambulance

EDIT: Sorry about the formatting. It sucks.
