That is all."
"I DID IT


I got into medical school!

Somehow I managed to get into medical school. I've been working so hard for this for so long and figuratively and literally shat on by so many people, so to be quite fucking honest, I deserve this.

Plans may change but I'm looking to go into either family medicine or psychiatry, with an emphasis on LGBT health issues. "

"Anybody else in the U.S. scared?


As I watch the election I can only think about the shit that Trump and Pense have said about LGBT* rights as well as minority rights in general, the shit Trump supports have pulled and said, and the general mindset against LGBT* individuals, the fact that the next president will choose two supreme court justices, the fact that Pense has been against every pro-LGBT* bill ever and that they're both against marriage equality...Is anyone else scared about what else is going to happen if Trump wins the election? This may not make exact sense...but it's becoming just an alcohol fueled brain puke..."
"The attack on marriage equality has begun. Thanks bros who don't vote.


See here: http://www.towleroad.com/2016/11/trump-nom/

TLDR NOM (National Organization for Marriage, a hate group) already has legislation ready and waiting for when Trump takes office. They laid out a bulleted list of goals that have a very good chance of passing. 

EDIT: Holy shit the trump supporters are in full force in this thread. Too many of you think this is ""impossible to overturn"" so let me explain: 

First, on [page 11](https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL[1]-ben_1468872234.pdf) of the GOP official party platform, it states the plan to repeal marriage equality. Appoint conservative supreme court justices to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges (the marriage equality ruling). This has already begun by the blocking of Obamas Supreme Court nominee. This is also a plan Trump *three times* said he supported. And lets not forget, Mike Pence will be the bug in Trumps ear and he did things like sending letters to businesses telling them not to hire gay people, trying to pass a bill making it a criminal offense punishable by jail time to apply for a marriage license if you're gay, as well as a legalized discrimination bill which cost his state $60 million when businesses started to pull out.

Second, You're about to lose protections starting at the very beginning of Trumps presidency. The (First Amendment Defense Act)[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2802], pushed by NOM and it's cronies (an act with a TON of republican support) is going to be passed. Trump promised in September he'd pass it. TLDR of  the bill, anyone can discriminate against you for being gay (not divorced, just gay), and if they get backlash for it they can sue. 

Third, If you're a federal employee or contractor, you're losing the executive order Obama issued that provided protection from you getting fired. 

But no, let the trump supporters that invaded this thread fool you into thinking this can't get overturned. "

"American Bros: Vote in 2018.


We can stonewall (hehe) any of Trump's/Pence's inevitable anti-LGBT agenda if we fill Congress with Democrats and other liberals in the 2018 elections. Now is not the time to just be a voter in the presidential elections!!!  
  
It will be very difficult for the Trump administration to overturn gay marriage and enact other anti-LGBT laws in as little as two years even with a Republican congress.  
  
But in four years? Six years? Eight years?  
  
Get ready for 2018, bros. This election will be a wakeup call for liberals. We have a chance to make history. We are now the actors of the change we desire. Vote, vote, vote.  
  
Don't let his being in Thiel's pockets nor pics of him holding the gay flag keep you from the truth. Remember that, during his victory speech, he lied to us as he stated that he was a president for ""all Americans."" Look to the left of him. What do you see? Mike Pence. The people he's surrounding himself with do not reflect the promises he's made. "
"I'm not scared of trump becoming the president compared to the what lies below.


Just terrified of the unrecognized deeper rage in the white, rural America. 

it wasn't just the radicalism of the GOP, but deep hatred in a large segment of the population, masked and muted by political correctness. It is exactly what brought us here to this presidency. Wake up people, this is a poison, a cancer, that runs thicker than our blood. Were the democrats 'supposed to win'? This is a lesson to be learned, we can't just be ignorant to the fact that there are vast majority of people with hatred, misunderstandings towards minorities, the lower class clutching to their babies, barely making a living while politicians playing their games. It's ridiculous. It might be worse that we have a president that's probably going to fuck up a lot, but is that not a change? Is that not a sign of fresh blood instead of this corrupted system of democracy now?
