"I am currently working on a YouTube channel that will show anyone, regardless of experience, how to 3d model, 3d animate, make music, and take professional looking photos and videos! AMA!


UPDATE NUMBER 2: OUR FIRST TUTORIAL!
https://youtu.be/w911CON6Z_Y

Just a little background, my roommate and I have been very interested in everything art related since we were very young. Combined, we have over 30 years of creative experience, and we finally have decided to put together a YouTube channel not only showcasing our work, but teaching everyone in the world how to create Hollywood style products on a regular persons budget. 

We launched the channel 2 days ago and have already received a tremendous amount of support from people, mostly consisting of folks from the reddit community. We thank you so much for this, and we look forward to helping you all create amazing things along with us very very soon. 

If you would like to check out our channel, here is a link to our little ""trailer"" we put together yesterday.

If you have any suggestions for what you would like to see us do, or what you would like to learn how to do, please leave a comment below! We are here to help all of you, and bring you along on our endless journey to learning more about everything music/videogame/cinema related.

I really look forward to getting to know each and every one of you. 
Thanks, and have a wonderful day!

UPDATE #3: WOW, you guys are incredible. I posted that tutorial at 1am, I woke up at 7:30 for work and you have already watched it over 100 times, and we reached over 100 subscribers in less than 3 days. That's amazing to me. I love how supportive you all are, and I really hope the video helped you make something cool. I'm so grateful, really. Keep asking questions! This is fun! :)

"I just shit my pants at work


So to put things as simply as possible I was working in my cubicle and I had to fart. My stomach hasn't been upset and I was expecting just a small, silent, squeaker. Instead it's just shit. Wet, rancid, warm shit.... What do I do? Like honestly I have no idea. Thankfully the cubicle next to me is empty.

Update: I made it to the bathroom. It's stained through the rear of my kakhies though. So I'm butt ass naked in my workplace bathroom."
