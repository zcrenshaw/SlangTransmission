"WELCOME TO SUMMER REDDIT: NOW GO OUTSIDE


Sup shitlords,

Most of you just got let out of middle school and now you get to spend all your free time posting stupid shit all day because you have no friends and have nothing better to do in between your chores and skipping the summer camp that your mom and dad are sending you to because they can't deal with you either.

But before you decide to go and be stupid on the internet, us friendly moderators would like to remind you of our rules, which you can find on our sidebar, and also to check our [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index) before you submit a post.  

I know, I know, you're having problems with thinking about talking to a girl or something like that and you think your situation is special but let me, your friendly neighborhood koala, give you a little piece of advice that you can also get by searching the FAQs: You're not special, your situation is not special, and your question about the girl or the sex or the talking has been asked before.

As always, if you suspect that our tyrannical nazi mod policies gestapo'd your post into the gulag, please message the mods and if you provide enough tribute, we might acquiesce to your request.

"Guys, what's a creepy thing women do that we might be unaware of?


It could be stalkerish, creepy, clingy, etc. and we have no clue it's being seen that way. "
"How to respond to guy saying he's not attracted to me?


...In the middle of sex? I've slept with a friend a few times, and last night, he couldn't keep his erection. He ended up telling me that he didn't find me attractive. I wanted to act like it was cool, but I'm in kind of a bad mental state right now. It really hurt me and I ended up sobbing... like, thanks for being honest, but could you let me down a bit gentler? I didn't have any romantic feelings for him, but just hearing that humiliated me.

If you were in this situation, how would you (as the guy) have handled it, and how would you have wanted the girl to respond? Did I overreact?

Edit: To clarify, I'm not upset because he isn't attracted to me, but by the fact that he told me after multiple times of hooking up, in the middle of sex. "

"S/O says I have a problem because I want sex more than once a week. What do you guys think?


So we are both 23 and I think our sexual compatibility has gone sour. Apparently I have a problem for wanting sex more than once a week and feeling sexual more often than not. I don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill so I need some advice guys. Thanks."

"How can I get my girlfriends ring size if she doesn't own any rings (yet)?


Hi,

I've googled a lot and looked for similar posts on reddit, but I couldn't really find a good way to get my girlfriends ring size without her knowing. Most people keep suggesting something along the lines of: ""Steal one of her rings and have it measured at a jeweler"". Unfortunately, she doesn't own a single ring, so I can't really use this method. I got one of these ring size measuring tools (no idea if I'm allowed to post a link to it here due to advertisement rules) which is basically all different sizes of rings on a chain.

So, I've been trying to think of a way to use that to discreetly get her ring size, but I just can't think of a good way to do it. I'm sure she will wake up if I try to measure her ring finger in her sleep... so that's not an option. We're visiting my mom this weekend and she would be on board with helping me find out (of course).

So, men of reddit. Got any ideas how I can get her ring size under these circumstances without her realizing? Thanks in advance :)"
"What were your moments of ""Wow I'm single and lonely"" right now?


Today, a pretty girl in a dress walked up to me to ask for directions. After answering her, on the bus ride home I fantasized about all the smooth things I could have said instead or how I would have gotten her number. Then realized, ""wow I'm single and lonely."""

"Men who hit the gym before work, how do you get through the day without falling asleep?


So I work from 8:30 to about 5 pm. By the time I get to the gym, it's been half an hour or so and it's so fucking packed that it takes me like an extra hour or hour and a half to finish. So yesterday, I tried going before work. I woke up at 4:30, got to the gym when it opened at 5, and worked out from 5 to 7. Made it home by 7:30, showered and changed and got to work by 8:30. But after 1 or so, I was dead tired. My brain wasn't working, and I was falling asleep at my desk. I got some coffee and it helped, but I was in and out of consciousness again by 3. I somehow made it to 5 without getting fired, went home and slept, waking up at 9 pm. 

How can I continue to go to the gym before work but not fall asleep during the daytime? A good friend of mine finished up his last year of college by hitting the gym at 5 am before his classes at 8 am. Is it possible? 

EDIT: Lots of great advice here, will follow through on the tips provided! As many of you have asked, let me clarify a few things. I spend 2 hours at the gym since I do about 45 minutes of cardio and 1 hr to 1 hr 15 mins in lifting (I could reduce rest time between sets). I sleep around 11 pm to 12 am on a given work night. My gym is like 4 miles from my place, and my work is another ~5 miles in the opposite direction. It's just that morning/evening traffic is horrendous where I live so it ends up taking around 20-30 mins to travel between places. My diet is not the greatest, I usually eat a lot of sweets and have coffee so I get a good dose of sugar, but I otherwise eat well. I drink about 64 oz of water a day, not including drinking water with meals."

"What's the worst red flag you found at the end of the honeymoon phase?


As Wanda said to Bojack, ""I guess when you're wearing rose-coloured glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."" 

I'm just coming out of my honeymoon phase in my first serious relationship, which has lasted a year. Turns out I missed a lot about our communication styles, her stubborn deflection of blame, and the fact that my interests never received any attention. It's a big wake-up call and while I still want to try to make it work I'm pretty sure we're gonna break up. I can't blame her for not having the tools to maintain a relationship at seventeen and having never done it before, but it still really hurts to realize that if I'd been a bit more realistic we probably wouldn't have lasted two months.

I feel like a complete idiot, so what're some big things you've missed? Make me feel less alone and all that xD

EDIT: Feel like a bit less of an idiot now, thanks for the stories guys. And for taking me to the front page! I love you all &lt;3"
