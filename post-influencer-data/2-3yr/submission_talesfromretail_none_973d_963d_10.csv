"A conversation about Pikachu


Hey All, recently discovered this sub and wanted to share a story. I'm on mobile so obligatory warning about formatting ect. 

Its true there's a lot of bad stories in retail, but I wanted to share one story that even today, about six years later still warms my heart. 

At the time I worked in the electronics section of a big box toy store. It was late summer and very slow, so I used my free time to talk with my guests.

A couple and their son walk into my department and I greet them. The kid is wearing a Pokemon shirt. I'll be me (M) lady (L) and Kid (K) 

I exchange usual greetings and the father goes and looks at the games in cases while the mother and son are looking at Nintendo DS accessories. 

M - hey there I like your shirt! 
K - silence but looking at me
M- (thinking he must be shy, but noticing he's paying attention I continue) who's your favorite Pokemon? 
K- (looks like he's really thinking, and fidgeting, he points to his shirt happy) Pikachu! I love pikachu! And he giggles and runs to his dad. 

Now I notice a shocked look on his mothers face and thought oh no, should I not talk about Pokemon? (He was wearing a shirt so I thought it would be okay) 

L- (leans close to me and I notice she's in tears) my son is severely autistic and he barely talks to us, but for him to talk to a stranger is a miracle. Thank you. 

It's the most stand out moment in my retail history thus far, and to think if I had just gone about a usual ""script"" of hi there how are you. That'll be $X.00 please. Thank you"" it would never happen. It pays to talk to people sometimes.

"'But that's only $5...'


This happened last night. We had a nightmare customer who'd been asking for some super unreasonable things *just for her princess daughter*, such as rotating our wall mounted TV's to be better seen by her little one and changing all the channels on all of the TVs to the kids network so her daughter could watch. The water in the bathroom 'scalded her daughters hands' (it was room temperature) but the water fountain water was 'too cold and made her cry' (it was also room temperature). In short, there was an issue with everything. 

Now, we have an arcade attached where it's pretty normal for parents to send their kids off to while they do their thing, and it's standard gold coin operated stuff (am Australian, so gold coins are $1/$2 coins). The mother of the demon spawn comes up to my terminal and asks for change for $5. Fine. Gets the daughter off to the video games which is better for everyone. 

'Could I please have two $2 coins and two $1 coins.'

'Sorry ma'am, you've only given me a $5 note? Did you mean two 2s and one 1?'

'Well, no, actually. Since it's for my precious daughter and I'm actually doing you a favour by converting your change to a note, I was hoping you'd be able to give me $6in change for this $5 note.'

Speechless. Utterly speechless. "
