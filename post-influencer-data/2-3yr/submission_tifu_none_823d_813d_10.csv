"TIFU by dumping a whole pitcher of water over my customers head.


At the restaurant I used to work at there was an extra upstairs room for special parties and the like. It had a spiral staircase and a large round table sat directly below the staircase. One day a big party came in and wanted to sit upstairs. Everything went great, although it was annoying taking large trays of food up a spiral staircase. Once the party left upstairs i began to clean up the room. I was taking dirty dishes down in tubs and glasses in racks. Finally, there were just a few full pitchers of water. My tray was wet and I knew the pitchers might slide around on it but I put them all on there anyway so I didn't have to keep coming back up and down. I was at the top of the staircase and the pitchers started to slide around. One slides straight off of the tray and dumps its entire contents of icy cold water on an elderly woman's head at the table below the staircase. I think the pitcher even bonked her on the head for good measure. She said my look of horror alone was apology enough.  All of my coworkers were ruthless about it, saying things like I tried to make a waterfall installation and what not. TL;DR- I accidentally soaked an old lady with an entire pitcher of cold water at work. "

"TIFU when I almost died while paddle boarding with my dog.


Finally happy to be reporting on a Tifu that happened to me just yesterday at my cabin in North Georgia. 

My family and I enjoy spending most of our weekends in the summer up at Seed Lake. One such activity we love doing is paddle boarding which, for those who don’t know, is where you paddle around...on a surfboard big enough to not tip over. The name is self-explanatory.

So on Sunday, I went out on the paddle board with my 90-pound Yellow Labrador named Dyson. I know he’s not ideal for this sort of activity, given the issue of balance and all, but he’s extremely chill about most activities. Here's him hanging out on a tube: https://i.imgur.com/pcTwFKj.jpg So he’s definitely not a nuisance on a big, sturdy paddle board...for the most part. 

In the beginning we were actually fine, with me paddling about fifteen feet from the shore and him sitting and watching minnows/wildlife. It was peaceful, serene, and relaxing. The water’s a nice, deep green and clear enough to see a couple feet down, so we were feeling good up until the point a snake slithered out from the bank.

If you’ve ever seen a snake swim, it instantly ups their “oh fuck no” factor by a couple hundred points. And this is from someone who loves danger noodles in general. But a venomous one slithering through the water, heading straight for us is entirely another matter. 

I went stone-still, hoping it would just go past us as though we didn’t exist, and it actually seemed about to do just that. Unfortunately my goddamn, 90-pound, spineless sack of crap of a dog had other plans, as he took one look at the snake, then at me, and leapt off the paddle board in the opposite direction. (Yes, I know he did the smart thing, but still: Fuck him)

I, being a tall, uncoordinated motherfucker, struggled to keep my balance as my dog jumped off, but he tipped the paddle board too far. So I ended up pinwheeling off the paddleboard and landing RIGHT ON THE MOTHERFUCKING SNAKE.

I went under for a second or two, certain it would sink it’s fangs into me at any point, before surfacing again. (In reality, it wriggled against me for like a second, and then swam away.) Immediately I swam for the paddle board, cursing madly. The snake was nowhere to be seen, probably noping the hell out of there, heading back for its muddy hidey-hole. 

I could still feel that initial moment of shock when I hit the water, certain I was dead, but adrenaline probably made it way worse than it was. From there, I high tailed it back to the boat house, where Dingus the Dog sat on the dock, panting innocently and waiting for me. He knew what he did, betraying me like that, but I can never prove it to anyone. Not my family or friends or even you guys, but he did it on purpose. Totally and unequivocally. 

And to top everything off, just as I came up to the dock, my dog stood up and tried to hop on the paddle board again, but this time I tilted it so he fell in the water. Revenge is a bitch, you big, yellow baby, and I will never forget this. 

TL;DR I went paddle boarding with my goofy lab, a snake slithered out from the bank, my dog betrayed me and jumped off the board, I fell on top of the snake, and almost died.

*EDIT: As many of you pointed out, yes, the snake probably wasn't venomous given I was in Northern GA. And another good point you made was that snakes probably can't strike from the water. Both of these are valid points, but try to see where I'm coming from: Wobbly paddleboard. Giant, marshmallow-brained dog. Danger noodle swimming right for me. Lanky-ass me struggling not to tip in. It doesn't matter if it was just a harmless water snake, I still got the hell out!"
"TIFU By telling my son ""Do as I say, not as I do""


So I wrote and posted this here yesterday without proof reading and it was terribly written. I attempted to edit it multiple times to make it more coherent but I decided to try one more time with a slightly better written shortened version. Forgive me if you already read this.

So the obligatory this was not today, it happened Friday.

I'll start by saying I have little experience working on cars but knew the brakes that were previously squeaking and are now grinding was not good.

Knowing this would damage the car over time and not wanting it to get worse I decided to take my 16 year old son, buy some brake pads and learn how to change them together.

I'm in IT, and like anyone in the tech industry, I am an expert at Google/YouTube. So we bought the pads and got some advice from our auto parts store, then headed home and pull up 3 videos on how to change brake pads.

We were both very confident we could do this and headed outside to my driveway, my not perfect flat slightly inclined driveway. Knowing this was dangerous and not wanting to drive 30 minutes to my dad's house where I would have access to all the proper equipment, I decide to pull the car sideways in my driveway. I tell my son don't ever do this, you should always use jack stands and make sure the car is secure before working on it. The jack we are using from the car is for changing a tire on the side of the road in the event of an emergency not for use while working on your car. Then arrogantly proceeded to do exactly the opposite because ""I'll just be careful""

So while tightening the last bolt on the brake caliper the car slowly moves and the jack falls over  and the rotor falls on my forearm, I watch as my arm opens up like the Grand Canyon vertically from what I thought was wrist to elbow at the time and I'm instantly terrified. I look over at my son and my fear vanished as I felt tremendous guilt, the look on his face was as if he just watched me die as he screamed ""OMG DAD!"" I somehow pushed the car with my left arm and pulled my injured right arm free and immediately wrapped it in my shirt and said ""it's bad but I'll be fine son, get me a towel fast and tell your mom"" he runs in and I walk in the house and begin directing traffic...

The first towel, a full size bath towel was saturated in blood quickly and I began applying really firm pressure on my upper forearm where I thought would be the most likely area to have a severed vein. I have my son wrap the second towel around my arm and pull hard, had my wife call my dad because my only vehicle is not driveable. He is coming but 20-30 min away and I now feel my shirt getting soaked in blood where I have my wrist pressed against my body. (Turns out the injury was lower and I had most of the pressure in the wrong place). I eventually had my son wrap a belt tight on my bicep, but concerned about blood loss I decide not to wait for my dad and call 911.

With the makeshift tourniquet held tight by my son, I sit back and try to control my breathing until the paramedics arrive. About 5 minutes later (15-20 minutes since the initial injury) the paramedics arrive and said, ""we are going to have to get a look at this so we can see what we are dealing with, you can look away"". I watch as they unravel the towels  and I see the wound, its bad but not as long as I thought, it was mostly just above my wrist and about 8-10 inches long. The paramedic immediately says, ""Great job stopping the bleeding man, but this will need repaired from the inside out with surgery."" 

Once I'm in the hospital and the doctor opens my bandage from the paramedics, she looks at me and says I have no idea how but I don't see any structural damage and think we can just clean this and sew it up. And she was right, after a couple hours of cleaning it and xrays etc, I got 14 stitches and went home. I felt like a bit of a drama queen at that point but there was no way for me to know the extent of the injury.

I am positive my son will never make the mistake I made and work on a car in unsafe conditions, so that's good.

[My Father's Day gift ](https://imgur.com/gallery/jsZqs)

TL;DR tried to change break pads with a roadside bottle jack as the only thing lifting my car while on a slanted driveway, almost lost my arm when it fell and nearly crushed/amputated just above the wrist. 

Edit: I added a link to my Father's Day gift instead of linking it to my replies. I truly appreciate the well wishes and advice."
"TIFU by thinking my elderly neighbour was dead.


This was a couple of years ago. I lived next to an old woman - a pretty intimidating West Indian lady, who after just a week of me living there, shouted at me about some vines that were growing on our shared garden wall. I tried smiling a couple of times when I saw her outside but she just glowered at me, so I just kept my head down after that.

Anyway... after being there a few months I started hearing a dripping. Like she hadn't turned off one of her taps, and this noise was still there the next day and the day after. I started to get a bit worried about her so I knocked on the door... no answer. Looked through the letter box and through the windows - couldn't see any sign of her so I decided to ring the police. If she'd had a fall and needed help, and I hadn't done anything then I'd feel awful so...
I explained to the police that I don't know the woman, and she could be on holiday for all I know but she was pretty old and there's been a tap dripping for days and no one is answering the door. 

I'm not sure what response I was expecting but they sent two police cars, an ambulance and a fire engine. Which is enough to completely shut down a narrow English terraced street. They kicked her front door down, in front of everyone who lived on the street who had all come out to see what was happening, then broke into a bedroom door that was also locked and... it turns out that she was on her holidays.

They actually left a note on the door saying the next door neighbour had called the police. Grassed me right up!
She gets back from her holiday, her front door is a mess, and comes straight round to my place, going absolutely fucking dingy. I explained why I called the police and she said ""What's it to you if I'm dead? What the police going to about that? I don't need no help if I'm dead.""

EDIT: For those asking, I would call the police again in the same scenario. Also... I've since moved home so it'll be a whole new door for them to kick down! 

EDIT 2 - Clarifications:

The dripping: It was coming from a boiler - not sure how that translates outside of England but it's the unit that powers the central heating system (not an AC unit but rather a hot water system that warms the radiators and hot water that comes out of the taps). I didn't actually see it but the police told me it was that rather than a tap making the noise. There was already a bucket or something underneath and I think it was the drops hitting the build up of water in there that I could hear.

The house: It was a terraced house rather than flats/apartments so I'm not sure she even had a landlord for me to call - she could have owned the house. Her kitchen led out onto the garden and the boiler was in the kitchen. I could only hear the noise from my garden and once, I knew to listen for it, also from my bedroom with the window open (it overlooked the gardens). I couldn't hear it from anywhere else inside the house.

TL;DR Heard a dripping for several days, thought my elderly neighbour was hurt or dead, called the police and they kicked her door down. She was on holiday.

"TIFU by not using a guitar pick.


This happened about 7 months ago. I was playing my guitar at an acoustic gig at the local cafe. So while a lot of people use guitar picks, I prefer to use my hands because I like the feel of it and I feel more comfortable with it. I had been growing my nails for a while so it was fine with me. 

While I was performing a song with a fast strumming pattern (Wake me up - Avicii), my lower E string got stuck in my nail making a weird noise and I felt a sharp pain in my index finger. I instantly  stopped playing and bent down grabbing my hand. When I looked at my hand I saw that the nail on my index finger was torn like paper and was pulled halfway back. I let out a scream and one of the ""cue guys"" came to my aid. I could hear people whispering stuff like ""Oh my god that looks horrible"" and stuff.

It hurt like a bitch and I went offstage for about twenty minutes. The pain was coming and going as the nail was moving. I asked them to put a rough dressing over it, some cotton and betadine. I asked for a pick and finished the song, horribly so.

My mates took me to the ER and the doctor numbed my finger and pulled the nail straight out, felt a little pain still. Had a bulb shaped dressing on my finger for about 5 weeks. 

[TL;DR] Didn't use a pick to play the guitar, nail got stuck in a string and got shredded, had a bulb shaped dressing on my finger for a month.

EDIT: For everyone asking for evidence, I managed to dig this up from my old phone, it's shaky/blurry because it was taken while I was in the ER lobby thingy going to get looked at. http://imgur.com/a/W4hx2
I can't believe I just spent the last twenty minutes trying to find a picture to post on the internet to convince strangers that my story is real.

"TIFU by being buried alive


This happened close to an hour ago.

First time traveling to Japan, and have been here for three weeks. I am staying in a lovely Ryokan for the first time. Very nice place. A five minute walk from this Ryokan there is a a very famous Beppu onsen called Takegawara, which is both a natural spring bath AND a sand bath. I travel there in hopes of enjoying said sand bath.

 What's a sand bath you, ask?

Well, apparently I didn't really read up on it to well.

I get to it and it's this super beautiful onsen with very lovely hosts, and I see a pit of sand directly after the women's showers. I put on the provided robe, cover up and think I'm gonna go play in warm sand and maybe bury my feet. I was the only one there; score! 

Then I see two women with shovels.

They begin digging about a six inch, body-long grave just the right fit for little ole me. Okay, no biggie? I get to sit in a hole, cool.

I sit and it's great, very warm... And then they ask my to lay down. Lol, alright ladies calm down now...

I hear a very familiar sound of the scraping of sand on the shovel as they begin to dig and cover me with dozens of scopes of wet, heavy, burning sand. OKAY, this is different than what I thought!

My feet first, okay it's heavy and hot but it's just my feet so I can do this. 

My legs up to my groin. Getting significantly hotter. I'm having a hard time adjusting.

Up to right below my now heaving-with-panic bosom. My body feels like I'm being crushed my the centrifugal force in those theme park spinning machines. 

My arms. I can't move. Panic is definitely happening. Am I sweating because the sand is cooking my body, or because I'm nervous? Hahaha...

That has to be it right? 

They cover my chest, my neck and around my head. 

I am completely entombed.

This took these women all of ten seconds, and they place their shovels down to Look at me and smile. In a broken, accent heavy attempt at English one says ""15 minute start now, okay?""

Nope. I have never noped this hard in my life. My sweat pores screamed and together in unison they all went 'Nope'. I'm pretty sure if I could have moved my hands would have signed 'Nope'. So what did I do next?

I laid there. Terrified. Imprisoned. Smiling at these wonderfully kind Asian women who just want to make me comfortable. That kind of smile you give someone after you blow ass in the bathroom and they hear, and now you have to wash your hands next to them. That smile. 

I tried to distract myself, I really did. Without being able to move my head much the ceiling and the foot high pile of sand around my face and boobs didn't seem very interesting. I'm sweating, hard. I wiggled my hands for clearance but all that managed to do was make a cave of heat and moisture for my hands to soak in.

Time moved at a sludge-like pace. I can feel my heartbeat in my ears, and it's getting louder and faster... I begin to have a panic attack.

For those of you who have experienced these in your life you understand the moment as follows, for the rest I hope you never have to. 

My body would have left that building had a half ton of sand not been weighing me down. I writhed, kicked, and probably mastered a form of taijutsu with my attempt to escape my sandy sarcophagus. The women both scramble to me, one holds my shoulders and the other rubs my back . I have no idea what they are saying. My vision starts to go out. 

I have no recollection of how I ended up from my grainy prison to under a freezing shower, but there I was with a puke bucket between my legs with two Asian women looking at me with pity and concern. I didn't actually get sick, but apparently they've seen this same scene before.

I get washed up and free of sand. They give me a bottle of water, new customers walk in and we part ways. Now I'm in my hotel room and I'm pretty sure I'm on some 'do not serve' list now 

Tl;dr: Found out you can get buried alive in Beppu, Japan. I didn't do well with it."
"TIFU, by hitting my eye with air.


*This happened last Wednesday, 6/14/17

**My Current Eye Situation**

My left eye is a lazy eye and is much worse than my right. I have to have fairly powerful contacts, therefore I had rely on my right eye a lot. My vision is fine when both contacts are in. 



**The *screw* Up**

Ahh, It's early Wednesday morning, and my young 14 year old self has planned on making some extra cash thanks to a Summer job. I was going to be doing metal roofing on a fairly steep house with my grandfather. I'm accustomed to this job and it's not something I'm scared of, however I understand the dangers and take all precautions when working. With such a dangerous job, you would think I FU would be *on* the roof, right? Wrong. After hours of sweat and hard work, the job was over. Time to pack up! I start with picking up the old shingles that we scraped off to replace with shiny metal panels, then cleaned up whatever else trash was thrown around. Then, it was time to pack up the air compressor. I began to unhook the air hose from the compressor. I have done this many times, so I thought nothing of it. I began to pull the mechanism used to release it, however it was harder than usual (Most likely because it was under more pressure than I assumed). *Here is where all my bad Decisions come in and turn into a FU*. I pull, and pull, but for some reason it won't come off. So I decide to put my foot on it and push, as well as use both hands and pull the hose, therefore I had no way of stopping the hose once it came off and flailed everywhere. However, I wasn't really concerned about it, because what could a little air under pressure do?  ^POP. Yay! It came off. I god. It just hit my right eye. 

The hose didn't hit my eye, but the air did. It hurt, but it wasn't to bad. Kinda like when you get punched under the eye; it hurts, but it's not unbearable. However, when I opened my eye, there was a thick film or blur over my right eye. Remember, my left eye ain't worth shit without my right eye, so I was nearly blind. I tried to read my phone, but couldn't even see the huge ass clock on my home screen. I was panicking. My grandfather assured me it would be fine, and to just put some ice on it. I nodded, and held back my tears. we finished packing up, and got in the truck. I could tell the film had become much larger and thicker now. I asked my grandfather to look at my eye. When he decided to go to the eye doctor, I knew it must have looked bad, because he is know for not going to the doctor, like, ever. *He has even cut out a in-grown toenail with a pocket knife...* We get there, and the doctor tells me that I have blood under my [iris](http://www.okcoptometrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dv246007.jpg) (the colored part of your eye). He said *any* activity could result in the eye to bleed worse, and therefore potentially cause a blood clot *in my eye* and cause me to go blind. Then, I would be left with my crappy left eye, that's basically useless by itself. 

The doctor even told me stress and being anxious is risky, as if I can be anything other than stressed out after he tells me I might go blind at **14 years old.** He tells me to do absolutely nothing for 3 days, and only open my eyes for two eye drops he prescribed me. And I did just that. For 72 hours straight, I laid motionless in my bed with a rag over my eyes. This gave my mind time to run wild and drive me absolutely insane while I thought about how horrible my life is going to be if I don't get lucky. I can't express how horrible these few days where, but I can say that I would have rather voluntarily broke my arm. Anyway, fast forward to my next doctor's appointment, and he said that I was very lucky and might be able to lay with my eyes open a few days. However, I can't do any eye tracking, so no TV, Games, or Books. 

What the heck is the point then? I wasn't even supposed to look left and right. Whatever, a few more days of nothingness, I guess. So once that's over, I come back to hear my verdict. Great recovery, he says! He tells me I can slowly start using my eyes more, for things like eating and showering. I feel great and relieved. *Phew, I survived...* He told me to immediately contact him if I have any pain, and whaddaya know... PAIN. I have a bad pain in my right eye the next day. So we call them and I now have a sty. I have a sty *and* a delicate wound in my right eye that may bleed at any moment. Cool. Well, today I woke up and my eye is swollen shut. That isn't even an exaggeration. Only time will tell how the rest of the story goes...

**UPDATE:** Thank you all that have worried for me and shared your similar stories. Some of you even PM'd me to check up on me, and that means a lot. Really guys, thanks. So everything seems to be clearing up. My vision is back to normal, and my sty has gone away. The swelling has gone completely down. I am 99% sure I'm fine, but we are still going to on Friday to see what the doctor says. I actually noticed a sty is trying to form in my left eye now, but I'm already treating it before it gets bad. Again, thank you all for checking on me! Also, added some spacing per you guy's request. It probably isn't in the right spots, as I didn't write it with paragraphs in mind. Oh well.



**EDIT:** It seemed to piss some people off that I explained what an air compressor was, so I removed that portion. Sorry I guess. Also, thank you very much for the anonymous user who gave me gold! It is much appreciated. Honestly didn't expect this to be such a hit.


**TL:DR** : I hit myself in they with air that was under pressure, I had bleeding under my iris and risked being blind. Then a few days later got a sty in the same eye and it's swollen shut."
