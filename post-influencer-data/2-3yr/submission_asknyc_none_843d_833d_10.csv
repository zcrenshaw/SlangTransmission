"hallway etiquette


so this woman next door regularly goes out in the hallway to blow some guy on the stairs. He loiters in the hallway touching his penis waiting for her. They bang in the area that is in front of another apartment with small children and are pretty quiet, but I have walked into them before and I guess the kid next door might put the garbage out one night and see them. I don't like the idea of coming home to a couple banging out in the hallway, sorry, it's not my thing, also I dislike having some guy waving his dick around in the hall at night waiting to be serviced. My question, am I overreacting in being upset about this? I am a single female and new to NYC. To me is seems classless and hookerish and I am embarrassed to have family over. How do I approach the situation? "
"Stores that sell just one thing


My mom is coming to visit and we love how in the city you can find stores dedicated to almost anything. I would love to take her to some stores that sell primarily one thing (like the rubber stamp guy in the East village). Any other recommendations?"
"Can you go to the courthouse and watch trials?


I know some courts are open to the public, but are there any in NYC that are open and you can go watch trial? Any specific days of the week? "
