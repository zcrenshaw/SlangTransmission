Hello World,

I am Arun Rajasingh living in India suffering from a rare genetic disorder which has caused my right leg to weigh about 100kgs. I need the help of fellow human beings and I am willing to answer the questions that they would have.

I was leading a close to normal life despite of my oversized leg until 5 years back. Since then, I am confined to a room and mobility is very difficult due to my oversized right leg. Even this this disorder, I managed to complete engineering in a college 700km away from home and now I run my own IT firm - [Kenriche Technologies](http://www.kenriche.com.)

I have got a fully customized wheelchair some days back (thanks to the GoFundMe campaign) but now I am hoping for a modified vehicle which will help me move around and thus, improve my business. I am currently working only from home as mobility is a big problem and I feel that if I am able to move around, I will be able to get my business to another height and excel in that field.

Your support is motivating me to spend more time here. I am available right now.

I have a GoFundMe campaign [here](https://www.gofundme.com/ArunMobility) which you can visit to read more details about me and there is also a campaign organized by Milaap [here](https://milaap.org/campaigns/movement_ceo). Even small amounts count.

Here are some news articles that cover my story :
