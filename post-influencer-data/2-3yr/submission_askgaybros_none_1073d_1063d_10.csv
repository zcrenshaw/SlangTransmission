"My parents are gone.


My parents died last night. The house burned down and I don't know what really happened. I'm numb and not at the same time and it doesn't feel real and I can't stop crying. 

I've got friends with me and my sister is on her way. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this I think I just need to make myself recognize it. It doesn't feel real."
"Update: I'm[41m] worried that my son[17m] might be having an affair with my friend [48m].

I decided to not confront my son or Michael or tell my wife before I was sure that there was something going on between them. I didn't really know how to be sure without looking through my son's phone again or following him when he went out. Breaking his trust and invading his privacy makes me extremely uncomfortable but I felt like I didn't have a choice. 

My son is always with his phone except when he's in the shower. I decided to look through it again and read his facebook messages as well. I couldn't find any texts between him and Micheal which means that he deletes them regularly. I did however find messeges between them on facebook. Most of them were about when they were going to meet each other and ""On my way"" types of messages. They went back several months and one of them said ""Kate (Micheal's wife) is going away this weekend so we can just hang out here."" which means that Kate doesn't know about it either. Not any real proof but I felt even more sure that there was something going on. 

At this point I honestly considered just forgetting about it and pretend like everything was normal because I had no idea what I should do and I was so scared of making the wrong decision. I've always felt like people who read their kids journal or went through their stuff were bad parents that didn't know how to talk to their kids and here I am doing the same thing. I decided to just keep an eye on them though, I didn't want to stalk my son or keep looking through his phone. 

Yesterday we had a big bbq and Micheal and Kate were invited and several other neighbors and I thought it would be a good opportunity to se how they interacted with it each other because I've never paid attention to it. Everyone arrives and everything seems normal. My son mostly talks with the other neighborhood kids/teens and he seems to be enjoying himself. There's nothing suspicious about how they're interacting and I start to wonder if I got it wrong. I tell myself that they might've been meeting up just to talk and maybe my son just finds it easier to talk about personal stuff with someone who isn't his parent. Just as I'm feeling a bit more calm about the situation Kate stands up clinking her glass and says that they have an announcement. It looks very impulsive and not planned at all and Micheal gets up as well and looks very uncomfortable. Kate announces that she's pregnant and everyone cheers and gets up to congratulate them and I look over at my son to see his reaction and my heart drops because he just looks completely shocked and heartbroken. Thankfully he's standing quite far back and I really don't think anyone noticed it. After a few seconds of just standing there and looking shocked and heartbroken he calmly turns and goes inside the house. 

I didn't really need any more proof than that to be completely sure that something is going on between them. I wanted to go inside and find my son and comfort him but I decied to let him have some time alone but I also needed some time alone to calm myself because I wanted just go up to Michael and punch him in the face. I mumble something about ""special occasion"" and go inside to get a bottle of champagne. When I'm inside I hear my son closing his bedroom door. I go back out, pop the champagne and pretend to be happy and congratulate them. 

After everyone has left I go to my son's bedroom and he's lying on the bed with his back to the door and he says ""I have really bad headache"" or something and I say ""I know why you're upset."" and he looks at me confused and it's obvious he's been crying and I said ""I know about you and Michael."" and he just breaks down and starts telling me what's been going on. We talk for a really long time and I make sure to tell him early in the conversation that I don't care that he's gay and that I and his mom loves him no matter what. He told me that they've been seeing each other for about 7 months now, and that it started out as a sexual thing but then Michael started saying that he loved him and that he was going to leave Kate and then they could be together. I was trying to be really understanding and supportive during this whole conversation and I made sure to tell him early on that me and his mom don't care if he's gay and we love him no matter what and he looked very relived. 

The last thing he did before I went to bed was send Michael a long text where he told that he never wanted to see him again and that he'd block his number. About 50% of the conversation was my son telling me how stupid he was and how he should've known better than to trust Micheal so I'm not really worried about my son going back to him. We agreed not to tell anyone about it. Not Kate and not my wife. I feel really bad for Kate and I should probably tell her but I don't know how without possibly risking outing my son and he's my number one priority, and my wife is friends with Kate so telling her would put her in a very difficult situation. I did advice my son to come out to his mom though because I know she'll be completely fine with it and supportive. I'm planning on having a talk with Michael though and tell him I know the truth and to stay away from my son. 

My son is obviously very heartbroken right now but I think it was extremely good for him to come clean and not carry all these secrets alone. I'm very optimistic about his future. I wanted to thank everyone for your advice. I couldn't really talk to anyone about this so I really appreciate it :)

**TL;DR:** Was worried my son was having an affair with my neighbor/friend. Turns out they were and my neighbor's wife is pregnant so my son is very upset and ended the affair."

"My friend coming out changed my life


My best friend came out to me while we were Sophomores. I was completely shocked. That night we could not sleep as we were talking, laughing, and crying. I was completely changed through this experience and can honestly say it is one of the better things that has happened to me. I began to be an active LGBTQ supporter whereas I never would have thought to do so before. We became even better friends. Please tell your friends if you can. I know it's scary but if they are good friends it will be beneficial to all who are involved. Thank you for reading this if you did maybe I could give people some hope by sharing my story. "

"I just came out to my parents


And my siblings. Everyone took it fairly well -- I haven't been disowned and I'm still welcome at my parents' house for Christmas. I was a little surprised that my dad took it better than my mom, however. He immediately said ""we love you and we'll work through things on our end."" My mom didn't say much at first but did tell me she loved me as we finished talking via FaceTime. 

I know my own personal story is anecdotal, but I wanted to share my positive experience. I was a little unsure how my parents would take it, as my father is a pastor. "
"Boyfriend wants gender roles... I'm confused.


So this morning my boyfriend told me that he wants us to have a more traditional relationship and assume roles. So far we've had a pretty normal relationship. We've been together for 4 years and are considering marriage. We're both 27.

So he wants to take the more feminine role and wants me to be more masculine. I struggle to even understand that to some degree, having been raised by a single mother. I asked him specifically what he wants changed in our relationship and he just says he wants a more traditional dynamic between us. He wants a more dominating personality from me and wants to present a more submissive one. He wants me to boss him around a little it seems that's the extent of it. I certainly already do that between the sheets! But not outside of bed. It's just odd to take a more masculine personality because I'm physically more masculine. It feels like taking him hostage or something.

Now the second part is that he kind of wants this advertised. He says he wants everyone to know that I'm the family head and he follows my lead. He says people should know who's in charge. And he says if we end up getting married, he wants to do what brides do. He wants to have a maid of honor, he wants to be walked down the isle by his father, and everything else.

I mean I'm a little freaked out by this. I find it bizarre and we more or less agreed to give it some thought and pick up the conversation in a couple of days. So I'm asking for insight and experience that you may have of this. Is this normal in gay weddings? And what do you think of gender roles in this context?
