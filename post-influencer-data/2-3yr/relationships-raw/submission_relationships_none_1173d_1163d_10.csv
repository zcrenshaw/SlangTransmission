"My [15F] aunt [33F] didn't invite me to her wedding while inviting my brothers [18/13M] and other cousins. Update.

"UPDATE: I [31F] realised I recently have feelings for a friend [34M]. We've arranged to go out for dinner next week, but I'm not sure if it's a date. Help!


My first post didn't get that much attention, but I thought I'd update in case it helps anyone else in the same situation.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r1j71/i_31f_realised_i_recently_have_feelings_for_a/

So Last Thursday Jim took me out for dinner. He came to pick me up and I was still super nervous, even though by that time I was pretty sure it was a date. He opened the door of the taxi for me, but I went to go around the other side, thinking he was just getting in the car! He looked really confused until I figured out that he was being a gentleman and we both ended up laughing about it. It kind of broke the ice as he seemed a little nervous too.

We went for cocktails, then for dinner. Despite my insistence, he paid for everything and it was just perfect. We were chatting for hours and before we knew it, they were closing up around us.

Jim walked me to my taxi and kissed me goodbye. My stomach flipped over and I felt like a teenager - I couldn't stop grinning on the way home and fell asleep with a stupid smile on my face.

The next morning, I woke to find a text from him telling me how much he'd enjoyed our date and that he'd like to see me again soon. I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-)

**tl;dr**: It was a date. We are now dating and I feel like I've won the lottery. :-)"
"UPDATE: I [34/f] turned to my husband [34/m] for support after some bad news. He pointed out a blemish on my face in response. Is this a big enough straw to break the camel's back?


Thank you so much to everyone who commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44zp5v/i_34f_turned_to_my_husband_34m_for_support_after/) earlier this year!

We got into counseling not too long after that post and have been continuing every week ever since.  We just had a session yesterday.  Our counselor is wonderful, she really understands the situation and has identified the struggle my husband faces when confronted with an uncomfortable topic, like our losses, stress at work, the decision to have children or not, and more.

We have spent quite a long time discussing my husband's upbringing.  His family isn't really big on communicating, and there are many problems that he and his siblings have had over the years (and continue to this day) that were never addressed and never resolved.  In session he talked about how he felt his emotional needs were never really met growing up, but that he didn't realize it until now.  It made me really sad for him.  We had his parents over a few weeks ago and as usual, the conversation remained really superficial and never delved into anything very substantial.  I have tried to share with them about our life and our losses before, but there's never been any sign of interest from them in connecting with us in that way, even though his mother is one of the only people I know in my life who has suffered a loss as well.  We spent the next week's session processing their visit, and unfortunately my husband felt a lot of anger and frustration that he wasn't able to talk to them about the important stuff.

However, in our relationship things have completely transformed.  We argue so much less, and he is completely present and there for me when I need his support.  The topic of having children has come back up, and we are still figuring that out, but we can really talk about it and be open and honest with each other without fear and with respect and open arms for each other.  He has repeatedly said that he's really happy we got into therapy and that he feels great about the state of our relationship.  I'm almost happy we've gone through such hard times so that we were able to hit rock bottom and get to this wonderful place.

So, thank you to everyone for your kindness and generosity in following our journey.  

TL;DR: Poor communicator husband and I started therapy and now our relationship has completely transformed.  Thank you to everyone!"

"[UPDATE] Do I [20F] tell the guy I've been casually seeing [20M] that I am pregnant and am having an abortion on Friday


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t5z5t/do_i_20f_tell_the_guy_ive_been_casually_seeing/

After reading all of your comments it became clear to me I needed to tell him. He called me just to chat this evening, and told me all about his trip but how excited he is to see me again. As we were talking, I realized I really like this guy and suddenly I felt this weight falling onto my shoulders. I had to tell him.

So I told him about 30 minutes ago over the phone. First he laughed, and thought I was joking about being pregnant. Once he realized I was serious, he got quiet, but kindly asked me to just run him through the logistics of what was going to happen and what it was going to do to me.

He was genuinely concerned for me and my wellbeing, and kept saying how thankful he was that I told him. He said he'd be there for me through the whole process, and that I don't need to worry about it changing anything between us. He was rather impressed by my matter-of-fact and practical approach to the matter- and that I had the appointment and funds covered without even talking to him.

I honestly think this just showed me that he is a really good guy and wants what is best for me. He seemed to appreciate my maturity and mostly appreciated me telling him.

Thanks so much to everyone who encouraged me to do this. It was 100% the right decision, and I feel even more sure about a possible relationship/future together!

Edit: Wow this blew up! Thank you SO much everyone for the thoughtful comments and advice. I feel much more at ease about the situation and am thankful for all of your words.
**tl;dr**: Called Mike, he was very understanding and nice about the situation. I feel relieved!"
"My [25M] best friend [25M] is the vet that put my girlfriends [24F] dog down and now my girlfriend wants me to stop talking to him


As the title states my girlfriend had to put down her dog a couple of months ago. It was really sudden and he was still quite young so we weren't at all prepared for it. He was her dog but we've been together for two years and living together for one so it was hard on me too. We took him to the only emergency animal hospital in our town that's open 24/7 which is where my best friend happens to work. He was the vet that ended up helping us. We ran all kinds of tests and tried a few things to help him but ultimately put him down that night. As much as the situation sucked, I think my friend was excellent at handling everything and my girlfriend didn't seem to have any issues with him. 

For the past two months she has expressed that she thinks her dog wasn't actually sick and our friend just ran all of those tests and put him down so he could make money. I tried to be sympathetic at first but now she's straight up insulting my friend and wants me to stop hanging out with him. My buddies and I have baseball season tickets (she has one too) and every time I go she asks if the ""dog murderer"" is going to be there and if he's going she won't come. She whines every time I get to get together with my friends too if he's going to be there. 


Can you guys think of anything I can do to get this to stop? I think it's really disrespectful and I'm probably going to break up with her if it continues.

"My [24F] sister [23F] got arrested last night for public intoxication &amp; Assaulting a police officer. My family are furious that my cop fiance [24M] did nothing to help her.


[removed]"
"My [25F] husband [35M] has been lying about working late for over a month now, leaving me alone to take care of our son. I'm furious and don't know what to do.


My husband and I have a 3 year old son together. In addition to our son, I also take care of our 4 year old niece -my husband's sister's daughter- on Fridays because she is a single mother and works full time. My husband volunteered me, but I was happy to do it because I work from home and she's a sweet girl. Plus it saves my sister-in-law money on daycare, so that's good, too. I originally agreed to do this because my husband works half-days on Friday, meaning he was home for the afternoon to help me out. Having two kids under 5 in the house is a handful, but I was able to handle the morning. 

Well, a month ago my husband told me his boss was upping his hours to work on a special project for the forseeable future. He would have to work an hour later on the weekdays and go back to full-days on Friday. This was a disappointment, but I didn't want to go put my sister-in-law in the tough position of trying to find and pay for a sitter on Fridays. So I figured I could handle the two kids, even if it would be tough. And I have. It's been difficult, I have to work later in the evenings because I don't get as much done in the day, but I've been managing it. 

Last Friday, I was at the grocery store with the kids. I saw my boss's wife and chatted to her for a bit. I made some comment about how much of a bummer it was how everyone was working more hours, and she looked confused. She said if that was happening her husband wasn't being a very good boss, because he was home every day like normal and working half Fridays. I ended the conversation and went home.

That night I asked my husband why if he was working more, his boss wasn't. He looked nervous and said that it was only for lower-level employees. I said that was bullshit and that he needed to tell me the truth. Turns out, he hasn't been working more. He's been going to hang out at a friend's house every day and on Friday afternoons he just does whatever the hell he wants. He said he needed a break from how busy we are with our son and on Fridays with our niece. 

I'm furious. First off, he lied to me. Secondly, he has left me alone to take care of *our* kid and *his* sister's kid, who he volunteered me to take care of! And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I told him he needs to be home at the correct time from now on, and he responded that he still ""needs his alone time"", and that the kids are ""too much."" Fucking yeah, it's a lot of work, but I have to deal with it all on my own? I mean, am I being unreasonable here? I get that it's a lot, but I don't feel like that gives him the right to unilaterally decide he can have some time off. What do I do? 



   
**tl;dr**: My husband lied about working to get out of taking care of our son and niece. I'm furious and don't know how to handle the situation."
"UPDATE: My husband [34M] bought a house without telling me [27F] and now expects us to live in it.


[Orignal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl27b/my_husband_34m_bought_a_house_without_telling_me/)

I have what I consider to be a pretty happy update, but considering how many people would calling for me to divorce my husband in the last post, maybe you guys won't feel the same. 

We sat down and had long talk last night and again this morning.
I told my husband, in no uncertain terms, that this had been a huge breach of trust and I was in no way happy with the fact that he bought this house. I had called my parents before and figured out how much it cost them to renovate a lot of the rooms in their house, as well as how long they estimated it took. I showed him those numbers and I could tell that that made it really sink in just how much work he had signed himself up for.

All of this finally sobered him up and he apologized for doing this. He said he understands why I didn't want it, and he understood that I wanted no part in the renovations, but he still loves this house and thinks he can renovate it to the point that I will love it, too. And to be fair to him, the house does have nice bones. It's in a good area, and the idea of being able to hand-pick everything and change a few things around to exactly what we want does appeal to me a *little* bit. So I agreed to keep the house.

With that decision, though, comes the condition that he will be doing *all* the renovations by himself. It will come from his pocket, he will do all the work, deal with hiring any contractors needed, everything. We agreed on a few major things that need to be done by the end of this year to make the house livable without it being a total construction zone. The only involvement I will have in the renovations will be input on paint colors, flooring, and fixtures. If he has the major projects we agreed on done by the end of the year, we will move in and I have agreed that I will help a little, but the house will not take up all of our free time. As soon as it does, I am done. 

In the meantime, we will be keeping the apartment. That is where we'll be living for the rest of this year. We agreed on a maximum amount that either of us can spend without consulting the other person. He has agreed to go to marital counseling with me so that we can figure out a better way to communicate so that this never happens again.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still kind of pissed at him and won't be lovey-dovey for a quite a while, but I can be in the same room as him without wanting to snap his head off. He's still my husband and I still love him. Hopefully in 20 years this will just be something that makes me roll my eyes when I remember it. I'm not looking forward to the coming months of renovations, but I'm glad that I don't have to be a part of it. He can spend his weekends ripping up carpet and insulating walls. I'll be in the San Juan Islands whale-watching and getting drunk on vineyard tours. 

Thanks to everyone for your help.


   
**tl;dr**: We're keeping the house and have some new ""rules"" to assure that this doesn't happen again. Not looking forward to renovations, but I don't have to do any of it so I think this is the best compromise. "
"My girlfriend [24F] of 3 years replaced all of my [29M] clothes while I was away


I'll try to give my girlfriends side here too so it's not too biased. I used to dress like shit, I was perfectly content wearing my gym clothes everywhere and stretched the dress code as much as possible for work. My girlfriend works in the fashion industry so she helped me buy some clothes that fit me better and looked nicer without being out of my comfort zone so I was really thankful for that. I kept all the same gym clothes, sweatpants, Panama pants, old t shirts and sweaters and jeans etc as well as all of my shoes because I figured they'd be fine to wear around the house or to work out because I don't really care how I look for that. I told her she could buy clothes for me if she wants because she knows what I like which is maybe where I went wrong. 


Last week I went on training for work and it was my birthday while I was gone. I got back and my girlfriend had  donated all of my old clothes that she hadn't picked out and replaced it with new stuff. I tried to act grateful at first but honestly I'm fucking pissed off. I don't want to wear shitty stiff jeans that stain the seats in my truck blue and the running shoes suck for actually running. Even the sweatpants are kinda tight which in my mind defeats the purpose of wearing sweatpants. She got rid of all my old t shirts that I bought at games and replaced them with plain colours but now I have barely any tshirts at all. And she spent a ton of money doing this. I know the jeans alone are over $300 and and the shoes probably cost over two grand. She gets a small discount on this stuff but still, she probably spent upwards of 5k on all the new clothes, I looked up some of the brands and it's all really high end. 


I told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had to but offered to go get it back from the thrift store. Well the thrift store apparently sends their donated clothes away to get wasted and then they get sent to various locations throughout our city so basically no one has any idea where my clothes are and they're as good as gone. 


The reason I'm posting is she's now mad at me for being ungrateful and says I'm being shitty and should respect and appreciate her more. But yeah I'm not really that thankful because she got rid of all my shit. Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find but it caused a huge fight. Am I being a dick for being pissed about this? 


**tl;dr**: my girlfriend replaced all of my clothes with nicer higher end versions and I'm pissed off about it. 


Edit-this is getting a lot of responses so I'll add this here to clear things up. I don't dress like a slob, my clothes don't have holes, I'm not wearing lame graphic tees, and everything I've worn out of the house for the last three years (with the exception of going to the gym) has been gf approved. Also I'm not going to break up with her over this, it sucks but not really break up worthy. "
"My [24F] sister died from melanoma. She went to the tanning salon twice a week for 10 years and was out in the sun constantly. I'm angry at her for being so reckless and can't move on from her death


Hello r/relationships. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this because it is about my relationship with my sister but my sister is dead so I guess it's a personal issue. I'm just looking for some help and advice. I'm posting with a throwaway because people know my main and I don't want my baggage out there for all of them to see.

I’ll start with some background about my sister: She started tanning when she was 14. School had just finished and she got a babysitting job for the summer. She used some of the money she made to go to the tanning beds. She would go at least twice week. She was constantly out in the sun too and never wore sunscreen. She met her husband when she was 20 and they got married a couple of years later. A year after the wedding she gave birth to a baby boy, my nephew. When he was a few weeks old she took him to the doctor for a checkup and the doctor noticed a mole on her arm that he told her to get checked because it looked suspicious. She didn't want to go but he made her promise to. She went to see a dermatologist and he was concerned enough to do a biopsy. It came back malignant and my sister was diagnosed with melanoma. The doctors did what they could to treat her but it had already spread. She died on the one year anniversary of her diagnosis. It was one month after her son's first birthday, two months after her second wedding anniversary and three months after her 24th birthday (to the day).

I am so angry with her. I know she’s dead so it doesn’t make sense but I can’t help it. The risks of tanning beds and the sun are so well known. My sister lived in a developed country, in a middle class home and she graduated high school and community college. No offense to anyone who isn’t, but she had no excuse. I tried to tell her and so did other people but she didn’t listen. She went twice a week and baked in the sun every chance she got. She tanned while pregnant. At first she didn’t tell the tanning salon about her pregnancy and once she started showing she tanned outside instead. Even after she was diagnosed with melanoma we found out she continued to tan. She said she couldn’t stand not being tanned. Don’t get me wrong. I loved my sister. She was a good person, loving, kind and ambitious. Her death hurts like hell and I give anything for more time with her. But I am so angry at her and I feel like I hate her too. She left behind a son who won’t remember her, a husband who she was the love of his life and a devastated family and many friends too. She worked at a charity and was always helping people. She could have done so much good but I can’t stop hating her for wasting it. She didn’t even stop when she was diagnosed. It’s been 10 months since she died and all the anger and hate is still there. I’m the same age she was when she died. I love my sister (if that makes sense) and I don’t want to hate her. Please help if you have any advice.

tl;dr My sister used tanning beds twice a week since she was 14 and she tanned outside too. She was diagnosed with melanoma but still kept tanning. She died and left behind a one year old son and her husband and family. I am so anger at her for being reckless but I don't want to hate her."
"My [25/F] brother [22/M] is expecting me to give up a study/internship abroad opportunity and spend the money going to his destination wedding [to 21/F] somewhere I am not interested in travelling to. Am I the unreasonable one?


Throwaway because I don’t want to link this to my post history.

For the sake of ease, we’ll call my brother Sam and his wife Kate. Obviously not their real names. 

My brother Sam became engaged 8 months ago to Kate after a year of dating. They have a 3 month old son. Sam and I have never been super close with each other…..we are very different people and have very little in common. We were very different as kids….I was always reading and he was always playing video games. He dropped out of school at 15, right when I went off to University. He was in trouble with the law for a while there and we didn't have much to do with each other. We get along civilly, but he does allow Kate to make an endless stream of side remarks to me which is a sore point for me. Sam never once sticks up for me, even when my parents have been shocked at what she says. Kate also tries to 'push me out' a lot by saying things like how she is my parents daughter. Basically, she has always tried to take my place to compensate for having had a crappy childhood with a single mother who didn't care about her. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean her behaviour isn't infuriating for me you know? 

Sam and Kate have decided to have a huge wedding and bacherlor/ettes in Thailand and are now expecting me to pay my own way there and book a 11 day trip to Thailand and pay for all my own expenses, including flights. They are taking out a loan to make the wedding possible because Kate has ‘always wanted’ a ‘dreamy beach destination wedding’. (I think that is stupid. I mean it is their life and their finances but why hasn’t that clued them in on how it might also be unaffordable for their guests? If I didn't have savings, would they expect me to take a loan). 

They also want me to be a bridesmaid and given that Kate asked her 2 best friends 4 months ago (I saw it on instagram, she did the ‘will you be my bridesmaid’ proposal thing)….I asked why they were asking now and they admitted one of Kate’s friends backed out because of the coats and they ‘need another and there isn’t really anyone else’. They're angry at Kate's friend for backing out, but she agreed to be a bridesmaid *before* she knew they were planning on taking the wedding from Australia to Thailand. I’m not exactly thrilled about the idea of being a ‘back up bridesmaid’, especially to someone I know dislikes me at worst, is indifferent to me at best. Eff that, tbh. This is going to cost *thousands* of dollars. My parents are not thrilled about the wedding, but are going along with it because they know any disagreement and my brother will take it out on them because whatever Kate wants, Sam makes sure she gets. My parents love their grandson and they know if they 'annoy' Kate too much, they can forget about seeing him. I think Kate knows that and uses her baby to get her way. 

This wedding is not how I want to spend my own money and it is now causing a big drama. 

Even before this became an issue, I was always of the opinion that expensive destination weddings are incredibly selfish and entitled because the couple is expecting their guests to pay a *lot* of money to attend and essentially dictating to them where their next holiday will be without considering they might want to go somewhere else. Go for your honeymoon, don’t make everyone else pay for that too. I mean, I personally have 0 interest in Thailand. I hate the beach……I’m a fair skinned strawberry blonde girl who hates hot weather and can’t go in the water with her contacts in so it’s just…..not my idea of fun at all. I don’t want to spend all my savings on a beach holiday I’ll hate. 

I can technically afford to go based on the balance of my savings account, but I’m saving for something important. I’m currently a masters student studying a double masters in European Union Law and French Translation and have been offered the chance to complete five months study in Paris next year and interning for a major government department for three months afterwards. That is my plan for the money I’ve been saving from my part time tutoring job. The wedding is being held during the internship. They want me to give it up even though it could be the big break of my career. This is how I want to use the money. There is now an expectation I’ll back out of this and go to the wedding and even pay to be Kate’s bridesmaid. 

I’ve said no. Sam is losing his shit because Kate is pissed off I’m not bowing to her wishes. My parents are urging me to reconsider. I know they think this is all bullshit (my father in particular thinks Kate is ridiculous), but they know the kind of hold Kate has over my brother and know if they even slightly upset her, he'll side with her and they might not see their grandkid. They enable her because she’s insane and entitled. 

Am I being the unreasonable one?

One of the things that makes Sam/Kate and I so different is that we have different goals and interests. I have an undergraduate Law/French degree (possible in my country) and am now studying a masters degree. Kate has said on Facebook that her goal is to get a husband so she ‘doesn’t have to work’ and can ‘have babies’. Sam dropped out of school and works a blue collar job. I’m not looking down on that, but it means he doesn’t really understand how important opportunities like the one I have been offered are for careers like the one I am pursuing. We are very different people with very different goals in life, which is fine, but it means they don’t understand that giving up and opportunity like this could be giving up my ‘big break’ and to me, my career for the next 50 years is more important than someone’s wedding day. They *knew* I would be interning in Paris when they selected this date because I told them long before they picked a date. It makes me wonder if Kate knew what she was doing in picking this date. 

What do you think reddit? Am I the bad guy for saying I’m not spending all my money to indulge Kate’s ‘fairytale wedding dream’ and sticking to my study abroad/internship plans or do I have to suck it up?

**tldr: brother is expecting me to spend the $10k+ I’ve saved to study/intern abroad on a destination beach wedding when I hate the beach and the bride is constantly rude to me. Am I in the wrong for refusing?** "

"[UPDATE] I [22F] found a hidden folder on my girlfriend's [22F] hard-drive with heaps of photos of her step-sister [26F]



Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl3fu/i_22f_found_a_hidden_folder_on_my_girlfriends_22f/?st=iqu768b8&amp;sh=f3d51f04


**EDIT** Thank you to everyone for such an outpouring of support, it means so much to me! My GF and I had a big talk last night and she is going to tell her parents. It's likely they will find out at some point anyway, and it isn't fair that my GF should feel uncomfortable with her own family. And to the people who are saying John must be gay, please think about what you're saying and how offensive it is. Yes, there have been instances where intensely homophobic people are hiding same-sex attraction. But they are in the minority. If I came to you saying my GF was black and her sister was marrying a KKK member, no one would be saying ""oh he just wants to be black"". Some people are just hateful. 


Hi guys, a few people hit me up for an update and I wanted to let you all know what ended up happening. Thanks for everyone’s support and advice, I wasn’t expecting so many people to comment and I really appreciate everyones feedback.  I’ve added some (fake) names here because there’s more people involved and I think it gets more confusing. 


From all the comments I got the sense that I was hugely overreacting. I’m an anxious person who can jump to the worst case scenario a lot of the times – it’s something I’m really trying to work on because I don’t like that side of myself. That’s really why I came here, to get another opinion before talking to my girlfriend. And you all slapped some sense into me, so thank you for that. 


So my girlfriend came over that night, and I decided to follow people’s advice and just talk to her about it honestly and be completely upfront. I said, “I wanted to surprise you by getting into Firefly so I went onto your hard drive to get it” and reddit my heart just broke, she was excited and wanted to put it right on so we could watch it together. I knew then that what I thought had happened didn’t – she obviously didn’t make the connection with the folder being hidden in her Firefly folders and was just keen to watch the show with me. That little reaction just made me feel so relieved – it’s hard to explain but I knew then that there was no way she was hiding this big secret and she obviously didn’t have any shame or embarrassment around the hidden folder, because she didn’t even remember that the folder was in there.


so I just said that I had accidently found the folder of her step sister (Lizzie), the one called “ugh”. I asked why she had made it. Her face just fell and she was quiet for a bit. And then she told me this whole story:


So I had noticed my GF had been quiet and a bit sad recently, but she’s been working a lot and I just assumed she was super tired. But no, like a few of you guessed she had had a big fight with Lizzie. 


A few weeks ago a high school friend (Gina) of my GF got in contact with her on facebook. Gina is fairly religious and goes to church a lot. Gina said she didn’t want to make waves in my GFs family, but wanted to let her know – the guy Lizzie is marrying (John) is well-known in the Christian community in our area for being involved in those gay-conversion workshops and seminars. Gina wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, and seemed to think maybe she had accepted John’s work out of some internalized homonegativity. 


My girlfriend (and I) did NOT know that John did stuff like that. I only knew that he was a therapist and that he went to church, and my girlfriend said he had only ever been introduced like that to her. She said she was pretty sure her parents didn’t know either, as they have always been loving and accepting of her and would be outraged over John’s line of work. She was worried that John had been lying to Lizzie as well, and contacted Lizzie to tell her what she had heard from Gina.


Obviously it didn’t go well. Lizzie was very defensive, and basically just kept telling my GF that John’s beliefs were his beliefs and Lizzie had no right to make any assumptions over it. It was clear Lizzie knew what John was doing and was completely find with it, and was hiding it through omission from her family.


My GF cried and cried through telling me this. As I said in my last post, Lizzie was such a hero to my GF and she loves her so much, so this acceptance is such a betrayal. I think that’s why she didn’t tell me when it first happened, and when she hid those files – she just didn’t’ want to have to deal with it, because Lizzie hurt her so much by not caring what John does for “therapy”. These workshops focus on telling gay kids/adults of how wrong and perverted they are, and basically force them back into the closet. They focus on scaring parents into cutting support off from their gay children and use all these horrible horrible tactics to basically force these people to hide their sexuality. 


So she said she just couldn’t stand having all these reminders of Lizzie scattered through her computer, so she ended up just putting them all into one folder and hiding it. I guess “ugh” meant “ugh I don’t want to deal with this right now”. 


We’re sort of at a loss to do now. I’m obviously just trying to give my girlfriend as much support as I can, because everything is her decision now. Lizzie doesn’t seem willing to see that what her fiancé has dedicated his life to is so painful for her sister. My GF doesn’t know whether to tell her parents. On one hand, it’s going to be horrible/painful/awkward as balls to have family dinners with this future brother-in-law who thinks that her and me are “defective”. And my GF is pretty sure both her parents (including her step-dad) would do what they can to protect her from John. On the other hand, she loves Lizzie so much and doesn’t want to force her away from her family. It’s not Lizzie’s profession, and John has never been outright nasty to my GF. 


So it’s still in motion, but I wanted to let you guys know what’s happened since my last post. I’m obviously relieved my GF doesn’t have feelings for Lizzie, but this is still heartbreaking in a different way. It’s horrible to see my GF so upset and I’m just trying to give her as much love and care as humanly possible. I’m excited for tonight because I borrowed a projector from my friend and am going to set it up so we can watch Firefly on the wall of my living room. I’m going to make us a big blanket fort and order pizza so we can snuggle and watch TV all night. 


Thank you all again, it means the world to me that you all took time out of your lives to offer advice to me.


**TL;DR:** My gf hid photos and texts of her step-sister because they are fighting and she didn’t want to look at them. Turns out step-sister is marrying a homophobe that works for a church performing those “gay conversion” workshops.

"I won the lottery, should I tell my financially irresponsible family?

"My deceased father [65M] left me [32M] a large inheritance, which my wife [35F] thinks I should give to her extended family to start a business


My father passed away in April due to an unexpected stroke. He leaves behind me, my sister [29F], and my mother [67F]. In his will, of course my mother gets to retain her house. He left each of us money and portions of his retirement savings. All told, my sister and I received about fifty-thousand dollars each, plus a few stocks and other investments worth about fifteen to twenty thousand dollars more, increasing over time with interest. My mother of course received more because she is his wife. She was really humble and ashamed as if she did something wrong, promising my sister and me that we would inherit everything when she's gone. I told her to keep her money and enjoy it as much as she can. My sister concurs.


Recently the lawyers handling everything have cut a check for each of us. My wife and I (we've been married eight years) discussed several weeks ago that we will just put the money in our retirement fund to combine with the one I get from my job as a teacher.


But my wife kind of bragged to her family that I had received an inheritance and that we were making our retirement more comfortable. We're also considering taking a few thousand dollars to go on a nice summer vacation with our two kids (two boys aged seven and four).


Her mother suggested that I use the money to help my wife's cousins and other family members fulfill their dream of opening a gourmet French restaurant. None of us are French but my wife's cousin is supposedly finishing culinary school and he says he will be the chef.


My wife's mother is really manipulative and has convinced my wife that our using my inheritance money to fund the family restaurant idea is the right thing to do, and that if my mother is unable to convince me to devote all or at least most of it to the restaurant idea, then my wife has the right to at least give them half (ie, twenty-five thousand dollars).


I do not like this idea at all, especially giving them all the money but even half of it. I asked my wife why don't they just borrow money from the bank, but it turns out none of them have very good credit. When I ask how they will ever pay me back, my wife's mother insists that I will be paid back by restaurant profits.


Personally I think it's all a stupid idea and doomed to failure, but my wife is now convinced that this is the best course of action and that if she fails to come through for her family, it is a sign of disloyalty.


I don't think my dad intended his money to be used to pay for some jackass idea that will most likely fail. None of these people know what they're doing, but at the same time I don't want to disappoint my wife.


When I offered my mother in law ten thousand dollars out of the fifty, she kind of turned up her nose at it like I was selfish and insulting her.


I really don't care what she thinks but I do care about what my wife thinks.


Just looking for advice on what to do, what compromises to make, just comments in general. Thank you Reddit.

[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4saiyh/me_28m_moving_to_new_city_bought_house_with/)

Thanks for all the advice, I have a happy update for you. She showed up at my new job yesterday to surprise me and she's going to be staying out here. The reason she kept putting off moving was that she found out she is pregnant (it wasn't planned) and was scared to go through pregnancy and have the baby without her mom close by to help. She finally told her mom on Monday and her mom reassured her and bought her a plane ticket and sent her on her way. 

As exciting as that news is, she's known for about two months now and only told me yesterday, so clearly we have a lot to work on. We think there was just way too much going on at once, with the move, my new job, her quitting hers, our engagement, etc and now the pregnancy. It was just too stressful for her. I'd appreciate any advice on how to make this easier for her. 

**tl;dr**: she finally showed up, she didn't come because she was pregnant and was scared to not have her mom around. "
"My [29F] mom [50sF] WILL NOT STOP offering my belongings to other people, then guilting me and insulting me when I say no. I'm getting really angry.


I got married last year, so I have all my wedding stuff in my attic (the one I have at my house with my husband, not my childhood house) and closet. Some of it I don't care about (extra favors, decorations, etc), some of it I do (my dress/veil/champagne flutes).

A few month ago, my cousin got engaged. She's a little snobby and would usually never accept used stuff, but that doesn't stop my mom from constantly offering. Keep in mind I payed for all of it myself.

My mom called me a couple weeks ago and said ""I told [cousin] she could have your card box, cake knife, and cake topper. Do you care? She said she wants it.""

I don't care about the card box or knife, but the cake topper was custom made for me. I told her she could have the first two, but in the future to please not offer my stuff to people without asking.

 She used to do this to me *all the time* as a kid. I'd come home to see my doll missing, and she'd be like ""oh, [other cousin] was here and she wanted it."" It pissed me off, to which she always called me a selfish only-child.

Anyway, a couple weeks after the card box thing, I mentioned I had a busy morning that Sunday, because I had planned to clean out all my closets and dressers. Saturday night, she called me and said ""I told [friend] you were cleaning tomorrow, and she wanted to know if you had any coats, so I told her you'd give her some."" I DID NOT mention I was throwing away anything, especially any coats. I told her no, which she guilt-tripped me about because her friend is poor, and I have so much, and I'm selfish. I gave her one I never really wore, but I told her this is the last time I'd put up with this shit and to cut it out.

Now, my aunt is staying with her from out of state for the week, and my aunt forgot to bring nice shoes. So, guess who is the same shoe-size as her? My aunt showed up to my place Saturday morning, telling me my mother said she could look through my shoes for a pair to wear to a party that night. I felt bad saying no to my aunts face, so I let her in.

Then, she informed me that my mother also told her I'd be taking her to the airport next week. I didn't answer.

Then **today** my cousin who is getting married told us she found a wedding dress. I was over my moms house having dinner, and she showed me the pictures she texted her. I remarked that her veil looked very similar to mine, and my mom goes ""yeah, I told her she could just have yours, but she said no.""

Finally I exploded. And I'm not proud, but I was swearing at her. I said ""what the *fuck* gives you the right to offer my wedding veil to her without asking me? Enough with this shit. I've had it. I will give you nothing. Ever.""

That veil was $500, and I was/am in love with it. It really pissed me off. My mom tried to play it off like ""oh please, I knew she wouldn't say yes anyway."" But that's not the fucking point. I left, and told her she could make herself look like a fool from now on by offering shit to people they can never have, and I no longer care.

Now she's trying to guilt-trip me about what a horrible selfish person I am, and I'm not having it. I don't care if I'm selfish. I wouldn't take someone else's things without asking, and I don't want people offering my things. Period. 

To top it off, a few hours later I get a text from my mom saying ""[Aunt] wants to borrow another pair of shoes for a party she has this weekend.""

I didn't answer. I'm literally seeing red. I want to wring her neck and never talk to her again. She's a good mom, I swear, and I never talk to her this way, but she's really been getting on my nerves lately by stepping all over my boundaries. There's other examples about boundaries, but this is the main thing that's driving me crazy today.

I need advice before I go completely mental.

"How do me and my friends [20sF] tell our other friend [25F] we don't want her toddler to come on our vacation?


Hi Relationships,

Last year a group of four girl friends [20sF] and I started a tradition of renting out a particular cottage during the summer for a weekend getaway with each other. This usually consists of us being unreasonably drunk/loud all day and night and something we look forward to all year. 

Six months ago when I began planning for this year's stay, we made sure to plan early so we could give Ella [25F] a lot of time to figure out what she can do with Lily [2F] in terms of babysitters. However, Ella said straight off the bat that her attending is unlikely. We were bummed but we understood. 

The cottage vacation is now a couple weeks away and Ella informed some of us yesterday that she will be attending and she is bringing Lily. Umm what?

Lily is an AMAZING girl and I'm always happy being in her company. But this is our vacation! So we can get drunk and swear and not worry about anything! Like any toddler, she requires a lot of attention to keep her occupied. Which I am always happy to do, but not during this trip.

First of all, the cottage is tiny, and I myself will be sleeping on a couch. Ella informed us that her and Lily will be tenting outside, but if it rains...I'm assuming she will feel like she will have to bring her toddler in, thus stopping the festivities so Lily can sleep. Another girl was also planning on bringing her dog, but since Lily is coming, she doesn't want to have to be watching their interactions all weekend and is now making other plans for the dog. Third of all, this cottage is on water, so I'm sure that we all will have to be doing some babysitting at some point during the trip to make sure she stays safe. Lastly, I don't expect Ella to put any money towards the cottage since she is tenting, but she will be using the facilities and I'm the one in charge of the safety deposit...the entire thing just seems like a big request to me. 

Two girls that are closest to her tried to explain to her yesterday that they love having Lily around, but this wasn't the most appropriate setting for her to be in. From what I was told, Ella got defensive and still insisted she wanted Lily to come.

How do we let her down easy, Relationships? She and her daughter are wonderful human beings, but she just doesn't seem to understand it's a lot to ask of us. It's a very sensitive subject so I'd like to be as courteous and understanding as possible.

"My husband [34M] bought a house without telling me [27F] and now expects us to live in it.


My husband and I have been married for 3 years. For the first two years we lived together on the east coast in an apartment I owned outright. Last summer my husband got transferred to the PNW for work. Several factors eventually led to the decision of my husband moving out west and renting a small place, and me staying back home and finishing out my contract. That contract ended in June and I moved to join my husband. Since then we have been living together in his studio. Recently, since I'm not working right now, I've been spending my time looking for a bigger, nicer apartment for us that is within our budget.

Well, I found a couple places and decided this past weekend would be a good time for my husband and I to look over them. This is when he decided to drop a bomb on me: he bought a house and wants us to move in when the lease is up. He was really excited about it, talking about how this is ""our"" place, how it's the perfect little starter home, and how it'd be perfect to start a family.

Reddit, I was livid. He took me out to look at it, and I'm absolutely floored at how idiotic this decision was. The house is a piece of crap. He bought what was in our price range, and that doesn't buy much out here. I grew up in a ""fixer-upper"". Every single summer of my life from ages 12-20 was spent doing projects ranging from painting to building new bedrooms. When I was young I promised myself I wouldn't own a house until I was at least 30-35.. I hate all the responsibility and headache that comes along with it. Honestly if I could have it my way I would never own a house my entire life, but I know it's something my husband wants, so whatever. 

And my husband knows this. He knows exactly how I feel and as soon as he showed me the house I let him know all of that once again. But he doesn't see why I'm so upset. He says he thought I would be happy and says he'll do all the work. Yeah, sure. That's what everyone says until they realize how hard fixing up a house is.

I want to live in a nice apartment and spend our weekends taking day trips and exploring this part of the world, not in old paint clothes ripping up berber carpet. Honestly I don't know what to do. I'm fucking pissed about this situation and pissed at my husband for doing this without consulting me. 

Should I just suck it up and be grateful? Part of me realizes he thought it was a sweet gesture, but the other part of me is really dreading that the entirety of my foreseeable future will be spent with renovations. Does it have to be that bad? Am I being a bitch for being this upset over it? Plus, he bought the house already. How can I even get us out of this? How do I even look at my husband without seeing an idiot who just ruined the next 5+ years of our lives?



   
**tl;dr**: Husband bought a fixer-upper when he knows I'm not ready to be a homeowner. I really don't want to go through with this, but don't know how to get out of it or have him see my side of things."
"[UPDATE!] I [18F] am deathly allergic to my younger brother [5M] kitten. Think his Dad [40sM] is encouraging him to poison me.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sne8n/i_18f_am_deathly_allergic_to_my_younger_brother/

First off, thank you all for your responses, I took the time to read through each one of them and took everything on board.

So, Friday morning, I told my Mom what was going on before I headed off to school and told her that I really didn't want to get Tommy in trouble! She said we'd sit down and talk with him after school, the pair of us, and get to the bottom of this (And he'd be grounded and have his scooter taken away because he's not getting away with it)

So we sat down and talked with him, this is a summary of the conversation.

Mom: Have you been putting cat hair on your sisters bed?

T:... yeah...

Mom: That's very wrong, Tommy. Because -explanation of severe allergy-

Tommy looks kinda shocked at this point, I don't think he'd figured out that it could actually kill me, he kept looking at me and I was nodding in agreement with Mom.

T: Sorry deathlyallergies! Sorry! Dad said that if you were okay with a bit of cat hair, Shadow could come home, he said that was a good way for him to come back, I'm sorry!

Mom: What exactly did Dad say?

T: He said that deathlyallergies got sick from cat hair, but having little bits about would mean she got better at being around it and then Shadow could come home. Like my injections.

So since then, Mom and I have basically gone NC with Frank. Tommy went for his weekend there with the knowledge that he's grounded and that's been passed on.

When Mom asked Frank about what Tommy had said, he denied it, saying he explained allergies properly and that it sucked but that was the way it was etc etc. We don't believe him, but since it's the word of a 5y/o against that of a 40y/o pillar of community, there's nothing we can do about it.

Tommy came home yesterday evening, stripped off at the door, went straight to the bath and then came and gave me a hug once he was clean, apologising again for what he'd done. Of course I've forgiven him, he's a little kid who's been manipulated by a grown up, which sucks.

So now, hopefully, the issue has been put to rest. It sucks to know that Frank tried to do that to me (whether he thought he was helping or he was just being a jackass I guess we'll never know) but I've cut him out of my life and that's that I guess.

*Edit* As per other suggestions, I will be getting Tommy a little plush cat sometime soon for him to have at home! It's not his fault.

**TL;DR** Talked to Tommy, he confirmed that his Dad gave him the idea. Tommy's grounded and realises he was wrong, Mom &amp; I have gone NC with Frank (Bar needed contact from Mom about Tommy)"
"I [16M] have been complaining about throat pain [for 5-6 months. My parents have told me it's nothing and my sister [14F] complained of ear pain today and they took her to the doctor.


Hi Reddit, I need to know what to do. I am not sure if this is the right place but it says advice so I am assuming it's right. 

For the past 6 or 5 months I have had a really sore throat, it has been itchy, burning, dry and it feels like some flem is there and it just won't go away. My throat get's really unnaturally hot sometimes. I have told my parents about this for months I have not stopped bitching about it. 

My parents have told me it's fine it's a cold, but I have had this cold for months now. My parents keep telling me you are a big guy, it will go away naturally. 

My sister complained of ear pain today and they took her to the doctor. I just I don't understand how they can take my sister to the doctor and not me. Because I am a big guy it should be fine

I live in Missouri, my older sisters live in Massachusetts so she is states away and I have no other family here, Can I go to the doctor myself?

"I [26F] ran away from a forced marriage. I helped my sister [19F] escape as well. She's having a difficult time adjusting to life in the US.


When I was 17 I was given to a 37 year old man by my parents. I had no choice in the matter. I actually didn't talk to him until after we were married. All I did after that was to stay on birth control so that I wouldn't get pregnant, I eventually was able to contact some human rights organizations and they put me in touch with the right people who helped me come to the US as a refugee when I was 23.

Last year my sister told me that my family are looking for a husband for her and I suggested that she should come to me. I got in touch with the same people and they were able to help her as well, and I was able to bring her here 3 months ago. She now lives with me.

The problem is that she's not adjusting at all. She continuously tells me how much she misses our parents and how alien everything is to her here, how difficult life is and she wishes that here was more like our home country. She's going to classes to learn English and other necessary things and she's making progress but she isn't happy and I know it can be difficult and I can't seem to be able to help her. She talks to our parents a lot and they keep telling her to come back and even though I've explained to her that the key for us being safe is to minimize contact but she hasn't.

I'm running out of ways to help her but it's clear that she needs help and I don't know how to. Any suggestions is welcome.

"My [27F] friend [20F] ruined my hair! How do I gracefully handle this?


My friend of about one year is in beauty school right now. A good beauty school with a good reputation for turning out competent upscale salon quality stylists.

Said friend will not be one of those stylists, judging by what she did to me.

She told me she needed a hair model this week for class. I ~~have~~ had beautiful red hair down to the small of my back. I assumed this was why she wanted me to be her hair model. What I learned is that ""hair model"" basically means ""living mannequin"", not so much model.

She asked what she could do to my hair. I told her *exactly* what my usual stylist does, in technical and layperson terminology. She indicated that she understood me and would be doing the same thing, given, on a student level. The entire process should take approximately four hours, but would be free due to it being ""model week"". Okay, fair enough, I'm due to have my hair done anyways.

To save you all the excruciating read it would be, here's a list of what went wrong:

* colored my hair the wrong color. a completely different color than the swatch she showed me.

* cut off 6"" instead of the agreed upon 2"" and did so on a large enough section that the rest of my head had to be made to match.

* charged me $10 for the color, when I had been told it would be free. okay, $10 is NBD, but still.

At this point, we take a break for lunch. I was expecting to be done by this point in time. She says she just has ""a little bit more"" to do and then we will be done, but ""don't worry, I'm really quick at this part"". I didn't bring a lunch because I expected to be done, and buying a lunch out at a restaurant is not in my budget. She does not offer a lunch, nor does she skip hers to get this done faster. I stress to her the importance of finishing quickly as I have lots of stuff to still to that day and have to get back to my dog to take him outside. This was at 12:30pm. We then go back for ""a quick"" round 2.

* she highlights my hair far too many shades lighter than looks natural, and uses BLEACH to do so. I didn't consent to using bleach on my hair, I consented to using the natural coloring stuff the salon is known for.

* she chooses the longest method of applying highlights, knowing full well it is the most time consuming *and* knowing full well I needed to get out of there.

* she uses another product I told her *not* to use on my hair, as it would take an additional 7 minutes. Lied and said it was something else.

* Shampooed my hair FIVE times after highlights, because she ""used the wrong shampoo"" the first two times. Sprays water down my back, soaking my shirt, twice. Leaves me in the wash stall for 10 minutes without so much of a word as to where she's going. Then comes back and says ""I just had to ask my teacher something"". Teacher confesses that friend ran out of wash stall to cry that the color didn't turn out properly.

* Attempts to do ""long layers"" for the styling. Winds up cutting another 3-4"" off of my hair. I explicitly told her I wanted to keep enough length to put into a decent ponytail and bun. Now, I look like a Hanson brother according to my BF. She started tearing up and crying a little so I didn't feel like I could even begin to express how angry and sad I was about it.

* Dumps oil all over my head, then puts dry shampoo on to try to fix it, leaving me looking like a wet mop with baby powder.

Oh yeah, did I mention? This ""it'll be really quick!"" took SEVEN *more* hours. Every time I said anything about the time constraint or about how long it was taking, she'd complain about her feet or about how she was tired or hungry.


Suffice to say, I am furious and I am sad. My once beautiful long red hair now looks like a Barbie got attacked by a 4-year-old with scissors. Being a redhead and my gingerness was part of my identity, and having long flowing hair was one of the few things about my body that I actually liked. I should never have let her near it. I was trying to be a good friend and help her out. She destroyed my hair in return. It's not like I can go get it fixed by a professional because a) the length is already gone, b) I don't have the money for that, and c) I still see this friend every few weeks and she will be heartbroken if I change the hack job she did to me.

I hate my hair now.

How he felt betrayed, I don't know. Things were ok for a week or two. We ended up having another argument at a tough time where I really needed him to be there for me. He told me that 'no one had ever treated him so disrespectfully before...none of his other girlfriends especially.' It was like I snapped in an instant.


I thought, what the fuck was I doing in this situation? He wasn't supportive. He made nice plans but they were always last minute. I was trapped in an emotional prison where I wasn't able to express how I felt about anything without meeting his wrath...no matter how I expressed it. He was stingy. He'd spend thousands of dollars on himself on a whim but if I wanted to do something I always had to pay for us. Or if he did something nice for us it was always on the super cheap. And I mean super cheap. Like making me a candlelight dinner of the leftovers in his pantry/fridge. He wasn't that way when he had friends come into town, we'd be painting the town red at those times and he would be paying for all of it. I realized that I was doing all of the work.


So that night when we had that fight, I packed up my shit, gave him his key back, and walked out.


I am still in therapy and am currently working out why I would put so much effort into a relationship with someone who could barely be bothered with me. Painful stuff but I know I will come out stronger, more aware and better for it.






   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend was an ass. Spent a lot of time being his emotional caretaker while stifling my emotions because of his unreasonable anger. Talked to Reddit about it (thank you!) and ditched that jerk!"

"UPDATE: Me [27F] with my fiance [28 M] of 2 years (together 6 total) - he inherited a lot of money and we disagree about splitting household contributions.


[Previous post here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tnr0p/me_27f_with_my_fiance_28_m_of_2_years_together_6/)

So this is a fairly quick update, since it apparently just takes one good conversation to resolve something. 

I came home from a particularly busy day at work, the first of many for the next couple weeks. Fiance was in the living room working on his bike and there were a decent amount of dishes in the sink and a couple pans on the stove. I collapsed onto the couch and he came over to rub my feet while I told him about my day, which sort of naturally sparked the conversation that I knew we'd need to have but hadn't planned on having just yet. 

**Me:** Blah blah blah, work stuff.

**Him:** I'm sorry that work is stressful right now. Is there anything that I can do to help?

**Me:** Actually yeah. I miss you all day, and I love coming home to you because evening time has always been our time together, and I love that. But when you are home all day and you don't spend much time cleaning up after yourself, then I get home and have to cut into our time together while I tidy things up. 

**Him:** Yeah...

**Me:** I don't mind cleaning the house, but I don't think it's fair that I'm responsible for cleaning up a house that looks nothing like it did when I left it. It would be really helpful for me if you could have things cleaned up from your projects and the kitchen cleaned up from your meals before I get home, so that we can focus on each other. 

**Him:** Oh, yeah, I can take care of that. 

**Me:** I wouldn't even mind you leaving stuff out if you had a space away from the main living areas to work on things. Maybe your office or the garage or back yard?

**Him:** Yeah, I think that might make things easier on both of us, since I don't like putting everything away when I am in the middle of working on something. 

**Me:** Yeah, that's fair. I get that. 

**Him:** I'm actually not even sure if this will be an issue much longer. (Acquaintance of ours) told me that (local company) will be looking for a (his job title) and I have been planning to apply when the position becomes available. 

**Me:** Oh? That's great. 

**Him:** Yeah, I miss it sometimes. I saw a few other listings that interest me but I've been dragging my feet on them. 

**Me:** I didn't realize you were looking. I think that's great.

**Him:** Oh yeah? Well maybe I'll work on that tomorrow. 

Not verbatim, obviously, but that's along the lines of how the conversation went. I got to tell him how I was feeling and he was just as accommodating as I should've expected him to be. I think in my stress and frustration I worked the situation up in my head to be more dire than it was, and I think some miscommunication might've played a part. We'll see how he does picking up after himself moving forward and hopefully he'll get back into work soon and alleviate the issue altogether. 

Thank you so much for your advice from before, those of you who provided some. Sorry to that one person who really wanted me to call off the wedding - the date is still saved, but I'll PM you for sure when we get the ball rolling on that divorce I was promised. 

Td;dr: We talked, things are better. Thanks, reddit. "
"Me [38M] and my wife [36F], married 15 years. Things have been horrible for a long time, I've been trying to get her to help me fix things and go to counselling, she refused. When I presented her with divorce papers, she now wants to start working on things and go to counselling. I'm lost.


My wife and I have been married 15 years.  We have four kids, aged 13, 10, 8, and 5.

The past few years things have been progressively getting worse and worse.  There was a lot more tension between us, we were fighting a lot and a lot.  She would often get angry at the smallest thing, if I was late in doing something, or if something was not perfectly clean like she wanted it to be or done on the exact time, she would throw a fit and explode.  It was always directed to me, small things she would get very very angry and it was making it unbearable.  Whenever I tried to talk to her about it when she was calm, I'd try to explain to her she had anger issues and emotional issues, that she was always getting angry and overreacting to simple things, she would just get angrier and shout at me.  It was horrible.

Her relationship with my parents became absolutely atrocious to the point of the detesting each other.  Every time there was a conflict between me and her, my parents would take my side and defend me, to the point of her hating them.  I reached the point where whenever she would have one of her anger outbursts, I would just leave the house and go to my parents house until she had cooled down.

I found myself more often than not looking for reasons to avoid her.  I'd stay after hours at work, just go for drives, I'd dread coming back home cause I couldn't think of what reason she'd be angry at me today.  Every time I tried to approach the issue, she always made it out to be completely my fault and refused to acknowledge she had an anger problem.  She would always blame me, saying it was my fault, I didn't listen to her, I'm pathetic and useless, that my parents turned me against her and they are the bad ones.

The things she would get angry over are really little things.  I'm home late from work.  Dishes aren't done on time.  I bought the wrong grocery by mistake.  Something I was cleaning isn't perfectly clean to her satisfaction.

I tried telling her many times we should go to therapy and couples counselling, she would always turn it on me and say ""so you think I'm the problem? Its entirely your fault"".  I got sick of always apologising to her for things I didn't do and I said, fuck it, I'm never apologising to you for anything.

The sex life was non-existent, we'd been in a dead bedroom situation for about a year or more, only making love on anniversaries, valentines day, birthdays, special occasions.  Probably less than ten times a year all together, it was horrible.  If I tried to bring it up or ask for it, she'd treat me like I'm some horny animal for even asking, always always come up with excuses.  It was always usually ""I'm too tired"", implying that I myself wasn't tired after the whole day at work.  Even when she'd done barely anything, it was still ""I'm too tired.""  I began to really resent her, she wouldn't even do this one thing for me, she had no consideration for me at all, besides the fact she was constantly berating me.

It reached a head one day after she had spent hours just ranting and ranting at me while I was sitting on the couch trying to watch tv, I just stood up and shouted at the top of my voice ""ENOUGH. SHUT THE FUCK UP.""  I lost my cool and shouted at her on the top of my lungs in front of the kids.  She instantly started crying and making herself out to be the victim, she went upstairs calling her friends and family telling them what a horrible husband I was, she wouldn't even talk to me or try to talk things out.

At that point I knew our marriage is dead.  She is a horrible person who has no love or respect for me at all, does not even want to give me the basics of communication.  I contacted a lawyer and was in contact with him for quite some while before I presented to her the divorce papers.

At first she didn't believe me, she got angry and started yelling and ranted, like ""YOU divorce ME? YOU'RE the one with the problem, not me.""  After it set in, she started crying and trying to reason.  She was apologising for what a horrible person she'd been, telling me she loved me, she wants to work on our marriage.  Its the first time I've seen her apologise or express regret for anything in years.  I've asked way too many times for her to work on our marriage, she always refused, but now she wants to.

I really don't know what to do? Should I accept her apology and agree to go to counselling? I wasn't expecting this from her at the last minute to be honest. I thought she'd just accept the divorce.  Is this just an act of desperation on her part or does she truly want to change her behaviour and change the fundamentals of our marriage and how she's been treating me?  Should I accept and give this one chance, or should I just refuse and press ahead with the divorce?


   
**tl;dr**: Marriage reached absolute breaking point after years of wife treating me badly and refusing counselling.  After I finally presented her with divorce papers, now she is suddenly apologetic and wants counselling.  I don't know what to do."
"My [33 F] husband [33 M] of 10 years freaked out when I revealed my pregnancy, suggested that an abortion was a ""good option"" for us and confessed that my body disgusted him all within one week. Am I justified in wanting a divorce?


It's so easy to doubt myself right now ""because hormones,"" but I really feel like this might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

My husband and I have been together since we were 16. High school sweethearts, teenaged parents, high school dropout (him), the works. We have overcome a lot to get to a place where we are financially stable, so we have recently been focused on ironing out the wrinkles in our marriage. We have been to counseling, spent a lot of ""us"" time, tried talking through our issues and concerns, but I think I'm done. His issues have always centered around his insecurities. They keep him from putting anyone's feelings before his own. Case in point, when I revealed my latest pregnancy. 

I knew that this wasn't exactly good news, so I prepped him by asking him to ""please be kind."" That didn't really help. He proceeded to insinuate that I got pregnant on purpose and that ""we have options."" He knows that an abortion isn't an option for me, so that made me feel alienated and incredibly alone. Over the next few days, he kept ""jokingly"" bringing abortion back up which drove me further away. Things came to a head one night when he confessed that my post-baby body disgusted him ""sometimes.""

This whole situation has made me realize that my feelings have never come first. I'm always supporting him and boosting his ego, while he promises to try harder *next* time. At this point I feel like I've built a marriage on IOU's. We argue, I cry, he promises to do better, but never really does. I feel like I've been married to the man I want him to be instead of the man that he is. 

So there are reasons I've stayed with him this far of course:
He's a good provider, bright future, we have two boys together, I'm not currently working and we live thousands of miles away from our respective families. It's hard for me to say that I love him right now, but I know that is true. He says he doesn't want a divorce, but this morning our browser was open on a ""spousal support estimator"" website for the state of California. He says he wants to fix things, but his actions show otherwise. 

So here I am - pregnant, jobless, emotionally bruised and full of doubt. A beggar that is wondering if she can be a chooser. 

Is this as good as marriages gets? Given my precarious situation, should I just keep pretending that I believe that his emotional IOU's are worth anything? Should I lower my expectation that my husband should care about my feelings?
   
**tl;dr**: My husband was an insensitive jerk during a time when I really needed him to put my emotions first. This is the latest in a long series of infractions and I feel like giving up on our marriage. Am I being unreasonable/ungrateful? Is this the most I can hope to get out of a marriage?

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice and support. It helps knowing that I'm not being crazy or unreasonable. I need to organize my thoughts before he gets home, but thanks to a lot of your comments I feel empowered to stand up for myself. "

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4syh8j/my_friendwork_colleague_23f_got_caught_as_an/

I would just like to say thank you to the people who actually gave advice and didn't just criticise one of the parties involved or get on my back about it. I'm from England, and this has developed overnight after a night out. First I would just like to clarify something.

In my original post I said that I felt she ""deserved"" what happened to her and people got on my back about it. I didn't explain it properly but my thoughts were that she has got a job she has wanted since she was a teenager and called it her dream job, that she could advance up the ladder for years to come since she was lucky enough to get it straight out of University. I think she deserved it because she should have known that if she got caught, she was gone, especially since she had her own face on the page. I don't really think she deserves to lose all her friends but they have completely different deal breakers to me, so I can understand their stance regarding it.

I went out to a bar with some friends, I had spoken to Joanne earlier and she seemed upset, so I felt like I would get to the bottom of why the hostility towards her. The main reasons given by the group were:

* Joanne had a very good job that she has wanted for years, and she has thrown it away for either sexual fantasies, greed or both. They say this wasn't really a big deal but it was a factor.

* That they wouldn't care if she was just a dominatrix as they have done stuff like that in the past with their boyfriends (not being actual paid dominatrixes). It is the fact that her instagram page was encouraging people to bankrupt themselves for her and encouraging married men to make her their priority over their wives/kids from what she titled her photos/videos.

* They wouldn't speak to her if she was cheating with a married guy and could understand if she didn't know that they were married, but actively seeking them out as her primary clients they thought was disgusting, even if she was just playing a role.
So yeah admittedly I don't know much about what financial domination is but apparently they are decided and there's nothing I can do about that. Their minds, their lives.

The problem this morning was Joanne phoned me after she saw a tagged photo of me on facebook from the night out the night before. She asked me if I managed to sort it out with our friends, I told her no they have decided, and straight up told her I won't be involving myself with her job as it was her mistake that cost her and I don't want to damage my professional life over it. She went on a rant about how much of a ""pathetic cunt"" I am, and how nobody really likes me, they just pity me. I hung up, and proceeded to block her on everything without even reacting to her. I was one of the only people who hadn't ditched her, but I'm not going to get treated like crap just because she isn't getting her own way.

tl;dr: Went out with friends, they explained in detail why they didn't want to speak to her. I accepted their reasonings and left it. Joanne phoned me this morning and started berating me so I've blocked her from everything she could talk to me on now. I have no plans on talking to her again anytime soon."

"I (M/30) gave my girlfriend (F/26) a birthday present two months ago. I found it unopened in a drawer in her room.


My GF and I have been together for 2 years now. Her birthday was in May and due to a business trip, I could not be with her on her birthday. She totally understood (or so I thought) and while she was a little sad, she knew I'd be thinking of her. 

I felt so bad for missing her special day that I got her something really nice to make up for it. Not only did I buy her a necklace that she's been eyeing every time we walk by the store (not a cheap one, either - think of one of the more expensive jewelry places around) I made her a kind of care package out of the box. I put in the necklace, her favorite candy, a stuffed bear from the city I was in (she collects them), and a handwritten card. I sent the package as soon as I got to the city to make sure it would be there before her birthday so she could open it. 

I let her know the package was coming, and she seemed really excited. When I called her on her birthday, she seemed happy and I didn't suspect anything was wrong. Now that I think back, she didn't mention anything in the box specifically, but I didn't notice it at the time. I was just happy she was happy. She always goes all out for my birthdays (surprise parties, big gifts, you name it). So I hoped I'd done something special for her. 

I started to notice that she never wore the necklace. I asked her about it a few times and she mentioned she was getting it cleaned, getting a shorter chain, etc, etc. I stopped bringing it up. I was at her place last night and she asked me to look for something in her room. While I was looking, I found my package to her sitting in the back of a drawer, unopened. I know it was my package, because I drew inside jokes of ours on the outside of the box. It was sealed.

I confronted her about it, but she assured me she just reused the box for other things. When I asked why she sealed it, where the necklace/bear/card is, she brushed off my questions. I asked if I could see the box, but she said she had ""private"" things in there.

I'm absolutely baffled. I'm 100% sure she never opened my package. I have no idea why. It's not even about the money of the gift, I feel really hurt that I went through so much trouble to do something nice for her and she ignored my present. I can't even think of one reason why she didn't open it. She wasn't mad at me for the business trip, or if she was, she never showed it. She's never done anything like this before. She's never even lied to me. 

What's going on here? Is she telling the truth? 

   
**tl;dr**: Sent my GF a birthday box two months ago, found the box unopened in her room. She assured me she was reusing it, but won't let me see the box 

EDIT: woah I fell asleep and now there's a lot of comments...thanks guys! I'll try to respond now. "

[original post](https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbfu2/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_24_f_5_years_she/)

I'm back and here with some good news.
_____________________________________________________________________________

I'm going to start off by saying i was being an ass, a big gaping ass but i fixed the problem. For a few days after my post my girlfriend was ignoring me which is understandable, i decided to surprise her with something special.

but before that i had to deal with the whole Rose issue, because i didn't want it to ruin my relationship. i asked to meet and we did at a local coffee and she was more friendly than usual.

i told her that i don't want to continue this friendship and that it's become inappropriate. i told her i have a baby on the way and my girlfriend needs me right now.

she stopped me and told me to let her say what she nedded to and i can decide when she's done(decide?). she said she felt a connection between us unlike anything she ever felt before.

she said she knows i have a girlfriend but she feels like me and her would be a better fit. i told her no and that none of that would happen and that i came here to end this ""friendship"" before feelings got involved.

she started crying and told me i was breaking her heart (this was getting awkward) and to please not do this. i just told her not to contact me and walked away.

last i heard anything about her she requested a transfer to a different department. 

_____________________________________________________________________________

i told my girlfriend i ended the friendship and that she won't be a problem anymore. my girlfriend hugged me and smiled and thanked me for listening to her.

i apologized because i acted like an ass and she didn't deserve that at all so everything was good. the next day i took her out to dinner and we ate and spent some time together.

when we got home i proposed, she was very excited and we hugged for probably and hour. so now we are engaged and she's really happy right now, so happy that she immediately called her sisters to tell them.

but that's what happened these past few days and i feel better about all of this. and i will never do anything like this again.


   
**tl;dr**: i fixed the problem and stopped being friends with Rose she revealed she had feelings for me and wanted me to leave my girlfriend for her. i ended the friendship and proposed to my girlfriend."
"My [19F] manager [25M] had unlocked my phone and was recording a private video of me and my partner onto his own phone, and I caught him


Apologies for any formatting issues as I am on my phone. I'm also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I didn't know where else to go.

I work in a retail store with different departments. This involved the manager of my specific department.

Today, he suggested that he, I and the other colleague working our department go and help out on another department, since we were finished for the time being, and the other department was short staffed. This was nothing new, and happens a lot. We all went down there and worked together for a bit. He disappears; I assume he's just been called elsewhere, and think nothing of it. 

I had left my phone to charge in the office, which I haven't done before today. I was running very low though and needed it to last. I did hide it, but I understand it was stupid of me to leave it like that.

I finish what I'm doing before I'm due back, but I head back anyway. I go into the office to check my phone and find my manager with my phone in one hand, his phone in the other. I had approached close enough as he noticed me to see that he had his video recorder running on his phone, but he had managed to close my phone. His hands were shaking violently. For clarification, I didn't know that he knew my password.

I asked why he was on my phone and what the hell he was doing. He claimed he was just taking a picture of my Pokemon on Pokemon GO to send to a friend on snapchat. I then asked why would unlock my phone just for that, why didn't he ask, and why were his hands shaking? He says they aren't shaking, but they are, and really violently.

I unlocked my phone and he had closed the app so it was on the home screen. So I looked at my open apps list, and there, open, was an extremely private video of me and my partner (I don't wish to elaborate, but I hope you can fill in the gaps :/). He had been recording this private video to his own phone. 

I freaked out and ran off to the staff area and to the toilets. By this point I was crying hysterically and a manager of another department had seen me run in there. She came to ask if I was okay, what was wrong, I said at the time I couldn't say. She said that was fine, and to go home if I needed to. She suggested I get a drink and some fresh air.

I went outside, and my manager was out there. He pleads with me to talk to him, that he's really sorry, trying to grab me etc etc. I told him to leave me alone and do not touch/talk to me, and walked outside the car park as far as I could without leaving the site. He thankfully didn't follow me. I called my friend to pick me up, went back inside to collect my stuff and left. 

I called my boyfriend as soon as he got off work and he urged me to call the store manager and report him. My friend is saying to do this too. 

I'm worried about reporting him because I feel like it will destroy my friendships with other colleagues who are also good friends with him, and I don't want to do that, but I also know that I can't go back to work with him anymore. It feels like a lose-lose for me. I like my job, besides what happened today, and I don't want to lose it, but I feel like if I don't leave and report him, I'll be driven out. 

I'm sorry this is all so jumbled but my head is a mess. I'm so worried and mortified and upset. He had texted me apologising saying he'd deleted the video he took, but how do I know this? What if he took more than one video? What if he distributes this? That's not only damaging to me, but my poor partner too. What if I let him get away with it, and he ends up doing it to someone else? I can't trust him. I don't know what to do. I feel so violated. 

My boyfriend is going as far to suggest police. I don't want to do that. But I have to do something. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to go about this? Again, I'm sorry for how jumbled and ridiculous my words may sound but I can't think straight. 

Thank you all

Tl;dr: my manager recorded an extremely private video of myself and my partner from my phone. My partner is pushing to me to report but I'm worried about consequences. Going as far as to suggest police. Desperately seeking advice on what steps to take next. 

Edit; hello everyone, I just woke up and it's the next day. I want to sincerely thank every one of you who commented and gave advice, I am eternally grateful. I have to go to work in about an hour and I am going straight to the store manager and/or HR and reporting this once I get there. Many of you are suggesting I go straight to the police as well and I am strongly considering it, as people have said he may still have traces of the video that I definitely want destroyed. I need to speak to my boyfriend first though because I'm scared of dealing with the police on my own. So far I'm definitely going to be seeing a manager though. I will post an edit at the end of it. Again, my deepest gratitude. I will try to respond to comments when I get some time. You guys are fantastic. Thank you"
"[Update]Our neighbor [50's-M] keeps complaining about music from our [20's] apartment. We live in artist's lofts, management took his side.


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nz28u/our_neighbor_50sm_keeps_complaining_about_music/)

So my husband and I went on a few week vacation, so our neighbor was out of our minds for a bit. We got back about a week ago and it has been living hell. He bangs on the shared wall at least a few times a day (much of the time when I'm just sitting in silence working on my computer, other times when we are watching tv or making dinner). We hung 3 pictures one afternoon (7 nails total into the wall, only two on the neighbor's wall), and he called the police on us. I went to talk to him to warn him that we would be hanging a few more paintings the next day, and he got irate with me. He threatened me and my husband, and he told us that we disturb the whole building with our noise, and that the woman above us is constantly pounding on her floor too. We know the woman above us, and have never heard pounding from her.

We haven't gotten any more complaints about my husband playing piano, but it has also been too hot for the neighbor to open his window, and I think those are correlated. We padded between the keyboard and the wall, and our neighbor on the other side said that she can't hear anything. 

I'm completely at a loss. This man has made our wonderful new apartment miserable, and I do not know what to do. I alerted management that he threatened us and that I am afraid to interact with him in the future (he was foaming at the mouth mad) and that I would be contacting the police if he threatened us again, but what else can we do? Management is not responding. 

TL;DR Shitty neighbor got shittier, thinks we are making noise when we aren't, threatened me. 

Edit to add to the DM's telling me I'm a horrible neighbor. The guy who lived in the unit before us was a woodworker and did carpentry projects in his apartment (with no complaints from the neighbor). I've never run power tools in the apt, so I could be worse, though I do understand how annoying typing is to someone in another room. "
"Me [32F] with my Mom[66F]. My born again christian mom is writing a book...I am NOT ok with this.


Ok..so the title doesn't even come close to summing up the issue I'm having with my mother at the moment. I apologize in advance if this becomes a wall of text. 

My parents divorced when I was really young and I lived predominantly with my mother (visitation with my dad every other weekend and 1-2 days during the week he would pick me up from school and we would have dinner). My mom was a ""functioning alcoholic"" but somehow always managed to keep custody of me. 

I suffered a lot at the hands of my mother. I was abused by her boyfriend, she had random people coming and going (only as an adult do I realize they were there to party i.e. drugs...which I had zero clue about). There were times I would have to call my dad to come get me, because I couldn't wake my mom up and I was hungry. To this day, I have no idea why I wasn't taken out of that house sooner...I suspect its because my mom was great at putting on a good face, smoothing things over, and had a killer lawyer. 

In 5th grade, I went to my dads for a weekend visit...and never wound up going home. My mom called him claiming she was ""sick"" and could he keep me for a while...like I was a pet he was pet sitting. My dad, of course, said yes and he took me to her house to get some of my clothes (I literally had the overnight bag I packed and that was it). He wanted to go inside first, and when he came out, he told me not to come in...that he would be out shortly. It was only years later that he told me she was in there, high on heroin, and that he didn't want me to see her like that. 

I spent that summer with my dad assuming I would go back to my moms when school started, but that never happened. I started the year at my dads...and on my birthday (end of September), she called me AT MY SCHOOL to wish me a happy birthday, claiming that the house was being fumigated and it would be ""just a little while longer"" until I came home. I never did. 

I actually never saw my mother again until my junior year of high school. She had quite literally disappeared. For those 6 years, no one knew if she was alive or dead..she lost her house, all of her possessions (some of which were antiques from her parents). I found out later she had pretty much pawned everything of value, and then everything else (including all of my things), were sold at auction or thrown out. My uncle went so far as to hire a private investigator to find her, with no luck. FINALLY, in 199 (my sophomore year), my cousin happened to be watching the news and they were doing a story on a building that was being torn down, and they were interviewing a homeless couple that lived in the building. Wouldn't you know...there was my mother. He called his mom (my aunt) and she called my dad, and my dad called my uncle, who called the PI (yeah...you following this so far??) and he got a copy of the news segment. 

There she was...drugs had completely ruined her, she was strung out, dirty, disheveled, and talking about how she was upset they were going to tear the building down because she lived there and that they had sex in the building. I shit you not. I realized there and then that the worry I had about her had been replaced with absolute anger. I hated her, I wanted her to know how much I hated her, so in my junior year when my aunt called me letting me know that my mother had reached out to her and wanted to see me, I jumped at the chance. 

I met with my mother (and my parents...my dad and my step mom) in the food court of the local mall. She was working at burger king and had just finished her shift. She started to cry, and told me she had ""made a list of all the things she had done wrong to me"" such as: not swimming with me when I asked, not taking my friend with us on a spring break trip, not buying me the tv I wanted.... nowhere in there were things like ""allowing random people to sleep in my bed"" or ""allowing her boyfriend to mollest me"" or the BIGGEST one (in my mind) ""selling custody of me to my dad for $1500"". I honestly didn't even read the rest of the list because it didn't matter...she clearly didn't realize what she had done to me, and I had zero interest in even telling her how much she hurt me... I just walked away. 

She wound up getting clean, finding Jesus, and rebuilt her life pretty well. She got a job as a behavioral health counselor (she got her bachelors years before she had me), and got a little apartment. I reached out to her, after hearing how well she was doing, when I was pregnant with my first son. I realize I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and wanted some type of closure. That contact sort of opened the door for a very fragile and tenuous relationship...but I tried. I figured if not for my sake, then for my sons. 

Our relationship has been up and down...I have very little patience for her and clearly harbor a lot of resentment, but I put it aside for my kids. She has been an amazing grandma, and she has stayed clean. I told her if she ever takes another sip of alcohol, I will take my kids and she will never see them again. Thats the level of tolerance I have for her. None. A lot of people have asked how I can put all of it behind me and forgive her...and truthfully, I don't know that I will ever forgive her fully...but it was such a long time ago, that it almost feels like it was someone elses life...so that helps. 

Fast forward to today, I get a call from my mother that she was written a book and that she wants to publish it! How exciting right?! Except for its a book that details EVERYTHING from my child hood. I asked her why she wouldn't tell me she was writing a book (because let's be honest, it takes a while to write a freaking book) and her response was that ""she didn't think it would bother me"". 

There are only a handful of people that know about what I went through as a kid...and those people know because I told them. I understand that she wanted to write a book because she thought it would help people, but she never took my thoughts into consideration once. She didn't even use a pseudonym...and we share the same last name. If this book gets published, and becomes widely publicized, people will know that its my mom and that its me in the book. 

I'm so angry at her for this... and I feel like I have a right to be. Or not? I guess thats why I'm here. Am I wrong to feel betrayed by this? Should she have asked me before writing it? She wont even let me read a copy of the book before its published, and that scares me. I really don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated. 
   
**tl;dr**: My mom did a lot of terrible things in my childhood, found Jesus, and is now writing a book. "
"My wife [29F] of 4 years is mad at me after I [32M] said I would save her before our son [1 month] if I had to make a choice.


I guess this is a stupid problem to have, but in a way it's not my fault. My wife was the one who came up with the hypothetical, although I don't know why. She's never been one to play these sorts of games. 

I don't think there's any way I could have known what way I should answer so I answered honestly. However, I did emphasize that I would never want to choose and would do everything to avoid a situation where I have to save either of them because I do love them both very much, but I love my wife more. In time my answer may change, but that is how I feel now. 

But my wife doesn't see it that way. She is pretty upset with me, and nothing I have tried so far has worked. I've explained myself and tried to reassure her that I love our son, but she's convinced that I don't really love him and am only saying it to make her happy. I don't know what else to try to change her mind. I've thought about taking it back completely, but I don't know if she would believe me or if that would even make things better. We are new parents, so should I just shut my mouth and leave it alone for the time being? I haven't apologized because I don't think I did anything wrong, and I would prefer not to start apologizing for situations that aren't my fault. 



   
**tl;dr**: After my wife asked if I would save her or our baby in a life-or-death situation, I chose her. She's mad at me because she thinks I don't love our son. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it. Is there something else I can try, or should I just give her time?"

"My husband [45M] gave his mother [72F] items that be built for me [40F] last year as a gift, then lied about it.


My husband and I have been married for 16 years. He rarely gives me gifts, but despite this fact he built me five beautiful planter boxes last year. He is not the kind of person who regularly builds things, so this particular gift was special to me; it meant a lot that he put the time and effort into creating something just for me. They turned out really nice, though I hadn’t planted anything in them yet, as we have been in a severe drought.

I was working in the garage yesterday and realized that I hadn’t seen my planter boxes in a while. I asked my husband if he knew where they were, and he told me they were out in the yard. Something about the way he answered made me suspicious and I asked him to show me… he hesitated, and then admitted that he’d given them all to his mother when she was visiting last month.

I was absolutely crushed by the fact that he would give my planters away to his mother without asking me (and he knew I would never agree, as his mother is always trying to get our stuff when she visits). He’s an only child and cannot tell his mother “no”.  I feel so hurt and betrayed; I was unable to hold back my tears last night (and I don’t often cry), but instead of apologizing or offering comfort, he said something along the lines of “I don’t even care if you are upset”. I’m hurt that he gave my stuff away, but more hurt that he doesn’t care how he made me feel. The worst part is that now he’s acting as if I am in the wrong by being upset about him giving my things away to his mother.

He told me he’d get them back from her “next time she visits” but she only comes once or twice a year and she was just here last month. I don’t feel like I should I have to wait for him to remedy his error and am inclined to tell him that I expect him to drive up there and get them from her this weekend since he gave them away, lied to me about it and now is acting like I was in the wrong for being upset.  Would asking him to go get them be an unreasonable request given the circumstances?

tl;dr Without my knowledge or permission, my husband gave special items that he built for me to his mother. He refuses to apologize or acknowledge wrongdoing. I want him to drive 6 hours to her house to get my property back.

"[UPDATE] Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 5 years, she told me she likes someone else but wants the option to come back if things don't work


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jo5hj/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_5_years_she/)

Ok, guys. Finally I have an update.
First of all, thank you again for the support.

After the original post, I was afraid of losing her.
I gave her that ultimatum but then I tried with all my efforts to be romantic and sweet and tried to make her love me again.

While doing my best she went on with her requests.
She said she wanted to tell Victor what were her feelings for him and admitted the reason was to find out if he was in love with her too. (But she admitted only after I ""disclosed"" this reason to her)

After a while, my efforts gave some results.
She started saying that she was again in love with me, that she really liked how much I was romantic etccc. and started trying to minimize what she originally told me. (Victor is not the problem, I've always loved you etc .... )

That's when I finally realised how she was treating me!
The fear of losing her was gone and I started thinking how selfish were her requests and how I could not trust her anymore.

We went on with our relationship for a while but my feeling were drastically changed. I started feeling inadequate when I was with her due to my trust issue.

So 2 days ago I asked her out to finally end this relationship.
We met and she went on saying that she was sad, that she loved me but that I took her for granted too many times and that she wanted that pause to find out if I was the right one.

The fact that she wanted a pause was in her opinion a ""great act of love"" and she told me that after that period, if she have decided to come back, it would've been FOREVER !

I told her that she did not know what she was talking about and asked if she had considered the option of me not wanting her back after the pause : she said NO.
(Speaking about taking people for granted ?!?)

So I broke up with her. She was in tears and when I was ready to leave she started saying things like ""can we met tomorrow?"" ""please, after the finals at least"".

Well, I think this is the end.
I'm feeling pretty well I think.
I miss her a bit but I think it's normal.

Thank you again for the support.
And if you are o will be in my situation, trust me, end it as soon as possible.
Don't do the same mistakes I made.

TL;DR : At first I tried to make her love me again. Then I realised how selfish she has been. We broke up and she probably does not know what she has done.

"My [19M] sister [14F] told me that she has an embarrassing problem that our parents haven't done anything for. I took her to see a doctor and parents are upset.


So last week my sister called me and asked me to come over when our parents aren't home and she has something important to tell me. I went there and she told me that it's embarrassing but basically when she goes to toilet to have number 2 it's very painful. I asked if she's talked to our parents and she said they don't believe her. She asked me to take her to the doctor. So I booked an appointment for her and took her this Monday. Luckily her issue is not as serious as it is painful and hopefully she'll be fine soon.

So somehow our parents learned and are upset that I took her to the doctor without their permission. They say this is me interfering with their parenting. That I'm old enough to make decisions for myself but not to make them for my sister. I really think this is dumb. I mean she's 14 so she can technically go to the doctor herself. She just asked me to drive her there and be there because she was a little afraid. I also think it's stupid for whatever reason to not take her to the doctor when she's not feeling well. Parents say she has a history of calling in sick for no reason and that's why they didn't believe her.

So right now she's grounded for going behind their back by involving me and I'm also banned from seeing her for a while because I went behind our parents back by taking her to the doctor without their permission. They expect me to apologize and promise that this won't happen again but really I in good conscience can't do that because if she asks me again to take her to the doctor I will. But I think they're just going to be mad at me and will ban me until I somehow tell them that I was wrong by doing that.

How I can handle it?
   
**tl;dr**: I took my sister to the doctor because our parents refused to, and they're now mad at me that I did and they expect me to apologie and promise that I'll never do it again."
"I (18f) Started my first job, boss (50s) commented about my outfit twice? Not sure where to go from here?


Hi relationships!!! Title is supposed to say (50sF) my boss is female. 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to go looking for advice but I'm at a loss!

I recently started my first real job, (I've babysat, done other small jobs in the past) working as a student assistant secretary in the HR department of my college. 
I started about 1 month ago.
The lady who I'll call my boss, isn't technically my boss, but the secretary I help and work for. Along with another secretary, who has never mentioned anything and has been nothing but nice. 
My boss technically is her boss as well, as she is only the secretary. But her boss is the one that hired me.
My boss/colleagues never mentioned a dress code, so I assumed I should dress nicely, dresses, sweaters, etc.

The 2nd week in I wore a dress that came a little bit below my knees, with a sweater over it and low heels. 
When my boss and I were alone, she told me, ""it's a nice dress and all but it's a little short."" I didn't think it was that short, but I guess it looked short because I was wearing heels. I told her I was sorry and went to buy clothes that weekend that were more appropriate, and were wearable during summer because it gets freaking hot. 

Being my first professional office job and all, I bought some dresses and long sweaters as well as nice shoes. Everything was fine, nothing else was ever said. 

Fast forward to today,  I'm wearing a dress that comes way below my knees, a sweater that covers my shoulders and sandals.

I've worn this outfit multiple times before and she hasn't commented. 

I had left to run an errand and I had come back in and pulled my top up to adjust it because it slipped down to right above my cleavage when I was waking back. (No boobs or cleavage was showing, it was just slightly lower than it should have been) She waited until everyone was out of the office and came over to my desk, and whispered, ""your top is a little too low, it's too reveling for the office."" Mind you, it covers my cleavage, and comes up to right below my neck and I have a sweater on. I apologized again, kind of shocked she said something. She was laughing and said ""it's okay it's just really not appropriate."" Then said ""I'm just jealous"" and laughed.

Ever since the first time she said something she seems to judge me, by looking me up and down every morning I come in. It's upsetting.

So I'm sitting here very uncomfortable wondering what I should do?

Help with outfit options for work? Am I doing something wrong? I thought everything looked okay and was appropriate. I'm confused and sort of upset I spent money on something that was work appropriate and she commented again.

Where do I go from here? 

tl;dr: Boss commented on length of my dress, I apologized, bought new clothes for work, wore something multiple times, then she commented again today."
"I (30F) like it rough. But I don't like it rough outside the bedroom and my boyfriend (25M) doesn't seem to get that and it's pissing me off.


We have been together a year.

Ok so sorry if this is TMI but I like it rough in bed. Hair pulling, spanking, choking, grabbing my face hard, even slaps in the face (not super hard).

My boyfriend is on board with this and we get into it and it's great. Lately though he's been being rough outside of the bedroom and I've asked him to stop and he is surprised and gets all hurt and offended being like ""what? I thought you like that?""

Like the other day we were watching a movie in bed just hanging out and he grabbed my pony tail and started to shove it down near his crotch and I recoiled immediately and was like ""get the fuck off me"" and he was like ""what??? I thought you liked that?"" And was really surprised and hurt. It made me feel like a piece of meat or something I don't know I really didn't like it, although I probably would have been down with it if we were already doing something sexual not just out of the blue while I'm watching the Dark Knight Rises and eating MnM's.

Then he was really quiet and hurt saying ""sorry I didn't know you'd be so upset by that"" and I tried to reassure him but I was also pretty irritated.

Another example we were kissing in public and he moved his hand up to my face and slapped me twice relatively hard. I was like ""can you not do that in public are you serious?"" And he was like ""but you like it!!"" And the people we were with look kinda weirded out and I was embarrassed. We spent another few hours with the people and didn't really talk about it again as the day moved on normally maybe I should have brought it up again.

Even just in general playing around he's super rough. I told him he doesn't know his own strength but he doesn't seem to get it. We were playing around and wrestling a bit the other day and slapped my leg so hard it was really painful and also grabbed me so tight I have a few bruises on my arm.

Should I be worried about this, is it concerning? Or are the lines too blurry for him that he genuinely doesn't get what's acceptable and what's not?

TLDR: I like it rough in the bedroom, my boyfriend seems to think I therefore find all pain pleasurable all the time and it's annoying me."
