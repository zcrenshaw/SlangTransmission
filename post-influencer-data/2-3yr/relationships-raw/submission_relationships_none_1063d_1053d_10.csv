"I [13M] am having a hard time accepting my situation. Everyone else seems to have these big families and I'm a foster kid with no family.


I've just been having a hard time understanding why. Like I was up all night and I was staring out my window. I don't understand why me. I don't understand why I have nothing. While most people at my school seem to have everything. I'm having a hard time understanding why I am where I am. I'm in a new foster home, only 2 days here so far. 

Like It just really bothers me that alot of kids seem to have families to go home too. Then like you can't even escape it watching TV. TV seems to have make it seem like everyone has this family. I don't understand like of all the people in the world, why me. I know some people have it rougher than I do. It's just I try to be a nice person in hopes of being adopted one day. 

There's these kids in my class that go on about how much they hate their parents, for things like not buying them a video game. I just have a hard time understanding why people who hate their parents, actually have parents. Then I don't. The same goes for siblings. 

I don't understand why them, who moan all the time have parents. Why do they get it and I don't. I understand life dealt me a shitty hand. God if I have to hear one more person say that I might just throw myself into traffic. It's like thanks for that captain obvious, I'm living it every single freaking day. 

I have been told a couple is looking to adopt me. I am grateful for that I have met them, but it's just I feel like a puppy in a pet store. You have these couples come in, and you just know they have options. Yet they look at you as if you're some stray to take home. I am thankful, but I feel like I have more in common with animals for adoption than I do anyone else. It's an awful feeling. 

tl;dr: I am having a hard time understanding my situation and why me "
"My [13F] dad drove drunk with my brother [12M]. My brother almost died. My Aunt and Uncle and Cousins are blaming him for mom divorcing dad


My little brother almost. My dad was unemployed at the time. My brother and I are in middle school, and my brother was staying behind at school with his friend Ashley. Ashley wanted his help with something. Ashley left with her mom and my dad was picking up my brother. My dad had been drinking all day at home. They crashed and my brother almost died from the amount of blood he lost. 

My brother survived thank god. It was probably the worst time in my family. My mom divorced my dad and got full custody of us. It was really open and shut. The judge was having none of my father and my mothers lawyer ate him alive. My mother and I left California and we moved to Arizona. My little brother is still struggling with his recovery. He just has alot of scaring and his leg is recovering. He needs to wear this brace when he walks around. 

My Aunts, Uncles and Cousins are blaming my brother. They are all my dads side of the family. They told mom and I that if he never asked to be picked up this would not have happened. It was raining, it's the only reason he asked to be picked up. I need to know what to do about them. They are still in California, but they want to come see us for Christmas. They are saying they are the only other family they have. That's true our mom is Swedish and she moved to America a little before she met my father. Our other family is in Sweden

"My [27F] husband's [28M] friend's [27F] boyfriend [2?M] told me he thinks their relationship is inappropriate. Not sure what to do about this.


My husband's friend's boyfriend (everybody got that?) told me he thinks their relationship is inappropriate.

Background: my husband ""Dave"" has been friends with ""Lily"" since college. Lily has become kind of my friend too, but she is more Dave's friend. I've never suspected anything inappropriate going on between them. They act more like squabbling siblings than anything else. 

Lily has been dating ""Mike"" for about six months now. I've met him a few times, he was okay, but very quiet. He never said much directly to me, until he sent me a facebook message telling me that he thought Lily and Dave's relationship was inappropriate. He didn't directly say he thought they were cheating, but I'm assuming he wouldn't have contacted me if he didn't think that.

The problems he had seemed kind of stupid to me. I don't know his life story, maybe he has been cheated on before, but none of the stuff he brought up seemed suspicious at all. For example, at a Halloween party, Lily got fake cobweb stuck in her hair. She tried to pick it out, but was having trouble with the back of her head. Dave was next to her, so he was able to casually reach over and grab the cobweb out. I saw the whole thing, it wasn't like he was tenderly stroking her hair, and it wasn't sexy or intimate at all. I guess she could have asked Mike for help, but Dave was standing right there and it look ten seconds.

He also had an issue with the fact that Lily didn't call him for help after she had minor surgery. I'm not even sure they were officially a couple at this time, I think I remember her telling us some time after the surgery was over. If they were a couple, it was brand new. It makes sense that you would not want a guy you have just started seeing and trying to impress in a state like that. Instead, she asked a few friends to rotate shifts staying with her until she was fully awake. She did ask Dave, but he took a turn with other people also, so its not even like she chose him above all others. I stopped by for a little because he was bored, since his only job was to look in on her every so often to make sure she wasn't dead. She was asleep most of the time, and the one time she woke up, she looked like a zombie. Nothing happened. There were a few other things, also all minor. Maybe I just have different tolerance levels than he does, but I really can't see what was wrong with any of this.

If it were anyone else, I'd tell them to stop over analyzing things and mind their own business. But *if* Lily was cheating, it is his business. I think he's massively overreacting. My problem is that on the one hand, it might be best to just reassure him that these are normal things and nothing to worry about, and avoiding getting all involved in someone else's relationship. But on the other hand, I am worried that being so upset over such innocuous things means he is not reasonable, and is a red flag. If so, I would want to tell Lily, or probably have Dave do it. Do you think I am overreacting at thinking that this is really weird? How would you suggest I try to reassure someone like this that nothing is wrong? Should I even bother talking to him?

"My[15/M] Mum's[47/F] Partner [60M] has been diagnosed with cancer and everyone is getting angry at me.


First before we start a little backstory:


My Mum cheated on my Dad about twelve years ago, the result of this was my half sister who is eleven and me being forced to live with my Mum, even thou i would much rather live with my Dad.


Currently I live with my mum and my sister, who i both dislike, its not like I'm being abused or mistreated or anything like that its just that my mum isn't a good mum, she cares for me sure but never supports me emotionally or in any work i have to do or ever helps me in general really and I'm finding it hard to cope with everything that i have on my plate. Again its not that she is a bad person its just I really don't get along with her.


Anyway My mother's partner has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and they reckon its been in his system for around 2 years. Since the diagnosis My mum has been understandably really upset along with her side of the family. Of course i would prefer it if none of this was happening and they could all be happy but that's just not how things work.


My mum has been with her partner for around 2 years and throughout that whole time I've probably spoken to him for around 15 minuets. And because i barely even know him I'm not really upset about the bad news. I'm still feel sad due to the whole situation but I wouldn't say i was upset. Since I'm not crying about it all the time or mourning over the bad news my Mum's side of the family have been treating me like some emotionless monster that doesn't care about anyone. I've tried supporting my mum but in the end they're getting angry that i'm not upset, I'm not prepared to pretend to be upset over something I'm not.


What do you guys think i could do to improve the situation?


feel free to ask more questions about the situation.


TL;DR My family is getting angry that I'm not upset over My mother's partners cancer.

Edit(My mum cheated on my dad probably before then, It when i was young I cant really remember)

Edit2 (turns out i forgot the definition for half sister, used step sister instead, whoops)

"I (27f) am a little upset that the guy (26m) I'm seeing (6 months) told me I don't have to ""sparkle"" every day.


[Edit: I was not expecting to wake up to so many responses. Please know that I appreciate each and every one of them, and you ! I sorta knew what I needed to do already, so I just did it. I texted him this morning that I want to be me and sparkle every day, and that I don't think this is a fixable issue for us. I told him we can stay pals, but being with someone is supposed to be easy and comfortable, not this prickly, ashamed feeling he gave me last night. 
Thank you so much everyone, even the people who weren't as positive. I needed that, too. 

PS: I was Elle Woods for Halloween :P]

-------

So. Long story short, I go to a really small law school on the east coast. Coming from California has proved quite the culture shock, and even though I've been here longer than a year now, I still don't really fit in. I have my core group of friends who I think will be mine forever, but everyone else at my (400 student) school I've kinda given up on. 

Anyway, this summer I started seeing a guy I thought was cute since last year. We had kinda lightly flirted all year, but didn't actually start ""dating"" till July. Since July, things seemed to be getting steadily more serious. I was sleeping there multiple nights a week, we were cooking and doing homework together, making weekend plans that actually followed through, etc. 

Anyway, last Saturday night was our school's Halloween party. He's not really a bar-scene kind of guy, so when he told me early last week he wasn't thinking about going, I made a naughty reference to me banging on his door afterwards. He told me that would be the perfect night for him. Come Saturday day, I asked him to come have dinner with my friends and I beforehand just in case he changed his mind, and even said my guy friend had a silly extra costume if he hadn't found one (it was a ducky tie and he's blonde - perfect Barney Stinson). He said no thanks, but still wanted me to come over after. Not a big deal. I told him I'd text him when I left the bar. 

10 pm rolls around and my friends and I are at the bar, he shows up with his guy friend. I go up and say hey, super excited that he's there, he is uninterested in talking to me. I shrugged it off, but my friend saw the exchange and went and asked him what's wrong. He told her he felt we were getting ""too serious"" and that his mom wouldn't like me, so he was thinking of breaking it off. 

This was all news to me, and I went home in tears. 

Sunday morning, I woke up to a bunch of texts from him saying he's so sorry, he didn't mean any of that, and he made out with some random girl, but it made him realize he DOES see me as serious and now wants there to be a real ""us.""

I ignored him till today, when I finally picked up after like the 20th time he called me and said I'd hear him out. 

He told me he's freaked out because I wear too short of skirts and it's a huge issue for him. He never thought he could be serious about me (or that his mom would like me??) because I ""present"" myself badly. 

My skirts are not that short. I worked for a marketing firm in Northern California before I moved here, and have never worn anything I would not have worn there. I have never worn anything here I wouldn't be comfortable wearing in front of my father. 

I tried to explain to him that after dying my hair darker and ""dulling my sparkle"" last year when girls went to the admin to complain that I was ""distracting"" (I'm naturally pretty strawberry blonde, I thought going brunette would help me blend in), I found that being myself made me more happy. I let the dye wear off all summer and have started dressing the way I want to again and finally feel like myself. 

In response to this, he asked me if I really have to ""sparkle"" every day. He asked if I can just stop dressing the way I dress, because he doesn't see himself dating a girl who wears short skirts. 

My skirts ARE NOT THAT SHORT. I don't know how much to emphasize this, because they're really not ! They are rarely above my knee, but I have weirdly long thighs and short calves so it's an awkward thing to balance. 

I guess I sorta just wanted to vent and also ask if anyone here has gotten over something like this? Do I just give up? I really like him.. he's smart, funny, a bomb cook, and we have a lot of fun together. But I'm not going to change the way I dress because it makes him uncomfortable. 

Is this doomed?

TL;DR: guy I'm dating (and rest of my school) doesn't like how I dress. Do I get over myself and change?"

"Me [27 F] with my SO [32 M] 1 year, overshares my personal information to ""bond""


I'm a very private person and he isn't, and likes to overshare.  His parents grew very excited about our relationship when we moved in together.  I had asked my him if his family could get to know me by spending time together and letting our relationship progress naturally.  Instead he shared all of my personal information with them (previous ex's, work history, financials) so they could get to know me better right away, and they were curious.  I expect that if I share these types of information with my partner they won't be shared that with others.  I've only met them twice, and they never would have felt comfortable asking me about those personal details, so they went to him to get the information.  We've been talking about it lots and he now says that he understands that I actually meant that I wanted him to keep those details private and he now understands that I was serious.

We've been working on things, and our relationship had improved.  This weekend I shared about my childhood and what had happened to me.  This was a very traumatic and personal issue and I had explained that I was sharing this with him so he could understand me better as his partner but I wanted to leave this in the past, and that this wasn't something to discuss or share with anyone else, including either of our families or friends.

Yesterday he was going for a half and hour drive alone with my Mom to grab my car, before he left I had asked that he not discuss with her that he knew or the details and he promised that he wouldn't bring it up.  When he came home, he explained that he has said to her ""so I got into the weeds last night about what happened to her and your family, and I just want to let you know that I'm okay with it and I won't be bringing it up, just wanted to let you know I knew about it""  

My Mom and I have an understanding that its my story to share if I wish, but considering how traumatic it was on my family and that we've now moved on past it, its not something that she would want to discuss with anyone, or have shared.  She didn't really respond to him and just explained that it was very personal and another ex had once used it against me so that he respect the sensitivity of it.  She's very upset with how he handled it.  He said he felt it would help them bond and that he could be supportive and show that he was accepting of it.  I feel like he wanted to flaunt that he knew.

I've asked him to move out last night and I'm lost.  I love him, yet for me I think this was a deal breaker.  I cannot continue to be with someone who so blatantly disrespects my wishes.  If I establish a boundary he always has to push it.  It feels like dating a child who does whatever you say not to do, just to see if they can get a reaction.  He has ADHD and I do understand that impulsivity is a part of that and something he struggles with.  I don't believe I couldn't have been more clear and the boundary.   

Is there anything that could be done?  I was thinking maybe through counselling, it would help him understand?

"Me [26F] with my sort-of friend [25F], continuously complains that she's either single or dates jerks, how do I tell her it's because she's obnoxious?


Hoo boy. There may be no good way to do this but I thought I'd ask and see if there's something I haven't thought of. 

So I have this friend, who I've known for about 6 years now. We were fairly close when I was younger and had a higher tolerance for bullshit, and I always felt a little sorry for her...she has this ""lost lamb"" naivety about her, and coming from a fairly sheltered background myself, I empathized. 

However, in recent years, she's become increasingly ""Nice Girl."" I really don't know any other way to put it. Every other social media post is about how she's ""not like other girls"" ""guys don't appreciate good women anymore"" ""It's ok though because Jesus is my boyfriend"" (I wish I was joking). It's beyond cringey, and for someone who likes to consider herself a feminist, bafflingly misogynistic. And every time she DOES start dating someone, she dives in headfirst, gets too enmeshed too quickly, posts endlessly about what a perfect precious relationship she has, and fucking surprise, the guy was manipulative/unfaithful/disrespectful/etc. EVERY TIME. 

I've tried to gently talk to her and tell her to slow down when she gets involved with someone, that a guy who gets too possessive and love-bomb-y so fast is probably bad news, but she just gets defensive and says she's a ""Hopeless romantic"" and ""no one appreciates how much love I have to give"". But then she's breathtakingly bitter all over social media, blaming men in general and slut-shaming other women for ""lowering men's standards"" until the cycle repeats itself. It is absolutely maddening.

I don't think I want to be friends anymore, so that's off the table, but should I make a last-ditch attempt to tell her that she's unlikely to attract anything but assholes with her current attitude? As obnoxious as she is now, I hate seeing her stuck in this cycle, and I suspect I'm not the only friend she's alienated with this behavior. Wat do, Reddit?

Throwaway account as I just want to reduce the risk of getting back to my main reddit account right now. 

My girlfriend of 3 years has been seeing a doctor over the last few months as she hadn't had her period - she went to see some specialists for tests and last week she was informed she may be menopausal (or as it's below 40 years old,  premature ovarian failure). She got her test results back today and the worst is confirmed - she has slim to no chance of having children. When this was a possibility last week, I told her that I'd support her no matter what and this is a blow, but we have other options for children if the news was bad. We had talked about adopting and other options before - we both wanted to have biological children but even before this were open to the idea of adopting, fostering and other parenting options so it wasn't like I just went ""oh shit, adoption it is!""

She got the news earlier and I'm home from work now, I told her that the weekend is absolutely hers and I'd be here to support and help her as she needs, she just needs to let me know. We had a brief chat and hug before and I just reminded her that this doesn't change anything for me and that we, her especially, just need to take time and think - but regardless of the situation I love her and I'm here for her. She said she just needed some space and time alone and I understand that.

Sorry for the messy post, I guess I'm just asking here for advice from anyone who has went through a similar situation - both as the partner or as a woman - as to how I can be best here for her in the next few days? I know we're fine long term, I just don't want her to think she's alone while also avoiding jumping to the opposite and smothering her. Any advice would be really helpful...

My boyfriend doesn't have the cleanest driving record. He has gotten into at least 5 accidents (1 that totaled his new car) and is somewhat of a reckless driver. I don't always feel safe when he is driving. That being said, between insurance and the new/used car I bought last year, I am forking over a lot of money for the privilege to drive my own vehicle - something he is not contributing to. I drive approximately 90 round-trip miles for work daily and I need to have a car. 
Aside from his lack of contribution, I also don't want him driving my car because I'm not sure I'd forgive him of he were to wreck it. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a grudgeholder. But the man has very little regard for material items with high value.

Today my mom was out around town looking for my dad with me in the car once more.

I've always been used to this, they've been together for 17 years and have been in a toxic relationship for a long time. After she tries calling him but he turned off his phone she made me call him before saying ""this is all your fault why dont you speak up, why dont you say dad why dont you have a job"". I wanted to scream at her and talk back, i was mad since she's always blaming me. I dont know why i need to speak up, ive only spoken up once before to my father that was when he was making her cry in the car with my cousin in the back and it was my grandma's birthday they were off to bury her ashes yet he didnt want to come. After that she always expected me to speak up saying i should do this because im her mother. Im really starting to get annoyed by her since she's chose to go running back to him every single time and she should be used to this by now. I dont care if he listens to me, i shouldnt even have to be speaking up for my parents or anything. I don't particularly like them both, my mom's a hard worker works 12 hours every day with no time off and ive never usually been close to her. Whenever my dad's in the room i instantly leave. I don't like him but I don't hate him. All i feel now is dread i don't want to be with them, we're moving out in 2 days and i don't know where we're going to go, but i dont want to be with my mom. She always  forgiving him after fights giving me false hope that everything is going to be ok and i dont feel like i trust them. I feel like im better off from here, over time ive started to lose interest in everything and now i only lie in bed and just feel nothing but boredom.

"Me [24 F] with my Boss [46 F], she has taken over my life and I am so overwhelmed, I can't see the way to take it back.


I've been working for my boss for about 1 1/2 years now and I've reached a point where I am so mentally overwhelmed that I can no longer think straight or take action to fix my situation. I'm looking for some outside perspective and would appreciate anyone's input. Thank you in advanced. 

I work for a small legal recruiting company that has been around for about 15 years. Last year, we made some amazing placements so business has been booming. There are so many issues within the company but I think it boils down to two issues. 1. My boss is a narcissistic sociopath that is getting crazier by the day and 2. We do not have the system/company structure in place to accommodate growth IE a database/employee handbooks/vacation days etc. 

As of right now, it has become my job to essentially build what is now $10 million company but what I was originally hired to do was coordinate interviews and calls between candidates and firms and Amy (my boss). I was hired straight out of University and my background is in politic science not business. This was supposed to be a job I held for about a year while I studied for the LSATS and then moved on to law school. I work anywhere between 12-18 hours every day and am expected to work a few hours on weekends and am supposed to always be available to Amy. 
She has always been abusive but it has reached a new level recently. Her technique has always been to be very mean and then very nice like she is your best friend. For example, she has called me any variation of the word idiot, told me I should go apply at Savon, that she would blacklist me from law firms in the future. One time I said that I was not an idiot and she said things like ""oh you think your so smart don't you? You think you're too good to work here? And told me to agree that I'm an idiot and harassed me until I agreed. Then a few days later she tells me how smart I am, how great of an employee I am and offers me raise. I truly think I have some form of Stockholm Syndrome.

Last October, I did try to quit. My mom has Borderline Personality Disorder and possibly PTSD that has been undiagnosed/untreated for 40+ years. I originally took this job when I graduated college so that I could support her as she was let go from her professorship after a mental breakdown. Before she had the breakdown, she (at least I thought) seemed like one of the strongest/smartest people I knew. She is on disability but barely gets any money (or that's what she told me) and needed my help. Then last October on a Sunday she tried to kill herself. I got word from my uncle and immediately let Amy know I needed the next day off so that I could drive to my mom (about two hours away) and be with her. Amy told me that if I did not show up the next day, I would not get a letter of recommendation. I told her to stick it where the sun doesn’t shine and hung up. I spent the next two months with my mom and right when I started looking for a new job I got a call from my old coworker promising the company had changed and that I would work directly under her and I wouldn't deal with Amy at all. I loved my coworkers before, would start at the same rate I left and would not have to deal with Amy so I signed right up. WRONG. Amy miraculously loved me again and only wanted to work with me - Basically I had my old job back. 

The reality is Amy cannot handle the stress of a successful company and has been so mean that no one we hire has stayed more than 2 - 4 months. Every day I speak with her for over an hour and have to hear about what I'm doing wrong, that I need to sound pleasant/happy when speaking with her, that I'm stupid for not understanding every side of the company or that one of my coworkers is an idiot and that's my fault. My coworkers and I have formed into a mini family of abused victims which makes it all the more difficult to just quit; particularly for my coworker Ariel. She trained me and has been working here for 2 years. She is so mentally drained from Amy, is fully addicted to Adderall to keep up with the work load and alcohol to get through her conversations with Amy that I truly believe she would die if I left. Before I took the job, 15 people in the previous year have come and gone from my role. 

To be honest, I am just so tired and sad. I don’t recognize myself anymore. I have kept this job because of my parents who need money, my coworkers who need my support, to pay for the bills/save up for law school and to save for a charity race I am doing in June. If I could last until June then I would feel better about leaving since it is an actual reason to leave rather than I just can’t take it anymore. I know that abuse is a reason to leave but I feel like I came into this job the second time knowing it was a possibility so its not a justifiable reason to leave. 

All I want to do is crawl onto my mama’s lap and have her hold me like she used too before she had a mental breakdown and tell me everything will be ok. I miss her so much. I am starting to hate myself for not having the spine to quit. I have never been this person; always priding myself on my own strength and yet I can’t even quit. Also, it is an awkward time to quit as I would only be able to have a job until June so any place that would pay me enough to support my bills probably won’t want to invest the time to train just for me to leave. 

I have always wanted my life to be dedicated to the betterment of society but if I can’t even handle this, how can I expect to ever work in politics and make those tough decisions? I don’t understand myself anymore. 

I am hoping you all could give me ideas/advice on what to do. I apologize for the length of the post and appreciate anyone who made it this far.

Hi again,

My previous post (https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58f4sl/i_20f_cant_get_over_my_insecurity_of_my_so_27m/) didn't blow up or anything but I am so grateful to everyone who responded, you all helped me feel like my feelings were valid. Thank you.

A few days after I posted, I had really been thinking about what exactly I wanted to say to him. I had been texting with Kyle and saw he posted on Instagram of him at a bar. Later, in the things friends like, I saw a video taken from the same bar and guess who posted it? Meg. So I was sure they were together and he hadn't told me so I resolved to talk to him the next time I saw him. I met up the next day with him and a friend and casually asked him about his day, really hoping he'd mention it. He listed the stuff he did (went Halloween shopping, bowling, to the bar and then to the movies) and didn't mention Meg. I was so mad but kept it together until later.

I waited until the morning and talked to him about it. It was a very long talk, but I stayed calm for most of it and I felt like I was as clear as I possibly could have been. I told him that we had discussed this on two separate occasions where it had clearly bothered me and that his behavior was incredibly untrustworthy. As I had guessed, not only did he go to the bar with Meg but everything he'd dome that day had been with her. 

During this, I found out that she had been over to his apartment alone and on one occasion she and his guy friend slept over after a night out. Hearing that made me want to puke. He said he couldn't just let a hammered friend go home, it wouldn't be safe. I told him that he could call her an uber in the future. 

Also I told him I needed to be told when he hung out with her, because otherwise I would find out on my own and feel betrayed. 
He told me the reason he didn't mention her or introduce me that one time is because he knew it upset me and he didn't want me to get upset and start a fight. 

Here's the thing, he has so many female best friends. If that weren't the case, I don't think I would have bought this but since he does, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I said I'd believe him when he said nothing was going on but I needed him to be honest about it and I wanted to meet her the next time it could happen casually. He said of course, he loved me, he was sorry he had turned it into something that it wasn't etc.

And honestly things felt great for a bit! Like I was so relaxed and happy....

Then this past weekend.. Went to a friends party. It was a really big party but the whole time he wouldn't really talk to me or dance with me and for a lot of it, I didn't know where he was. I made do, but felt weird since I was getting hit on by a bunch of strangers and had hoped to hang out with him for part of it! We wound up getting into a fight about that and other things the following day.

I felt like I'd been a hungover asshole so I wrote him a love letter and went over to apologize. 
He was still really mad, told me he didn't think he wanted to be with me and fell asleep.
I was crying and I'm really ashamed to say this but I went on his phone. I looked at his texts with her. I didn't find any evidence of blatant emotional cheating, but a lot of stuff really hurt me. First, it didn't look anything like his texts to his other friends, a lot of triple texting etc. and

- They'd hung out a LOT more than I'd previously thought, INCLUDING texts about going to the party we went to and dancing together. So now I know where he was when I couldn't find him. 

 -She'd left her bag at his house the time he told me she'd just ""stopped in to use the bathroom."" Hmm...
 
- They swapped poetry back and forth, not poetry about each other but things they'd written which stung because he never shows me his writing. 

- Also there were a lot of occasions when she'd ask him what he was up to,  when he was with me and he would omit that fact and tell her he was with friends or running errands! Sounds familiar... The one one time he mentioned me was after we talked the last time, and she was all on board with going out with a group of us but after the text where he mentioned me she changed her mind about going. 

And then Kyle woke up, caught me on his phone, yelled at me and shoved me + all my shit out the door at 3am. 


So we're done, and I'm heartbroken and fucking mortified that I stooped that low when I could have just left with my dignity intact a couple weeks ago. But honestly, I think unless I caught them fucking I would have kept making excuses and rationalizing his behavior for him and forgiving him for everything until the end of time, so in a way I think it's good I did something so shitty and burned the bridge. 

**tl;dr:** tried to fix it, wound up snooping and seeing more weird stuff, got caught snooping and now we are like, so over. :( 

edit: oh gosh, thank you so much to everybody who took time out of their day to read this. I feel really bad about what I did and don't ever want to repeat it in the future, but hearing that things will get better on an emotional level means so much to me right now. "
"Mother (48F) and stepfather (50M) tell me (29M) that I am enabling and spoiling my sister (11F). I am starting to resent them. Advice please?


[removed]"
"My grandpa [89M] thinks I'm [16M] turning into a ""sissy"" and blames my mother [50F] for it.


Just a bit of background: I have two older brothers, 28 and 26. They are technically my half-brothers, because we have the same father but different mothers. They are both very much ""manly men"" and are both in the military. They are also very athletic and enjoy sports such as hunting and rugby. My grandfather (father's father) fought in World War II and is a real tough guy, the kind that takes no shit from anybody. He also has a rather old-fashioned world view and raised my father and uncles to his ideal. He is also very outspoken and speaks his mind. His jokes sometimes cross the line between ""funny"" and ""offensive"".

On the other hand, I'm very different from them. I guess my mother DID kind of spoil me when I was growing up, and was a bit over-protective of me, and I didn't really do any of the things which they did when they were young. Instead of fishing and playing rugby and hunting, I stayed at home and learned the violin. Instead of going to the schools which they went to, I was a chorister at a church from the ages of 8 to 13. Since then, my grandfather would always tease me and call me ""princess"" or the feminine version of my name. He would always encourage my father [62M] to take me out hunting, like a ""real man"".

Well, that happened once. I remember it vividly. The two of them (dad and granddad) took me out deer hunting when I was about 12. I followed them as they stalked and eventually gunned down a large doe. It was the first time I had ever witnessed an animal dying and I was so traumatized that I threw up and started crying. My father was in a hurry to get me home, and while my grandfather was worried at first, he started to rag on me on the way back. He teased me and called me an over-sensitive sissy. He and my mother had an argument over it. She accused my grandfather of ""pushing me too hard"", and he accused HER of being overprotective and allowing me to be so sensitive.

Now, I'm in high school. I'm on the school rugby team, but it's not something I really enjoy. I'd rather play the violin or golf than rugby (which I've broke several bones from). I guess you can say that I'm rather ""effeminate"" in that I care about my grades, the way I look, the clothes I wear, etc. I'm also bi, but I haven't come out yet, and frankly, I don't think I ever would. My grandfather gives me enough crap as it is.

The actual incident happened yesterday. As with every week, my family and I were having supper at my grandparent's house. My grandmother asked me how school was going. I told her it was going well. My grandfather asked me whether I was thinking of joining the military after high school, like my brothers had done. I told him that I was actually thinking of going to university to study law and become a lawyer. He huffed and was like, ""So you think the army is too good for you, princess?"" I was like no, I didn't think it was ""too good"" for me, I just didn't think that it was the right option. And then he went, ""Yeah, a pretty boy like you wouldn't last a day in there.""

My father then chimed in and told his dad to give it a rest. But my grandfather still continued. He was like, ""The problem is, [my dad's name], you've allowed your wife to turn your son into a little lady, prancing about in his designer clothes and expensive cologne."" He then went on about how when he was my age, he was sleeping in hard bunks in a military school and taking cold showers, blah blah blah. And then the kicker was when he said something about how he ""wouldn't be surprised if I turned out to be gay."" That's when my mother lost it. She told my grandfather in a hard voice that he was being silly and old-fashioned, that she would never let me join the military like a ""mindless sheep"" and that what I did with my life was none of his business whatsoever. She actually started to YELL at him, which was pretty surprising considering the fact that nobody had ever dared raised their voice to my grandfather, not even my grandmother.

She was going on about how I was her son, not his, and he replied with ""Thank God he's not my son!"" At that point I actually thought my mother would throw something at him, but my father interjected and told them both to calm down. The rest of supper was awkward, to say the least. My brothers tried steer the conversation towards something else, but the tension was still there. After supper, my parents and I went back home. My grandfather didn't even see us off. On the phone, my grandmother later apologized to my mother and I for his behaviour. I assured her that I wasn't offended by it.

My mother is still angry at my grandfather, and my father promised her that he would try to ""reign him in"". I'm not sure what to do though. I feel like I've been caught up in the center of their argument. Despite how annoyed I am at my grandfather's narrow view of the world, a part of me still seeks his approval. I just wish that he would be proud of me, like he is of my older brothers. I wish he could see that although I may not be good at hunting or flying helicopters or sports like they are, I'm still good at other things, like debating and playing the violin. I know that he loves me, or at least my father assures me that he does, but I just wish that I could have him understand that there's nothing wrong with me, that just because I'm more ""effeminate"" than my older brothers, I could still turn out to be a successful man.

TL;DR: From a young age, I've always been interested in things like music and literature, in contrast with my manlier older brothers. My grandfather accuses my mother of raising me to be effeminate. I just wish that he could be proud of me and acknowledge the fact that times are different and that being a ""man"" doesn't mean joining the military or liking sports."
"My friend [23/F] is being stalked by someone who is part of the cyber cult Twin Flames theory [36/M] and he has started posting worrying YouTube videos


Hi guys, I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to post to as it's about a friend and not me. But I was really hoping for some advice and how to support my friend and point her in the right direction. She doesn't reddit. 

This story started a long time ago and my friend originally met Twin Flames guy when she was 16 and he 30. Apparently he was obsessed from that point on, which is extremely inappropriate in hindsight. 
My friend saw him only as a friend and had absolutely no romantic dealings with him. She agreed to meet him on several occasions for 'coffee' or 'acting classes' but then he'd pick her up and suddenly the plans would change to dinner and dates. 

There's a lot more to the back story and eventually my friend realised that it was creepy and wrong and stopped seeing him, however occasionally still had contact with him through out the next 6 years. 

My friend had never disclosed this to anyone until recently, and they said it sounded like she had been, or was in the middle of being groomed. She quickly sent TF guy a message and asked to cease all contact. 

Since then, things have escalated. He's been posting weird videos on YouTube about how he met his Twin Flame when she was just 16 and now the time is right. It's his 'God Given right to be with her' and it was his for the taking. 
She also has evidence he turned up outside her house at 3am one morning and just stood there. 

What can she do? How can I help her? 

TL:DR Friend might have been groomed when she was 16 by Twin Flames cult member, now six years on he's still posting videos about her and his ""God given right to be with her'."

"Me [21 M] with my best friends [21 M] of 5-10 years, are hanging out with the person who assaulted me


I would like to start this off with,

about 1-2 years ago, my brother and i was attacked by a gang of people (around 30 people) for no reason, my brother was stabbed 4-5 times and i was bashed badly.

We found out who the people were a few days later, but were warned our house would be raided by them if we told the police, so we didn't.

Fast forward, two years later. I have a group of friends, and I found out recently, two of them hangout with the guy who stabbed my brother.

Should I be angry, even though they know what that motherf*cker did to me and my brother, they still decide to be friends with him? Because he is 'Nice' to them?

I know I don't own my friends or anything, but do I have the right to feel this way..?

It's hard for me to make friends, the group of 5-6 guys we are all tight friends, and i don't know what to do.

Edit: thanks for all the replies guys, really means a lot to me, reading them all! 

Woah woke up to 60 comments haha, really heart warming guys. Thanks!

So firstly, I know this isn't a strictly relationships question but /r/Pets doesn't allow posts concerning the loss of pets, but /r/Petloss seemed to be only for people talking about the loss of their own pets and I didn't want to interfere with that, so this kind of made sense.

Anyway, we're very good friends and I'm close with the family and knew the dog, so I'm not really concerned about them taking anything the wrong way. I was just thinking about sending flowers or an edible arrangement, but honestly I don't have a terrible amount of experience with this so I wouldn't know if that was an *off* thing to do, or anything.

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
