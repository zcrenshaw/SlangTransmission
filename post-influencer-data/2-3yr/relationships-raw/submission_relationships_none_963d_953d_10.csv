"[Update] I [27F] may have fallen in love with another woman [26F], and I don't know what to think of it.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5s74h4/i_27f_may_have_fallen_in_love_with_another_woman/

So my initial post didn't really get that much attention, but I thought I'd post an update for those who cared!

The same day I made that post, Margot came over to hang out. I don't really know how it happened but I ended up just spilling everything like word vomit and telling her the truth. At first she was taken off guard and really didn't have much to say, but we talked it out and she admitted that she still had feelings for me, too.

So, long story short, we are now dating, and I'm still trying to come to terms with my sexuality. Margot wants to take me to queer nights at this bar and I've been reading a lot of material online. No one in our friend group is surprised at all, but I'm going to wait before I tell my parents.

TLDR; Margot and I are together now and I'm working on learning more about myself. Thanks for the advice!"

"[Update] I [28 M] asked my BF [28 M] of one year to come support me at my grandmother's funeral but he feels uncomfortable about it and does not want to come.


Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5t2iqk/i_28_m_asked_my_bf_28_m_of_one_year_to_come/

Hello there,

I wanted to give an update to the situation and also thank everyone for their comments and support. I took the time to read through almost all the comments and posts, but I was unable to respond to many of them because of everything that was happening. The funeral was yesterday and the days before that was spent with family. There was also a viewing on Sunday and that lasted the entire day.

When my BF came down on Friday, we talked some more about the situation and what was happening. It definitely was much easier to discuss everything in person as opposed to a phone call. After we talked about it, he was much more understanding about the situation. He told me that he was willing to come with me to the viewing on Sunday with me to support me. 

By this time, I had also cooled down a bit and thought about everything. By reading all the replies, I was able to understand that even though he wanted to support me through my time of need, it's not always clear cut as I thought it would be. He has anxiety when it comes to large crowds of people and he also did not know if my family knew of my situation of being gay. He felt very uncomfortable and pressured into a situation without any time to prepare. 

In the beginning, I failed to understand why those concerns would supersede my needs for support. But after cooling down a bit, I understood it more from his point of view. We were able to come to a compromise about it where he came with me to the viewing but not the funeral. While he was with me over the weekend, he was very sweet and caring and it helped me immensely.

All in all, it was a great learning experience and we both definitely learned about each other more. I think it made us closer and we are better for it.

I wanted to say thanks again to everyone who commented and provided advice and different perspectives. It made me extremely emotional (in a good way!) knowing that there were so many people willing to help. Thank you very much!

TL;DR: BF and I were able to discuss the situation and come to a compromise about it. We are still together and better after everything."

"My [24 M] parents [M 60/F 51] have threatened to disown me because my girlfriend [F 22] comes from a very poor background


For a little context – I originate from an African country. I come from a wealthy and prestigious family. My grandfather made his name, passed it onto my dad (who made a bigger name) and since I’m the only male among my siblings (got two younger sisters) I’m expected to follow in the same trend. All that though is probably going to go down the toilet because of the woman I love.

She doesn’t come from prestige or money. Far from it. Before I met her, she couldn’t even afford to buy socks of her own. I met her through one of the maids that work at my parents’ house – my girlfriend and the housemaid are neighbours, and we met when I dropped off the housemaid one day. I became captivated by my girlfriend after speaking to for like 5 minutes. We’ve been a couple for 18 months and I’ve never felt this way about a woman. Honestly, I love her so much I feel like I’m going to explode sometimes. I want to marry her. I want to have children with her.

My parents object. They object a lot. I was with my girlfriend for 10 months before telling them about her. I waited that long on purpose, because I knew they would disapprove. However, their reaction to our relationship has been more hostile than I thought it would be. I thought they would be fierce at first, but perhaps come around – especially my mother. 

Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. They have threatened to cut me off if I don’t end it – emotionally, financially, everything. My dad has told me he will write me out of his will if I don’t end it within 2 months (we’re 1 month in now). My parents have described my girlfriend as “trash” and that “she isn’t fit to walk on the same side of the street as me.” All this because she comes from a very poor family. They say she isn’t fit to bear the grandchildren that will one day take over my dad’s company through me.

I work for my father’s company. Because I’m his son, I hold a very high position for my age, and I get very good money for my age (I'd also like to think I'm good at my job). My dad told me that if I don’t end it, he’ll fire me. I’ve actually started looking for other jobs on the sly because of the situation I’m in. I’ll be severely fucked if I do get fired – I live alone and have a lot of bills to pay. 

What confounds the situation is that I’m paying for my girlfriend’s education. Despite her poor economic background hampering her studies, she’s really intelligent. She’s about to finish a diploma in telecommunications in June – she’ll begin a degree later in the year. I’m determined she get that bachelor’s degree – even if I get fired and I have to rob a bank in order to pay for her education. My girlfriend also has 9 younger siblings (yeah, crazy, I know) and they have their own problems and needs that I also take care of.

My parents are also racist. They don’t only object to my girlfriend because of her social and economic status, but because she isn’t black – because she is coloured (mixed). I received my bachelor’s degree at a British University, and I know that using that word to describe someone who is mixed or black in the UK, can be considered offensive and racist. But here in Africa, “coloured” people are what we use to describe mixed people. 

My girlfriend is a mixture of black and Arab (most coloured people here are that mix – goes back to the Arab Slave Trade on the East African coast back in the day). And although my girlfriend is not very devout, she identifies as a Muslim, which is a huge no-no in my family (we’re Christians) and something that my parents also loathe about her.

 **tl;dr**

There is no way I’m going to comply to my parents’ demands. Like I wrote before, I want to be with my girlfriend for the rest of my life – I want to have kids with her. However, the situation I’m facing is no joke. Getting fired and being completely cut off from my family will be very difficult. Despite their snotty ignorance and bigotry, I still love my parents. But it doesn’t seem like they will come around, and I guess this is where idealism clashes with pragmatism. Because idealism is telling me to remain with my girlfriend and ride out whatever my parents decide to do – but pragmatism knows that in the event of this, it will be a very difficult time for me. I would appreciate any advice on the situation.

Thank you

"How do I [36F] deal with my soon to be ex husband [37M] now that I'm dating again?


My soon to be ex husband and I were married for 2 years, together for 5.

He had an affair with a 21F waitress for 4 months, telling me he was working late on a large project. He was on a large project but not one that needed that much overtime as it turns out.

Anyway, after the project ended he got a promotion and then I found out about his affair. He tried to make it work for about 3 months but kept visiting that restaurant and blaming me for becoming emotionally and physically unavailable after the affair. 

He ended up leaving me and filing for a divorce. I was pretty crushed to have my husband leave me for a younger woman but I started recovering, all the usually stuff, gym, ice cream, retail therapy, actual therapy etc and then joined an online dating site.

About 4 months ago I met my current BF (38M) and he's a really great guy. We hit it off instantly and I know things are moving fast but we spend almost every day together at one of our houses and weekends too.

I've already met his friends and vice versa and everyone is quite happy for us. I personally have never been happier, I feel like I'm being treated right.

My soon to be ex husband, I have only talked to via my lawyers with regards to the divorce settlement.

I found out through the grapevine though that he was cheated on by that waitress and they have now broken up. 

To be honest, when I heard that news, I felt nothing. I thought I'd be happy because karma but I just didn't care (I don't know if that's normal).

When friends wanted to talk about it, I just told that that apart from the divorce, that chapter of my life was closed and I've moved on.

It helped that a few hours after I heard the news, I came home and my boyfriend had made the effort of plating up our takeout onto nice dinnerware complete with candles and flowers. I get that this is the honeymoon stage but I just love that I have a relationship were we are both invested in making an effort.

My ex however, who hadn't bothered in all this time to contact me outside our lawyers, recently found out though that I had been seeing someone else and he called me a few days ago, incredibly irate that I was seeing someone else and how I moved on before the divorce was final.

My mind is blown. He moved on whilst we were still married! What the hell is going through his head that he doesn't see how hypocritical that is?

He blamed his affair on ""mid life crisis"" and work stress and how he was wrong to leave et. 

I know he's just back because he got dumped and he's using me because he doesn't want to be alone.
 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have two questions:

1) I'm not mentally braced for the emotional turmoil this has thrown even though I 100% know I do not want to get back with him. How do I stay strong? I feel so attacked even though he's being so ludicrous.

2) How do not let my current relationship suffer because of the emotional effect this is having on me? I don't want to have my BF have to put up with this. "

"My [20M] family is upset with my for trying to change my name. UPDATE


Original https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rako9/my_20m_family_is_upset_with_my_for_trying_to/

Soo... Kind of a strange update. In my original thread, /u/dragonflytype pointed out that There was a threaf that was similar, but from the other perspective. I checked it out and it was eerily similar to my situation, from what OP said in the remaining comments. I asked my dad about it and it turns out he did actually post it. Some minor things didn't match up, we both changed a couple minor details to preserve anonymity. But he kind of gave that away when he said my name in the comments.

So to the update, everyone is still pretty upset about it. My dad has been sulking about it a lot. He's still struggling with the idea that hes going to be the last of his name (and here I was thinking that ""your father's name"" meant his last name, not the whole thing.) My brother, who is more like my dad than I am is mad. I think he does like the tradition, and is pissed that I came first. So he's mad at me, too. Dad called my Grandad and he's on his side, too. Mom has been more quiet. She's really conflict-avoiding and I think that might be why she agreed to name me this in the first place.

So it's been rough, but more than anything, it's strengthened my resolve. No one has talked to me about my feelings, just how i'm turning my back on the ""family legacy."" All I could do was point out to them is that their arguments are exactly what I was talking about. They're making me feel like I'm nothing more than a vessel to carry on a name rather than someone who was desired as a person. It got a little heated when my dad, grandad and brother had an intervention of sorts with me about it. I was pissed and told them, straight up that the tradition is dead. You can either have this decision with me, now and alone, or in a few years when I have a pregnant partner, and they can take us both on at once (I would never want to put this pressure on a GF or wife, especially while she's pregnant. That part of why I think this is important to do now.)

After their total lack of support, the offer to work with my parents on picking out a new name together is off the table. I've made the decision on my own. I love my new name :). My friends are cool with it, and Ive given my family one month's grace. At the end of February, I will correct them every time, and that will last 2 months. After that, I will refuse to respond if they call me by former name. The paperwork is filed to make it legal, so I think it's going well overall.

Picking out my new name obviously caused its own problems. As so as I told my dad, I got the immediate response that ""That's too modern! Why are you giving up a name with historical integrity for something so new?"" Brother was again pissed that I followed through with it because ""The name is dead!!!!!!!!"" I actuay don't think either name I've picked out or myself is particularly modern, but they are probably a bit newer than William.

So that's kind of where we are now. My family is now pissed with me, but I'm holding my own. I've got my new name, which I absolutely love, and I'm in the process of a legal name change.

Thanks for the advice that you all [gave the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5q8a9s/me_14m_with_my_stepbrother_17m_of_10_years_heard/). 


first i talked to my stepdad and he said the same thing that most of you said. He said that Tony was just looking for something smart/hurtful to say, so he went with that and then later he admitted that he hadn't meant it. Also he made it clear that no matter he thinks of me as his son - which even though I call him Dad and consider him my Dad - is not a conversation we've had before so that was nice. and he told me i should talk to Tony, because Tony would want to know if something is bothering me. 

And so I did talk to Tony. He was super apologetic, and kept saying that he didn't mean it. I told him that I would understand if he didn't see me as his brother, because that happens a lot in stepfamilies and I get it, but he insisted that he meant brother. Also he promised that we would hang out more, which was also nice. He kept his promise and this weekend me, him and our Dad went to  dinner, and then Tony took me to a Super Bowl party on Sunday.

So Im moving past what I heard, because I do believe that he didn't mean it. But, even though I don't think he meant it, I do still keep thinking about them, which kinda sucks. I[m hoping that I forget this whole thing soon. Thanks for  the advice.

Well! It's been a while, but I feel like I should give you guys an update because of how drastically you've changed my life. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fr0bs/me_18f_with_my_husband_20m_he_wants_me_to_give_up/


I'm getting a divorce. I'll give a quick summary of the past few months:

We started marriage counseling, and I began to realize exactly how selfish of a person he is. The therapist asked, ""what is the biggest problem you're having with your partner?"" to each of us. His response? ""Well, I really don't like it when she fact-checks me. It makes me angry because it seems like she doesn't trust me.""
My response was ""I do not feel respected. He does not see us as equals and I can't continue being his emotional punching bag."" (Which was a line from one of the comments, thanks guys!)


She told him after a month or so of sessions that he needed to seek individual therapy for his emotional instability, because he kept lying and contradicting himself TO THE THERAPIST. What's the point of going if you pretend everything's fine and dandy?


About October I told him that I couldn't continue the relationship. He was getting more and more aggressive and even punched a hole through our wall. He started throwing things and his fuse was incredibly short. So I told him I was done. It wasn't healthy for me and it wasn't healthy for our daughter. 


Skipping ahead a bit to my current situation:
I have moved up with my parents. Divorce papers were filed about a month ago now, and luckily he agreed to all of the things we discussed. I'm very glad there was no conflict on that front, but his mom is a divorce lawyer so she wouldn't have let him mess around. 

Candice is very happy, because she gets to play with her grandpa any time she wants (he's a stay at home parent). 

I don't really have any connections here other than my parents and brother, but that's okay. I feel so much happier just being away from him. Now I've just got to find a job!

"My husband [39/M] is afraid to get help for a simple medical issue and I (his wife) [41/F] intervened. Now he's furious saying I'm controlling.


I have been married to my husband for just over 15 years. I became a family physician and contrary to people’s perception, a lot of doctors don’t marry nurses or other doctors, we marry non-MDs all the time. My husband is a business executive, has two graduate degrees and is very smart – he’s very quick witted, very strong-willed and intellectually very focused. He’s a much better debater than I am, too. 

Our marriage works because we’re equals; but, we had a rocky start. When I graduated from medical school, I had a bit of the god complex and often talked-down to people (family and friends, mostly, but sometimes patients) which alienated my close friends. My husband and I nearly divorced early on, but I worked through my issues and we’ve come to accept certain boundaries. One of them being that I try not to talk-down to my husband using a medical degree as a magic wand. 

But, a problem as bubbled up. My husband isn’t diligent with his health or seeing a doctor. He’s very much “too manly” to see a doctor and also has a turgid fear of needles. I understand and respect that. I booked him with a colleague (a female doctor who works with people who are afraid/fearful of doctors/needles/medical procedures) and he’s gone, a few times, but only under duress.

 His rationale is that he doesn’t want to go to a doctor I know – I know a lot of doctors, it’s hard to find one I don’t know in the area. Normally this wouldn’t bug me, but I love and care about him and his health is important to me and of course an issue everyone has to deal with. He’s getting to an age where he needs to see one more regularly. His fear of needles is pretty bad and needs an EMLA patch and Ativan for blood work, which is fine; but, getting him to go to the doctor and for blood work is a big fight. I go to appointments with him, am very reassuring and sit through blood tests; but, it’s not enough. We went through all this a year and a half ago and it is time again to see a doctor. He has been complaining of pain that is very evidently a hernia he got from hauling drywall for a basement. I have been after him more and more vocally to see a doctor. It’s gotten so comically out-of-hand that I finally booked an appointment with his doctor and told the receptionist what his specific concerns were. 

I told my husband, and he immediately flew off the handle. He said I was doing it again where I was using my medical degree to be controlling and we got into a huge fight. I don’t feel like I’m wrong. He basically walks holding his groin, tries not to laugh and has avoided sex for weeks. He’s putting himself through hell because he’s afraid and it’s just a bad way to live your life. I told him I’d go with him to the appointments and would be there for everything, and I know I can’t make people not afraid, but it’s the best we can do. He has to go. 

Am I wrong here? Am I being controlling?

So I asked him if he was interested in dating. He ghosted me for several weeks then resumed things as they had been.  We had one talk about how dating works here - he's from a different culture than I am. I made it clear that communication is key and that if he changed his mind he could ask.  I also made it clear that if he was interested in dating other people, that here at some point people who are getting into a relationship / dating will talk about it so he should be prepared for that. This all happened about 1.5 years ago.  We kept hanging out and being friends since then. 

In this time I wasn't dating anyone but that recently changed when I met Sam (28M).  When I introduced Sam to my friends, Bob kept asking him why he was at the party and pointed out to him that Bob and I had been friends for years.  Bob is now demanding that I explain past actions in terms of ""why did you do [thing]?"" and seems to be looking for meaning in them.  He also keeps asking a lot of questions about Sam when we hang out.

I'd like to keep Bob as a friend but I really don't know what to do with his odd behavior.  Should I flat out tell him that just because I asked him out more than a year ago he doesn't have an continual claim on me? Or do I ignore the situation and hope Bob stops being odd.

"My (18/M) friend's (18/M) younger sister (17/F) carved my initials into her arm.


To my knowledge she's had a crush on me for a couple of years now. I've been friends with her brother since eighth grade. I used to go to their house a lot in the beginning, and she would always make a ton of excuses to drop by his room, come down to the basement, pop in wherever he we were chilling, etc. At school she would always walk by my locker, stare at me, giggle with her friends. I didn't really care for the most part. I figured it was just a little crush. No big deal. I'm not interested in her like that, but her crush was never bad enough that I felt I had to step in and say something. 


That all changed when I started dating my current girlfriend, Neha. I can be a little clueless sometimes. I trust Neha's point of view, and according to her, my friend's sister has an unhealthy obsession with me. Not just an innocent crush. Apparently his sister has been going around telling people in her grade that I kissed her on her birthday. Never happened. I didn't even see her on her birthday. I was away on a family trip at the time. The weirdest part is, she concocted this whole story about how I texted her to come out of her house at the stroke of midnight, and that we kissed on the back porch and talked for hours about our ambitions. Not one part of that is true. A couple of people have come up to me to ask. Some people believe her, but anyone who knows me personally, knows that it never happened. I don't really care about the gossip, but the fact that she's making up stories is a little concerning. 


I told my friend. He's a good guy. I know he wouldn't blow up at her angrily. They're on good terms and they don't argue at all from what I've seen, so I trusted that he would handle it correctly. He was very embarrassed on her behalf, and he apologized to me, and then a few weeks went by where his sister left me alone entirely. I thought the situation was sorted and over, but I was wrong. 


Turns out she carved my initials into her arm, and she showed it to a few people in her grade. They're my Korean initials, which not many people know as I have a different name that I use at school and on my birth certificate. The only people who use my Korean name are my older family members. That said, my close friends, girlfriend and apparently my best friend's sister know about my Korean name. No one else really does. My girlfriend saw the initials on an IG photo in which my friend's little sister was posing with her friends, and didn't really make an effort to hide the marking. She's been telling other people that those initials belong to her boyfriend from a different school, but I don't really believe that. I'm pretty sure my friend is fully aware of the marking, and didn't tell me because he (rightly) didn't want me to lose my shit, but now that I've seen evidence of how far her obsession has gone, I'm a little worried. 


Is it normal to do this sort of thing? Can it be chalked up to a crush gone too far? An embarrassing high school story? Or should I reach out to her and explain how uncomfortable this makes me? 


**tl;dr** She's always had a crush on me. I used to think it was an innocent high school thing, but recently she's been making up stories about me kissing her (I didn't) and she has my Korean initials carved into her arm. My friend has tried talking sense into her, and for a few weeks everything was cool, but I'm worried now. Can this be chalked up to a crush gone too far or should I talk to her about cooling it? "
"Me [22 M] with my friend [21 F], gave away her spot in our senior year house for next year. Who's the asshole?


I'll be a senior in university next year and I've been looking for a house for me and 2 other close friends. We decided to add on a person to our hunt since there really aren't many 3 person houses near my university.

Backstory: I'm trying to live with 2 of my closest friends for senior year. We've been through a lot together and are really tight. If we don't live together, then pretty much I have to find a single on campus and be super lonely, which sounds like a terrible way to graduate university. The two of them have been abroad for the majority of this semester, so I've been spearheading the search for a place off campus. I definitely worked harder at searching for a place than some of my classwork (not recommended) and as a result, I'm pretty tired and frustrated. There is basically no place that is a) fits everyone's budget, b) is close enough to campus, and c) is a decent place to live that's not run down. Except, after all this time searching I finally found a place that seemed to fit the criteria. 

So, I went and checked out the house with the girl we added into our search. She liked it, but said she wanted to hear what my other friends said about it and then she would decide. I showed them the photos and they loved it. Case closed right?

Well, I'm trying to collect the first month's rent from everyone and she's hesitating. She comes out and says that ""being straightforward, I'm looking at a cheaper place with some other people"" and to wait until she could see the other house. I got really angry at her and asked why she didn't bring that up before. She says she did when we left the house viewing (and I don't remember that at all, but let's say she did). She certainly didn't make a big deal about it when she was supposedly talking about it to me. I ask her how likely she is to pick this other place, and she says ""50/50"". 

Essentially, me and the other friends agreed that if this house didn't work out, we would give up because the deadline for on campus eligibility was ending soon. So, I panicked. I messaged a bunch of friends who I knew might need housing, and in 20 mins I found an acquaintance that wanted the spot and he got me the check the day after. 

I message her today letting her know that I'm sorry but her spot in the house was gone. She was really upset. Normally, stuff like this doesn't get to me, but the messages she sent sound really hurt and as far as I can see - our friendship is pretty dead. That sucks, she's a cool person and I care about her. So, I'm not sure how to approach her.

On one hand, it was shitty of me to give away her spot without even telling her I was going to. She said she would have just made a decision if I would have told her and that I really betrayed her. On the other hand, I worked really hard for this and wasn't about to let someone's indecision to ruin my senior year with my best friends. Honestly, if she would have said anything other than ""50/50"" this probably wouldn't have happened. To me, she was trying to play the field on both sides and kept us as a back up plan. I'm hurt too to be honest.  

edit: thanks for all the advice everyone. obviously I still think my friend was jeopardizing everything, but I now see that I could have easily waited another day or at least let her know. it was a shitty decision in a high pressure situation, so hopefully yall can learn from my mistake. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr** Offered friend a spot in our senior year house. She was indecisive and was looking with someone else behind our back. Tried to have her cake and eat it too, so I gave away her spot to someone who could commit. Who's the asshole?"

"Coworker [25F] thinks we [22F] [20 - 30 F/M] are using ""office politics"" to bully her?


I've been a high school girl, so I know bullying in the form of ostracization. But this is not the case. There are no ""office politics"" oppressing the victim. 

More or less, everyone in our office became close knit about 3 months ago. We were all in the same training class for a new branch in our company. After finishing training, majority of the people in the office felt comfortable exchanging Facebook info. 

One person, Kathy [25F], told us all she didn't use Facebook. This was a lie because I had searched her name and found her before she stated this. It was an active and very public account, but I never outted her to the rest of the group. I believed it was her nice way of turning us down. I understood because not everyone is comfortable with work friends on their personal media. 

Some weeks past and she lets it slip that she has a Facebook. Something about her dislike about her friends sharing stuff on her Feed. She was called out and she admitted she just didn't want to mix business with pleasure. **Kathy didn't want work to get mixed with her personal life.** Again, we understand.

So more months passed. And during said months, our group interacted outside of work. We went shopping together, had BBQ, movie nights, drank wine and watched Scandal, etc. And with this came inside jokes, more invitations, and emotional connections (?)

Last Monday, Kathy complained to me that our coworkers Brad and Joey were having a laugh during break. She feeling left out, asked what was so funny. They said she just had to be there to get it. She asked them to say it anyway, and that she'd probably get it. They did through giggles and when Kathy didn't laugh, they repeated she just had to be there to get it. When Kathy repeated the joke for me, I burst out laughing because it was an inside joke about something that happened at Joey's movie night. Kathy seemed hurt and went back to her desk. 

Today during break, Patrice asked our other coworker Nancy what she should bring to Scandal night. This exchange happened in front of me and Kathy. Again Kathy piped up and asked what they were talking about. They explained that a few of us coworkers were getting together to watch Scandal and drink wine. Girl talk and stuff. They then started a conversation about the latest episode. 

Kathy pulled me to the side and asked if everyone was doing things without her. I told her yes. She asked why she wasn't invited and I explained that it was because she told us she didn't want to mix business with pleasure. She still insisted it was rude not to ask and they were using ""office politics"" to bully her. She ranted about how she feels victimized and ostracized when she isn't included. 

How do I explain it to her that her not being included is her fault and she can't force people to like/invite her?

TL;DR: Coworker doesn't want to mix personal life with work. She gets annoyed when everyone seems closer and does things outside of work without her. 

EDIT: Bolded for emphasis since there is some confusion. Kathy has stated she doesn't want coworker interaction outside of work. Not just Facebook. 

Ever since Kathy found out everyone does interact outside of work, she's been very curious about my texting (on break or after work). She wants to know if I'm texting X coworker or doing to X's coworker's event. 

**UPDATE (is this how I do it?):**

I talked my coworkers during our time before shift starts (usually a coffee and donuts thing for everyone). I phrased it so that it seemed like I was hurt by the group talking about Scandal night in front of me. They understood and promised to keep that to themselves. I also stated that maybe next time me and Kathy could go. 

Nancy was confused and Brad was visually disagreeing/pissed. Apparently, Kathy lied to me about not being invited. Why, I don't know. 

Nancy sent Kathy a FB message weeks ago. Nancy said that she was thinking about having a TV and wine night. She listed a few shows and asked Kathy which would like to watch. It took Kathy a few days to respond after reading it. In the response, she said she “had better things to do then drink cheap wine and watch trash tv.”. Also to not message her on FB again. I physically saw the message to confirm it wasn’t some fake screenshot. I asked Nancy why she didn’t tell us about this and she said it would make the workplace hostile.  

Brad also noted Kathy was a bitch and that I should just check out her Facebook. So I did and like before it's a very active and public account. Apparently, for months she's been posting status (Kathy's Tea) about our workplace. Sometimes venting, sometimes actually harmful statements. One that really bothered Brad was when she took creepshots of everyone and posted that he was a fat N-word (hard r), something about Tyler Perry. He only found this out because one of Kathy's FB friends sent it to him. 

I was also not left out as she posted a direct photo from my own social media and captioned it that I'm a bottle redhead who sets feminist back. There was something about Nancy's Scandal night, but she called it for desperate soccer moms and wannabe stepford wives. 

Brad said he didn't want to tell us because he went to HR and they haven't gotten back to him yet. That they said though it counts as cyber bullying, it's her social media BUT she had her phone on the work floor (against the rules).  

So now I have all this information and confused on what to do. Kathy's been lying to me and very rude herself. But why would she lie to me? What her end game? 

I have about 4 hours until my break with Kathy. Should I confront her?"

"My [41f] ex-wife [39f] told all of her friends we divorced because I cheated on her, which is a lie. I have to face them all this weekend for the first time, and I'm so anxious about it.


My ex-wife and I were together for six years. We had a son together, and divorced two years ago. Our son was two at the time, and is four now. My ex and I split custody 50/50, and while we're not ""friends"", we are civil to each other, text daily regarding our son, and overall I think we co-parent well. 

Since my ex got pregnant, our relationship became tumultuous and never recovered. The last ~2.5 years we were together were horrible. By the end, it was clear we both needed out. 

When our son was two (and we were living together, obviously), she came into the kitchen and said to me ""I don't want to be married to you, honestly I don't even like you as a person, and I want to get a divorce."" 

This was a hard and shitty conversation, but I felt it too, and so we mostly-calmly talked about it. We agreed that we would keep living together for a bit while we figured out how to split everything, talked a lot about child custody rules (because we're both women and she was the one who birthed our son from a donor, I was terrified of her taking him away), and also talked about other rules regarding each other. We agreed to sleep in separate beds, for example. We also agreed that we could see other people. Because there was so much more important logistics shit to talk about though, we didn't spend a lot of time processing the part about seeing other people. We agreed we could, ""as long as we didn't bring them back to the house ever,"" and we went on to discuss more important things.

My ex and I hadn't slept together since she became pregnant 2.5 years earlier. I was heartbroken, felt shitty, etc., and hooked up with a friend about a month later. I was still living with my ex at the time. I never brought this friend back to our place (as I agreed to in our rules), but we started seeing each other pretty regularly, mostly as friends who were hooking up. I want to be clear here that I wasn't skipping out on parenting duties at all. Even during this time, my ex and I were splitting time with our son equally. She'd leave to go hang out with her friends and I'd stay home with our son just as frequently.

Anyway, after about a month (so two months after we separated), she asked if I slept with this friend. I said yes. Immediately she accused me of cheating on her, and said I needed to move out immediately. *Now, to be clear, I **know** it was shitty for me to sleep with someone while we were still living together.* I know that was unethical. I wish I had moved out earlier. But I was afraid of moving away from my son without custody sorted out, didn't have the disposable income to rent another place straight away, etc. I think it was a shitty situation. But I maintain that I did not cheat on her. We were talking about nothing other than how to move forward with divorce. The relationship was over.

This was all two years ago. We don't talk about it anymore, and co-parent fine together. She is now engaged to another woman and is very happy. It's all fine.

**The crux of this post is** that she told everyone in our lives (including every member of my family) that we divorced because I cheated on her. As far as they are concerned, we were in a happy, loving relationship raising a toddler, I cheated, and so then, begrudgingly and heartbreakingly, she divorced me. It just isn't reality. 

I've always hated that her friends still view me this way, but I don't think about it too much these days. **However,** all of these friends are coming into town this weekend for a party for our son, and she invited them. Which is fine - except I'm anxious as ALL HELL to see them for the first time since, knowing that they think I selfishly ruined our lives.

I talked to my ex about this and asked her to clear the story up with them. She flipped out on me and we fought about it. She even said at one point ""It felt like cheating, so it was cheating."" 

I know that it's crazy town to personally go up to each of her friends and ""set the story straight,"" but I don't know how to handle seeing them all this weekend. I really don't want them to think this horrible thing of me. 

Is there anything I can do?

**TL;DR**: My ex and I agreed to separate when our son was two. I slept with a friend. She told everyone that I cheated on her, and *that's* the reason we got divorced. I don't know how to face them this weekend, and really want to set the story straight. Is there any way to maintain face here?"

"My wife [31/F] feels guilty about something that isn't her fault. She's driving me [30/M] crazy with her contrition, I think it may be PTSD.


Throwaway because my wife knows my account. Hopefully she doesn’t see this.

Last July 4th weekend, my wife held a Saturday BBQ for friends and family. She was stressed-out and we got into an argument about an ingredient she needed. It's not easy to get and I needed to go a ways away to find it. So I did. 

Only, I never came back. Some drunken teenager and his friends t-boned me. The car was totaled and I was lucky I was alive. My wife didn't know and was fuming with how late I had become. Eventually, some State Troopers informed her where I was and even drove her to the hospital. 

Anyway, a half dozen surgeries later, a couple of days in a coma and some ICU action and I'm home. Of all the things that happened, I basically walked away without any long-term damage. I am still afraid of needles and never again need to be poked, prodded or invaded so long as I live, but, I'm good. 

My wife. Not so much. She beat herself up. Blamed herself for sending me out there. She would sit in the hospital room and cry when she thought I was asleep. Even now, 8 months later, we can't fight about anything; she quickly goes to pieces if I get upset with her; she gets shaky when I go to work, or if I'm going out for anything; if someone asks about the accident, she tears up and beings panting, says she can’t go into it. I sometimes wake-up because she keeps saying “sorry” in my ear. I mean it got to be a bit much. I have an L-shaped scar on my chest that is fairly prominent, but is slowly fading. After sex, or if I’m sleeping without a shirt, She runs her fingers down the scar and says: “I. Could. Have. Killed. You. Bad. [WifeofStawmThrowah]. Bad.”

We got a therapist, but that was, on the whole, not helpful. We tried two therapists. One was in her early twenties and basically had nothing constructive to add, only that she was single and basically kept asking how we met and about asking women out in general. The other, an older woman, was a loon, and kept asking if we felt a cosmic connection. All-in-all, it didn’t help my wife any, and only made her resistant to therapy. The thing is, her contrition hasn’t stopped. If I get annoyed with her and want to discuss an issue, she gets really emotional, apologizes, hugs me and then says something about how we have a second chance. Then she cries for 10 minutes. I really think she’s got PTSD from this – I got a new car and a sweet story to tell to get sympathy from friends, but it somehow really affected her. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Two bad therapist experiences has really made her avoidant to any further therapy. I told our family doctor who seems to agree with me, but says that I can’t unilaterally force her into therapy. Meanwhile, we haven’t discussed anything in 8 months and I can’t go 10 minutes without her around my either getting upset because I’m going to work or moping while I watch Seinfeld reruns on TV.

tl;dr I think my wife has PTSD and I have no experience with this. I can't seem to get her back into therapy and I'm not sure how to proceed. This is starting to drive me a bit batty. "
"Me [20M] with my Step Brother [22M] wont talk to me or even acknowledge me because I had a guy friend sleep over in my room.


***I'm a girl, I didn't realize I put M instead of F.

This started about 2 months ago.  

To put a little bit of background on this situation.  I currently live with my step sister (20) and my step brother (22) and his girlfriend (23) in a house.  

I want to lay out all the facts and make the story seem as unbiased as possible.  I just need to know if I'm being the unreasonable one here.

My step brother has been a little bit over protective recently.  I just got out of a 2 year bad relationship at the beginning of December.

I moved into my sisters house toward the end of December.

About a month and a half to 2 months ago I had a guy friend sleep over during the week.  For the story's sake I'm going to call him B.  We kind of have a friends with benefits thing going on so we had sex and just hung out in my room the whole night.  We weren't loud and didn't interact with anyone else that was in the house. 

I had work the next day so I had to wake up early.  I woke up B the next morning and told him I needed to leave so he should too.  He's super not a morning person so he kinda woke up, I was in a rush and just left (a mistake on my part).  I thought he was going to be right out the door a couple minutes after me but he ended up falling back asleep.  

My brother called me at work at around 9:00 am telling me that B was still in my room sleeping.  My brothers gf was getting upset and told my brother she didn't feel comfortable taking a shower with a ""stranger"" in the house.  

I told my brother I would call B and tell him to leave.  I did that and B ended up leaving soon after my brother had called me.

I'll admit that this was a mistake on my part.  I shouldn't have had him sleep over when I couldn't really attend to him when I woke up.

I talked to my step brother about it and my brother told me that I'm not allowed to have sex in the house or have guys sleep over overnight.  I didn't really agree but I just said if I have friends sleep over, from this point on I'll only have them stay if I'm going to be home in the morning as well.  My step sister didn't really know any of this had happened, and I was worried for her to find out.  My brother told me that he would promise not to tell my sister about it if I didn't have someone over again.  He had told me if my sister found out she would get super mad and that she would tell our parents.  

I just kinda brushed it off because he was being a little dramatic in my opinion.

My sister owns the house that we all live in so she makes all the rules basically.  The only thing I was worried about was making her uncomfortable in her house.  

My brother does not have a job or pay rent.  He goes to bed at 4am and wakes up at around 2 or 3 pm.  He relies on his Gf for food and gas money, and she pays half the rent that she is supposed to because she is tight on money.

I ended up talking to my sister about it because she found out about it through my brothers gf.  She told me that since I pay for my room, I can do what I want to in there.  She said that if I wanted to fuck 10 guys in there at the same time she wouldn't care (her words haha).  She also told me that if I wanted to have my friends sleep over that I could.  

So this past weekend I had a guy friend over that I am just friends with. 

It was late on Saturday night and my friend lives about an hour away, so I offered for him to stay at my place in my room for the night.  (Plus we were both drunk and I didn't want him driving) I'll call him M.

My brother has always been a little bit stand off ish toward my guy friends because he thinks every guy that I hang out with I'm having sex with.  So he wasn't happy that I was hanging out with M in general.

I asked my sister if M could sleep over and she said okay.  She told me to send a group text with my brother, his gf, and my sister in it and let everyone know that M was sleeping over.  

My sister was the first to respond with a ""k cool :)"".  My sister gf who I have never talked to about any of this said ""I thought we agreed no boys sleeping in the bedroom."" and my sister responded with ""What? No..? its her room and her friend.""

My brothers gf went on to say that her and my brother had talked about it and they agreed that I wasn't allowed to have guys sleep over.  

At around 2 in the morning my brother knocked on my door.  My friend was passed out next to me with his own blanket completely not touching me.  I was just on my computer reading reddit (haha).

My brother said we needed to go for a drive, I said okay.  I was still really drunk and I don't remember much about what my brother said.  He basically told me what I was doing wasn't okay.

I had M sleep over anyways to kinda prove a point to my brother. (just wanna say again we did nothing romantic)

Also my brother had 2 friends over already and they were both in the living room on the couch. 

The rest of the weekend neither my brother or my brothers gf would make eye contact or acknowledge me.

I ended up having to text my brother to ask him why this is such a huge deal to him.  He told me I don't respect him as a person because I broke a promise to him.  He said that he doesn't even care that people are sleeping over in my room, it was the ""promise"" that I broke that bothered him.

The promise that he is referring to is him not telling my sister about B sleeping over that one time if I didn't have another guy sleep over again.

I told my brother that our sister knew so there is no promise to keep.  He wouldn't acknowledge that and kept going on and on about the promise. 

I told him about how I felt about his friends sleeping over (one of his friends will stay over for 5 days at a time, which I'm not happy about but I don't say much about it), and that him and his gf share a bed and live together.  He brushed that off.  

I also said that he doesn't really have the right to tell me what I can do with my room.  I pay for my space.  He does not.  He said that since it makes him uncomfortable that I have sex in my room it becomes a house problem and he has a right to say something about it.

He then called me selfish and self centered and said that all I do is fuck guys, get drunk, and smoke.  (All of which I really don't do often).  He then said that this house isn't like a dorm and I shouldn't treat it like one.  He said that I don't respect him at all. He also said that I snaked behind his back by asking my sister what she thought about guys sleeping over.  

I got irritated and told him if he's going to attack me like that I can say that its not okay to not have a job and play computer 90% of the time.  Again he didn't acknowledge that I said that.

Its just sucking a lot because I work with my sister and my brothers gf.  My brothers gf wont talk to me at work, and we need to talk to get work done.  She told me it was low of me to tell my brother that he doesn't have a job (???) 

I texted everyone and told them we need to have a house meeting tonight.  I'm really not sure what to do because I've tried to talk to them but my brother told me ""he's done being an older brother"" and that ""it doesn't matter anymore"".

I'm just not sure what to say anymore because my brother keeps telling me what I'm doing ""wrong"", but says its different for his situation and its okay for him to do it.

For the record I think I'm a pretty good roommate otherwise.  I clean my messes in the shared space and clean up things that aren't even mine.  I'm not loud and try and be nice in general.  

This is the only issue my brother and I have ever had.

"Me (f22) with my neighbors(mf20's?): they saved my cat, how do I thank them?


My neighbors and myself are all in our 20's. We've never spoken to each other. 

Today, my cat was chased up a tall tree by two giant dogs. Kitty was not coming down anytime soon and was yowling to wake the dead. Dogs got chased away, but I couldn't get to my cat. 

In come my two neighbors, and one of them climbs a tall fence and spends the next ten minutes nudging my cat down the tree, getting very scratched up for his efforts. 

I was thanking them profusely during, and afterwards as well, as well as apologizing for his injuries and all the trouble. He said no biggie. 

But I'm the type of person that carries around a lot of guilt. Right now I'm feeling very guilty for letting my cats out and for all that mess with the rescue. I want to bake them something, or buy them nice chocolates, or something like that. 

I need advice from y'all. Is that over kill or a kind gesture? 

**Edit**: Thank you all for some wonderful suggestions! Some of them were really cute, and if I had the confidence to do them, I would. Instead I opted to keep it simple and bake them cookie-brownies. They were delivered with a lot of gratitude. Again, thanks to all! Internet cookie-brownies for everyone!

"Me [25F] with my fiance [25M] dating 6 years, engaged 6 months, his mother is still on his bank account.


My fiance still has the same bank account he had in high school.  The bank says there is no way to remove his mother from it without her written consent or her being the one to do so,  even though he is no longer a minor.  In a normal family,  maybe all he would need to do is ask his mother to do that,  but his mother is crazy.  

Like,  actually mentally unstable.  Which is a large part of the reason I want her off the accounts.  He has our joint account and two credit cards linked to that account (his personal,  and our joint),  and I'm afraid that if she went off the deep end,  she could do some serious damage. 

He gets annoyed whenever I bring it up,  because it would be ""a hassle"" to close that account and transfer the money to a new account,  re-set up auto debits for certain bills (though the only bill he pays on his own is his car payments and the insurance on my engagement ring which is due yearly,  everything else we pay jointly). 

I am worried about her name still being on that account for two reasons.  First,  I don't trust her not to decide we have somehow wronged her and that she is entitled to all of our money, or to take money from us to ""punish us"" (she used to do this with personal belongings when we briefly lived with her a few years ago,  I wouldn't put anything past her).  Also,  in the unthinkable event that anything happens to him,  she gets any of that money as the other person on the account.  That sounds petty,  but if we have kids in the future and I need that money to support them? Or cover other costs? I don't trust his mother to give it to me. 

Fiance says I'm making too big a deal out of this and it would be an unthinkable hassle to open a new account.  He seems to conveniently forget that I had to do this when I moved to our current city because my old bank doesn't exist down here.  
It wasn't that much of a hassle.  You get your new info,  you enter it everywhere you have auto debits,  you transfer all the money over and you close the old account.  

I think he's being immature and lazy about this and I feel like he's not taking our future financial security seriously.  Am I making too big of a deal of this?

"My [29 F] best friend [29 F] asked me if I dislike her husband [34 M] and I don't want to lie. Help me decide what to say?


If you check my history, you can see how I've outlined why I dislike my friend's husband. But the TLDR is: My best friend (Laura)'s husband is a shitty life partner. He is selfish and extremely annoying. He won't offer to help, and if asked he'll agree and then disappear when you need help. When Laura cooks, she can't put food on the table or he'll eat it all without her getting any. He enjoys bugging her and thinks it's amusing to annoy her. He says awkward sexual jokes. He repeats questions 5 times in a row, even after having been answered. His parents are crazy with his mom being a hoarder and dad an actual creep who makes Laura uncomfortable. She argues that her husband is like this because of his parents upbringing and I feel, while they may be the cause, he has a responsibility to realize these issues and work on them.

Since the previous post, I've carried on internalizing my annoyance for her husband (Tom [34 M]). I still try to see the positive in him, and I think he's growing on me, but this goes back and forth depending on his behaviour.

Married for a few months now, their marriage is already rocky and Laura is now going to therapy alone for her stress levels. Tom's driving her crazy and while I don't think he's the only cause of her stress, him and his family are about 90% of it. 

Recently she sort of broke down in text to us (myself and our mutual friend, Mia [29 F]) telling us how they're fighting over him bugging her so much. With her therapist pointing out that Tom is childlike, Laura told us he was immature and she wasn't sure he was ready for marriage. We met with her and reiterated what she said in the text to us and told her we agreed. I suggested ways to combat his annoying behaviour, like asking him what he's feeling when he won't stop ""poking her"" (it's something different, but I'll say he pokes her as a replacement for what he does). Or getting him a stress ball. It felt productive and while we did bring up what she said on her text and agreed with what was said, everything seemed fine.

So our friend Mia has recently gotten into a very serious relationship with someone from Tom's friend group. Mia's guy is great and my spouse and him get along very well. Since Mia has a guy now, us 3 couples do a ton together. In the beginning, Laura mentioned how me and her didn't really double date, but now Mia has a guy, I seem to want triple dates. In the past, we HAVE gone on a couple of double dates with Laura and Tom, but there is something to be said for all 3 best friends having spouses finally and being together as a big group. Before Mia dated her guy, she said she wanted a guy like mine.. which basically meant a light hearted nice person because all her past guys have been abusive. So now that she's with someone great, we talk so fondly about him and how him and my guy are so cute together. They have things in common, they'll jokingly pose together for photos. You can see a good friendship blossoming between them, and I love this since my spouse doesn't have friends and it makes him sad. The problem is my guy also can't stand Tom and doesn't click with him. Hanging out in a group is fine, hanging out in a guy group is fine, but he doesn't want one on one with Tom. My guy and Mia's guy haven't even hung out one on one YET, but Laura is noticing and is already upset.

Well this all came to head when I was chatting with the girls about how my spouse was sad and needs to make effort for friends if he wants them. Mia says ""well, he did text my guy recently"" and I said ""oh? That's good"". And then Laura says ""y'know, Tom is around too!"".

I go back to talking about my guy's situation and don't acknowledge Laura's comment to avoid saying anything. Mia says ""oh, Tom's schedule is tough"" (I'm not sure why she said that). Laura then straight up says she fears we don't like Tom, and I don't know how to respond to that. We have kept our rants to ourselves, but she's picked up on things that I don't think we can filter. Or were we not careful and being rude? I think it really just comes down to our guys clicking and me not pushing my guy to be friend with Tom (which I shouldn't have to do).

I don't want to lie. Even if I wanted to lie for the sake of our relationship, it would be like saying ""no, that's all in your head"", and it's not. But I do NOT want to lose her friendship. I need to be tactful in my response. Mia responded very tactfully, but she did say ""I don't think he's good enough for our best friend"" and my sister says that's terrible to say and my spouse says if we say that we will lose her. What do I say to not lie, but also keep her friendship and be tactful?

**TLDR: My best friend's husband is a shitty partner and is driving her insane. She complains about him and wants advice, so we discuss it. But she sees my spouse and our mutual friend's spouse are becoming friends and that, (coupled with us agreeing with her complaints about her husband?) have made her realize we don't like her husband. How do I avoid lying but also not ruin our friendship?**

"My husband [31M] is upset with me [30F] for wanting to rent a smaller apartment to save money.


My husband and I recently found out we had to move and have started looking at apartments. I was recently promoted at work: the good news is I will be making a LOT more money, the bad news is I have been transferred, and we are moving to another state.

We went to look together, and during the process he didn't have much to say other than to layout his stringent requirements. (example: it must have granite countertops, it must have all hardwood floors). We finally found a place that met all of both our criteria, though it was a little on the higher end of our price range.

I asked him multiple times for his opinion, and he didn't really have much to say except that ""they're nice apartments, let's go ahead and apply"". So I found myself answering all the questions of the leasing agent and filling out all the forms.

We decided on the one bedroom. We had talked previously about getting a two bedroom for the extra space, but the one bedroom was pretty spacious and it was about $220 per month cheaper.

I thought this would be the best option for us to save money. I think $220 a month is a lot, especially since we agreed I will be paying 2/3 of the rent. (The reason for this is that my job pays much more than his. When we got married we decided to keep our finances separate.)

When we got back to the hotel later that night, he was in a really bad mood and I finally got him to admit what was wrong: he wanted the two bedroom instead of the one bedroom.

I asked him, why didn't you tell me? His answer was that ""he was dropping hints"" but I seemed ""set"" on the one bedroom.

So we had a long discussion that was never really resolved, and now I need advice on what to do.

I still feel the one bedroom is the best option. Like I said, $220 a month is a lot of money, and I will be paying for most of it. I feel that just because we CAN afford the two bedroom doesn't mean we SHOULD. **We do still both have car payments, plus utilities, gas, groceries, and a dog to care for.** We could put that $220 into savings every month. If we go with the two bedroom, we will likely have almost nothing to put towards savings, which doesn't sit well with me because we are supposed to be saving for a house.

He wants the two bedroom so that people from out of town can come visit and stay the night. I know the reason for this: his parents are very cheap and if they have to choose between staying in hotel or not coming, they will choose not to come. I can sympathize with his reasoning, but I don't think it's right for us to have to drop an extra two hundred every month so his parents can save money a few times a year.

However, I know he has made some sacrifices for me in order to move. It is a lot to ask someone to move to a whole different state for you. He is coming with me and leaving all of his family and friends behind.

What should I do? Should I stand my ground and go with the one bedroom because I feel it's the best decision financially, or should I appease him and call to see if we can apply for the two bedroom instead to make him happier and because of the sacrifices he's made for us to move for my job?

**TL;DR: One bedroom apartment will allow us to live comfortably and save a little money, Two bedroom apartment will stretch our budget but husband will be happier with a guest room for friends and family. Which one should I choose?**"
"My new boss is Michael Scott from The Office.


I (26M) recently started a new job where my boss is quite a character and I'm having trouble wanting to stick around and could use some advice.  

Background: The company I work for is fairly small.  Our department is the smallest with just three employees. Hierarchy is me supervised by Bossman (~50M) who is supervised by LadyBoss (~50F).  LadyBoss started in her position 9 months ago.  Bossman has been working here for four years without a lot of supervision.  I was given a brand new position under Bossman, my skillset is fairly unique and I believe that I offer a lot to this company.  LadyBoss offered me more money and changed my job title after our first interview because of how impressed she was. LadyBoss is very Type A, extremely organized and by the book.  Bossman is the exact opposite.  Two completely opposite ends of the spectrum.  

I've just come on board about a month ago and I can already tell everyone in the company is very frustrated and annoyed by Bossman.  He doesn't have great social cues.  He talks nonstop, if I try to speak at all he just starts talking over me.  He is disorganized.  He tries to be funny but is the only one who laughs at his jokes.  I'd wager he's got Adult ADD.  Think Michael Scott  from the Office.  He is a very nice man who means well but he is extremely annoying.

If he was good at his job but had those quirks I wouldn't mind but as far as I can tell his decision making process is flawed and he makes bad choices when it comes to purchasing equipment and supplies.

It is hard for me to believe that he has been doing this job for four years but it seems like he didn't have any supervision for most of that time so he was left to his own devices and his poor choices weren't picked up on.  His disorganization and lack of professionalism are very obviously frustrating to type A LadyBoss but the way she goes about handling it is also unprofessional IMO.  She will call him out in meetings, often treating him like a child.  (Just yesterday he was giving a presentation to some of the other higher ups in the company and he wouldn't stop eating out of the snack bowl on the conference table during his presentation so LadyBoss picked up the bowl and moved it away from him.)

LadyBoss complains about him to his face.  Bossman complains about LadyBoss to me behind her back.  I try to stay out of it but I 100% feel like the child while Mom and Dad are fighting at the kitchen table.  I've been asked to take sides on a couple of occasions and have tried to use as much tact and diplomacy as possible but I find myself usually taking LadyBoss' side.

Bossman acts like I'm always on his side and looks to me for backup because we work together but I disagree with him constantly.

Normally, I would just do my job and deal with my boss because usually I don't work with my boss very often but I work with him directly about 75% of my week.

I know this is a long post and it seems like I'm just bitching at this point but I love this job and what it entails but every day that I have to deal with him (every day) I end up being in a terrible mood and ask myself is it worth it.

Does anyone have any experience with a boss like this or can anyone give some advice?

TL;DR - My boss is just like Michael Scott, no one at work likes him, I love the job but hate my boss, we work together almost every single day.  How do I handle it?

"My [21M] girlfriend [21F] of 4 months was asked to be her male friend's date for a frat Valentine's Day semi-formal and she said yes (without talking to me) - am I right to be upset by this?


See update.

**Edit:** The event isn't actually *on* Valentine's Day, it's a few days before but it's themed for Valentine's.

So my girlfriend was invited to be this male friend of her's date at a Valentine's frat ""semi-formal"" because his girlfriend is long distance and would not be able to come.

They've known each other for a couple of years but it still makes me really uncomfortable and I think it's disrespectful to me and our relationship. This is a Valentine's day event, people will be there with girlfriends and actual dates.

Apparently he asked her ""will he [OP] be okay with this"" and she told him that ""I wouldn't mind"" without consulting me.

She told me all this earlier today and I just sort of went aloof and didn't say much because I needed to think very carefully about my words.

I sent her a message about how it makes me feel uncomfortable two hours ago but she hasn't seen it yet.

She and I had a very loose date plan for the day of this event (not Valentine's day itself) and I'm disappointed that this has now ruined them. She genuinely forgot about the plans (like I said, they were not set in stone) but I feel like I've been put secondary here.

Am I right to tell her that this whole thing has made me pretty uncomfortable? I don't like that she would go to an event as a dude's date, I don't like that she told him I wouldn't mind without consulting me, I don't like that it's a fucking Valentines themed event and I don't like that it has messed up what I had in mind for that day (go out for dinner and a movie, stay over at her's).

I don't think I'm being controlling by letting her know this (in a very carefully worded and calm way). I would speak in person but I wont see her for a couple of days and it would be weird to message/chat like I'm ok and then drop this shit on her.

Thanks.

-----   
**TL;DR** - My girlfriend accepting an invite to a Valentine's semi-formal event with one of her male friends. She thought I wouldn't mind but I do because to me this the sort of thing you reserve purely for you and your partner. I don't fully trust the motivations of this dude and the whole thing just makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable.

The event has also messed up some plans I had in mind for the weekend with her.

Am I justified to be upset and tell her as much?

-----

**Update:** She responded to my message well and told me she was sorry and felt horrible about it all because she'd sort of told him yes in the moment, in person and it was afterwards she started to worry about how it might affect me. In her mind it was more about doing a favor for a friend than anything else and she made it clear there was nothing to worry about. She apologized for her forgetfulness about our weekend plans and said she had somewhere special planned for a date to make up for it. She was genuinely thankful for the way I went about talking to her about it (not overreacting etc) and was glad I let her know.

She spoke with the friend and he was able to find someone else.

All in all it went perfectly and I'm glad to have spoken with her about it. Thanks for the advice and Happy Valentine's everyone. This was a valuable lesson in communication!

**And in response to those saying I was looking for confirmation bias...**: Look at the times of the comments I responded to. Sort the comments section by ""old"" instead of ""best"". Those were the original comments. I read them, replied and then went to bed. Now when I look 24 hours later the theme to all the answers is way different to the first 10 comments or so. Heck, they're all downvoted now.

I wasn't looking for confirmation, there just weren't comments being particularly critical of me because this thing hadn't all blown up."
"Me [19F] with my Mom [55F]. We are fighting because her friend/business partner was extremely creepy with me and she doesn't believe me.


Throwaway because I'm pretty sure everyone I know is on redditt. 

Just a bit of context my mother and I were in the States (I'm Canadian) renovating her recently deceased brothers' house so we could sell it. We were working with a contractor - let's call him Chris - that she knew because he was married to her real estate agent. He is around my mom's age. 

Long story short we got pretty close with their family and spent a lot of time at their house, I even babysat their six year old daughter from time to time. I got along really well with him, we would joke around a lot, it seemed like it was just a good friendship. 

However, a couple of times he would say something to me that was a little unsettling. Once when he was driving me home from babysitting, we were joking, and I heard him say very quietly ""You know exactly what you're doing, don't you?"". I shrugged it off because I didn't really hear him and again, nothing had happened to make me think he was creepy in any way. Another time he made some offhand joke about how my looks could stop traffic when a car honked while going by. 

Now, fast forward about a month and I'm at his house with my mom. We'd both had some wine and were a little tipsy so we decided to sleep in their guest room. I stayed up a little later to watch TV, as did Chris, but everyone else was asleep. He asked me if I wanted to go outside and smoke some weed, I said no, but eventually he convinced me - I was a little drunk. 

When we were outside, we smoked and were looking at the stars and then he asked me if I wanted a hug because I was cold. I said no, he moved in anyway. I did not hug him back but immediately seized up. The hug lasted a long time, and he kept rubbing my back - overall a very uncomfortable situation. Eventually he pulled away but did not move from my personal space - this is when I ran. He tried to grab my elbow but I kept moving, went upstairs and spent the whole night shaking. 

I told my mom and she immediately asked me if I was sure that's what happened, citing the fact that I had been drinking. I was emphatic, I know what happened and I know it could have been worse had I not left. I've been assaulted before, and she knows this, I know what it feels like when something wrong is happening. She again challenged me, saying I had been flirting with him a little. This is what pushed me over. 

I was 18 at the time, he is a grown man, even if I was flirting - which I was not - he should not have engaged in any kind of suggestive behaviour with me. As an adult it's his responsibility to step back. 

I went home two days later, but not before she forced me to be in a room with him and talk about it - I stayed silent while he openly blamed me for thinking it was wrong, again the ""you were drunk, you misinterpreted it."" 

My mom and I have been through therapy to deal with this, but she still doesn't believe me and continues to spend time with him and be friends with him. I am considered cutting contact with her, but I don't want to cause a rift in my family. 

Am I overreacting to what happened with Chris? Or am I overreacting with my response? Any advice is welcome.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My mom's friend/business partner made me uncomfortable with suggestive comments/behaviour, but she doesn't believe me that anything happened. I am considering cutting contact and need help. 

EDIT: So this has kind of blown up and I was going to try to reply to comments but it got really overwhelming so I'm just going to try and address the main things people are saying here. 

Yes, I know I was an adult at the time, and I was in no way trying to say there was anything illegal going on. What I meant by that section of the post was that the gap in maturity as an adult between an 18 and 55 year old is A LOT and even if I had been flirting with him, if he truly had good intentions like he said, he should not have encouraged it.

Secondly, a lot of you have said that I should break contact with her for the time being and talk to my dad. I'm going to try and do this, and will hopefully have updates soon. Thanks so much for all your support, this has been really helpful for me. "
