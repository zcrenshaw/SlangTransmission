"My [26F] sister's [22F] friend [22F] is a nurse and told my sister some test results of mine. Should I report her?


I had to get a TB test done for some clinic work I'll be doing this year in my grad school program. My sister's friend works as a nurse at the clinic I go to. She wasn't the one who took my blood for the test and as far as I know, the nurses don't actually do the lab work. 

Anyway, I got a call from my sister a few days later saying ""Tina"" told her my TB test was positive. Now, due to the nature of my grad school subject I know that sharing medical information is HIGHLY prohibited and she could get fired or worse. I don't really care if my sister knows my test results, but apparently she was talking about this at a party. It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that. 

Initially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing. 

Thoughts?

TL;DR My sister's friend shared my medical test results. Should I say anything to the clinic?
 
Oh and regarding the TB, I had further testing done and it's latent. I'm going to get treated for it but it's not active or contagious. "

"[UPDATE] I[29F] feel like I'm wasting my life by staying with my husband [29M]


I have a mini update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xmc3v/i_29f_feel_like_im_wasting_my_life_by_staying/).


I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who commented. I read them all but only got back to the first few who wrote in because yesterday turned into a shit show. 


In the morning I said I wanted to go off and do my own thing (it was actually just running errands) for an hour or so alone. He said he had shit to do. Whatever...too early for me to be pissed off, so I dropped it.


I asked again later, suggested he take our child to the park next to us since she's always asking to do stuff with daddy instead of me. Again...said no, he was going to do stuff with his hobby.


So, I broke down. I told him I needed help and that I *needed* a break from just being stuck at home 24/7 being a mom and wife. His response was that he didn't understand why I needed a break, but if I did I could just hang out in my room alone to get away from our child and him. And then asked me to make him lunch. 


I think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. I have no fucks left to give, obviously he never had any. I'm still not sure what my next move is, but I think it involves finding a job and starting a better future without him. 


TL;DR: Thanks for the comments on the first post, things are a little clearer now. "
"I'm [23F] pregnant, and I screwed up really badly. My SO [25M] is devastated and I finally told him the truth.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xun54/im_23f_pregnant_and_i_screwed_up_really_badly_my/

Hi :)

I feel like I should address a very important topic that got a bit misunderstood in my original post before diving into the update.
I know a lot of young girls, much younger than me, read this sub and I don't want anyone going through what I did when I was 15.

I've said my whole life I didn't want kids, and I really didn't, until now. I want this baby because I want this baby, because I know I can be a good mom. I didn't decide to have this baby because I was scared my boyfriend would leave, I didn't decide to have this baby to make him happy and I certainly didn't decide to have this baby due to some romantic fantasy. No woman, no girl should be pressured into having a kid and there's absolutely no shame in not wanting that or getting an abortion. You gotta do what you can, need and want to do, not what other people think it's best.
 
Also, protection. Dick is the only man in my life with whom I had unprotected sex with and relied solely on the pill and the reason for that is because I trust him and he trusts me. I'm not talking about pregnancy, I'm talking about STDs and all that. I messed up on the pills, but it wasn't on purpose, so I couldn't just sit him down and say: 'hey, we need condoms for the rest of this month' because when the month did come to an end, I saw that I had two pills left and I just froze. I told him immediately, and that's why when the pregnancy symptoms started coming up, he knew what was up right away. 

That said, I'd also like to thank everyone who commented. I left a thank you note in the original post, and I wish I could reply to everyone. You guys were amazing and encouraging and kind. Thank you so much.

Now, the update.

So last night Dick came home, and after a few awkward moments where I kept building up the strength to tell him everything, and he kept looking at me knowing I was up to something, I finally confessed.

I apologized for the outburst and for saying I didn't want our baby. I told him I really didn't meant it and went on to explain the reason why I reacted the way I did. I told him that after he left, I was pregnant, didn't know and miscarried. Told him about the stay at the hospital and how everyone thought I was a suicidal teenager and how much worse that made things. Everyone hovered over me, expecting me to just break down, and it was an awful experience. 

He was very shaken, and looking at me without saying anything, processing it all in. I apologized for not telling him back then, and said that I just didn't think it would change anything. We were still minors, and he'd still have to live in another country with his parents and it'd only add more grief to a relationship I cherished more than anything. I was also so angry and bitter and depressed that any rational thought just flew over my head to the point anything related to pregnancy sent me into a crying spell. Told him that I felt betrayed by my own body, that even if I wouldn't have kept the baby back then, it was still my decision to make, it was still my responsability and things just sneaked up on me in such a way that I lost control.

I told him that I really want this baby, and apologized again. I started crying and talking through sobs, and he just hugged me, trying to comfort me. When I was calmer, he was wonderful about it all. He told me it was okay, said he was sorry I had to go through that alone and that if he knew, he would have helped me.

He forgave me for the outbursts and for saying such shitty things.

We're fine, and we booked an appointment with the OBGYN tomorrow. I'm happy, he's happy and I feel a thousand times lighter.

Again, thank you very much for the support, I'll never forget it.

"My gf [24 F] of 3 months never cuddles with me [27 M] since she has always been a ""non-cuddler"" and when we recently went on vacation she slept on the spare bed in the hotel room to avoid sleeping with me.


This is an update post! this is probably the quickest update ever but it's such a happy update that I just want to share with everyone :)

Original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x58pn/my_gf_24_f_of_3_months_never_cuddles_with_me_27_m/d6dk9f4?context=3

So I read a lot of the advice and decided that I was going to talk to her about a possible break up. I know this makes me sound like a shit person but honestly I'm just a very touchy guy and express my affection by touching and being touched. Not being able to cuddle or hold hands or sleep next to my girlfriend was not going to work out for me and just felt like a constant tease you'd get from a long distance relationship where you'd think about holding and cuddling your gal or guy but just don't end up doing it. Honestly it was not gonna work out. 

I brought my gf to my house after telling her we had to chat. I started by telling her that I'm really sorry and like her very much but I don't think things will work out with our different cuddling preferences. She started crying and said she didn't want me to be turned off by this but she actually loves cuddling but has a ""sweating disorder"" and when she cuddles she gets super sweaty like I'm talking hella sweaty. She said her ex boyfriend dumped her because of her sweating and she said that's why she didn't want to cuddle with me. She said the same thing happens when she holds hands and she gets super sweaty. She said she was afraid cuddling with me would make me leave her like with her ex in the past.

I felt bad that I've been giving her so much shit about it and it was like an insecurity she had and I told her that I don't really care if she sweats on me its all good. She laughed and said ""no I actually sweat buckets"" and I told her ""can you sweat buckets on me?"" :P she thought about it and then she said ""okay but don't break up with me over it if I sweat too much!"" In a joking voice. 

She layed beside me and we cuddled and it felt so fucking good to finally feel that with her. She actually managed to sweat so much that my shirt was pretty wet and the bed sheet was soaked and I told her that I found it pretty cool. She said that she is so happy that someone appreciates cuddles and doesn't mind the sweating and I was just so happy we were finally cuddling. I told her I didn't mind getting soaked cuddling and said ""at least now we can have kisses in the rain in bed"" and she couldn't stop laughing. She asked if we could hold hands in bed to show me how sweaty her hands get and again my hands were wet as hell which I didn't mind. She said ""if you ever need to wash your hands and there's no sink available just hold my hands!"" Which was really cute.

It's been an amazing day and I'm just really happy things worked out. I told her that if she felt like things her ex said to her were hurting her and still making her feel insecure she should really consider maybe seeing a therapist to help her feel more comfortable. She agreed and said that the fact that I like her sweating lifted a burden off her shoulders since she loves cuddles. Hopefully all goes well!

Tldr; she is an excessive sweater that's all :P"
"Me (34F) with my BF (41M) of 2 years. Got mad at me because I took my cat (16M) to a park for the cat's birthday. Am I really a crazy cat lady?


I've had my cat since he was 6 months old. He was an ""unadoptable"" rescue. He had so called unsurviveable pneumonia, and when healthy, was nothing but fear aggression. I was basically cat hospice. 

Well, he lived. And he loved. He's the purring-est, snuggliest, sweetest cat. He is now a chubby 16 year old with arthritis (treated with Dasuquin, which has helped immensely, but he's not a kitten anymore).

We used to live in a first floor apartment where we could sit outside and I could read and he could be on his tie out and watch birds. Now we don't anymore.

Shortly before his 16th birthday, he slipped and/or fell off the bathroom vanity. I didn't see it happen, I only saw the cat who couldn't stand without screaming afterwards. We rushed him to the vet and miraculously nothing was broken, but that left the question of what he DID do. Even in a bad sprain, it may always be weak and he may never walk normally again, or walk at all. If he tore a tendon or ligament, it was basically over. Orthopedic surgeries and senior cats don't usually end well. 

For a week and a half, we brought him food and water. We gave him his pain meds. We set him in the litter and held him up. We lifted him onto and off of the bed. It was basically a cat nursing home up in here. 

Just when we thought he would never get up again, he did exactly that. Then he walked a few steps. Then it was cat PT. Making him go a little further every day. Getting his strength back up.

A month later, aside from sitting over on one hip when he sits, you would never know he had ever been hurt.

For his 16th, I loaded him into the car (which he doesn't mind at all) and took him to a park by the lake. He spent a couple hours watching ducks and warming his old bones in the sun. 

My boyfriend was indignant. How the cat doesn't even know it's his birthday, what a waste of time, who does that, etc etc. 

No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys. He knows he feels better than he had been. He knows those things. 

Now it's 3 months later and my BF is STILL on about cat birthday outings. Idgi. He helped care for him when,he was injured and did probably more than I did, because I work 10 hour shifts. So I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is? I mean, there's whole parks devoted to dogs where dogs can see their dog friends. So what's weird about taking a cat out for one afternoon? He's really starting to make me feel like shit about it.

tl;dr Senior cat was seriously injured. He recovered, and I took him to the park to celebrate his 16th bday. BF is acting like I murdered his family over it. Am I crazy?"
"[UPDATE] My [19F] manager [25M] had unlocked my phone and was recording a private video of me and my partner onto his own phone, and I caught him


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4skueq/my_19f_manager_25m_had_unlocked_my_phone_and_was/

Hello everyone. First of all, big apologies for how long overdue this update is. Since the rules limit me for one update only I wanted to have the most full outcome to give you. Thank you all so, so much for your help and support and advice, I didn't expect so many people to respond to me and I really am grateful.

Sadly the outcome isn't so happy. My conclusion from the original post was to go to highest management first and then police if the result wasn't satisfactory, which is what I did. 

I went straight to the store manager the morning after my post and was advised to write up and sign a formal grievance, which I did. I then met with two other managers to discuss the details of what happened and any other relevant stuff. They told me they'd talk to the manager in question and any witnesses and get back to me in a week after investigations had taken place. In the meantime, my manager was not allowed to work with me and was told to reschedule all his shifts or work elsewhere. 

A week passed and I heard nothing. When I went to find out, apparently due to staff holidays it couldn't be completed in time. I asked how much longer and was told a week. I felt this was too long and was really restless by this point already and so my boyfriend came with me to speak to the police. 

We explained the situation and my details were taken down and then we met with a sergeant. To summarise, she told us that in the UK there is no specific law against accessing someone's private phone/recording off someone's private phone without permission. As such, they are unable to search his phone as no arrests can be made. The only thing they could do was go to his house and explain it had been reported and that if he ever distributed it he would be arrested, which they did, and he LIED TO THE POLICE and said he hadn't done anything. Sadly, they said there was nothing more they could do.

The internal investigation then concluded and I was told my manager had denied everything, made up a false excuse for the apology text he sent me and basically called me a liar. They told me that there is no CCTV where it happened and nobody who was in the area at the time saw anything (no shit, they were the complete opposite end of the room, as I had already explained). They tried to say they weren't taking sides, but to be honest it seemed like they were. They're moving ME from the department instead of him, because moving him is ""harder"". I really enjoyed my job and now basically I have to suffer because my manager is a disgusting liar. They don't seem to care how serious this is. I ended up almost crying when they legitimately said ""maybe you didn't see anything at all"". I feel like they're accusing me of lying and imagining it, even though one of the managers involved was the one that caught me in the corridor bawling my eyes out.

I really wish I could've given a happy update. I'm so upset that I have to move and give up something I enjoy when he gets off without even a slap on the wrist, goes on knowing he can probably do this again to someone else and carry on being the scumbag he is, not to mention, he might still have the videos. He may have distributed them already but how the hell would I know. I have no idea what to do now. The police say nothing else can be done. If anyone has any legal advice around this issue within the UK law then I would be very very grateful for that. 

Sorry for the length, and if it's worded badly. Again, thank you all for your advice. I'm sorry this was a bad update.

tl;dr: Went to higher management and police about how I caught my manager recording a private video from my phone to his phone. He lied to both; management say not enough evidence to do anything, he gets to keep his job but I have to lose mine. Police say nothing can be done due to no UK law surrounding the subject.

"I [24F] found out my best friend [24F] had sex with my boyfriend [26F]; I'm upset and can't believe it


I don't where to begin. I feel so embarrassed coming here and asking for advice.

My boyfriend Steve and I have been dating for over a year in a half. I met him in one of my upper level classes two years ago. At the time he was finishing up his degree, before moving on and working on his masters. Since we started talking, seeing each other, and dating casually; I really loved our entire relationship. Steve and I had a lot of similar interests, which included traveling. We did a small trip to South America a couple months ago for a few weeks (Peru and Chile). We had an amazing time! It was once we got back form our trip that I saw our relationship in a  whole different way. We travelled well together, and bonded in a new way. I knew I was in a great relationship! 

I thought we had a great relationship, until I got some news a few days ago.

Three days ago, I went over to drop a macbook charger over at my best friends house, Chenelle. Chenelle and I have been best friend since we were in high school from the age of 16 years old. I have always considered her to be my number one, and closest person in my life. I have noticed that the past 6 months we haven't hangout in the same capacity that we usually have. Both of us have been busy with our lives (school, work, relationships, etc). But, I kinda got the feeling after this past year of university around April, that she was starting to drift. She had a shitty relationship with her ex that lasted under a year. He cheated on her with a coworker, and the rest is history. They broke ""officially"" around the end of January.

As I went over to drop off her extra charger that she borrowed, I talked with her mom for a bit. Chenelle ended up getting called in to pick up an extra serving shift at the restaurant she has worked at during her degree. Her mom wanted to talk to me about a few things. I was puzzled.. Chenelle's mom was always really outgoing and funny. We had known each other for over 8 years at least. But, she wanted to have a serous talk.

Chenelle's mom, ""Karen"", went on to tell me that she saw Steve and Chenille sneak around the back of the house about a month or so ago. Karen went on to explain that she noticed this happening two other times. At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. She told me that I should talk to Steve and Chenelle ASAP. 

Steve and I were supposed to go out for dinner last night. He picked me up, and off we went. I felt really gross and humiliated the entire time we were out. We ate dinner, had a couple drinks, but we didn't talk much. Steve kept asking me all night what was the matter. I told him ""nothing"".

Finally, when we got back to my place, we sat in my room and I asked him. I asked him, and told him what Chenelle's mom (Karen) told me. He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white. That gave me the answer I needed. I broke down and Steve tried to comfort me. I didn't want him touching me. I didn't even want to hear it! I told him to leave, but I basically had to force him to leave. I tried calling Chenelle and texted her that I needed to talk to her. I got no response. Not one. Basically, two of the closest people I have had in my life betrayed me. This is so terrible and I feel so shitty. I have like no one right now.

Sorry for all of the grammar and title mistakes.

"UPDATE - At what point should I [19F] tell potential partners that I can't have kids and will probably only live to 40?


Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xeqgr/at_what_point_should_i_19f_tell_potential/

First off - I decided to go bug my doctor. He's re-testing me for celiac. FINALLY. After I get the results for that I'm going to be tested for MS and Huntington's disease. Being loud and annoying really can work when you need it to!

Secondly - [23M] and I met up again, we got drunk and watched netflix. I somehow brought it up that my lifespan may be decreased and his response was ""Well that sucks. Just means you have to do more over the next 20 years, right?"" Hell yes.

I have a funny feeling that I'll be seeing him again soon.

TL;DR - Bugged doctor, being tested for more shit! Told [23M], we watched Happy Tree Friends all night.

I got this shit.

Edit - so much hate, whatever. All I can go by is what I've been told and the tests I've had done. Believe me if you want, don't if you don't. That's how the Internet works. 

Most people have been awesome on here, to those few who have not - I don't give any fucks. I know my life, my physical health, my mental health.

This post might be long, but I'm going to post it anyway. I hope it helps someone else, if they're in a similar situation. If you want the backstory, I'll type it out for reference (my own reference, and for others who may benefit). If not, just scroll down to the ""What I learned"" section. It's extremely important.


First off, Reddit, I'd like to thank you so much. To every single person who replied to me - you were a crucial voice in a chorus of people telling me to leave him.


**The tipping points:**


After my post, things got so much worse. I thought life would be better when I moved back to my hometown and saw him more often - but they didn't. He was just as untrusting, 3 times as clingy, and a million times more dissatisfied with our relationship.


On one hand, I was happy I could finally be with him. But he was not happy to be with me at all. He expected me to put up with so much. For example, one day we went to go pick up a paycheck at my work, then we were going to go to the mall. When I walked into work with him, he was basically acting like a child - tons of PDA, whining, etc. I work with kids, for crying out loud! I didn't want the kids, or my boss to see some guy hanging all over me and doing a baby voice trying to get me to kiss him. I told him to please wait until we got into the car, but he then insulted me, saying that I needed to get over my social anxiety. He sulked the entire day at the mall. I kept asking what was wrong, and he wouldn't tell me. I tried SO SO hard to find out if he was truly okay. I bought some jewelry at a store, and when we got into his car, I tried it on because I was excited. He blew up at me, calling me conceited and saying that it was so rude to be focusing on myself even though he was so sad. Even I knew that was complete bullshit - this was the first moment I had focused on myself all day.


The above story is just one example of the amount of times that I'd tell him to stop doing something --&gt; he'd sulk --&gt; I'd devote hours of energy trying to help him --&gt; he'd insult me for focusing on myself when I finally gave up. This pattern became very clear, especially in the weeks following.


In those weeks following, we both went on vacation. I wanted to enjoy my reunion with my family, but he was mad because I wasn't devoting enough of my time to him. When he went on vacation, a ton of truth was revealed. Long story short, his mom hit his sister one night when everyone was drunk. He was texting me and threatened that he would never forgive me if I went to bed instead of supporting him (it was 3am and I was very tired). He also said that the only person he'd ever loved was his sister, and that he isn't fulfilled by me because I'm not half the woman that she is. I understand he felt very betrayed by many people in his life at this moment, but his lack of appreciation for me in this moment really stood out as just plain rude.


A few days after the incident with his mom and sister happened, he confessed to me that both him and his sister have been hit before, but that he doesn't see anything wrong with it. Still, he claimed that he was ""ready to change"" and that he was going to improve himself as a person. I asked him if he was considering therapy to assure that he could maintain a healthy relationship with me despite his horrible relationship with his mom, and he said no. He said there was NOTHING wrong with him and that he would never go to therapy. Instead, he told me, he was going to join martial arts so that he could become stronger, and kill anyone who ever laid a hand on his sister. This was basically the tipping point. I understand rage and anger. I understand that sometimes you have the urge to hurt people. But I realized, in that moment, that if he ever found an excuse to hurt me - it could very well be permanent, or fatal. He is already extremely strong and big. I was afraid, and I didn't want to stick around and wait until he hurt me.
I told him this - I told him that becoming physically stronger was not the answer, that he needed to figure out how to work through his feelings. He told me, ""No, stop pushing me to go to therapy. If me refusing therapy is a dealbreaker, then so be it.""


At this point, I was feeling very strong and secure in myself. I had been seeing my therapist regularly, I had built up a group of online friends (that he didn't know about, so he couldn't forbid me to talk to them), I had started working out and eating healthy, I was writing a play, I was having a good time at my job. If there was a good time to leave the relationship, it was here - when my self-worth was at the highest it's been the whole relationship. I think, subconciously, I was preparing the strength to leave him.


It took a few days for me to process what he was saying, but in short, I figured out the message: He was not going to change, ever. He would never be fulfilled by me. He would only get worse since he is unwilling to confront his problems. Until the day where he is willing to take a good honest look at himself and his issues, he will not be able to participate in a healthy relationship.


**The breakup:**


Long story short, we both sort of ""gave up"" and broke up. I talked with him and told him that this relationship wasn't good for either of us. He agreed heartily. I unfollowed him on social media and we said our goodbyes. He asked if we could be friends...I said we could remain cordial, but I'd rather take a break for now. This was a HUGE mistake, given what happened next.


**Post-breakup mess:**


I was doing perfectly fine for the next two weeks. I had only cried once, for about an hour or so. Besides that, I was having the time of my life. I didn't know what to do with all the freedom. One night, my self-esteem plummeted suddenly. That's when I fucked up.


So, we shared a tumblr blog, where we would share things for the other person. I had unfollowed all social media at this point, but while ruminating over my low self-esteem, I thought of our memories together. I realized that I had forgotten to remove myself from that blog. I went to go remove myself from it, but that's when I got a huge fucking shock - he had posted, IN DETAIL, about a blowjob he had gotten from some girl on Tinder. I was filled with rage - not because I was upset he had moved on, but that he would be SO DISRESPECTFUL as to post it on our SHARED blog that he KNEW I would see at some point. I was also enraged at the fact that he had berated me for MONTHS about the fact that I'd had casual sex before, but then goes out and does it, then bragged about it. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to drive to his house and scream at him until he cried. I've never been so angry in my life - I scared myself. I made another mistake here - I called him. Luckily, I was calm and composed on the outside. I told him that it was disrespectful as hell to post something of that nature on our SHARED blog, and that I wouldn't accept any excuse. He tried to make excuses, but I hung up. Here's where I fixed my mistake of contacting him...I immediately blocked and deleted him on everything. Gone without a trace. Haven't looked back. I burned the FUCK out of that bridge, and I'm proud of it.


That incident caused me an incredible amount of pain and rage; at the same time, it gave me the final push to get him ALL the way out of my life. He was continuing to try to emotionally manipulate me even though we were broken up - I am never going to put up with that shit, ever again.


**What I learned:**


Here's the good part, Reddit. I hope that someone else reads this and will be able to take an honest look at themselves and their relationship, as I did.

1. He was much, much harsher on me than I thought he was. I couldn't see it because I loved him much, much more in love with him than I should've been. Looking back, I remembered that we had taken a short break at one point in our relationship. During that time, he called me up and YELLED at me, straight-up YELLED that he hated me, that I was a bitch, that he resented me more than anyone else, that I ruined his life. I still forgave him and got back together with him, because I assumed he just didn't mean it. The question that I asked myself, that opened my eyes, was this: ""Out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, there has been ONE person who wanted to hurt you badly enough that he told you he hated you and that you were a bitch. And out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, you somehow love him the most. Shouldn't he have been disqualified from your heart the moment he called you up for the sole reason of hurting you?""


2. I ignored huge red flags, and I'm lucky that I got out when I did. He has already been violent with people before. About a year ago, he got blackout drunk and punched some people, as well as slamming a guy through a glass wall (which shattered it) and breaking two tables in half, one of them being a ping-pong table. This alone should've been a red flag, but coupled with other aggressive behavior...it's haunting. I've gotten drunk with him many times. I trusted him too deeply, and I'm honestly luckily to be physically un-harmed right now.

3. My worth is not dependent on him. My new outlook is based on the idea that ""worth"" is separate from a ""bond"" with someone. A bond is based upon many things, one of them being compatibility. Since we were not compatible, that means that our BOND was unable to work out, but my worth is still intact. Obviously I'm not a perfect person, but I also needed to stop basing perfection on HIS standards. Whenever I do something and then reflexively think, ""wow, I'm too selfish"" or ""wow, I talk too much,"" I add the words ""for him"" at the end. Yes, I was too selfish for him, I was too sad for him, I was too much for him. Then I ask: but what about for ME? There are obviously times when I go overboard and don't act like a great person. But most of the time, I'm enough for myself, and I'm not selfish or conceited or fucked up. There's nothing seriously wrong (and if there was, I have a support system to help me work on those things).


4. I am a loving, kind person, who has many amazing qualities. I didn't realize this when I was with him, but my god am I gentle. I'm empathetic and understanding. I have amazing self-control, I'm considerate, I'm direct and honest with people. I value authenticity, I'm open, I'm a good listener, and I'm dependable. Those are just a few things that I like about myself - I'm sure it'll be easier to think of more as time goes on. I'm not a piece of shit, but he had me convinced that I was. He made me feel like I had zero good qualities, that I couldn't positively affect the world. He was always looking for the worst in me, the bad intentions, the secret darkness that I supposedly had in my heart. But no. I'm not a dark or vindictive person. I'm not saying I'm the best person in the world, but I've seen enough evil to know that I would never stoop to that level.


5. Even if I felt bad for him, that doesn't mean I had to stay. He was very damaged as a person from his childhood, which is probably why he was so horrible to me. But it is NOT my responsibility to be his punching bag. I deserve respect just as much as anyone else. The best way to get him to realize the error of his ways was not to stay in relationship with him. By staying with him, I was sending him the message ""you can hurt me as much as you like, and I'll still love you, so you get to feel like there's nothing wrong with your behavior."" By breaking up with him, I was sending the message that I respected myself and him too much to continue accepting such hurtful behavior. Of course, when he ultimately gets into another relationship, I will feel slightly upset if it's successful. I will probably ask myself, ""why couldn't he change for ME? What makes HER so special?"" But on the other hand, it would be a relief to see him heal as a person. I don't want any other girl to go through what I went through, because it absolutely affected my life for a long while. He held me back from so much, but now I'm exercising, I'm writing, I'm hanging out with people, I'm doing things I never dared do when I was with him (in fear of his anger).


6. Although I'm trying to avoid basing my validation in others, it is helpful to note that people DO love me. So many friends were overjoyed when they heard about the breakup. Many asked, ""Is is okay to say that I'm relieved about this?"" Every single person told me that they were so worried about me but they didn't know what to do, but that they're so excited to have ""me"" back. They're excited that I'm not a huge ball of anxiety, that I don't have to miss events to talk to him, that I don't have to lie and defend him to cover up his bad behavior. Everyone is being very reasonable with me, I'm going out with friends all the time, I'm getting complimented on qualities I didn't even know I had. I'm reaching out to old friends and reconnecting, I'm being introduced to new people, I'm joining things. I'm also going on lots of casual dates/have hooked up with some people. I forgot what it was like to have someone who was enthusiastic about making me feel good, but now I'm basking in it. I'm surrounding myself with different kinds of love - when someone doesn't behave in a loving way, it's so much easier to set limits and boundaries. I am a lot less lenient. I'll admit, this has ended a close friendship (because I realized how toxic she was to me). But I'm also surrounded with so many others who support me. I support myself, as well, so there's no way I will feel alone. If I would've known how absolutely loved I'd feel even without him, I would've broken up with him a long time ago. There is no emptiness in my life - it is fuller than ever before.


7. I trust myself so much more. Not only because my ex is not around to gaslight me, but because I know that I am fully capable of making healthy decisions about myself. I trust my perceptions. I can see red flags much more easily. Just today, my ex messaged me somewhere I forgot to block him. His message was long, and seemed heartfelt on a surface level. But I could see every instance of subtle manipulation, every humblebrag, every backhanded compliment, every instance of blame-shifting. The moment I read it, I DIDN'T feel like he'd changed, and I didn't have ANY urge to go back to him. I didn't buy into that bullshit even for a SECOND, and that's how I know that I've changed. I quickly blocked him on that platform as well, and fully intend to never reply to the message. I trust myself to protect my own heart, and to not jump back into a situation that I know will hurt me. A year ago, I did the exact opposite: I fell into his arms. But now...I feel so incredibly stable, that he could never knock me off-balance like he did before.


Thank you to whoever read this, it means a lot. I needed to vent about the things I learn. Overall, I do have my weak moments. But goddamn, my soul is growing stronger every day. Leaving him, and getting to experience the benefits of being without him...it's worth every second of occasional loneliness.


**tl;dr: I broke up with him, my life is fucking AMAZING now, and I've learned enough to know that I'll never go back to him.**"

"Me [30M] and my wife [36F] of 5 years, have been dealing with my obsessed ex-gf [28F] for years, but it has now started to affect my wife negatively


Hi reddit.

Throwaway because i don't want friends and co-workers that know my reddit account to know details about what i'm going through.

Me and wife have been together for 8 years, married for 5. I am Greek and she is Italian. She was the secretary of a business woman we visited with my boss 8 years ago in Italy, it was something like... love at first sight as they say. Nothing really happened between me and her back then, but we kept in touch through the internet and liked each other a lot. Things escalated and lead us to a long distance relationship. Despite the discouragement of everybody that it will not work and that we should stop wasting our time (and mostly from her parents because she is older than me and a few years with a man that wouldn't end up being with her could be an utter waste of time), we managed to endure the distance (we travelled to each other regularly) and eventually make it work. We are now living happily married in a wonderful city of northern Greece and we enjoy every bit of it.

Of course, our relationship has its ups and downs, but we never really had a big trust issue between us since the foundations of our relationship were honesty, trust, loyalty and fidelity. Before i met Valeria (my wife), i was in another long distance relationship with a Dutch woman, Larisa. I broke up with Larisa 8 months before meeting Valeria, and Valeria had full knowledge of my previous relationship and all the details - pretty much anything that happened between me and Larisa, why we broke up, what went wrong, etc etc.

Our lives with Valeria were peaceful until 3 years ago that we received a weird mail from the Netherlands. We were both surprised because we weren't really expecting anything, and the package/box had only my name written on it. After opening it we realized that it had some (not all, you'll see later) of my older belongings that i had left in the Netherlands (t-shirts that she kept everytime we met to feel me close to her while we would split again, everyday stuff, a perfume of mine, stuff like that). We were both shocked, but Valeria looked way more worried than me. She never felt comfortable hearing anything about my ex-gf, although she was the one to bring her up in the conversation. That used to happen in our first few months together. She would ask me questions about her and i could happily answer them since i was over her and it didn't hurt, but on the contrary, it hurt Valeria, but she kept getting back at it.

Fast forward to July 2016, we have had plenty of these packages delivered to us. After the first few, she started adding notes in the packages and old pictures of us when we were together. Valeria was boiling. I even told the post office to block any incoming mail from Larisa but they said it was against their policy (???) and all mail was eventually delivered to us no matter what.

During the last week of July, i had to travel for business purposes with my boss and a few colleagues to Belgium and the Netherlands. Valeria didn't say anything about me going to the Netherlands although i did expect her to. Everything went fine, nothing important to mention until last Monday.

Two days ago we received another mail, but this time the package has Valeria's name on it. Without any surprise we figure out it's from Larisa. This time it wasn't a big box though, it was just an envelope. It contained pictures of me with Larisa, and they looked really recent. The pictures were pretty intimate to be honest, but they were CLEARLY photoshopped. Some of these pictures, judging by the poses of mine, were taken from social media, but others just look totally unfamiliar to me. Needless to say Valeria was so shaken she almost fainted. After she calmed down, she looked at me furiously and a few seconds later she started crying relentlessly. I tried to explain that i did not meet Larisa and that these pictures were clearly edited. She asked me then how did Larisa know that i was in the Netherlands these specific days, which is an excellent question. The only ones that knew i would be in the Netherlands these days were my close friends, colleagues and of course my wife. Valeria said she wanted  to think, she starting packing a couple of clothes and she told me she would stay in a hotel for a couple of days. I stopped her and packed a few clothes of mine and moved to a hotel myself and have been staying there for the last 2 and a half days.

As obvious as it is, this thing is burning me on the inside. I feel shattered that things have turned like that. I feel totally devastated that my wife doesn't trust me, but i can partly undertand her, since this obsessive mailing that was perpetuating through the last few years might have finally tricked her mind. There is a great question though: How did Larisa know i was in the Netherlands these certain days? There are no chances that she mailed these intimate photoshopped pictures by coinsidence. 

So reddit, sorry for the long post, but what do i do now? How do i convince my wife that nothing has happened? Do i proceed to talk to her ... maybe today, or do i keep leaving her on her own space for as long as she needs? I think i am so stressed that i am having panic attacks all the time thinking of all the possible bad outcomes, and i am filled with unlimited anger and hate towards my ex-gf. I just want everything to be right with Valeria, i love her more than my own self and i would give the world to make her happy. I don't want to see her like that. This really feels like someone is trying to set something up on me.

  ---   

**Edit/Update** : Fixed some typos. Wow, this has totally blown up, i'm stunned. I am overwhelmed by the advices and the support.
I'm trying to read every comment and reply where i feel like it is needed.
As a summary, your advice is mostly as it follows:
1) Contact a lawyer/police and see what i can do legally against Larisa, such as have a cease and desist letter sent to her or a restraining order.
2) To show the real pictures to her, the ones that were used as photoshop material.
3) Secure social media accounts, lock down stuff. Make sure no security breaches have occured and to try to make info harder to find.

So, **update** regarding legal issues:

I just contacted a good lawyer friend of mine. Well, kind of a silly move since i haven't spoken to him for years, but he gladly helped me. He told me that there is absolutely nothing illegal Larisa has done. Note to many of you: do remember that i am Greek and Larisa (the woman that is harassing me and my wife) is Dutch. There aren't even any common European union laws that we both have to obey that give me any ground to press any charges on her. She has practically done nothing wrong. And even if we were not living in different countries, it would still be hard to get a restraining order on somebody just because of some mails. So, all in all, we are powerless legally. He pretty much says that all we can do is send a legal note to her saying that any form of contact with us (mail, e-mail, phone call, text message, anything) is not desirable and that it is going to be delivered instantly back to her unopened. Also, we contacted the Hellenic Post Office and this time they took my request to not receive any mail by the said person in a more serious regard since i was accompanied by a lawyer. They said they will fulfill my desire to not receive any mail and will contact me once again the next few days for more details.

And now **more important update** regarding me and Valeria! :

I was encouraged by your comments and i decided to give my wife a call. She picked up and i was so relieved. We had a small and quick talk on how we are doing and if we are ok, and we decided that we had enough of that shit and that we should talk about everything that is bothering us. She sounded ... ok. I expected her to sound bitter or anything like that, but she sounded really ok on the phone. We arranged to meet in 1 hour and 15 minutes to our favourite place, downtown in the pedestrial area right by the sea. I was really nervous before calling but now i feel more relieved, i hope everything's going to be alright and i have a feeling it really is going to be like that. Fingers crossed i guess... I'll post an update in this post or maybe on a new ""Update"" post after we meet.

And something else. There's a few people saying that i did indeed meet Larisa and now i'm trying to cover my shit. I mean, i personally cannot see why i would make this post if i had indeed met Larisa. And if i had, why would i not tell you the truth and ask for advice, admitting that i had screwed up? Makes no sence to me, but maybe that's just me. Perhaps i'm too naive or not demonic enough to see the reason to do something like that.

Once again, thank you for your support everyone, i'll keep you posted.

**Edit2**: So something regarding Larisa. I'm glad another redditor asked me why would she harass me or if there was any reason behind that. Well, me and Larisa didn't break up very peacefully. I mean, the breakup itself was ""okay"". Mind you, it was a relationship that started with Larisa's initiative, she was the one that made the first step in everything, literally everything. After meeting a few times (we both travelled to each other), she decided that she wanted to break up with me. She didn't really want me anymore. Larisa figured that she was not really physically attracted to me (for example, she wanted me taller.. Dutch women are tall, and i wasn't tall enough for her. She was 179cm and i was 183cm but that was not enough for her. That's one of many things she didn't like about me apparently). I truly loved her, and this is why i decided to respect her decision, to accept that we are over and to move on. She didn't like that i cut contact with her though. Larisa has been suffering from anxiety. After i cut contact with her she would sent me really bitter messages saying stuff like ""I do not need you anymore. You were not needed in my life and i am strong enough by myself. You were wrong"", you get the idea. I never said or implied that she needed me anyway. Needless to say she convinved her whole family that i did say or imply those things. Well, that kept going on for a while until a point that she just stopped. The very last message was a very bitter and resentful message saying stuff like ""good luck to your next victim, i hope she realizes her mistake fast enough so that she can save that time being with a loser and coward like you"". I mean ... ok. She wasn't really friendly....

"Me [25/M] not invited to friends wedding. My girlfriend is a bridesmaid.


A friend of mine of 5 years or so is getting married today. It's at Disney so they only paid for 18 people.  I'm not invited. Okay fine not enough room. I understand that... However my girlfriend is a bridesmaid. When she was invited she had only known the bride for 3 months. To top it off the best man's girlfriend is invited and the bride and everyone there is known to hate her.
To make it even worse the bride and maid of honor didn't tell my girlfriend anything about the bachelorette party, the bride was lying to everyone in the wedding party saying my girlfriend wasn't going to anything but the wedding despite having MANY texts saying otherwise and asking for info. 
I came with my girlfriend and stayed at the hotel with her so she wasn't alone. All of the groomsmen know I am here and no one had even bothered to say hello to me. No one even said hello when I walked past everyone when I dropped my girlfriend off at the wedding Pavilion. 
I'm honestly extremely hurt by the entire thing and not sure what to do. 

Tldr:
My girlfriend is a bridesmaid maid and I am not even invited to the wedding of someone who was a friend longer then she has known everyone."
"I [30 F] snooped husbands [29 M] phone, found something but not sure how to deal


We have been together about 9 years now. I work at home with 3 kids (8,3,11 months) it's hectic and I constantly feel like I'm drowning. He goes out every week or two with friends to their houses or out to a bar.. a few months ago I lost it as he stayed out all night with zero contact with me all day long and just waltzed in the next morning at like 10:30am like nbd. After some digging he stayed with his uncle and I checked it out to be true. 
Since he still goes out every now and then I am jealous he gets to leave and have a life, I'm jealous he even gets to go to work and socialize with adults. We only have one person who can babysit the kids and they do so veeeeerryyyyy reluctantly if it ever happens. So he says it's just easier for everyone if he goes out with friends, so we never go out unless it's a super rare special occasion. 

Maybe a week or so ago he stayed up all night drinking at home. I woke up around 6am with the baby and the kids.. he's sleeping on the couch. and he gets some text messages. They display right on the front screen so I saw they were from a woman, and they were in reply to something he had said to her but weren't exactly damning. Still, these are texts at 6 am and he was texting her at night while drunk. 

I pushed it out of my mind until he left his phone at home while running to the store the other day. I looked to see who this person was and what they were talking about. It's a coworker and seemed innocent enough until I scrolled up and saw he sent her ""Did I slap your ass last night? I was feeling the liberties.."" or something like that. she said she didn't remember and that she didn't care if he did..

Husband comes home and I am a mess. He is pissed about me going through his phone. He says he doesn't feel like spending the energy trying to defend himself because nothing happened and it was just a joke like how he would smack guys asses. Ultimately he turned it around enough so that I was the one trying to explain myself why I was going through his phone, why don't I trust him, what is wrong with me. Then starts to guilt trip me like if I'm going to act like this he will just never go out again..

It's been 3 more days since this happened and I have hardly spoken to him since. He knows I'm upset but hasn't tried to talk to me or ask what is bothering me. The idea that he is out getting drunk with coworkers and slapping some girls ass, or thinking he slapped her ass, completely disgusts me. I mean if I was there with him, would he have done that? No. I just have no idea how to proceed from here.

  ---   
  **TL;DR**: snooped through husbands phone, found out he slapped a coworkers ass while they were all out drinking at a bar, he's acting like he just wants to move on and forget but I'm still disgusted.

-----

**UPDATE:** I am really really truly thankful for everyone who has commented. I haven't gone through everything but I do have an update.
I got a bottle of wine to sit and talk with him about these issues today. In a nutshell says this girl is ~one of the guys~ and it was not flirtatious or sexy or anything like that. he agrees that I need my own time out, SAYS he will watch the kids. made some ridiculous suggestion about buying me a plane ticket to leave for a week and that he'd watch them.. I laughed because that is obviously not going to happen for many reasons. He said the last thing he wanted was to be laughed at and went to go pout in the garage. I went upstairs. He eventually came up and said to me do you want to know what really happened that night? He slapped another girls ass. Someone he didn't know. Just some girl. And he was doing damage control by contacting this coworker to see if he had slapped hers too. So he wouldn't have shit to deal with when they went into work together. I started crying. He sat for about 2-3 minutes of that in our room, then went back downstairs to apparently finish his video game as I heard all the sound come back on. I slammed the bedroom door. That's where I am at now.

**EDIT:** to clarify I am a WORK at home mom. He does not support our entire family. I take care of the entire mortgage, the water bill, the gas bill, the cable bill.. I work at night when the kids go to bed. That's why I feel like I'm drowning. I have absolutely no ""Me"" time. "

"My (31M) sister (38F) is sheltering her kid (17M) to extreme levels, the kid has asked me to intervene.


So I moved in with my girlfriend to Philly 3 years ago and my sister moved here a year ago with her kid after she got divorced. Her kid, Aaron, is a sweet funny kid. He is handsome, smart, charming, basically everything good about a 17 year old kid at the prime of his life...

But my sister shelters him to the point of extremeness. I often am at their house and I see Aaron all the time and he sort of looks up to me as the cool uncle. Basically, my sister makes sure he doesn't have any resemblance of a social life. He can't leave past a certain block radius of the house, he can't talk to girls, his mom checks his phone like twice a week for suspicious texts. He can't work a job because she thinks hes too immature for it or she doesn't trust him with it or something. He wanted to go to a college in north philly but she told him she would refuse to pay because the school is too 'ghetto'. The absolute worst part is that when he has friends over she insists that she... just kind of sits there and hangs out with them. I know it is because she can't stand the idea of him having conversations that aren't 'approved' by her. He tells me this stuff and I feel so, so bad for him. I know his friends and they like to go out and hang out like any 17 year old kid would do, but he literally has to be home for dinner at 6 every night and then after be home at 9:30 so he can't do anything with them. He has complained to me about this maybe a hundred times about how unfair it is, and it sucks even worse because he loves hearing stories about the crazy fun shit I did as a kid and it just makes him feel worse in the end. 

I honestly think she is being extremely unfair to him, or she just doesn't know at what point to ease up on him. These 'laws' have been there since he was 13, they should change by the time he's 17. She even has a god damn breathalyzer. 

It hit a bad point when he apparently had a girl over 2 days ago and the mother walked in on them kissing and she flipped a shit. Now... at 17, kissing a girl is totally 100% normal. He is extremely noticeably good looking and fit, I am sure the girls cant get enough of him, but he cant hang out with girls like that because he has to be home right away. I told her she was over reacting and she started going off on me about STD's and how she doesn't wanna pay for his kid if she gets pregnant. She called the girls mother angrily and told the mother, and apparently the mother told my sister that it was fine if they wanted to kiss and my sister was SHOCKED that ANY PARENT would allow such a thing. It seems as if she gets her parenting advice from fucking Nancy Grace. I should note that me and my sister grew up separately with divorced parents. 

The worst part is that he has little to no social life. He has like 3 friends at school and he can't really do anything fun with them. He has resorted to playing video games day and night, and his mother flips a shit on him for being addicted to those. But what the fuck else is he supposed to do... He gets perfect grades, he works out (to my sisters dismay). She has this little thing on his phone that beeps if he goes too far, who the fuck has that for a 17 year old boy?? When I was that age I was doing road trips from nyc to boston every month with tons of beers and girls and everything, and I'm sure he wants that too, but he can't because his mother is fucking insane. Not saying he should become some party animal like I was, but let the kid go loose a tiny bit for crying out loud. 

So basically at this point, he has been begging me for weeks now to say something to her about this. She listens to my advice, not sure why but she really does. I have briefly said things, but nothing direct or serious. I do feel strongly about this, hes going to be living in that household for his college years too because hes going local. It kind of hit a bad point when I witnessed her flip a shit on him for kissing the girl and he was looking at me like ""please say something about this"" and I didn't say anything really. What do I do Reddit? How do I go about passing this message in a way that opens her eyes in how she is hurting her son? I honestly feel as if if he was to rebel and just do what he wants for a bit and go to a party, she probably would eventually give in (she wouldn't ever kick him out), but I obviously don't want to RECOMMEND that to him lol. 

 EDIT: I should also point out that he DOES have a good relationship with her. This might sound weird but they get along very well, they watch TV and movies together and laugh and all that. She is extremely helicopter parenty and he despises that, but besides that he does not resent her, he just wants her to stop being crazy about this.
He didn't even care about the over protectiveness until about 4 months ago when I guess his friends started going to more parties and such. So its not as if this is a long term issue, for most of his early HS years he just played video games all day so the crazy restrictive rules didn't even apply cause he never went out. 
So now that he is trying to go out more and be with his friends, the rules are coming into play more and more and stressing both of them out.

"I [22F] was told by my brother [26M] I can't come to his wedding if my boyfriend [22M] comes. His wife [28F] has a crush on my boyfriend


My boyfriend has always received a lot of attention from women. He is a really attractive man, One thing I love most is how loyal he is to people. He is completely loyal to me, he really is. We have been together for 2 years and we are going to start trying for kids soon. 

My brother personally handed my brother his wedding invitation and asked him to come to his wedding. My brother called me last night and told my boyfriend is allowed no where near his wedding, and if he comes then I must stay away as well. 

He told me nothing happened between his wife and my boyfriend but she has a crush on him. She told a friend and it got back to him and it's caused a cluster fuck. 

I just need some advice on what to do 

tl;dr: Brother wants my boyfriend no where near his wedding after he found out she has a crush on him "
"My husband [27] is extremely handsome and successful, and lots of people try to tell me [31F] that he is ""out of my league""


My husband is a successful print model and graphic designer. He has been featured in lots of store catalogs for international companies. Obviously he is very handsome. Think, Swedish cheekbones.


I am a professional photographer and work regularly, but make a much smaller salary than my husband. I'm just average looking. We got married after dating a year and living together half a year more.


I love being with my husband. He's smart, funny, and totally humble even though he is utterly BEAUTIFUL.  He's so gorgeous that strangers have on more than one occasion asked to take a ""selfie"" with him because he's such a prototype of a tall, blonde, model type. I've always been proud of him. Out of respect for me he will usually refuse selfies with people unless they are just silly teenagers or if they specifically say they recognize him. He treats the grown women as if they should know better.


I knew to expect it, but haters are always coming up to me and passive-aggressively insinuating, ""what's he doing with YOU?"" or that he's slumming with me or that I must be blackmailing him or that he must be blind. People also insinuate that I'm robbing the cradle with him. Which means either they think that I'm a geezer if I'm only four years older than him, or that they are saying I look like an old hag next to him.


I just roll with it because I know women can be cruel and jealous and they want what I have.


What I really hate though is that they are hitting HIM with the same kind of questioning.


I know some people are trying to convince him that I am emotionally hurting him by making him not realize his true value as a person. Like I'm ruining his self esteem to make him more on ""my level.""


It's been happening more and more lately since I'm pregnant four months and am having a little bit of trouble putting myself together every day.


It's killing me that he's surrounded basically by these gorgeous Russian and French models and they're flirting with him so hard. It's hurting my confidence and I'm scared because I'm so in love with him and he's dad to my baby and I would fall to pieces without him. These other women have NO shame and NO mercy.


What can I do about this? Or, about these feelings?


My husband keeps telling me he loves me and that he only has eyes for me but sometimes I see myself in the mirror in the morning lately and see someone fatter older and uglier than him and wondering why he's wasting his life with me.


How do I get over it?


tl;dr

Husband is prettier, younger, and more successful than me. People never let me OR him forget it. It's killing my confidence "
"I [31M] believe that my wife [29F], a former alcoholic, has been drinking during her pregnancy, but I can't prove anything and she denies it. What do I do?


I've been married to my wife for 5 years now, and those 5 years have been a very happy time for both of us--for the most part. The only serious issue we've faced in our marriage has been my wife's struggle with alcoholism. In truth, it started before we were married, but it got worse as time passed until we got to a point a few years ago where my wife would come home from work each night and get absolutely wasted.  There was a significant period of time where not a day went by that she didn't excessively consume alcohol to a point where it interfered with my ability to spend time with her and our marriage. Eventually it began to affect her work performance and other areas of our lives, and after she lost her job and went through a semi-intervention, she realized she needed some help. 

We got her enrolled in a treatment program and she was able to get to the root of the problem--that her coping mechanism for stress and anxiety was alcohol. She struggled at first with staying sober, but after many months of counseling and therapy (and lots of hard work on my wife's part), she was able to gain her sobriety. Since that point 2 and 1/2 years ago my wife has been completely sober, and our lives have been good. My wife has since found another job in her field and is in a position similar to the one she had before she was fired. We're also currently in the process of having a child that was very much wanted and planned; my wife is currently 10 weeks pregnant. This should be a very happy time for us (and it is for the most part), but I've started suspecting that she's relapsed and has started drinking again. It's either that or I am going crazy. 

This all started when I found an empty wine bottle tucked behind some boxes in our hall closet several weeks ago; it was about a week after we found out my wife was pregnant. It seemed very odd to me because (a) it was very out of place in the closet; (b) we haven't had wine or wine bottle in our house since my wife started her treatment program; and (c) I don't remember it being there ever before this. We also have never kept empty wine bottle for reuse either, so there's no reason for why it should be there. 

I casually mentioned it to my wife, and she acted surprised. She said it must have been something we stored and forgot, and she claimed to have no idea when we put it there. It was suspicious, but I believed her. 

Almost two weeks later I discovered another wine bottle, but this one was buried at the bottom of our outside trash can. Again, something didn't seem right to me. I always take the trash out, and I don't remember it being there a few days earlier. Since it was at the bottom, I would have had to have seen it at some point unless it was hidden after the can was filled up, but then why would someone go through the effort of stuffing a bottle at the bottom of the trash can unless they wanted to hide it? I certainly didn't put it in myself, so I knew it had to be someone else or my wife. 

I took it out and showed it to her, and this time she got upset. She asked me what I was trying to imply, and I told her I was curious and possibly concerned. I didn't accuse her of anything, but she came right out and told me that she wasn't drinking and that it was the same bottle I found two weeks earlier. I could almost swear that it was different because I'm fairly certain they had different labels, but since I didn't throw the other one out, I don't know for sure. I thought it was odd that she would wait so long, but I didn't have anything to prove she was lying. 

I noticed after that fight that my wife seemed more on edge and very jittery, and I also noticed at times her behavior was odd in other ways (e.g. she started questioning me a lot more about when I would be home if I was out and would randomly call me sometimes to make sure I was still going to be home exactly when I was, and if I got home a little early, she would be upset with me). I also started to notice that after she went into the bathroom for a while some nights she would come back more relaxed and sometimes almost like a person who is tipsy. I did take a quick glance at the bathroom, but I didn't find anything.   

Then finally the last straw (and what made me post here) came earlier this week. I was coming home from work, and I again got a random call from my wife asking if I was going to be late or what time exactly I would get home. I probably should have done this, but I lied and told her I expected to be about an hour late. I decided to park a little way down the street instead of our driveway and walk home and surprise my wife. She must have heard me come in because I saw her run into her into our bedroom and heard her shut the closet door. 

I'm going to try to condense this last part because this post is already too long. I caught up to her and asked her what what going on and she got very upset immediately. I asked her why she ran into the closet, and she denied going into it. I knew she was lying because I heard two doors close (our bedroom and the closet). I went into the closet and eventually found a bottle of wine hidden under some clothes. We had a big fight about it. I asked her if she was drinking again, and she denied it completely. She claimed that she had bought it as a gift for her friend but hid it because she knew I would think she was drinking, and that's where we are now.

She's still pissed because she thinks I don't trust her and consider her to be the type of woman that would drink while pregnant. I've told her constantly that I'm not judging her. I just want to do the right thing for her and the baby so if something is going on I would rather her be honest with me instead of hide it from me.

Nothing adds up to me. Everything points to her drinking again, but none of what I've found proves anything. The empty bottle I found could have been stored there by accident and forgotten by me. Maybe the bottle I found in the trash was the same one. The bottle I found in our closet didn't look like anything had been drunk from it, so maybe she is telling the truth. Maybe the other odd behavior is just stress or related to the pregnancy in another way. I want to believe her, but my gut tells me something isn't right. I'd like to know what third parties think. Do I have a reason to be concerned about a relapse, or am I paranoid and imagining things?



---   
**tl;dr**: My former alcoholic wife has been acting strange lately. I've found several wine bottles in places so odd that it makes me think she has started drinking again. I found another she hide from me that was full or nearly full, but she claimed she bought it for a friend and hid it from me because she thought I would think she was drinking again. Everything points to her drinking, but I can't prove anything. She thinks I am being paranoid, and I feel that way at times, but am I? She is pregnant right now, so I'm extra worried that the stress has caused her to relapse and she's going to hurt herself and the baby if something isn't done soon!

Update: I just wanted to thank you all for taking the time to respond and offer suggestions and for the support. I contacted my wife's OB/GYN today and let him know about the situation. He shared some resources with me related to FAS to share with my wife, and he told me that he would do everything in his power to help my wife. I have not had a chance to search the house for alcohol yet, but I'm going to try to do it discretely tonight. Then I'm going to confront my wife either way. I don't know exactly what I'm going to say to her, but my goal is to get her to understand that we can get her help for this but I'm not going to stay silent and let her hurt our child. I still think we can be happy together, but if the child is born with FAS or she continues to drink, it won't be possible. The only way this can work is if she gets help and stops lying. I also read the comments about termination. As hard as it is to admit, I think it may be the best thing. Clearly we're not ready to have a child right now, and I think going forward with this pregnancy would only hurt 3 people instead of just two people being hurt. If she really has relapsed, even if our baby is healthy, I don't think she would be able to handle the stress of motherhood and stay sober right now. She needs to get healthy first.      "

"My (22F) husband (27M) doesn't trust me to make purchases for myself even though I support both of us financially


My husband has this idea about my being irresponsible with money. He's had it for as long as we've been dating. He thinks this, from what he tells me, because I do a lot of online shopping. I grew up in the middle of nowhere, where the only way to get a lot of things was to order them. I wanted to wear clothes that weren't purchased at the local Walmart or feed store, so I shopped online. I have a lot of food allergies and I wanted to find versions of foods I could actually eat, so I shopped online. I love sci-fi shows and I wanted action figures that I knew I had no change of finding locally, so I shopped online. Even after I moved out of my home town and into the relatively large city we currently live in, I continued to shop online because it was easier. So every time I make a purchase, it shows up at our door. It makes him very aware of what I'm buying, and even when I sit down with him and open the box in front of him and say ""Here is a bottle of my favorite nail polish, remember how often you see me wearing this polish and remember how I was complaining that I was out?"" Or ""Here are some hazelnuts, they were manufactured in a facility that keeps their nuts segregated, so I can eat these nuts because there's no risk of cross-contamination,"" and he sees that everything that I'm buying has a purpose and isn't just frivolous spending, he still sighs and comments on it every time a new package arrives at our door.

To get into our financials a little bit, I work in a field which requires professional licensure, which I have. I have no debt and I have a decent amount of money in savings. He works in retail and is constantly paying off various debts. We were both briefly in college and we both, separately, chose to stop attending, me to enter the workforce and him for financial reasons, and he's still paying bills from his attendance. Until recently he had medical bills from an ER visit. And he has a credit card, so he always needs to pay his credit card bill. Because of this, I've been paying all the rent and utilities. This isn't a strain on me financially at all, and I'm still able to put money into savings at the end of each month. When we had first moved in together we had discussed splitting the rent equally, but when we'd discovered he wasn't in a financial place to do this, I'd just taken over the payments. 

Now...I'm currently six months pregnant. I've recently reduced my work hours because my body just wasn't able to handle it. I've had miserable nausea, fatigue, leg pain, back pain, ligament pain, and although I tried to tell myself that I was a warrior and that plenty of women work throughout their entire pregnancies, it's become apparent that I'm just not one of those women. I did some math and figured out how many hours I would need to work to cover the bare minimum of rent and bills, and then I reduced my schedule to those hours. So I am still bringing in enough money to support us, I'm just not going to be putting any more money into my savings. Which is fine, because I did the math on those too, and I have enough saved up that we could live on it for ten months with no other income, so I'll definitely be able to take maternity leave and I could even extend it past the standard two months if I needed to. I presented all this information to my husband, told him it would make the money stretch even farther if he was able to contribute, but that even if he couldn't we'd still be fine. He was okay with my reducing my hours and he promised to contribute $200 per month, which it's now looking like he's not going to be doing.

I've only had my reduced schedule for two weeks now, but those two weeks have been great. I got so much cleaning done, I started dragging furniture into what's going to be the nursery, it's so much easier to handle the physical pain when I have the option to go and lay down whenever I need to, and I just feel, overall, so much more ready for our child to arrive.

The only problem is that, recently, my laptop broke. This wasn't all that surprising, since it'd been limping along with noticeable issues for almost a year now, but it had finally reached the point where it wasn't functional at all, and since it was an older laptop it would likely cost more to fix than it was actually worth. So, after confirming it was dead, I picked up my purse, told my husband I was going laptop shopping, and headed for the door.

But he asked me to stop, and told me that he thought I'd get ripped off if I tried to go buy a laptop by myself. I said that I didn't think I would, I just wouldn't blindly follow the salesman, and he questioned if I even had the disposable income to purchase a new laptop. He'd just seen my finances two weeks ago, so I responded that of course I did. He repeated that he thinks I spend too much money, that I do a lot of online shopping, and I reminded him that he'd seen me open everything that I'd purchased and that I'd been buying things like maternity pants and books on childcare, not frivolous items. Next he pointed out that I have plenty of other ways to access the internet; I have my phone, the cheap little tablet I'd bought for travel, and my Kindle, and asked me if I even really needed a laptop. I responded that I definitely did need a laptop, and he asked me to at least wait on purchasing one until he'd looked up some specs and had told me what he thought I should buy. I agreed.

A few days later, he calls me over to his computer (he has a desktop) and shows me a laptop which he likes. I said that I didn't really like it, and he said that he did and he was going to buy it for himself. I asked him if *he* had the money to spend on a laptop, and he said that he would put it on his credit card and that he needed a mobile computer for when he was watching the baby. He ordered the laptop and told me that I could use it too. So now he has a laptop and I still don't. 

The complex we live in doesn't have laundry in the unit. Instead the laundry is communal and it's $2.50 to complete a load. I hated this, until I discovered something which made my day so much easier. I'm not sure if this sub allows linking, but if you google ""Panda Compact Washer"" you'll see what I'm talking about. It's basically a teeny-tiny washing machine that you hook up to your sink. My god, I love this thing. No more trekking out lugging a laundry hamper and a bag of quarters. No more brushing my hair on a Saturday morning because doing laundry requires going out in public. And it paid for itself within the first two months of use. My husband has heard me talk about how much I love my washing machine, so he's well aware of how much I love it. Seriously, I never shut up about it.

Well, recently it stopped draining. I tried everything that I could to fix it; I snaked it from both ends, I turned it upside-down in the bathtub and poured water up the drainage hose, I tried that pipe declogging trick with baking soda and vinegar, and I even pried the casing open and took a look inside it, but since the pipes were a visibly thin plastic and the wires to the motor were run right beside them, I decided that trying to open the pipes would probably make the machine unsafe, and I closed it back up again. This was also why I was afraid to try a chemical declogger, in case it weakened the plastic. But, these really aren't expensive machines. They're certainly *much* cheaper than a laptop. So I texted my husband to let him know that I was going to be ordering a new one, and asking if he'd mind if I needed his help to get it inside and set up, since they're heavy and I'm pregnant.

And he responded that he didn't know if I really needed one. 

I don't know, man. Does your wife need a *washing machine?* Which she would be spending her own money on? When you just bought yourself a laptop for no good reason? 

When he got home we talked about it, with my emphasizing that this is a *household appliance* I am looking to replace here, and he agreed that I could order one, which I did. But I'm pissed about it, and more than a little incredulous. I am the one who supports us financially. He trusts me to keep the rent paid, but not to handle my discretionary spending money? I know he's always thought of me as being financially irresponsible, even though I've been going out of my way to show him that I'm not, and an argument could be made that no one really *needs* a laptop, but why the hell wouldn't he want his *wife* to replace her broken *washing machine?* He asks me every couple of days if his work clothes are clean. They're not gonna be clean if I don't have any way to wash them. 

We're about to have a baby together. A baby which I'm going to be the primary caretaker for, since he'll continue to work full time while I take my maternity leave. What if I decide I need to make some semi-expensive purchase on behalf of the baby and he takes issue with it, even though I'll have used my own money to do it? I need to have some degree of freedom here, especially when it comes to *basic household appliances* being kept up and running. 

I just feel disrespected. I've taken him over our financial situation, I've shown him the things that I'm buying, and we still have to have this conversation every time I buy *anything.* We're in good standing with our landlord, the goddamn internet bill is paid every month, *none* of which he has a hand in, and yet his distrust of me with money that I've earned runs deep enough that we have to talk about how much I need to have a functional washing machine. 

TLDR: my husband doesn't trust me to buy myself anything with the money that I have in the bank, but will buy himself a laptop on a credit card when I'm the one with the broken laptop. "

"FOLLOW UP: I [31M] have gone out with a lady[31F] a couple times in the last couple weeks. We have a ton in common, and get along really well. How to approach lackluster sex?


Original post: tl;dr - Was unsure how to proceed with bringing up personal sex preferences with new partner.
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xeqrq/i_31m_have_gone_out_with_a_lady31f_a_couple_times/


Everyone(all commenters and myself)was right, about everything. That's really the only way I can put it.


She came to my house for the first time last night, and while making out, I stopped and asked her what she likes(from oral and PIV) and wants me to do. At first she said the equivalent of, ""I like what you do, do that."" I think she was too horny to think about it right then, because after round 1, she did tell me some specifics she likes. Also, it turns out I wasn't hurting her and her stamina is not low. She was stopping because she was too sensitive from orgasming so intensely, so many times in succession, and couldn't form the words to tell me that in the moment(ego boost x100). So, we pretty much fucked all night...with intermittent breaks.


The head thing seems to be working itself out very nicely, without even addressing it directly. I went down on her for a good while(I get really turned on from it too). She started giving me that same, whack bj, and as suggested, I didn't react(beyond trying to maintain my woody). She started trying different angles and techniques, and boy, did she find what works. 


This morning we talked more, and her ex-hub, had a very low sex drive, but she wants to explore now. We talked generally about some things we'd like to do, and I think it's about to get a little crazy. Thanks to everyone who commented. It really got my nerves up to have, what I thought would be, an awkward conversation. Turned out to be anything but awkward.


TL;DR - Open communication led to better sex, and exponentially better blowjobs, which in turn, led to more communication and even more better sex, and crazier sex down the road."
"UPDATE My (30/f) immediate supervisor (35/F) is stealing from the owner (38/f) of the business

I didn't know this at the time but while I was making that post, my boss was having an emergency c-section!  The twins were a few weeks early but overall in good health and were discharged the following week.  They are doing well and are adorable.   

My boss started work again about a month ago (she lives super close to the office and hired a nanny for the twins).  I asked to speak with her and showed her all of the documentation I'd collected.  She was taken aback (like, really shocked!) and then started asking me questions - I gather she'd heard a different story from Candy and she thought maybe *I* was stealing.  But here is the thing: I can't steal the way Candy was stealing.  She was writing and signing checks to herself to give herself pay check advances.  I can't sign checks.  She was pulling out money from the ATM.  I don't have the debit card OR the PIN for the account.  I pointed that out, and reiterated the proof, letting my boss know whatever she needed, I would try to help her with, but that the situation was untenable as it was and I had been looking for other work because I didn't want to stay at the position, working under Candy. 

Boss took a few days to think things over and verified what I'd said.  She checked in with payroll processor and, no, Candy wasn't taking the ""advances"" out.  She checked in with the bank and not only was there ATM footage of Candy withdrawing cash, the bank also brought to Boss's attention a slew of checks that Candy had written to herself and signed, but that were in my Quickbooks as checks to vendors.  So that's another reason why she didn't want to me to log into the bank account online, I would have been able to see the check images.  

Needless to say, Boss confronted Candy.  The story from Candy was 

- Kiki (me) is the one stealing (then boss showed her images of herself taking money out of ATM, reprints of checks made out to herself and signed, etc.)

- That turned into Candy saying she's a pill addict and this is because of her addiction and blah blah.  She might be a pill addict, I don't know.  But the total of theft that we found (with the bank etc) was over $30,000 in a little over 3 months.  So... would a pillhead with that kind of money even be alive still?  Anyway, the last one is the best one, IMO

- I DROVE HER TO ABUSE PAIN PILLS BECAUSE I WAS SO MEAN TO HER AND FRAMING HER FOR MY OWN THEFT.  Which again, go back to the first bullet re: ""my own theft"".  But also, she was HORRIBLE to me in the last few months.  She brought a buzzer in from a game and would literally buzz it at me anytime I tried to talk to her and she didn't want to listen.  She made a big deal about locking up her purse around me.  I'm pretty sure she was letting air out of my tires because I kept leaving work to find flats.  She also was openly being like ""you are such a bitch"", ""wipe that face of your head, bitch"" etc.   So that was pretty rich.  

Boss fired Candy.  She thanked me for bringing it to her attention.  I didn't have the heart to say ""well, your husband knew about it at least 2 months ago"" I wonder if he just never told her and acted surprised when she came home to tell him?  Anyway, the silveriest of linings to this story is:  I started applying for jobs and got one, that pays roughly one and a half times what my current job pays!  So I gave notice today.

"UPDATE Should I [18 F] go see my [17 F] best friend that I haven't seen in six years even though her almost boyfriend asked me not to?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wdol5/should_i_18_f_go_see_my_17_f_best_friend_that_i/?st=irtta750&amp;sh=83061d7f

So, shit hit the fan since I last posted. I honestly wasn't planning on posting an update because my last post really didn't get much attention, but today I got a random message from Gwen asking if her mom had invited me to a party. It turns out that Almost-Boyfriend figured making plans with her on the same days I was going to be there wasn't enough, so he told her about the going away party her parents had planned.


I was really annoyed about the whole thing at first because her parents had put so much effort into this party and he ruined the surprise, but then after I told her yes she had a complete meltdown. 


Apparently she had been telling her mom for a while that she did NOT want a surprise party, and her mom decided to just throw one anyways. Now she's not on speaking terms with her parents and is frantically trying to figure out everyone they invited so she can uninvite them.


Anyways, since the cat was already out of the bag about the party I figured I might as well take your guys advice about telling Gwen about what her boyfriend did. I don't know what I was expecting, but she didn't really care. She even told me she was glad I had decided not to go, because she's really looking forward to the weekend with Almost-Boyfriend.


I mean, I'm glad they didn't ""break up"" (if you could even call it that when they're not even dating yet) over me. The guy acted like a douchebag, sure,  but he's usually not like that. I guess I'm just kind of upset that after not seeing me in years her reaction to finding out that her almost boyfriend purposely ruined the one chance we would have had to spend together before she moved off even farther away for college was basically a shrug of the shoulders and a change of topic.


This really opened my eyes to the fact that I think I value her more as a friend than she values me, and that I deserve a lot better than to constantly be caught up in her drama all the time. I've decided I'm going to focus on other friends and leave the ball in her court for now. Maybe this will all blow over if they ever break up, but I'm not holding my breath anymore.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Almost-boyfriend told Gwen about the party and she had an absolute meltdown over it because she had apparently told her mom she didn't want one. I came clean about my original plans to spend the three days with her that almost-boyfriend purposely made plans with her on, and she sided with him. I've decided that Gwen isn't the same person she used to be and this new person isn't someone I want to be associated with so I'm leaving the past in the past and am going to focus on bettering myself and building healthier friendships."

The title pretty much says it all.

He still tries to reach out to me often (through phone calls, texts from his friend's phones, used to come to my house sometimes and leave letters) and I have not responded to anything. 

I had no idea he was dating again and frankly it doesn't bother me. I am somewhat concerned for this girl, however. I don't know how she got my phone number or knows my name, and not sure why she would want to know who I am. I'm guessing she found something out about me from his friends/family or possibly snooped through his phone to find he has been trying to contact me. 

My intuition tells me not to touch this with a 10-foot pole but a part of me wants to call her back and gently tell her the truth and set the record straight. Her voicemail sounded rushed and anxious. Any advice?

**UPDATE:** So the general consensus here (and between my friends) was that I should call her back and let her know. I triple-checked that I had my ex blocked on everything, and then I sent her a text saying:

""Hi. I got your voicemail this morning. I am [Ex's] ex-girlfriend. We were together from October of 2012 to March of this year. We are currently no-contact and I haven't spoken with him in months and I hope you can please respect that by not telling him you have contacted me. I am not sure what your motives are for reaching out but in my experience, if you are having suspicions about him, they are generally for a reason. He is a cheater, and an expert manipulator. Don't lose your sense of worth or your sense of self. All the best.""

She immediately called me and I was too scared to pick up. She called back again about a half hour later and we had a small chat. She verified that I was his ex-girlfriend and said she had looked on his phone last night and found that he had been trying to call me late at night for the last month and a half... every night. I have him blocked so I never received these calls. I am honestly not sure why he is still trying to get into contact with me but I told her the story of how we broke up. She just said she ""has a lot to think about."" I think I have done my job here. Thanks for the advice, everyone.

"My dad [45m] thinks he is 'giving me away' at my [23f] wedding. I don't know how to tell him he's not.


So basically I feel kind of bad, but I also feel like I'm justified in my choice, so if I'm not please feel free to take me down a few notches.

Here's some back story before I get to the issue at hand.

My parents got married very young and had kids very young and divorced before they were 27.  My dad left when I was 6 and was in and out of my life until I was 14 and then I went NC until I was 20.  

My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, and one of the reasons I went NC.  He was violent and mean spirited, he would call me drunk in the middle of the night and then scream at me for being up so late even though he was the one that woke me up.  He still to this day says terrible things about my mother that I shut down immediately.  When we were very young, he would either not show up to pick us up for the weekend or he would pick us up and drop us off with our grandparents.  I don't have many good memories of my dad growing up.

My mom is a saint.  She raised two kids by herself, supported us, and we struggled a lot, but she is my rock.  She is the only parent I have ever had and she has sacrificed everything to make sure my sister and I had a good upbringing and became good people.

Now, my problem.

Like I said, for the last 3 years or so, I am in contact with my dad again and so is my sister.  His drinking seems to be under control and he's not as nasty as he used to be.  I have pretty much accepted that he is who he is and I have to accept that if I want a relationship with him.  We talk at least once a week and I try to make time to have dinner with him every so often, simply because he's my dad and I've forgiven him for what I can.  There are some things I won't ever be able to forgive.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt though, he has been trying harder than he ever has to be my parent and I am grateful for it.

I have been with my fiance for 6 years, and we are getting married on October 1st.  My entire life, I always knew my mom would be the one to walk with me down the aisle and 'give me away' at my wedding.  We are also doing a dance together at the reception instead of me dancing with my dad.  Well.  My dad asked me last week what he has to do and says he knows he has to look nice because 'everyone will be watching him walking with me'.  I never asked him to give me away, he just assumed because 'that's what dads do' right?  I didn't know what to say, I just skirted around it and changed the subject.

On one hand, I guess both of my parents could do it to save feelings, but honestly I want my mom to.  Just my mom.  She is who I have been able to depend on for everything my entire life and she is who I want to walk with me on my wedding day, and I feel like anything else is a slap in the face to every ounce of hard work she has put into me.  In my opinion, as much as he has redeemed himself recently, my dad hasn't earned that spot beside me.

So what do I do?  If I decide to only have my mom do it, how do I tell my dad?  Do I compromise how I've always wanted things and how I think it should be to keep my dad from being upset?  I'm at a loss and I really don't know how to approach this.

tl;dr  My mostly absent father assumed he'd be walking me down the aisle at my wedding despite me not ever asking him to.  How do I tell him I don't want that?"

I've just started seeing someone new [23M], he's awesome and I really like him so I feel like I should explain sooner rather than later.

Of course I'm hoping that science and medicine will advance and keep me going for even longer, but you never know!

"My [30F] MIL [55F] is ruining all the special and fun moments in my life/marriage


My husband's mother has become obsessed with the ""fact"" that we hate her. This started after I got pregnant. The baby is now several months old and MIL's behaviors have been consistently getting worse. Everything we do, even things that have nothing to do with her or the baby, is somehow twisted into a slight against her. She has resorted to constantly lying to various family members about things we have said to her.


My husband and I have both spoken to her several times about all of these issues. She has denied everything, and even said we must have confused her for someone else, and named another family member who she believes we must be thinking of. We have continued to set boundaries, explained why things she does and says are not okay. (She has done a lot more than I'm writing about here.)

The worst part is, she always waits for holidays, birthdays, a celebration, vacation, or any other special occasion to really act up. Sometimes it can also be something as small as her finding out we bought the baby something. (Please note, that her lashing out and lying doesn't just have to do with the baby, it just began once I got pregnant.) So, for example, we were having dinner to celebrate my husband's college graduation, just the two of us. His brother mentioned it to their mom, so he received a long text about how we must hate her and that she isn't good enough to celebrate with. Some holidays we spent with her, some with other family members or just the two of us. When it's not ""her turn"" she will send several ""why do you hate me?!"" texts or calls to my husband, and several to family members making up stories about how we made her cry on such and such holiday.


I don't know what to do anymore. We have spoken to her countless times and set boundaries, but she keeps getting worse. And keep in mind, she's only like this towards us. As holidays are approaching, I'm getting worried. I don't want another year of this.

She has most recently started posting very vague, adolescent quotes and sayings on social media, pertaining to revenge, karma, making sure people get what they deserve for wronging her, etc. I'm horribly stressed about everything. 

My husband thinks ignoring the problems is the solution to this, since talking to her hasn't worked.

What should I do?


Tl;Dr: After getting pregnant, my MIL decided my husband and I hate her, despite us being quite friendly. No matter what we do or say, she isn't happy, and has resorted to telling lies to family members about us. Her being the victim in everything. During holidays, she will keep texting or calling my husband with guilt trips, manipulation, and overall very depressing things, and then will call other family members and tell lies about what horrible things we said or did on those holidays. What should I do? "
"[Update] My [43 F] husband [46 M] doesn't like our daughter's [17 F] boyfriend [17 M] because he's black.

tl:dr of previous post: My husband doesn't like our daughter's boyfriend because he's black. I'm not really sure what to do.


I would like to thank all of you guys for your responses. Just wanted to update some of you even though the issue is still ongoing.


I confronted my husband and told him that he was the one splitting the family apart and he shouldn't blame me for not going along with his racism. I told him if he continues acting like this he will send both his daughter and myself away from him. He was still angry at me but after awhile until I think he realized that I was serious. He said he wasn't sure if he would ever be 100% okay with it and wants ""the best"" four our daughter but for the sake of keeping the peace he'll let her do whatever she wants.


So our daughter is no longer grounded and is ""allowed"" to hand around Kenton and he is not allowed to say anything about it unless there's evidence of it negatively effecting our daughter. but there is still definitely tension in the house. I feel like our daughter views my husband as kind of ""the evil enemy."" The relationship between them is completely strained. On the other hand I do think Kenton and her are getting very close which is obviously annoying my husband.


Now that school is started, and she and Kenton are in some of the same classes, she spends time with him after school and they study together, or she texts him a lot. For example, on her Instagram and Facebook she posts many pictures of them together (ot inappropriate pictures or kissing pictures, just pictures of them together) and I can tell it annoys my husband but since he promised not to say anything he's keeping quiet


To my husband's credit he asked her to invite him over for dinner but she refused and said that ""she wouldn't put him (Kenton) through that misery"" This again annoyed my husband Now he's claiming that he think they spend to much time together and that she should be focusing on school and applying to college instead, and his race has nothing to do this.


This is bullshit because although they do seem to talk a lot she has always been involved in a lot of activities like cheer-leading, and plays/musicals that kept her out of the house. And most of the time they spend together isn't at his house or anything it's at the school or the library. I told him this and he said that if her grades drop she has to stop seeing him which I agreed with so he's quiet


Anyway to conclude it hasn't' gotten much better, but at least he's not making snide remarks around the house anymore and finding excuses to dislike him.

"Married 26F with my 28 M, caught husband having sex with a close friend of ours. The've been having an affair. Thank you for the messages and advice!



Here is a link to the previous thread. https://redd.it/4wsqpw 
Hello everyone, I wanted to give everyone a quick update. I received lots of messages, and appreciate the advice. I wanted to clarify and update about the situation. He is not a serial cheater, when we were together, he never cheated, or mistreated me. This was his first GF/Love, and somewhere their relationship went south. 

Later I came into this picture. In the back of my mind, I had a fear that he still had feelings for her. And I knew I could never compete with her in looks and her bedroom behavior.

 However we had a few years of a great relationship. fast forward a few years, she gets divorced, we help her through it, we become best friends. 

She came over to our house to have her laptop reprogrammed, something was wrong, but my assumption is, she intended to fuck him that afternoon. 

And that is what happened. They have been continuing this for a few weeks, since I have made it clear that we are not reconciling.

 I have received a few texts from her wanting to talk, but that is not happening. Sadly, we were discussing a potential 3 way, but this happened, and I think maybe since that was discussed, she used it as an opportunity. 

He is just as guilty.. I will be filing for divorce, and won't work on reconciling. He is open to ending it with her, and working on our marriage, but since they have a history, there is no guarantee this won't happen again.

 Most of my friends have never been through this, so their advice was mixed. So, I will just move on.

tl;dr: husband having affair, I am filing for divorce.

"Me [32 F] with my Husband [33 M] We said we didn't want kids, now he does. It's ruining us.


I've never seen myself as a mother, I don't like children, children don't really like me either, I never played with dolls and I don't know how to be around children. I think the world as it is right now is a crappy place to bring in new people. I like animals better and they like me back, gimme a puppy or a kitty or a bunny anytime. I've never really had that motherly instinct surge everyone has told me I would have and I've always said that when it get it, IF I get it (edited), then I'll want kids. I haven't, I have no rush for it and I am (was, read below) perfectly happy like this. I thought he was too, he did certainly look like it.

I was 100% clear about all of the above with my husband 3 years ago when we decided to get married (5 years together) and he said he was fine with it. Apparently he is not, and last week he got drunk, had a meltdown and said that he's miserable, that I'm selfish and that he does want to have children. He even pulled the ""your body won't bear a pregnancy later"". He even said that if when we turn 10 years together and we still have no kids, he'd leave.

I don't think we need kids, also we both have very demanding professional lives. We compensate that with our favorite activities, we have even been blessed to find that balance between work and life.

I love him so so much, he's not perfect but really, who is? I don't want to lose him over this, should I get pregnant? Should I reevaluate this entire relationship? 

Please help.

EDIT: I am at work, sitting alone in my office having done NO work whatsoever all morning and I have tears in my eyes, sobbing uncontrollably. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account, but I've been in Reddit for years, I usually am the one trying to give advice to a complete stranger, not really knowing if he/she would read it, and if they would how would they react to it. Today, I am completely overwhelmed by you, my dear fellow redditors, you have not only read my little story but have been incredibly direct, honest and loving. Today, I don't feel as alone as I've felt all week, I've been terrified to talk to my Mom about it, I've been terrified to call my therapist and asking her for an appointment, I had absolutely no idea how to handle this situation. You have given me so much courage such great advice and so much love that I really had to write this down. For the first time since last week, these tears are of happiness and courage. I am excited that the world is not as shitty as it looks and that total strangers can lift someone up so high, they´ll find that courage in their hearts and minds. 

Please keep on writing, I read everything. Thank you so so so much for it all.

EDIT 2: So I called him and asked him about the counselling, surprisingly he said yes and apparently he's very willing. He's also saying that ""the whole kids thing comes and goes, it's not a deal-breaker for me"" WTF?!?!?!? I'm so confused and angry right now I want to throw my poor phone out the window.

About the whole meltdown and berating he seems truly sorry, I told him I want us to be happy but that we need help. I also told him I needed solo therapy as well, since this whole ordeal has really taken its toll on me and I need to get my shit together. If I'm not ok with myself, I won't be able to be ok with anyone else. He said that he was scared about that but that he was ok. I thought of suggesting him that he should also go to therapy, but I'm terrified of how he'll take it. He didn't suggest it either.

Thank you all, you have been incredibly helpful.

"Me [28F] with dad [57M] and step mother [53F]. They told me that I'm receiving half the inheritance my step siblings will receive.


So a few nights ago my dad called me and he told me that he and my step mother are preparing their wills and he wants to talk to me about what portion I'll be receiving.

First let's get this out there that this isn't about money. I'm a high earner and don't need a cent from them. And my dad and step mother are healthy as horses and I hope they'll be with us for 50 more years.

So he told me that they're considering 1/5 of the amount they're setting aside for children. My step brother and step sister (step mother's children) will receive 2/5 each. I asked why not 1/3 each and he thinks that will be unfair as my (stay at home) step mother has contributed a lot to the family and it's unfair if I'll be getting as much as her children. I asked if he has made half the contributions his wife has, as he's now giving me half but he does indeed think her children deserve more.

I lived with my parents until I was 12 when they divorced, and my dad married this woman shortly after. I lived with my mom after that. I visited my dad regularly and have OK relationship with step mother and step siblings, but it's always fair to say I've been an outsider to that family. This decision just cements that. I wouldn't expect my step mother to include me equally as her own children in her will, hell I don't even expect her to include me at all, but I expected more from my dad. This just tells me he considers me half as valuable/wanted as his step kids.

So is it ok to be disappointed here?

"my [21 F] close friend [22 F] of 15 years has finally gotten into major trouble for shoplifting $1300 worth of makeup. She has been shoplifting on an off since 6th grade. She wants me to write her a character letter. I'm not sure if I should.


[Non-Romantic]

Hi reddit. This situation has left me very confused and it would be nice to have some outside input. Long story short, Marissa and I have been friends for almost 16 years. In most of grade school we didn't really like each other, mostly due to our competitive natures. Eventually we became close friends, and attended the same high school and now a big 10 college. Neither of us are perfect, and she started telling me of shoplifting excursions starting when we were both in 6th grade. I'd go over to her house and she'd show me her vast collection of beauty supplies, and kind of brag about ""I bought that... stole that... oh yeah, that too"" etc. It bothered me, but she didn't get caught so it never became a problem in her life. Her parents got divorced around 9th grade, not sure if that's applicable but it might be?

This apparently continued through to high school as well. I believe I remember her telling me about a time where her and her younger friend Lana got caught at a Walgreens one day shoplifting together but she said they got a slap on the wrist from the cop and a ban from that Walgreens. Later in high school I didn't really go over to her house as much so I didn't see any more stolen stuff or she just didn't tell me about it.

Flash forward to this year. Earlier this year, sometime around March, I get a call from Marissa. She's in tears because she was caught taking about $15 worth of food from a dining hall. She was caught by the manager and was afraid she was going to get kicked out of school, and this was happening on top of her issues with going off depression and anxiety medication, or changing the dosage. She's a fun person to be around and I was aware of her depression issues, as she was aware of my own issues. We shared a lot of secrets which is probably why she felt comfortable enough to let me know that this had happened. Nothing really bad happened after she was caught, only Marissa told me she did this a lot. As in, stealing food from the dining halls. It was very hard for me to understand why, as she had over $1000 on her account for money (her parents are lawyers and very well off). She just ended up going to mandatory meetings a few times about trying to prevent shoplifting and trying to be a better member of our campus. I don't even think it went on a permanent record.

Now, in the past few days, she again called me crying, saying she'd been arrested after going to the mall to the local Lush store and stealing about $1300 worth of stuff. Marissa was read her rights and given a court date after telling the officers that yes, she did take the stuff. She was calling lawyers and planning not to tell her dad. She was terrified that she was going to be convicted of a felony. I can't imagine how she must have felt. She did end up telling her parents because she called her therapist and the therapist told her she probably should. Her dad got so angry apparently, and called her a ""criminal"" and that he could never trust her again. He was going to cut her off completely, (probably after the school incident she was given a final warning) but was convinced to keep paying for college. Marissa was scared he just meant tuition and not housing or food. She still doesn't know and was not planning on getting a job because she needs to hunker down and study (as her grades have been less than stellar), as she was going to get a degree with all the premed requirements (unrelated to her degree, think about getting a psych degree and the premed requirements) and didn't want to get a job in the middle of all that. Marissa has no savings as she spends a lot of her money on shopping. She thinks, and I agree, that she has Kleptomania (none of us are qualified to diagnose her, but the way she described her compulsion to steal sounds right).

She eventually got a hold of a lawyer and that's where my question comes in. Marissa wants me, and a few of her friends and maybe a professor, to write her a letter of character to show at the court date, and since I've known her the longest, she really wants mine. I have a lot of reservations about doing this, for a few reasons. First, she told me she's done this three times this summer and gotten away with it. Similar amounts of stuff. THREE TIMES. I just got home from a summer internship out east a few days ago, and if it wasn't for a plane delay I was going to go shopping with her. To the same store she got caught at. She denies it but I'm scared Marissa would have taken the stuff from Lush if I had been there and I would have gotten into trouble too.

Second, last time this happened (ie stealing from the dining halls) Marissa promised to get help and stop doing it (though that sounds like an impossible promise from someone with kleptomania). She always blames her problems on her meds or her parents or her schoolwork and never seems to want to take responsibility. Somewhere deep down I feel like this is a good thing, that maybe she'll start taking her health seriously now. 

Finally, and this will be the worst sounding one, I'm not sure if I should write her a letter of character because I'm not sure I can vouch for her character. Even when we were little she'd always try to be the center of attention and manipulate people. I remember one time she got mad at me and drew red lines on her arm with a red pen and pretended to hide it when I saw, like she had cut herself. Marissa constantly brings up ""wrongs"" that people have done to her in the past and follows them up with ""but it's no big deal now"", even for stuff that happened when we were in first grade!! It's hard to feel sympathetic towards someone who never seems to want to take responsibility for their actions. She sounds like she has some serious ideas now for taking control of her life back, and that's awesome!!! But I am so skeptical they'll actually happen. Marissa feels super shitty that she keeps doing this and says she wants to stop. 

I'm just not sure what to do reddit. Not even sure if I should stay friends with her. She doesn't really have any other close friends and none of my friends really like her. I guess what I'm asking is, should I write the letter? How do I go about praising someone I believe needs help and who isn't in a praiseworthy spot right now? Am I a huge raging asshole who just needs to help out a friend?? Thank you for your help :) Sorry for textwall!!

TL;DR: Friend from elementary school stole $1300 worth of stuff from a big cosmetics store. This isn't the first time and she's been doing it for years. She was arrested and wants me to write a character letter for the judge. Not sure if I should do it or am asshole. 

Edit1: She just texted me saying ""Don't imply that I've done this before tho. We want to make it an isolated event"" 

Edit2: I'm not writing it. I sent her this:

""Marissa, if you want me to write a letter omitting the events of the past, especially the times you haven't been caught, I can't. That's lying. Especially to a court. I love you and you're my friend but I don't think it's the best idea for me to write you a letter precisely because I have known you so long. You're a kind person but have been doing this for a long time and not mentioning that would be wrong. I cannot write you a letter that would help you so I should not write one at all. Doing so is possibly illegal as well. I'm sorry and wish you the best of luck.""

Edit3: Things went surprisingly well. She told me her lawyer was the one who told her to not mention the other incidents and to make it seem like it was isolated, and she said she wasn't aware it made me so uncomfortable. Also, in regards to the kleptomania, she (again, this is her word and I don't know how honest it is) told me yesterday that she does feel a compulsion to steal, and that it's like a ""pressure"" building until she goes and does it. She then feels awfully guilty and the pressure goes away for a bit but then returns. Thank you for all the comments and advice, y'all kicked my ass into gear.

Edit4: First of all, thank you for the advice in general. I got a few really nice PM's that made me even more sure the majority of you telling me not to do it were right. A few angry PM's too saying I'm an awful friend. I'm definitely not trying to be and I want the best for her, but not for her to slide past on everything, especially because this is a definite pattern. Second, I fudged the details a little in the post to not be recognized, the actual store she took from was **Sephora**, not Lush. So many people commented their confusion I thought I should clear that up! God I hope this is finally a big enough wakeup call for her. There is no indication that she's mad at me yet though she didn't message me back after saying she didn't know writing the letter would make me uncomfortable. Thanks guys :)"

"My [24F] co-workers [various, mostly male 20's] are making fun of my bf's[26M, together a year] missing eye, and I've gotten in more trouble for defending him than they have.


So, my boyfriend, Ryan, lost his left eye a couple years ago, before I knew him. These days he mostly wears either an eye patch or put a fully-white fake eye in the socket, so it isn't like it is a subtle injury. I honestly think he is the handsomest guy in the world, but I know he gets a bit self-conscious about it, though he wouldn't admit it.

Anyway, on this previous Friday night, I had forgotten something important I needed and Ryan swung by and dropped it off for me. He was wearing the eye patch.

After he left, one of my co-workers, who I'll call Andy, asked me if there was something wrong with his eye. I just explained to him that he had lost that eye a couple years previously and figured that was all I would ever need to do.

Well, a little while later I stepped into the break area in the back, and Andy was in there talking to a couple other workers. He was covering his eye with his hand in an obvious mockery of an eye patch and saying something along the lines of ""I thought pirates were attacking the store or something"". They all laugh, and I just rolled my eyes and told Andy to stop being a douche. Well then other co-workers start jumping on board, asking my stuff like ""So your bf really only has one eye?"" and ""How did he lose it?"" I was trying to be polite and just told them yes, he is missing an eye, and I didn't really feel cool talking about how it happened without him around. 

Instead of dropping it, they starting making some very stupid and personal comments. They kind of stopped talking to me and were joking amongst themselves about how he shouldn't be driving and using an empty socket to hide stuff or something. I was getting *livid*, and finally lost it when I heard someone say ""I wonder what sex is like with a guy who has no depth perception."" I flew off the handle and told them to fuck off and shut their mouths.


They kind of shut up for a while. Towards the end of my shift, I was told the manager wanted to talk to me. I figured he wanted to hear about my co-workers making fun of my bf. instead, he asked why I had been yelling and using foul language in the workplace. I tried to tell him about the things they had been talking about that lead me to lose my temper. He brushed that aside, saying ""I mean, he was wearing an eye patch, you can't expect no one to ever say anything."" He told me I was wrong for losing my temper and causing problems at work over minor stuff. I was getting angry all over again, and I told the manager I should probably leave before I start yelling again. Before I left, he told me to take Saturday night off to ""cool down"" before I come back in.

I really don't know how to handle this. I have a mind to call and complain to corporate, but I think it would also be pretty obvious to anyone here who complained, and Im not sure I have faith in the corporate office to protect me from retribution if it comes to it.

There is also a not-insignificant chance I will get pretty angry all over again if co-workers keep making comments about Ryan's injury.

"My [M 34] girlfriend [F 24] does not like it when I bake pastries even though it is one of my favorite hobbies. I don't understand why she's upset.


My girlfriend Tara and I have been dating for 6 months. I love her a lot and she is everything I could ever want in a significant other. However, she doesn't like the fact that I bake. I'm not talking about getting baked-- I love making cakes, pastries, cookies, and all sorts of desserts. 

Tara said she doesn't feel special when I'm baking. She thinks I bake because I love the activity rather than the reason being that I love her. So I guess she feels inferior to my love of baking, but I like to bake her things because I enjoy making her happy AND because it is one of my favorite hobbies.

She has been really distant lately. I'm afraid she will break up with me, but she's the only woman I've ever thought about marrying. What should I do? (btw, English is not my first language and I have a thick accent, so there may be some type of misunderstandings as well.)

**tl;dr** girlfriend of 6 months says she doesn't feel special when I bake, and Idk what to do

**EDIT:** thank you to everyone who replied! I never expected this many responses. I really appreciate all the opinions and different points of view. Even though most people said Tara was insecure and possibly crazy, other people brought up the fact that maybe she has an eating disorder and gets triggered by an excess of food. Or maybe she just wants to watch her weight and cannot resist my baked goods.

Anyway, much love to you all for taking time to read all this and share your thoughts with me. I appreciate it very much!"
"Me [20M] with my GF [22F] of a year, I got her a nice gift, and a bunch of issues surface

"Me [22F] with my fiance [22M] of 4 years, masters degree has turned him into a lunatic about genetic disorders and pregnancies.


So this isn't an issue at this very second, but I think it will be soon, and so I kind of want to nip it in the bud before he gets too obsessed.

My fiance and I met in our first year of university, moved in together in our third year to save on bills, and began renting together upon graduation. I have been in full time work for a year while he has been doing a masters degree on something to do with genetic disorders and other related things. A lot of his research is on causes of different disorders, and apparently a common theme among all of them and a big cause of disorders is kids conceived above the age of 30.

Over the course of the last year, this has now brewed some crazed obsession where he's tried to work out how late we can put-off having children before our future-kids risks of X, Y &amp;Z disorder start to rise. In a fit of throwing his papers around the room and declaring the risks are just too high, he has decided that we should probably start trying to have kids in a year or two to make sure we can get a good 2/3 kids in before I approach 30 ""to be safe"".

This, is out of the question for me. With a university degree i'm a few years later than everyone else entering the ""adult world"". I planned to enjoy the freedom of it, go on holiday, get some savings going and work off some of my debt from student loans before I brought kids into the picture. MY ideal timeline would have been to start TRYING for kids somewhere between 30-35 (yes, I do know there can be issues as you get older, but it's a risk I'm willing to take for a few child-free adult years).

The sensible compromise in my mind was to say we start trying at around 27-28 or something, and he burst into tears. At this point more than the kids issue I'm worried for his general sanity, but he keeps insisting it's just the pressure of doing the masters and he'll be fine when it's over. 

We have talked about marriage/kids before and so he knows I want 3, and keeps telling me things like how it'd be impossible to have three children in good health if I started at the age of 30 and our only possible option is to start soon. And since it's unlikely I'll fall pregnant in quick succession on our first attempts he's saying it'll take years and if I reached the dreaded age of 35 the world might has well have exploded, and so we absolutely must start as soon as he's got a good job. 

There is 100% no chance I will be having kids next year, but I'm asking for help on a way to talk him down from this crazy behaviour and prevent him from having a complete meltdown when I tell him this. I also wondered what a good compromise on the age to start would be, if I can get him back to normal again. I am understanding of the idea that 35 is probably a bit late and I should move my plans up a bit earlier, but I'm wondering when a reasonable-person window is? 

TLDR: Fiance read too many horror stories about genetic disorders doing his masters degree, and has decided we absolutely must have a baby next year or our water will turn into blood, frogs will rain from the sky and our families will be attacked by locusts. Help."

"My [17F] Daughter is upset with me[41M] after coming out as gay to me.


So, Throwaway cause I know she uses reddit, as do I.

I'd like to preface this that her uncle - my brother - is gay, and I have never talked bad about it or that it bothers me, so this really has me confused.

So Last night I was in my living room reading a book when *Sally comes in looking rather sheepish. I clocked her with a smile and went back to reading my book. I knew the look on her face meant she wanted to say something, but I would let her get it out in her own time.

After a few minutes she kind of blurts out that she has something to tell me. I put my book down and she starts raving on about her feelings and how confused she's been for a few years. This was weird for me as I am not the most emotionally available person, and I kind of thought this was a conversation she should have with my wife, and her mother, but whatever I'll try and help her like a dad should. 

Maybe 10 minutes into what had become a bit of a ramble, she kind of wore her self out and just let out ""I'm gay dad."" I was a little side struck for a few seconds and (admittedly looking back it may have come off a little callous maybe) I said back to her ""Oh, okay. good for you."" I picked up my book and read again. It didn't matter to me whether she was gay, and I thought making a big deal about it might upset her, so the low key approach should have worked right?

Nope, been avoiding me ever since. even after I told her, that her sexuality is of no concern of mine as long as she is happy. Her mother is confused as to why she thought a 'need' to tell me about it. We're both pretty liberal people and I have a gay brother with whom I love, so why she is sad and noticeably upset with me I have no idea! Have I missed a trick here? Did she want me to make a fuss over it?

I wouldn't consider my self an unfair or strict dad, or given her reason why she thinks I need to approve of her sexual preferences. My only ruling on this is, be safe. We live in the UK so it's 16 for age of consent and When she turned 16 I told her that I know what I was like at that age and that not all boys are being nice just to be nice, and that as long as she is safe and responsible that's good. I was not gonna lie to myself and pretend she was not going to start having sex. Me and her mum agreed that it was better in the house than in an alley, wasn't exactly thrilled but my wife assured me she was a responsible young woman and would be safe.

I really have no idea what I have done wrong.

**tl;dr**: Daughter comes out as gay, I tell her ""okay"" it doesn't bother me, and now she's upset with me. Why?"

"Me [25 M] and my fiance[25 F] together 6 years decided to cancel our wedding plans


Hi there! I'll try to make this quick.

My fiance and I have been together six years.  Earlier this year, we decided to take the next step in our relationship and got engaged. We had been planning a small wedding since then. However, over the past few weeks we did some serious talking and thinking back and decided that neither of us want to be married. We decided to not have a wedding and not get married, but we have no desire to break up.
 
This decision was not made lightly and was not made because we have trouble in our relationship. Our relationship is as strong as ever. We've learned that I felt pressured into proposing *by her* because she felt pressured into marriage *by me*. We feel that we essentially pressured each other into engagement and subsequent marriage and neither of us truly has a strong desire to be married. In addition to this, we felt pressured by family. Both of us come from broken homes and this may play a role in our lack of desire for marriage.

I know this is quite an abnormal thing to do - cancel a wedding not because of relationship issues. But we feel this is a better choice for us. I am posting because I am looking for advice on how to share this with people, especially family, because we know folks won't be happy to hear it and we know it's not ""what they want for us"". Thanks so much!

"[Update] My boyfriend [28m] of three years is mad at me [25f] because I don't want to visit his dying grandma again.


[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x3iar/my_boyfriend_28m_of_three_years_is_mad_at_me_25f/)

tl;dr of my last post was: Dropped everything and drove 10 hours to visit my boyfriend's dying grandmother last weekend and he wants me to turn around and do it again this weekend, which I don't think I can handle.

My post didn't get too much attention but I did get quite a few people PMing me asking if I could update them on the other issues that came up in the thread (my boyfriend basically taking advantage of me and treating him like his personal nanny, maid, and sex toy while receiving little to nothing but a roof over my head in return). First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate all of the support I received and that everyone's comments really opened my eyes to a situation that I had become numb to.

On Friday I tried talking to him about it (a little premature I know, but it was eating at me). I admitted that I sort of felt that things were going downhill and in a moment of weakness I started looking at apartments for my girls and I to move into. His initial response was that I shouldn't ever complain that he doesn't think about the future for us when I'm out looking for apartments (this is an issue I brought to him a while ago - we've been dating for three years and have a child, but no serious talk about marriage, saying he's not going to 'rush into it'). Fair enough, but I explained to him that the reason that I did it was because I was brought to the realization that without him, my day to day life would not change. My emotional support level would minimally change, along with the amount of love and affection I feel.

Reddit, he said nothing. **Absolutely nothing.**

After about five minutes of staring blankly at each other, I went to bed without another word to him. We got up Saturday morning and I went to see his grandma with him, we acted like nothing happened and I honestly had a great time. I love his family, they love me. And that's where it's confusing. We obviously have some pretty severe issues, but now that I spent the whole weekend with his (entire/huge) amazing family, I feel so conflicted. When we got home I tried to bring it up to him but nothing came of it.

I'm sorry for such a dull update - I just wanted to let the people asking know what happened. I don't think we'll talk about it again. He'll act like nothing happened, just like he always does, and I don't want that. I'm pretty sure it's over. I'll be devastating his family and he'll probably hate me forever, but there's really not much more I can do when I voice my concerns and they're not even valuable enough to warrant a response.

So now I have to figure out how the hell I'm going to move out with no money and raise two kids on my own. I just want you all to know that I appreciate you bringing these issues to light and making me realize that I didn't have to be with someone who does nothing but take advantage of me.

"UPDATE: Me [26F] with my BFF [25F] of 6 yrs; she is unfaithful to her fiance [28M] - Bridesmaid no more!


So here's the update no one asked for, and obviously this was a while ago but shortly after posting, shit. went. down. Link to OP below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44d6mc/me_26f_with_my_bff_25f_of_6_yrs_she_is_unfaithful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44d6mc/me_26f_with_my_bff_25f_of_6_yrs_she_is_unfaithful/)

After sifting through the comments and PMs, I am forever grateful to the internet strangers who helped with this situation. For those too lazy to check to OP, the tl;dr is that I [26F] had knowledge that my soon-to-be-married BFF Marie [25F] was cheating on her fiance Paul with her ex-boyfriend Joseph. As it turns out, my sister, my boyfriend Daniel, and I are not the only ones who knew/suspected she was cheating.

Paul's best friend Tony had his own suspicions around the same time, and somehow got proof that Marie was texting her ex-boyfriend at all hours of the day and night, for weeks and weeks, even after I had had a conversation with her about how she needed to stop/come clean/whatever she needed to do to start an honest marriage with Paul. Tony and some of their other friends confronted Paul; Marie denied everything, and in turn, accusing Paul of *cheating on her with my sister*! (They work together.) I just about lost my shit. I quickly calmed down, and when my sister said Paul wanted to know everything we knew, I sent her screen shots of the conversation we had, in which Marie admitted to sleeping with Joseph just before they got engaged and ""apologizing.""

During work hours in the aftermath of being told during the first two days, apparently he stayed strong and determined to leave her, but once he got home, I guess he folded like a house of cards and she manipulated him into staying. Even with the phone records, even with the screen shots of our conversation. According to various other friends, Marie keeps changing her story - first saying that she never did anything with Joseph, then that he only kissed her on the forehead, then that he only kissed her on the lips, then that he only fingered her. Bits and pieces of the truth here and there and my guess is that it's never going to come out. She also accused me of only ""waiting until the right time to drop a bomb"" and ""trying to ruin her life"" and ""being jealous"" and ""wanting her and her fiance to be as miserable as we (my boyfriend and I) are."" High school drama BS. I decided I didn't have time for it, and sent her a note that because of her lies, ridiculous behavior, and outrageous accusations against my sister, I had no interest in being in her wedding or in continuing a friendship with her. She has ""banned"" Paul from speaking to my sister at work, even though they work in a small office and it's extremely unprofessional that he's acquiescing to her demands. I'm sure she is spreading more lies and gossip about everyone who attempted to inform Paul of her infidelities.

Ultimately, he's made his choice and I can do nothing more. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy with Paul, but she made the choice to cheat on her fiance and lie to everyone around her. 

Again I wanted to thank everyone for reading the OP and this. No more drama, woo!
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Update to OP about friend who was cheating on her fiance and what I should do about it - turns out, other friends knew and told him first, then he came to me for information, which I readily gave. No longer friends with either of them because my friend couldn't be honest and made ridiculous accusations against my sister. Oh well! "
