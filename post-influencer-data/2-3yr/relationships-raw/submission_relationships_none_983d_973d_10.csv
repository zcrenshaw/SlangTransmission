"UPDATE: I [23f] really like a coworker [23m] but can't tell if he's just friendly


Hey! This didn't get a ton of attention or anything but I'm updating anyways.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54tq2d/i_23f_really_like_a_coworker_23m_but_cant_tell_if/

Original post above! Tl;dr my cute coworker and me, wasn't sure if he liked me and if it was appropriate to ask him.

So over time I still liked him but had moved out of the intense crush phase. It didn't seem like he was interested. It made me a little sad, but wasn't devastating or anything. Still would have been over the moon if he had just spontaneously asked me out, but it wasn't as much on my mind anymore.

So we were hanging out and talking about another coworker/friend, who just started officially dating a guy she had been casually seeing. (Not trash talk, just like ""wonder how it's going!"") I had already told him about my past relationship, and he had alluded to dating people in the past but very much in passing and with an air of not wanting to elaborate, so I hadn't asked. But we are fairly close friends now, so I figured I'd ask him directly since I felt sure he would just tell me if he didn't want to talk about it.

To my surprise, he's actually dating a ""friend"" from college he's told me about in the past (i actually met him once at a lecture we went to after work)! The only reason I say I'm surprised was that for some reason I thought my coworker had said that this friend had a girlfriend. But it turned out I had just gotten confused about which friend he was talking about. But the second he said it, everything made much more sense. He and the friend (actually boyfriend!) went to lunch every now and then during the workday since we all work near each other...I thought it was sweet that they had such a tight friendship but it's even cuter now that I know they just have a really close relationship!

I'll admit there was a part of me that was a tiny bit sad when he first told me, but I'm being totally honest when I say that that only lasted for a moment. I'm queer as well, so we had a really good heart to heart (he had pinged my ""gaydar"" as being queer, but wasn't sure if he was bi or whatnot), and honestly I feel like we're closer now than ever now, but with none of those butterflies in my stomach from earlier, just really honest friendship.

Also, we have another gay coworker and friend who is very flamboyant and we are planning on trolling him by telling him he no longer has the gayest study in this lab (we're scientists). His face will be amazing.


Tl;dr he's gay and in a really cute relationship, and we are bros



EDITED: fixed some typos/minor grammatical errors for clarity.

Also, I truly did not expect this level of response! My original post had a couple of comments, but I wanted to share this anyway, since it's interesting that this is one of those times when I had a sudden paradigm shift, and also an example of a situation not ending in a ""good"" way (ie, oh he likes me and we're dating!), but in a way that's actually somehow better (great bonding moment with a friend). I'm touched so many of you have responded to this with your stories and support. Thanks!"

**Edit for Update** 

Let him go as nicely as possible. His sister has been blowing my phone up all day with invectives and nasty slams telling me her brother is so amazing. I messaged her back that she should have married him if she was so smitten with him. Then blocked her.

He messaged me after I specifically said not to so I told him messaging me after I told him not to is NOT respectful, so he is not being respectful, and that makes him a not nice guy, do NOT message me again.

He complied, but I blocked him after work anyway.

Thank goodness he doesnt know where I live.

I give up on dating for a while. Maybe a nice vacation to somewhere that serves lobster would be a better use of my time.

---Original---

I've been talking to this guy for a few months and am getting increasingly creeped out by him.  My friends and family insist I am being judgmental and mean.

He constantly talks about how much he loves his sister, her husband, his brothers, and their kids (he sent me a picture of the kids the first day he texted me. I reacted poorly to that. Not his kids, should not be sending strangers their photos, what the hell!) 

Any difference of opinion we have is met with ""I respect you I respect that you have a point of view I am a very respectful guy I am a nice guy. I am a really nice guy, everyone thinks I am a nice guy."" Unless it's about church, then he tells me there is no excuse to not go. 

He monologues every time we talk on the phone, often times interrupting me or cutting me off after asking me a question, all while talking as fast as possible. We have had the same conversation every time he calls (him telling me inappropriately personal things for our acquantance, like vivid detail of family members deaths). I have told him this, and he immediately interrupts with the ""I respect you,"" spiel, again as fast as possible. Then goes right back to what I objected to and restarts the story. I have hung up on him several times for this already.

He always talks at lightning speed and in the rare times I can get a word in edgewise, no acknowledgement of me having said anything happens. He bulldozes on, jumping subject to subject again speaking extremely fast.

The most annoying part was him telling me ""My sister said I should tell you you are beautiful. You are really beautiful, beautiful."" I flatly told him that he was insincere and to not call me beautiful if he didnt mean it, and to address me by my name.  He lapsed into the I respect you,"" speech again.

I dont know if he has some kind of disability, or if he's just plain insane. Some things he does are similar to my autistic sister, some are similar to people I know with adult ADHD. Then again some are just batshit insane.

*Edit to add*
Every day he texts me morning, noon, and night to have a good day, he hopes work is going well, and he hopes work went well, and that he is praying for me. I dont even text my mother that much. It feels very much like forced intimacy and I tell him to text less.

My friends are insisting I am cruel for not wanting to give him a chance, because he's very good looking.

I think I should run for the hills and cancel the date (that he asked me out on, but I have to plan. Because he likes everything I like and wants to do anything I want to do.)

Good people of the internet, should I put my good running kicks on, or is he exhibiting a disorder I should be sensitive about and work with?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: He rambles nonstop about the same things, tells me I'm pretty when his sister tells him he should,  reiterates constantly that he's a respectful and nice guy, speaks at a super fast pace jumping subjects constantly, etc....and I am getting increasingly creeped out by it all, but he may have a disorder I am not aware of."

"[UPDATE] I (17/M) elbowed a female friend (17/F) of mine on Monday and now she's avoiding me.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5q7inv/i_17m_elbowed_a_female_friend_17f_of_mine_on/)

Coincidentally enough, the girl, Julie, ended up texting me back before my mom had the chance to talk to her mom. The text I sent her on the day of the incident was, ""Hey, I'm really, really sorry for what happened back there. I hope you're okay,"" and she texted me back late last night saying, ""I'm fine. I heard you switched lockers with Gia. You didn't have to do that."" I replied asking, ""It was best to switch though, wasn't it?"" And she answered, ""No. You're fine, OP. Stop."" I wasn't really sure what to say to that other than, ""So you're not scared of me?"" and she said, ""Of course not. I was never scared. I needed a few days to process. That's all. Plus I'm pretty sure I flashed you when I fell. That was so embarrassing."" I immediately said, ""I didn't see anything. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. It was my fault."" 

After that we continued texting for a bit. She ended up talking to her mom on her own, and then we walked to home room together today. According to her she avoided me because she thought I saw something. But I didn't. Seriously. She said we're cool, and our moms had a chat, came to the conclusion that we're okay, just shaken up for different reasons. Regardless, I'm still going to talk to my hockey coach about how to control reflexes off the ice. Julie said she's fine but I don't want to risk anything like that happening again. 

(EDIT: *Someone told me to add this comment of mine in the post*. In my mind I lost all sense and gave her a hard elbow on reflex, realizing it was *her* when it was too late, but according to her I sorta just nudged her when I spun around and she lost balance from that. In reality what happened was probably somewhere in the middle. Those people were (rightfully) reacting under the impression that Julie was scared/traumatized, which she easily could have been. Regardless, I should work on my reflexes.)

TL;DR - She texted me back late last night, before our moms had the chance to speak, and she told me she's fine, and that she had avoided me for a few days because she was embarrassed. Apparently she flashed me when she fell. I have no memory of that. I didn't see anything. I told her as much. We're cool now. That said I'm still going to talk to my coach about how to control my reflexes off the ice. "

"My (25/F) boyfriend (28/M) of five months spent the night at his ex's house.


They were together on/off for three years and they broke up officially around this time last year. I'm still friends with one of my exes, so I didn't really think anything of it  when he told me he was still friends with one of his. They don't hang out alone, they only hang out with their close knit group of friends. I've met them all and they're really nice people. I've never had any reason to doubt anything he's told me. He has been cheated on (by this particular ex) and it really shook him up, otherwise they'd probably still be together, so I don't think he would ever cheat on me or anyone else. He's just not coded that way. 

That said, he and I were supposed to hang out last night after work but I couldn't get a hold of him. His phone was either turned off or the battery was dead. Either way, my night was put on hold for *hours* until I finally decided to just eat out by myself. I was already dressed and ready to go, so I just left, grabbed some pho by myself and came home to find zero texts/calls from him. I left my phone at home by accident. He didn't get back to me, nor did he stop by the apartment, according to my roommate. 

On a whim, I popped onto IG to see what he was doing, if he had posted anything that day. I was partially worried that something bad had happened to him, and partially suspicious. I've never had any reason to feel suspicious of him before. As I scrolled through IG, however, I noticed that his ex had posted something. For whatever reason I follow her and she follows me. The photo was taken at his favourite restaurant. She took a photo of her dessert, and you can clearly see him in the background, seated across from her, his elbows on the table. 

She made the post hours before he and I were supposed to hang out. And in the image description she mentions having a movie night ... *with him*. One of their friends (whom I've grown close to) commented on the photo with a question mark. There was no reply. 

I was kind of numb at that point. I wasn't sure what any of it meant, but I knew he was doing something he shouldn't have been, and that he had blown me off in the process. Again, this was completely unlike him. It could have been that he had simply forgotten our plans. We organized it a week prior, which is long enough to forget. That said, I'm his girlfriend. He should remember. He should at least make sure he's reachable. 

I went to bed last night feeling sick with worry, and then when I woke up this morning, I found five texts from him saying the following:

""Hey, I'm so sorry! I forgot we had plans.""

""Cathy and I marathoned Westworld and I fell asleep. My phone died. I'm an idiot. Please forgive me."" 

""How about I pick you up tonight and we go to that new sushi place on Main?""

""Just you and I.""

""I love you."" 

I don't really know what to think. He has always made a point to never hang out with her alone. He hasn't made any promises to me in any explicit words, but when he and I first got together, he told me things between him and Cathy were completely finished, and that he had no desire to hang out with her alone anymore. He said the only reason they still *occasionally* see each other is because they're part of the same social circle. It's the same with my ex and I, except I've never hung out with him one on one post-breakup, and I don't plan on it. 

I replied back asking if anything happened between them and he said, ""No, of course not. I would never do that to you."" 

But he would make himself unavailable for hours without even thinking to say hi to me all day? Our plans were for eight o'clock. Unless he's had a rough day at work, he usually stays up much later than that, except he didn't have work yesterday, so I don't understand how he would magically fall asleep so early in the night. 

I trust him, but at the same time, I feel betrayed.

**tl;dr** He forgot we made plans, and instead hung out with her alone. They were apparently maraonthing a tv show, and he fell asleep there by mistake. His phone was dead according to him, and that's why I was unable to reach him. He has never given me any reason not to trust him in the past. He told me nothing happened, but this whole situation still looks really bad.

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [29M] of two years - he suddenly announced he hates my cat and wants him gone - I'm considering going with the cat


Hey there, using a throwaway because boyfriend knows my reddit username. Sorry if this is all over the place but I'm very upset.

I have been together with my boyfriend for 2 years and we moved in together 6 months ago. He is the love of my life, or I thought so, and I gave up so much to be with him here. I've had my cat for 5 years, not to sound like a crazy cat lady but I'm not close to my family and I only have maybe 2 friends who don't live in close proximity, so my cat is my ""family"", or has been at least my stable point in those years I had him. He knew we were a package and while we were not exactly pressured to move in together (despite being long distance), he asked me to move in with him. Boyfriend met my cat beforehand multiple times and he seemed to love him, and I must say, I have never seen my cat connect with any person like he did with my boyfriend. He used to cuddle me but since my boyfriend is nearby all the time, he completely ditched me! As far as I was concerned, it was a perfect match and I couldn't have been happier with how well the two most important people in my life got along. My boyfriend loved him so much that at some point he tried to convince me to get a second kitten as his own so my cat has company, but in the end we decided against it for multiple reasons.

Our flat is not too big and divided into rooms in a very poor way, which means we have no real way of closing the cat out of the bedroom. This hasn't been a problem until a couple days ago. My cat ate something he shouldn't have and has had an upset stomach since, so he has been complaining more than usual (but otherwise he sleeps about 20 hours a day so I wouldn't say he is a bother... either way a visit to the vet is due today). I'm a light sleeper so I wake up probably twice a night to the cat just walking around but my boyfriend never did until the cat became restless a few days ago.

He has never had a pet of his own before but he is a big animal lover. Unfortunately in light of our latest talk I realised that he is one of those people who love other people's animals/kids because he only has to deal with them for a limited time but otherwise absolutely hate the responsibility and the ugly parts that come with actually owning one. In retrospect I witnessed this about a year ago when we looked after his sister's dog for about 3 months. He claims he is a dog person (this was one of his defenses for why he hates my cat??) but after a week or two he was annoyed with the dog too even though it's a very good doggo.

So yesterday he sat me down and told me out of the blue, without much explanation that he hates my cat because he is annoying, stinky and he doesn't feel safe around him or leaving him in the flat. I think this is a bunch of bullshit and related to my cat being unwell and needing more attention in the past few days, because otherwise he is very low maintenance. But to address his new-found concerns:

- annoying: he will do ""cat"" things for maybe 30 minutes a day. Running around before pooping, meowing for attention and food, etc. He's also worried that the meowing and running around bothers our neighbours and they will report us to the building management.

- stinky: I do my best to keep his litter and the area clean, unfortunately the past week I didn't sweep in the kitchen every time he went to the toilet. I'm working two jobs and was just exhausted this past week. I always tried to do anything related to the cat on my own and not expecting help from him because even at the start I knew that essentially this is my pet I need to take care of. So he complained that there was some fine litter on the floor and how he now has to walk around knee deep in cat piss.

- not safe: my cat has NEVER bit, scratched or attacked my boyfriend in any form. He will nibble me if I ignore him too long and he needs something but nothing vicious. He admitted that he has no reason to feel unsafe but he does because it's a cat.

- the flat: technically my cat shouldn't be in this flat so this is a valid point. We got the blessing of the girl who normally lives in the flat and her mother who rents the flat to us, but the flat is owned by her husband. He wrote the lease and it very clearly says ""no pets allowed"", although we were advised to just bring him in anyway. But I do realise this leaves us no legal standpoint if it comes to defending having the cat in the flat. Unfortunately we didn't really have a choice at that time other than moving the cat in. He also complains because my cat lightly scratched the sofa before I taught him not to. It's barely noticeable but I already offered to replace it when we move out, should it be a problem.


So yeah. He told me he hates the cat and wishes he was gone. He also told me he won't throw out either of us and won't ask me to get rid of him, but he wants nothing to do with him from now on (he couldn't explain what he had to do so far apart from my cat wanting to sit in his lap every morning, something he refused to let him do in the past days). Honestly, I don't want to keep the cat somewhere where I know someone hates him, and not because I think my boyfriend would treat him badly. This incident was very eye-opening for me, because now I also think I can't stay with someone I won't be able to have more pets with. My options are either moving my cat to my ex (who very much loves him, we got the cat together) but I know I'd be heartbroken without him, I already am. Or I just break up with my boyfriend over this and move out with my cat after I figure out where we should go next. But I have no idea, I feel like it would be crazy to leave an otherwise good relationship over ""just a cat"", but my heart is breaking if I think about having to give him and possible future pets up.



To get ahead of an obvious suggestion: I moved here to be with him from another country and the flat market here is CRAZY, so I can't really just move out and find a flat on my own around here. We have been looking for a flat for the better part of those two years before we got this one, and on my own, as a foreigner, with a cat, I stand no chance.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to reply and the awesome people who messaged me about their personal stories and gave me some great advice.

To the negative commenters...well, my man is still awesome so sorry you didn't get the ""break up, hit the gym"" scenario you wanted.

To start off, I talked to my boyfriend about his drinking. He completely agreed and he realized he was getting out of hand as well. We both promised to try and keep each other on a healthier path for eating and drinking and so far we're doing great. His drinking has definitely gone down and he realized he was sleeping a bit better but not 100%.

We decided then to contact someone we know who has ties to the medical community in the country we're currently living in. He provided us with information and set us up an appointment with a sleep specialist. After a couple of days in the hospital and some testing, we found out that he does have sleep apnea. We got a mask for him and everything has been fantastic! He feels better in the morning, I feel better for being well rested, and we both feel better that he's breathing regularly in his sleep.

Everything is great again. Communication and understanding is key. Thanks again."

"(UPDATE) Me [25 M] with my roommate's [27 M] dog, keeps pooping in the house during the day


Hey everyone, [I posted a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ruqr2/me_25_m_with_my_roommates_27_m_dog_keeps_pooping/) about my roommate's dog who kept pooping in the house and I just wanted to update for everyone who commented.

Kyle and I wound up moving out a couple months ago partly because of the dog issues and partly because Chris' girlfriend found a job in our city and was going to move in with him. After we moved out, Fido continued to have the same issues. It peaked when he peed on the floor, it leaked through the floor and started dripping through a potlight in our ground floor neighbour's apartment. After that Chris was kind of at his wit's end, so he decided to bite the bullet and get an MRI for Fido.

Turns out Fido has a massive brain tumour that's completely inoperable and he has to be put down. Chris is understandably a mess (and so are Kyle and I to a lesser degree) so we've been trying our best to help out as much as we can. We're going over tonight for one last visit with Fido before he gets put down tomorrow.

Sorry it's not a very happy update, but I think in the long run it's probably for the best so Fido doesn't have to suffer and Chris doesn't have to keep getting stressed about his stuff getting destroyed. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on the initial post.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5otgaj/me_29_m_with_my31_m_6_month_boyfriend_who_isnt/)

Soooo on Sunday i found out my boyfriend had blocked me on facebook. I was able to still send him messages through FB messenger where he has a pretty new picture of he and his new girlfriend up. I was physically ill. Didn't sleep. Wanted to die very badly, but I made it. 

Moving on, I sent him a message that said I wanted my cat back and my money I loaned him to get presents for the kids. (just $100) He sent me a message that said I could come get the cat when the two kids were home so that I could explain to them i was taking it back. I ultimately said they could keep it because the kids loved it and i don't want to hurt them.

He then agrees to meet me and talk. I ask when. He answers:
""I work tomorrow but maybe tuesday after you get out of school. &lt;BradyLeeG&gt; it isn't you. You are amazing in every way possible.

I said well then you need to talk to me. Tuesday comes and he says it will have to be Thursday because his ex-wife is moving her stuff into his grandmas house, at the bottom of his driveway, because she just left her boyfriend and has no where to go and he will not allow her to stay at his house. 

I said it needs to happen today because im a wreck, my lifes been on hold for 10 days. I told him I had a lot i needed to say and that he needed to say some things to me. His response:

""Theres not a whole lot for me to say. I can't be in a relationship with another guy. I'm sorry. I thought it was what i wanted but it isn't. I do really like you and I really care about you. Over the past few months you ahve grown to become my best friend and I don't want to lose you as a friend, if you think that is possible. But I just can't be with you and I'm sorry."" 


So yeah. If you didn't check out the OP, he used to cheat on his wife all the time. Sleeping with another married guy, offering hot guys on FB blowjobs and then when the guys would decline, he'd always say someone took his phone and sent that. 

My thoughts: He is sexually attracted to guys, but cannot be with a guy for whatever reason. He's not out. He's afraid. He's a fucking liar. 

Anyways I thought i'd update anyone who read the original. Give me your thoughts. I need to be strong when I talk to him tomorrow unless he blows me off again. In which case, I'll get my closure by showing up to his station in front of all the other paramedics. "
"A stranger on the internet [34M] messaged me [18F] to let me know that my boyfriend [19M] and I are ""all over"" a couple's swapping site.


Throwaway because all of my friends know my main. And I'm sorry if the grammar in this post is all over the place, it's late here and I'm kind of freaking out. For the sake of privacy I'm going to call my bf ""Ryan"" and the guy who messaged me ""Craig."" 

**Background** : Been with Ryan for six months, the relationship is fun and great.


Now let's just get straight to it.


I was browsing social media before bed when facebook alerted me that a non-friend was requesting to send me a message. Curious, I opened it and was greeted with a shock. He stopped replying after my second question.

Craig: Soooooo umm heard that you two are into couple swapping... Etc. Lol

Me: What?

Craig: Y'all are all over a site for that. Not trying to be a creep at all or odd about it. This would be our first time doing anything like that.

Me: Can you send me screenshots of that stuff? Sorry if I sound rude. I don't think you're creepy, it's just that as far as I know my partner and I aren't on any sites for swapping or anything else sexual.



Ryan isn't picking up his phone (it's late). I think that someone might have taken our images and put them on some sort of sexual meet up website (and I have no clue what the ""Etc"" entailed.) And since we were contacted by a man in his 30s the site must say that we're older than the 18/19 year old kids we are. I'm also scared because Craig's profile says that he is from the same city that Ryan and I are from, so whatever site we're on has our relative location on it. Maybe Ryan has something to do with it? 

 I want to know how I should proceed from here. Please help. 





UPDATE: So after posting this last night I was exhausted and fell asleep.  Craig messaged me again a half hour ago and then stopped responding. I'm hoping for screenshots soon.
   

 Craig: Sorry I was asleep. I'll try to find that stuff. My wife and I deleted our profile.

Me: Yeah sorry about this mess. Idk how this could happen unless there were bots or my bf was trying to cheat on me.

Craig: No he wasn't trying to cheat, the profiles had both of you.



At this point, I'm afraid it's Ryan. I don't want it to be. He won't answer my text.



UPDATE 2: Thank you to everyone who has responded!!!

1. Something I didn't make clear in the original post is that the first message from Craig was from early January. I hadn't seen it until last night because my facebook settings have it so I only get alerted to messages from people who aren't my friends nor I have given permission to talk to me when I'm in the app or on the website. Last night was the first time I had gone on facebook in about a month.

2. At this point I'm just waiting to hear back from Ryan still. I'm leaning towards Craig is just some creep, but Ryan's silence is becoming increasingly worrying. I still am going to check swinger sites to make sure none of my pictures are being used. I will update again when this is all figured out.


**FINAL UPDATE:** Thank you so much again, all of y'all have made this day easier. Also I want to mention that I hope I never came across as shaming the swinging community, all of y'all from that community were so kind and helpful (especially u/coffeetea_swing) and my problem with all of this wasn't that the concept of swinging was scary, just the fact that my information and photos were being used without my knowledge.

So let's get to it:

Ryan ended up texting me that he wanted to see me. I got a bad vibe so I asked him to call me instead. You all were right. It was him :( apparently the fantasy of swinging was a special kink for him and he used those sites to masturbate. I couldn't find the profiles any sites because he had listed our ages as 23/24 and I had been searching couples 18/19. Craig couldn't find our information because when Ryan received my text last night he went into damage control mode and deleted everything. He had used inappropriate photos of me to lure people into chatting with him. I'm young and relatively attractive so I guess I was good bate. I threatened to call and tell my dad, who is a sheriff, about all of this if he doesn't take down all of it. I'm meeting him at a coffee shop tomorrow to look through his phone and laptop to ensure all my photos are gone.

Needless to say we're done.

Craig said he was sorry and that he didn't want to speak with me ever again, and that him and his wife only were interested in swinging because they thought Ryan and I were hot. I still don't know how the fuck he found me on facebook, and he stopped responding. So I blocked him.

ORIGINAL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ow0hm/i_21f_feel_like_my_roommate_23m_is_trying_to_take/

Hello everyone! Firstly I want to say thank you so much for all your help. I read very single one of your comments and I couldn't believe how great all the advice I was getting was! So thank you all so much.

I spoke to Max yesterday. I tried to keep things calm before immediately moving out because I was afraid of making an irrational decision. My BF gave me the go ahead for me to move in with him, and it seems like in the next few months that could be a possibility - YAY.

I talked thinks over with Max and explained, thoroughly, why certain things he was doing were not okay and why I wasn't allowing him to do them. For example, I explained all about why he shouldn't be walking my dogs (they try to get away, they pull a lot, and they're just very energetic) and he understood. After speaking for him for a few hours I could tell he was just genuinely interested in my dogs and asking a ton of questions about pretty much all breeds and what it's like to own a dog. At first I felt very paranoid and thought OH SHIT he wants to steal my doggies! But that wasn't the case, obviously.

As some of you pointed out, he just apparently really wants a dog for himself. I then went on to explain the basics and how it really isn't easy nor is it always fun, but he's still saying he just really wants his own dog and that's why he was 'smothering' mine. I guess it makes sense, but I'm a little worried. I'm not sure Max would be such a great dog owner right now.

SOO, I told him if he's serious about all this and he really does want a dog and won't be giving up after a year, I said I'd help him get into dog-owning so he doesn't go in on his own and clueless. I've decided to give him 'classes' where we can practise important things that he'll need to do with his own dog. I said the dogs for now will still be locked in my room and garden while I'm out because I'm not 100% trusting of him just yet, but when I get home some evenings we'll be doing some training.

I'll be teaching him how to walk them, how to clean up after them, bathe them, what food to buy and how to know, how to play with them and how to properly call them if he wants their attention. I also advised him not to get huskies as a first pet because they can be tough (some of you will know!) and I'd much rather him have a smaller dog which will be easier to take care of. If you have any recommendations on small, easier dogs to care for, Max and I would appreciate it. Though he's got his heart set on a Westie.
I guess that's it for now! Tomorrow we'll be walking my doggies together and I'll be teaching him the DOs and DONTs until he decides he's ready for his own pet. At first I was incredibly apprehensive when he told me he wants his own dog, but I'm no one to stop him and it seems like he does really, really want one. He's been searching up dog breeds on Google and spending hours researching on which breed he'd like.

That's it for now, guys! If you still have any advice I'd really appreciate it. I'm not expert in training so we could all use some help! 😛

Thank you, Reddit!!

TLDR - I'm going to prepare Max for getting his own dog, since that's what he's wanted since the very beginning and that's why he's been smothering my dogs, apparently. I feel worried for him, so I'm going to try my hardest to make sure he can be the perfect dog owner. I'll be giving him daily lessons on DOs and DONTs. I also explained in depth why everything he was doing with my dogs was not okay. He seems to understand now."

"Me [26 F] with my now ex-fiance [26 M] after being together over 10 years; any very long-term relationship breakup survivors out there? [breakups]


My ex-fiancé and I started dating in high school. Our values and dreams always seemed to align, even way back then. We went to different colleges, had rough patches here and there, but always knew we wanted to end up together. We saw the distance as integral to us being independent people coming together as a team. We took jobs in separate states after college for a year, but then moved in together and have been living together ever since (3+ years). 

He was my best friend. We fought here and there, but always had fun goofing around, traveling, and being creative together. We talked about being married, growing old together, having a bunch of kids. We weren't in a hurry for any of it, just excited knowing that could be the future. 

I lost my full-time job in March 2015, later finding out that undiagnosed ADHD was the mystical curveball that had been causing a rift in my productiveness throughout grade school and office jobs. I struggled through applying to many many jobs before settling for a couple part-time positions until I found something full-time. He was always supportive, but I could sense that he wasn't proud of my career (or lack thereof) anymore. Eventually the fall rolls around and I have two promising job interview processes in the works. We're both excited.

He proposed November 2015, we were thrilled, families were thrilled, friends were thrilled. It felt natural and right. I got two job offers shortly after, and started a new and great full-time position in January 2016.

I got to planning the wedding. He didn't have as much input as I thought he might, knowing how creative he is, but I attributed that to a general disinterest in wedding planning.

We fought as often as most couples fight. The fights were often about his increasing lack of communication. Sensing that wall between us, and coming from a loud family, I tended to raise my voice during arguments. This was a natural but bad reaction. This caused him, coming from a family that does not talk about feelings, to shut down more. It was a vicious cycle. 

He kept shutting down more and more. And I kept trying and trying to get him to open up. His business trips got longer and more frequent, going from 25%-50% travel. I would say I missed him when he was gone, to which he would respond "" you know i'm doing this for our future so I don't have to travel as much then."" His workdays got longer, no longer waking up for a morning cuddle session or to play with the dogs, but waking up and immediately heading to the computer or phone. Working, texting, calling until 9 or 10pm at night. 

I couldn't hold his attention for longer than a minute at times. I would be interrupted mid-sentence during our only conversation of the day by him answering a phone call, only for him to forget he was talking to me and never come back to finish the conversation. Every time I tried to talk to him about these concerns, I got ""I am too busy to talk about this now."" So I would bottle them up and  we would never find time and they would eventually come out as a yell during a fight. 

But I was still holding on to what we were before the engagement, and onto all the dreams we shared for the future. He proposed after all, we had talked about getting married for years and years. He knew I and our families were planning our wedding. I attributed a lot of the fights to the stress of wedding planning. Everyone said it would be stressful. 

The last two months he was home for probably a total of ~10 days. We went to our hometown for Christmas and my family noted that he seemed disconnected and off, but didn't say anything until present time, after the fact. 

Before New Year's, I drove to a nearby city where his company was having a conference. We goofed around during the day together, having fun like we hadn't had in a while. Later in the evening we have beers with his coworkers. I sense something happening with one of his coworkers. Being drunk, I addressed it in a not-so-sensitive way. We fight. He makes me feel immense guilt for accusing him of emotionally cheating. We fight badly. He confesses that he is not happy, he doesn't want this wedding and he didn't even want to propose. I am floored. I drive home the next morning not knowing how to process. He says he'll be home in a day and we can talk.

For me, I saw this as the time we finally sit down and talk through these issues, plan for some counseling, bridge that connection again. But he tells me he doesn't know if he even wants to try. He doesn't see me as his best friend, and he doesn't know if he's in love. He keeps saying, ""I just want something extraordinary."" I can't understand why he can't see that we were extraordinary, we can be extraordinary if we get over this hump.

Two weeks go by of him not knowing if he wants to try. Saying things like ""I'm not sure I believe that there's happiness down the path with you."" 

And then I find out that he has feelings for his coworker. The one he guilted me over. I tell him it's done and NC when he tells me that his coworker asked him on a date and he wanted to go. Via text message, because he doesn't want to say it over the phone. He says  that he's too scared of my love for him, because he can't give it back. He goes on a date with her the night of our breakup. 

The past few days I have been feeling the full gamut of grief stages. Lots of disbelief, lots of anger, lots of sadness. I'm living on a twin mattress at my sister's apartment with 1 of what were our 2 dogs, dreading going back to the home we shared to try to figure out what's supposed to be mine. 

I don't know where to go. I have never felt so lost. I sobbed so hard during my commute today that my stomach cramped up for an hour. I'm not sure if i have a very specific question, I just want someone to relate with. Is there anyone out there? Advice for getting over my love for someone who apparently got over me so long ago?

If you read through all of this, thank you. It became somewhat of a venting session.

"My(25m) dad(50m) is angry with me for wanting to change my last name.


I'm the child of a white father and a black mother(49f). My dad's parents never approved of my parents' marriage and they've never been shy about it. They're pretty well off and a little stuck up in my opinion. They always felt that he married way beneath him and could've done a lot better. I remember as a child how my cousins on my dad's side would get all these cool birthday and Christmas presents from the grandparents and we(myself and older sister(26f)) would get nothing. One of my older cousins actually convinced me as a child that he too was born mixed race like me and he spent a full day in the bath tub and emerged white. So desperate to fit in I was at the time, I actually did what he said and needless to say, it didn't work. I laugh about it in retrospect though.  Every time we'd spend time at my dad's parents' place the vibe would always be extremely cold. Like they were just tolerating us instead of loving us as their grandchildren. There is an old family photo album in their house with some really old pictures of some ancestors who were slave owners. 

As we got older, we spent less and less time with my paternal grandparents and more and more with my mom's side of the family. My mom's parents are the coolest people I know. All the grandkids loved (and still do) it there. They've taught me the true meaning of love and family.

For the reasons stated above, I've decided that I want to change my last name to my mom's maden surname. I sat my parents down and told them this yesterday and it hasn't gone down well with my dad at all. He's incredibly upset with me and hasn't spoken to me since I broke the news. I tried to explain that I'm my own man now and I want to have my own identity that I feel comfortable with but he refuses to see this. I love this man with all my heart but I feel so strongly about changing my name just because I detest everything that those who we've inherited it from stand/stood for. I'm not going to back down from this but I also don't want to fall out with my dad. I feel like I'm standing between a rock and a hard place right now. Is there anyway I can have this cake and eat it at the same time?

So i'm seeing this older guy and earlier this week he says he might want to hang out sunday night (today) and I said cool. I got off of work at 6:30 pm today and he never mentions hanging out so I don't think anything about it and take a shower and lay in bed when he knocks on my door.

Girls. This is a new man and you have no makeup on, your apartment is a disaster and you're wearing just a towel with a hair bun. I open the door tell him i'll be 30 minutes then close the door. So he's pissed I left him outside (he left because of it) and i'm pissed i can't get a 10 minute heads up call. I work and go to school and my apartment reflects that and its embarrassing to have company over so when i do I clean up. 

Also, he's been cheated on before and makes a point to always check over my shoulder when i text and now he's showing up announced probably to test me. Give it to me straight.

"Me [26 M] got into an argument with my friend [27 M] that ended with me banishing him from our social media group. Am I overreacting?


My good buddy, we'll call him John, has been a good friend of mine for about 4 years now. We hang out at least once a week, we play cards, video games, watch movies etc... His girlfriend is a nice enough person but she has something, not really sure what. But it is a mental issue and she has ""episodes"". She never comes out and I've only met her twice.


We have a pretty active social media circle of friends on facebook and Overwatch/WoW.


Well what happened was, we got drunk and he told me that he lets his gf read our chats, on social media and texts and everything. That he usually records our calls with some app and lets her listen to them. He told me that they make fun of us together. Now this is the part where I might be overreacting, I told him that that's pretty fucked up and that if that's true then I wont be contacting him anymore.

He decided to double down and told me that his gf hates me and thinks I'm weird, that half the time he just gives her his phone and reads my messages out loud while he dictates a response. Now I'm sure you all know how 2 guys that have been friends with so long text each other; we have made up words and phrases that don't make sense. But I have also texted him some pretty personal stuff.

We didn't talk much after that night and I went home. The next morning I kicked him out of our chats and have not made an attempt to contact him. All the people in the chats don't really know why I kicked him, I told them that I have a good reason. I'm pretty sure he's telling them his side of the story where I'm blowing things way out of proportion and is probably not mentioning that he lets his girlfriend read everything.

What do you guys think? That's pretty fucked up right? Or am I making a big deal out of nothing?

TL;DR Friend's girlfriend reads our conversations and listens to our calls so I kicked him out of our chats and have not contacted him"

"My parents [45M/F] think that I [19F] need psychological help because of my obsession with a fictional character.


So, I'm obsessed with Harley Quinn. Me, being uninformed with comics, had only found out about her during the Suicide Squad hype, and curiously watched Batman: The Animated Series. It was from then on I became enamored with her character.

I think my obsession is healthy, however. I've started a collection of Harley Quinn figurines (that I bought with either my own money, or got for Christmas.. from my parents), and I own more than a few articles of clothing that are Harley related. I splurged (again, with my own money) on a custom made Assault on Arkham based costume. My hair is split down the middle, half red and half black. I've also started collecting comic books, too.

Admittedly, the object of my affections changes every few years. Which, I think is normal for a 'fangirl'. I don't do anything permanent like tattoos because I am aware of this.

My parents would joke about it at first, but they suddenly started to pester me about it when I adopted a little kitten named Batman. I didn't even name this kitten, it was a little black cat I got from the shelter who had named him that. 

My mom thinks that I use fictional characters as a coping mechanism and that it is unhealthy. She wants me to see a professional and talk about why I latch onto things. My dad just silently agreed.

Nothing I can tell them will make them think differently. I could be addicted to substances, but instead I choose fictional characters. Does what my mom say have any truth to it?

TLDR; My parents worry something is psychologically wrong with me because I am obsessed with a fictional character and they want me to get help. Do they have a point?"

"My husband [30/M] told me he hates me [30/F] after 2 years of marriage


My mind is so overwhelmed right now. This will be long and I am sorry.

My husband and I have been together for 5 years, married for 2. We have always been compatible and got along well most of the time. He is a very moody person and has pretty bad OCD. He is very OCD about the kitchen being clean. Before we got married, we lived together for a year and he would always ""inspect"" the dishes and the counter tops when he got home from work and would flip out if I didn't clean them enough. On a few occasions, he called me lazy and worthless. However, he would always apologize and be perfectly sweet and loving hours later.

Fast forward to getting married. Things started out great and we bought a new house. However, he started drinking a lot more and things got bad at times. He got a new job and started working with some people that I didn't care for. He would go straight from work to the bars and stay out until midnight most days of the week. 

He started coming home drunk and getting mean with me. One day he texted me and told me he was going the bar near our house after work. I was off that day so I thought I would go there to meet him for a few drinks. Well, when I got there he wasn't there. When I called to see where he was he lied to me and told me he was at that bar. (I was there and saw that he clearly wasn't)

After he came home that night drunk as hell, I confronted him and he called me some names and finally spewed off that he ""hates me"" and he ""never loved me"" and ""didn't want to even marry me in the first place."" I was so shocked I didn't know how to respond. He staggered into the bedroom and went to sleep. I slept on the couch.

The next day I decided to go stay with a friend for a couple of days. He texted and called crying saying that I am the only thing he ""wants"" and that he was sorry. So I went back.

For about a month, things seemed to be going well. Then he went out of town on a business trip for 2 days. I called his cell phone the night he got there to see how he was doing and a woman answered the phone. What the hell? She also said he was drunk and not able to talk. I said I didn't give a fuck and wanted to talk to him immediately. He answered slurring his words and said a lot of BS that made no sense.

When he got home, I confronted him again and asked why a woman had answered his phone. He told me that they decided to share a room with 2 beds to save money (mind you, the company is paying for the room). This woman is also gorgeous, I have met her a couple times. I told him how it made me feel that he shared a room with another woman. He immediately started yelling at me and told me I was overreacting and that it hurt to know I didn't trust him. I told him that I wanted to go to marriage counseling and that I would set up an appointment if he would go. He told me there was ""no way in hell"" he would ""see a shrink."" He told me again that he hated me and just thought he was meant to be single and that the married life wasn't his thing. He stated several times he wanted a divorce.

The next day I didn't speak a word to him and went to work like normal. He texted me and told me he had been thinking and that he would consider seeing a counselor. I called and set up and appointment the next evening. 

I showed up at the appointment at 5:00, right after both of us were to get off of work and he never showed. I called to see where he was and I could tell he was in a bar. I was humiliated in front of the counselor. I came home and he showed up about an hour later apologizing again. I told him I couldn't take it anymore, so I packed up some clothes and a toothbrush and drove to my sister's house in my hometown about an hour away.

Well as you may guess, the next day I was yet again bombarded by texts and voicemails saying he was sorry. He also called my sister and one of my friends and told them to try to talk to me and that he couldn't stand life without me. So again, I went back and he gave me what seemed like a sincere apology. 

It's been 4 months since then and he has been sweet as pie. He's been doing a lot more for me and he hasn't been drinking as much or saying hurtful things to me. In the back of my mind though, I am worried it will happen again.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I am asking. In the back of my mind I know I deserve better. I am a decent person and I know there is someone else out there who would probably treat me better, but I am so in love with this man. It's hard to talk to friends and family because there is some bias. I guess I am just trying to sort my thoughts out there anonymously and see if anyone can provide some insight or thoughts.

UPDATE: I am gone finally.

"Do I [20f] have any right to call Child Protectives Services on an employee's [17f] mother?


I am a supervisor at my job. One step underneath a manager, but I'm there on a daily basis to supervise the employees. They're mostly teenagers or 20 year olds. It's a seasonal minimum wage job.  
This one girl works a lot. She picks up shifts every single day there is one open and often expresses her sadness when she can't come into work. I thought this was just normal at first, she likes the job.
She starts showing up later and later, but never more than 15 minutes or so. She works a lot so I never wrote her up for it. Her eyes were also red and puffy a lot, four days in a row it looked like she came in directly after crying. I pried a little bit and apparently she does poorly in school but is there every single day. She showed up with bruises on her forearms but we get those from work, so i ignored it until it got significant. I suspect this girl is being abused somehow. 
The other day, this girls mother calls me. She says that if she comes in to work, that she is sick and to send her home immediately. The girl comes in, and she looks fine. I ask about the phone call and she breaks down into tears and tells her not to send her home. It seemed like an if of an extreme response to just not getting sent home. I let her stay and didn't push any further. Eventually, I sent a bunch of people home early and she happened to be one of them. She didn't protest this time, but I didn't want her in trouble with her mother that obviously didn't want her there. Before she left, she asked me if there was anyway I could schedule her more shifts so she wouldn't have to pick up all the time. 

Do I have any right to call anybody about this? HR will not do anything about it, as they are so afraid of getting sued or something happening. Would i be overstepping boundaries by calling CPS or going to HR? 

tldr; I think a 17 year old employee of mine is being abused by a parent. Can I call CPS or would that be out of line?"

"My [22F] brother [22M] our friend [23M] and his wife [25F] cut me out of housing plans months before telling me. Don't know how to react.


A little bit of background: My twin brother and I are close friend with a married couple, Jane and John. We grew up with John and the four of us hang out 2-3 times a week.

Last January, John and Jane asked me if I would want to be their roommate once their lease was up so they could save a bit of money. I've lived with them before and we all knew we got along so we started planning to move in together in the summer.

In February my brother and his ex-girlfriend broke up. He moved in with my parents (where I live) and mentioned he was interested in living with the three of us when the time came, which we all agreed on.

Skip forward to summer, when John and Jane had to end their lease. They told us they wanted to save a bit more money and had decided to move in with John's parents for the time being. This was fine for us as it gave us more time to save money too.

Since then every time I've brought up moving out they have said the plan was still for the four of us to move into a 3 bedroom together. There aren't many options for 3 bedrooms for rent where we live so it was taking quite a while to find anything.

Today I got this text from Jane: ""Hey, we signed a lease for a house and I don't know if [brother] has informed you yet. I'm contacting you so you feel relieved of any distress that news like this might cause you. The truth is, I only want one roommate. So I confided in [brother] privately around August and asked him if he would be willing to share expenses, in order for us to have a house and a small property. [Brother] invited you as a roommate without any authority to do so. And now feelings can get hurt. There is an extra room, so please feel comfortable to come over whenever you need an escape and to just hangout.""

Now I'm so angry I'm shaking. They've known they were cutting me out since August, but decided to string me along for 6 months, my brother invited himself after the rest of us had already made these plans, and they got a 3 bedroom, they just don't want me to live there. I don't even know what to do. I basically just lost my three best friends at the same time.

John and Jane will no doubt be over to my house several times before they move and I live with my brother. How can I stay civil with them until I don't have to see them anymore?



**Tl;dr After a year of planning to rent a house with my brother and our two friends, I found out they've leased a house without me and have been planning this for 6 months. How can I stay civil with them until I don't have to see them anymore?**

EDIT: Some people have been confused and thought they might have mixed us up. Just want to be clear: my brother and I are fraternal twins and I'm female and he's male, so I don't see how that could happen accidentally."

"My [26M] girlfriend's [25F] twin brother disappeared 6 years ago. She's still looking for him. I think she should move on, but is it my place to say something?


About 6 years ago, apparently one day my girlfriend's brother goes out and never comes back home. They did all they could to find him but there was nothing. They looked for him themselves, hired private investigators, and did everything humanly possible but he has just vanished...

During the two years that I've been dating my girlfriend, she's still looking for him. She still calls hospitals and morgues and any place that he might show up. She still hopes that he would come back. Her own parents have accepted this reality and have moved on but she hasn't. I don't think there's a PI in the state that she hasn't hired yet.

I can see that she's suffering and it's not good for her. The reality is that her brother would have been found by now if he was to be found. He's most probably not alive anymore. I understand that she doesn't want to accept that but that is the reality. I don't have siblings myself, I don't pretend to understand what she's going through or how difficult it is however it is time that she accepted the reality and focused on herself, gets help to deal with grief and other feelings that she might have. That's what her parents did and they're better now, and she needs to move on as well.

I don't know if it's my place to breach the subject to her. I'm afraid that I might be overstepping here. Should I do this? And if so, how?

"My [24F] bestfriend [24M] told me that my past relationships didn't work because I like sex too much.


So I dated 3 guys. One from high school and the two from college.

1st guy took my virginity. I was also his first. We were both 18 that time. Whenever we had sex, I always initiated it. The relationship lasted for 11 months. We broke up when we started attending different universities.

2nd guy(we were both 19) lasted for 10 months and again, I initiated all our sex acts. We fought a lot because he was complaining that we have sex too many timesWe broke up because of misunderstandings and issues we could not resolve. 

3rd guy (we were both 21)lasted for 1 and a half years. There are times when we fight because he doesn't want to have sex but I wanted to. Often we fight about sex. We broke up after graduating college.

Yesterday, I had a long chat with my best friend. I've known him since we were kids. He is dating the same girl for 6 years. That's why I think he is a relationship expert.

He told me ""guys don't like it when girls are too horny or even hornier than he is. It's a big turn off.""

I asked him what he meant by that.

He told me ""All your relationships didn't work out because you like sex too much.""

I was devastated when he said that. My relationships were not based on sex. I admit, I really like sex and I'm always horny but sex is not the reason why I was with those guys. I only slept with 3 guys. As much as I want to hookup with someone, I can't possibly do it because I'm too scared. But I know my sex drive is higher than most girls I know because I masturbate at least twice a day.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if what he said is true.

"Me [28M] and my GF [25F] been together for 4 years. She thinks my mother is the worst, my mother doesn't like her very much, and I feel like I'm being pulled between the two. ;text=Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks. --- **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!


This is my first time posting here, and I need some advice because I'm not sure what to do anymore.

I love them both but I wish they would get along, and I'm beginning to realize I might be the problem?!

First of, I need to explain that I live in a city about an hour away from my parents, and I've lived here since I had to move her to go to hugh school when I was 16.

I was single up until I met my GF, and I'm the oldest of three siblings (Have a brother 27M and sister 21F).
I'm the first of my siblings to get a girlfriend (or boyfriend for my sister), and I fell hard and in retrospective I realize I was a little crazy in love and that didn't fly too well for my mother and my siblings as i disconnected me from them to be with her.

When we met I lived with my sister and my brother and I think I ignored them and just had my GF over and did what I wanted without asking them. So they felt ran over by me (I got to know this later on). But I've made amends with them and things are good.

However, my mother feels like my GF took me away from, because I wasn't present for all of my parents and families birthdays, a fathers day and mothers day, and that I didn't come home as much as I used to, and didn't call as much as I used to.

I've been ignoring this, and didn't excactly say it was my choice, because I had too much respect for my mother.

I've always been close with my mother, and we are very like-minded, but I think we might have been too close, and that I might respect her too much also.

2 years ago me and my GF bought a house, which was a real fixer-upper, and I did alot of work on it, and I sometimes complained to my mother about my GF not doing so much (I know, big mistake!).

My mother has also been very involved and controlling, always asking if we have money to buy this and that and asks if we are broke atm etc (I was a bit sloppy with money when I was younger and borrowed alot from my brother (also after I met my GF).

I've often chosen not to go to some family dinners and such because it's a long drive or I haven't felt like it (it's usually 1-2 hours to drive for any of my families events. However, my GF's family lives in the city, and we attend most of the events (it's so much easier to get there).

My GF has always made comments about how my mother is controlling me and my siblings, and always makes herself at home when she's at our place.
I've been afraid to say anything to my mother because I know she'll react badly.

About a year ago, she said infront of both of us that we are not getting ourselves a dog before I've been to the dentist, and I flipped out on her. But then she ran out and said stuff like, bye, we're never coming over again, and I ran after her and apologized.

When we're over at their place, my mom comes over and strokes my head and such, and when I tell her to stop, she responds with saying that I'm her kid and she does whatever she wants. And right before christmas (this was the first time I went away for christmas) my mom pointed out to my GF at a dinner that I was used to this, and that and that's how I usually spent christmas. Ofcourse my GF got mad at me since I didn't say anything, all I said was calmly, ""mom, stop it"" or something like that. And my GF has made me aware of these kind of episodes. Cause I've never noticed it earlier and though it was my GF being stupid over my mother. 

My GF has warned me and said my mom is a control-freak and jealous, but I've always defended my mother, which recently have made my GF and I argue alot.

During new-years eve, my mom said I had to fix my coat, which I said ""no, it's okay, I don't need to"". And 30 seconds later, in front of like 10 people, she started fixing my coat. I just turned away without saying anything to her. But my GF was mad that I let her get away with this.

Recently my parents came to spend the night, and she told me to tell them that if they wanted to take a nap, they could go upstairs to the guestroom to lay down, and I told them so. But my mother laid down on the couch and it wasn't much space, so I told them to go up to nap, but they said they were going out soon. So I let it pass, and I saw my GF got furious, and didn't speak to my mom and didn't hide that she was angry. So after they left, my GF flipped out on me and almost left.

It's been other similar episodes too, and last night she posted on a family facebook group that I had made her the thing she wanted most for christmas, and I had taken the challenge and made it for her.
When infact both me and my GF had made it togheter, and she knew this very well as we had told her, and that we both gave it to her.

She also always asks if I've talked to my siblings and I need to keep in touch with them etc. (my brother lives in an appartment in our basement). And that I should talk to my brother to go to therapy for his neck injury (had it for years) which I get mad at her for, and then she usually starts sobbing and says bye and hangs up.

My GF got really hurt and upset and left the group. So I commented that she should get credit too, which my mom later replied that we'd both been great at making christmas-gifts (we made all the gifts for this christmas), not her gift.
Which also made me mad. 

Am I the problem her? For letting my mom get away with all of this? And how should I go about this?
My GF got mad at me and told me should call her today and tell her to treat me and her with respect and appologize to her and start treating us with respect and so on.


TL;DR: Have I been ignoring my mothers jealusy and controlling? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the help so far! I feel like a complete shit, and I feel sick over myself... "
"An asshole coworker [?M] sent my [36F] husband [39M] an inflammatory text during a work even. Now he's threatening leaving me.


There was an after work event this week. A coworker was leaving for another job and we were going out for light food and drinks. I don't drink btw. I didn't give my husband details because he usually doesn't ask nor appear to care that I attend these occasional outings which usually end by 6-7pm. 

Here's kind of a text log to get an understanding of what happened. 

Husband 6pm: You have that thing tonight right?  Need dinner after?

Me:  Should be out of there by 8 and fed, no worries about dinner. Times are estimates. 

Husband: Ok. 

Note the following I didn't see until the train ride home at around 11pm. 

Husband 930pm: Hey baby, everything ok?  What's your status

Husband 1005pm:  All good?

Husband 1030: Hey, give me a ping getting worried. 

Me 1033 (sent by asshole coworker): Hey buddy, chill the fuck out. She's in really good hands, I can assure you ;). 

I left my phone at the table and asshole coworker took it upon his drunk self to send that text. Yup my iPhone 4s is not password protected.  I didn't see any of my husbands texts because his notifications had been cleared when asshole coworker opened up messages. I saw it as soon as I got in the train and texted him immediately. 

Me 1105:  Babe, sorry that was not me!  See you when I get home. 

No response from husband. 

When I get home he is in bed, I give him a kiss on the cheek and he doesn't reciprocate. I ask him what's wrong and he says he doesn't want to talk because he's afraid he'd say something he regrets. 

The next day was totally ghosting. He finally approaches me tonight and says that he felt extremely disrespected and is suspicious of my inattention. He said he wasn't keeping tabs on me but making sure I way okay since most of these wrap up by mid evening. 

I profusely apologized and tried to defuse. He wasn't all that receptive. He said he's not sure what to think. He had total trust in me but thinks something nefarious must have been happening for this guy to have my phone and feel bold enough to send that text. Him and I, back and forth, no improvement. 

He finally dropped a serious bomb. He says he doesn't know what to think. But he said that if there's any hope of him believing this was as I say (as actually happened) that I can't be in his words ""the same fucking room with that fucker"". No after work events, if there's a work meeting he wants me to notify HR that there's a personal conflict.  He's heated and said if I can't meet these demands then I can either look for another job or a new husband, my choice. 

Everything is happening so fast. I know he's over reacting, but he does have his reasons. I have bitched out the asshole coworker. Told him off and told him if he touched anything that belongs to me again I'm going straight to the police.  What my husband is demanding is not practical. 

I guess I'm asking if I should risk waiting this out for cooler heads to prevail. Or meet my husbands demands. Or if there's something I can do otherwise.  I am pretty sure he thinks something happened that night. I think if he was assured it is what I say it is he'd move past it, but I can see from his perspective it looks like shit. 


Tl;dr: Out at a work function, running late. Husband was trying to get ahold of me to no avail. A coworker picked up on this and used my phone to send husband a text that seemed as if I was dissing him at the least, fucking around on him at the most. Need advice on how to proceed.
