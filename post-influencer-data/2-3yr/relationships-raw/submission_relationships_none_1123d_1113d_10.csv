"Erm, my girlfriend [22F] has an issue with the fact that I [26M] walk to work - UPDATE


[removed]"
"UPDATE: Me [60 M] with my daughter [19 F], she hasn't had a single friend since middle school and I am starting to get worried


My original post can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l41q0/me_60_m_with_my_daughter_19_f_she_hasnt_had_a/

My apologies in advance, this got much longer than I anticipated.

Hello reddit,

I debated for a while on whether or not I should post an update. On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her.

Soon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy.

We made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography.

Then came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film.

We were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it.

Anyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going.

You guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies. 

I hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet. 

Thanks again reddit.

"My [25F] dogs [5F German Sheppard &amp; 3M Rottweiler] has started to growl at my boyfriend [27M] anytime he comes near my son [4M]


Earlier in my relationship my dogs loved my boyfriend, he would play with them, he would take them for walks but recently they hate him. It's like if he comes near my son they are fully prepared to take a chunk out of him. My dogs have never had a problem with anyone, people always comment how gentle they are. 

My boyfriend does not live with us and he babysits brad sometimes when I am at work. 

This started two weeks he came over for dinner and the moment he walked into Brads room they ran up the stairs, ran right past me and into his room. The were showing their teeth, growling, barked when he tried to enter the room. 

This was so unlike them, I have never seen them angry before this and they did not stop until he was out of sight. They don't do this with anyone else, even brad friends father was here the other day and they were perfectly friendly with him. They have never met the man before. 

Every time my boyfriend is here they both sit with brad, if my boyfriend even walks past the room the growl. The dogs love brad really I have never had a problem, they carry his toys to him. They always want us to play 

They never have a problem with me coming near brad, they always want me to play with them. If they see me playing with brad they just go back to sleep.  It's literally only my boyfriend 

Am I right to think something is up and he did something to brad? 

tl;dr: Dogs hate boyfriend all of a sudden and won't let him come near brad (my son). 

**Edit Hi, yeah so the dogs were right.
My boyfriend basically broke up with me when I confronted him about it, he basically said he gave brad a ""light"" tap on his hand and the dogs freaked out when he did it. I finally got the truth out of him after he continued to lie, half the things he said made no sense. I am sure the light tap is bullshit and he hit him hard
He broke up with me, but honestly I can't say I am sad that he is out of my life**"
"My [20F] family is calling my niece [13F] a traitor because she went to the police and told them what her dad were doing to her brother [14M]


**Was doing, sorry for typo**

Long story short my nephew is an extremely gifted athlete. What I did not know is my brother would push his son to the point he was dehydrated. As the story goes one day after school his sister walked into a police station and told them what was happening. The police went to her house and they found my nephew dehydrated and dry heaving into a toilet.

Fast forward my niece and nephew moved from California to Ohio to live with our cousin [26F]. My family is calling my niece a traitor because my brother is now depressed he can't see his kids again

My Nephew even told me he could not thank his sister enough

Do you have any advice on what to do, because I don't know anymore.

tl;dr: Family is calling niece a traitor "
"Me [23M] with my GF [23F]. She was pregnant and people were telling me to prepare for the worst. Turns out they were just assholes.


Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zprmp/me_23m_with_my_gf_23f_shes_pregnant_and_people/

Edit: I'm totally telling my baby about how her story got a gift from a kind stranger tonight. Thank you for the gold. 


Edit 2: I guess I should clarify that Nita and I are not out of friends completely, and that the comments our other 'friends' were making all the time wasn't friendly advice to prepare ourselfves in case something went wrong. Some of them heard 'pre-eclampsia' and decided either my gf or my baby would die, or I'd certainly lose them both. I freaked out, even with our doctor's words ringing through my mind that Nita was fine. It was brutal to consider the possibility I could lose my girls, especially when there was no need to consider that. Then, when things were over, the same people who were so sure of death were suddenly sure that my gf and baby would pull through no matter what. That hurt and pissed me off, not to mention how much it hurt Nita who didn't need to go through any more stress. 

---
I guess the reason I was freaking out so much in my last post was because I knew something was going to happen.

Nah, I'm kidding, I was just freaking out. But 4 days after that post, Nita's water broke. She didn't even need to be induced, our baby just decided she wanted out already. We were tense and scared but everything went well and now we're the parents of a healthy baby girl. Nita's health is also good and her mood has improved drastically because she can finally let go of that bed rest rule.

Our baby is sweet and tiny and loud and holding her for the first time was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We've been adjusting to parenthood ever since and it's been great. Baby cries a lot and I know the crying will eventually drive us a little crazy, but for now I'm just happy my baby has lungs strong enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood.

A few of our ''friends'' have called, wanting to check up on Nita and the baby. One of them told me they just knew everything would be alright, and I couldn't help myself then and said that his previous words to me on Nita's pregnancy had been: 'shit, man, you gotta be strong 'cause this is probably gonna end badly'. I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone.

So, this is it, I guess. I wanted to update because you guys were really good to us, and calmed us down. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone back then, but I appreciate all the advice and responses. You guys shared yours stories with us, and it meant a lot, be sure of that.

tl;dr: Turns out I was freaking out for no reason. My girls are strong as hell and are doing more than fine. Thanks for the help, everyone."
"My best friend/best man [24m] stole a wedding idea from me [23m]. My wedding is in a little over a week and I'm freaking out. Am I being petty?


Kyle and I have been best friends since junior high. I'm not going to go into massive detail about our friendship, but he's really important to me and we've been through a lot together.

Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and Kyle and I both get engaged around the same time to two wonderful women. It's been really fun planning a wedding with another couple and my fiance, Kacie, and I love having them around.

Now, Kacie is a bit of a control freak. She has mostly had final say on everything in the wedding, not that I'm complaining. She has better taste than me and the wedding is going to be really beautiful thanks to her.

The one thing she has let me have complete control over is the first dance. I was ecstatic. I really wanted to show her how much she means to me with this dance. I picked out Peter Gabriel's ""The Book of Love"" and edited a video of pictures of her and I growing up, meeting, and falling in love. And then I commissioned an artsy friend of mine to make a literal Book of Love with all our pictures in them. I've cried every time watching it. The whole thing is going to be a huge surprise for her.

The only other person who knew about this was Kyle. He kept saying how cool it was I was doing this and how he wished he'd thought of something like it.

Kyle's wedding was this weekend. And holy shit, their first dance was to Book of Love and he edited a video of their baby pictures and their relationship. My heart fucking sank like a brick. He wouldn't talk to me during the reception and hasn't responded back to any of my texts.

What the hell do I do? I can't go through with my plan. Our social circles intertwine and I'll look like I stole his idea. Should I just tell Kacie and have her help me with a new idea? Do I tell Kyle he's not welcome at my wedding? Or am I just being silly and just go ahead with my plan despite how I feel?

tl;dr--Best man stole my wedding idea a few days before my wedding."
"My [42F] nephew [20M] is telling everyone he has asthma like my son [12M] but he is just overweight. He stole 3 of my sons inhalers and he is refusing to pay for what he took.


My nephew is really overweight, like extremely big. I promise I don't mean to sound like a witch but he can't make it up the stairs without being short of breathe. 

Recently 3 of my sons inhalers went missing, my son asthma is bad. He has really bad asthma attacks from time to time. My husband, children and I hosted a party the night before. So we thought maybe someone threw them out by mistake while drunk. We searched for them but to no luck. 

Anyway my daughter [17F] heard from one of her cousins that Stewart has asthma. I called my sister and I asked if this was true and she said it is the first time she is hearing of it. She went into his room and she found my sons inhalers. Her son still lives at home and is not doing anything with his life. No college, no job, nothing. 

You can tell they are my sons Asters because we have stickers on them. His little sister who is 7 put smiley faces on them because she believes it helps. My sister confronted him about it and he cam clean. He stole the inhaler and pretended to have asthma so people would not think he is out of shape. 

I know he has no job, but those things are not cheap and honestly I am furious. I think he should pay for what he used because really 2 of them are broken. My sister does not think she should pay for them if he can't and is asking me to cut him a break. 

I don't think I should, but I don't know what to do. This is really tearing a rift between myself and my sister. But at the same time it's like he stole my little boys inhalers, that to my is unforgivable. 

tl;dr: Nephew stole sons inhalers "
"My (26M) girlfriend (27F) thinks she has body dysmorphia... she's just overweight. I don't know what to do.


Been with Stephanie (name changed for privacy) for a little over 3 years. More or less relationship is good, she tends to be way overdramatic when we fight (which isn't often) but I can usually talk her down and things work out. 

When Stephanie and I first started dating she mentioned a few times in kind of a mysterious (I thought it was attention-seeking, still do) way that she had some kind of mental illness or mental health struggle. Eventually (probably two or three months in) she came out and told me in a really serious conversation that she has body dysmorphia and thinks she's obese and hates herself for it. 

Now let me be clear, I love her the way she is, wouldn't change a thing, I don't mind her weight whatsoever. But even when she said it initially, I almost thought it was a joke. Stephanie is obese. I'm not good at guessing weight and she's never told me her weight, but I know she's 5'4 and a size 22 in pants (US). She's by all standards obese. I don't mind it at all. I'm attracted to her, I think she's beautiful, I would never ask her to change a thing.

It didn't come up again for a while but last fall she took a psychology course for her college degree and they talked about mental illness and it came back up. She came in one night almost happy? in a weird way, saying that she understands everything that's wrong with her because they talked about BD in class and it all makes sense. She has never been diagnosed by a medical professional and can't see a doctor for lack of health insurance. 

Ever since then, she talks about it a lot. I'm not one to poke at people just to poke, so I just let it be. But she talks about it all the time. She blames arguments we have on her BD. She uses it as an excuse to eat poorly and not take care of herself, because she is straight up convinced that she is smaller than she is and that the person she sees in the mirror is a dysmorphic situation. She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her ""struggle"" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her ""actual"" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen. No offense intended to my girlfriend, but that's not her body type. She is much bigger than that.

I'm getting to the point where I don't know what to do. She uses it as an excuse for all her behavior. I honestly don't know if she truly thinks she has BD or if she just uses it to justify herself. When we first moved in together, she would cover all the sizes on the tags of her clothes with Sharpie so I wouldn't see them. She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it.

I know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services. I'm not sure what to do. 

TL;DR Girlfriend uses body dysmorphia as an excuse for everything, but she's not dysmorphic, she's just overweight. "
"[UPDATE!] I (20M) want to ask out a really cute girl (19/20F) in my physics class. She's deaf and I need help on how to approach her.

Sorry I'm late with the update! I've been busy since class on Friday. 

I got to class about 15 minutes early as I usually do. She happened to come in right behind me and was alone at her seat. I had planned to approach her after class, but I figured I couldn't get an opportunity better than this. 

I walked up to her and she smiled and waved when she saw me. I sat down next to her and signed ""Hi, my name is Sam"" and she responded with her name. After that I signed ""Can we mouth talk?"" as /u/lin_zexu suggested. She said yes and we spoke the rest of the conversation.

We are both from the same city so we talked a little about that. I asked her if she was free this weekend and she said she was going back home so we have a date this coming week. We have been snapchatting nonstop since.

Thank you r/relationships for the help in asking her out. Can't wait for the first date(:

tldr: Asked her out. Went great. Date next week."
"My [29f] sister [32f] just got dumped by my ex [30m] whom she slept with on our wedding night. Now our family expects us to re-bond over our mutual hatred of him. I don't care about her sudden apologies and I don't think getting dumped absolves her of what she did to me.

"I [23f] won $10,000 cash. My boyfriend [24m] of four years and I have been having a childish fight and I did something I can't undo.


He's a full-time student who works part-time in the summer. I have a full-time and part-time job (he studies a lot). We live together and mostly live off my pay while he stretches what he makes in the summer. Neither of us have ever owned a car because it isn't necessary where we live. 


We both walk or take the public everywhere to save money. In the morning we stop at a corner shop shortly before splitting up for the day. He buys cigarettes and coffee. I buy fruit for my lunch and, on the weekends, lotto tickets. 


He always makes fun of me for paying the ""stupid tax"". But I figure my indulgence is cheaper and doesn't come with lung cancer. Sometimes I jokingly tell him not to expect a penny when I win.


The day I won he answered me with ""Fine, keep it all! It's not like I'm crying over a penny of nothing over here.""


I showed him I'd won. He stared for a bit and then dismissively told me I'd probably spent more than that on tickets. In response I asked what I should blow his half on for myself. I was honestly joking at the time but he suddenly became angrier than I've ever seen him and I didn't want to admit I'd been kidding because he was so pissed off it pissed *me* off. 


He wants a car, and I don't. He keeps trying to steamroller me so I'm refusing to share the money. In honesty I'm willing to spend or save the money for us but I don't want a car. I won't use a car and it will keep costing us money in parking and maintenance. 


After weeks of him sulking and lecturing me about his ""entitlement"" to the money he took me to a car lot and tried to embarrass me into going along with him in front of a salesman. I threw a tantrum after we left without buying anything and I went to my mom's and paid our rent up to the end of the year and donated the rest to charity. He doesn't know. 


I fucked up and don't know how to come clean.


Tl;dr: I haven't told my boyfriend I spent the money I won because I was upset he was being a dick. He's already angry at me. What do I do? "

"My [28F] family expect me to put everyone to work only because my husband [30M] runs a successful business.


My husband owns and runs a very successful network security company. It's a small company and we employ highly skilled people. All but one of our employees have masters degrees. About a quarter have PhDs. We've been married for 6 years.

I have a very big family. Six siblings, 11 biological aunts and uncles (18 counting the spouses), 28 first cousins. The list goes on. It's not another month before someone from somewhere is looking for a job and is looking at us, thinking we can provide them. It's never been that we didn't want to put anyone to work, but nobody has ever had the right skills to even work for us.

Our family don't seem to understand what highly skilled work is like. Just a few days ago my aunt (who I love very much) was asking me if I could put her daughter's husband to work. He doesn't even have a college degree but and apparently (according to my aunt) has started to learn programming online since last month. I tried explaining to her kindly that the work we do requires a lot of relevant experience and everyone has graduate degrees and he should apply to more relevant jobs to gain experience. Her response was that he's a quick learner and he will learn everything on the job quickly. That's the mindset we're dealing with.

My husband is tired of this, and I'm kind of tired of this. This is my side of the family so I should deal with them ideally... I don't want to come off as an asshole to everyone so I listen to them and always try to explain things kindly but doing the same thing again and again is frustrating especially as things don't change and they'll say the same thing to us a couple of months later.

I don't know how we should deal with this problem?

"My [25] wife [24] is obsessed with trying to get our toddler daughter [22m] ""discovered"" on instagram to be a model.


I love my wife but she refuses to go back to work and all she does is spend all the money left over from the job I hate but work to support them on new outfits every day for our kid because she wants to make her a 'brand rep' on Instagram so she can eventually get discovered as a model and 'make money' and 'be famous' and 'get free stuff'. She won't even work on the 3 days a week our kid goes to child care for socialisation. She uses it as time to nap and get her nails done.

My sister called her out on it and said that she is teaching our daughter that her only value is in her looks and what she is wearing/if she has the 'latest' clothes and that it's a really poor message to send to our child. My wife lashed out at my sister for that and is now trying to freeze her out. But I think my sister had a point.

I told my wife that I think she needs to stop doing this and now she is giving me the guilt trip for not 'supporting her' as a SAHM and not loving my daughter enough because 'don't you want her to have nice things'. Of course I do, but no child needs $250 a week spent on its wardrobe. 

Don't know what to do. I feel like if I push it too far, it will end badly, but I think this needs to stop.

"(UPDATE!) My (29F) wife (28F) and I work together and were anticipating becoming business partners with our boss (40M). I got into a bizarre confrontation with HIS wife (40F) and now we need help navigating the situation!


Link (hopefully!) to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ejbw/nonromantic_my_29f_wife_28f_and_i_work_together/  



Hi all! I have to say, I really am blown away by the diplomacy and sympathy I received with my first post; I really thought this was a pretty mild topic that wouldn't receive too much attention so I'm really grateful for everyone that took the time to comment! Seriously, once I hit 7 up votes/4 comments I thought that would be the end of it!  


I want to clarify and expand on a few details before I dive into the updated situation: First, I have absolutely NO ego about my job.  I'm a freaking waitress! I'm completely aware it's unskilled labor and certainly doesn't take any specific skill to be competent at it.  That said, I LOVE my job. I served and bartended through two college degrees and kept on going afterward- I have a BLAST at work! But I am absolutely aware that my wife is a significantly more valuable employee and were this a simple employment situation, I would happily just move to a new job.


I also wanted to clarify on the owner's wife's interference when I snapped at her.  She wasn't simply checking on tables/refilling water glasses/pre-bussing tables (pre-bussing = clearing empty plates from the table while diners are still seated).  At one point she was standing at one of my tables for about 3-4 minutes (which is a LONG ASS TIME in the restaurant world) talking about: her 4 kids and which ones still breastfed/her mortgage/how much they would lose if the business failed/the application process my wife went through to become the head chef/the owner's wife's own work history, etc.  It was incredibly inappropriate and a really invasive service style. I usually don't even let my own guests know I'm married to the chef unless it organically comes up in conversation! Multiple tables were actively complaining to me about her service style, which led to the (admittedly petty) comment I made to her.    


Anyway, I went in to meet the owner.  I asked our bar manager to be present at the meeting as well (bar manager is a longtime friend of the owner and was present for the initial altercation and the private conversation the owner's wife and I had).  So the three of us chatted for about 5 minutes- I said very little, and mostly took the general advice here of deferring to whatever my boss said (I generally employed three key phrases: ""I understand"" ""You're absolutely right"" and ""I'm sorry"").  My bar manager (with whom I primarily work with, rather than the owner) completely shut down any tense moments by immediately telling the owner that I was ""a self-assured, seasoned server who needed little to no direction"" and that ""(owner's wife's name) overstepped her boundaries in a big way, which led to a pretty understandable reaction from (me).""  The owner pretty much deflated after that; he hemmed and hawed a bit about me being inappropriate (to which I agreed) and then repeatedly told me his wife ""had no problem"" with me.  I cheerfully answered ""great! I look forward to working with her next shift!"" and that essentially ended the conversation.  I did ask the owner point blank if his wife was considered my superior when we worked together; he looked confused and clarified that no, she was considered my complete equal both on the floor and off.  (He also FIRMLY stuck to his guns in being justified in discussing my personnel/performance issues with my wife, a statement to which I again deferred.) 


That was the planned end of my update until a pretty serious conversation with my wife last night.  Prior to/aside from this altercation, there have been some instances that my wife witnessed that really made her question if we should invest with them; apparently our owner has been getting HAMMERED on his shifts (he works alone behind the bar a few days early in the week, whereas I work the later week days and the weekend) to the point where he has: FALLEN OVER in front of guests behind the bar/completely unable to make cocktails (we're an upscale craft cocktail bar)/visibly intoxicated and heavily slurring; generally giving terrible, drunk service.  The breaking point for my wife was TWO 1-star yelp reviews within minutes of each other specifically calling out his service.  One guest had to actually go to the kitchen window to get her own food.  Reddit! It's TERRIBLE! I was completely appalled and upset for/with her, and we both agreed this is NOT the way we want to run a business and reiterated to each other that any potential partnership with this couple wasn't going to happen.  We're both professionally serious people, both COMMITTED to her career goal and neither of us will do anything to jeopardize that.  


Anyway! So we're both on the same page.  We're keeping our savings intact and completely mentally/emotionally checked out of going into business with this couple and generally getting all of our ducks in a row to head back to Vegas so she can get back into some of the top-tier restaurants out there.  Our lease is up in November so we'll just ride it out until then.  Reddit I really appreciate the attention this query received; I really felt a bit unmoored with how to handle it and I'm glad that you all essentially told me to follow my instincts and play it safe/close to the vest.  That's it! Thanks everyone!

"I [26 F] just can't keep my two teenaged brothers [13 &amp; 14M] I took in anymore.


I don't know how to live with myself honestly. I just can't do it. It's been 3 months. My parents died a year ago. They lived with other family for a while and it didn't work out either. I'm about to lose my job and my husband and I are divorcing over it. They only ever really listened to him and I can't do this by myself. I'm so overwhelmed and there is nowhere for them to even go to give me a break. I'm on a family vacation I paid for us to take right now and it all came to a head today (as it does nearly every day now) when the younger one ignores me and takes off. 

The younger one won't listen to me at all. He ignores me almost all the time or throws fits. Gets in trouble at school, won't help do anything around the house unless I spend an hour fighting with him. He's a loving sweet boy but he needs more help than I can give him. 

The older one is really trying and seems to understand the gravity of it all. I think it could work out with him but how can I put one in the system and not the other? We can't afford military or boarding school, ESP not on just my money, ESP not if I lose my job and there is only the state money they have. I'm already going to have to trade in for an older car as it is and that's with me still having a job. 

There is nowhere else for them to go. No aunts, uncles, grandparents, family friends, etc... I'm the last one and I am so overwhelmed I'm having a mental breakdown 6 out of 7 days of the week. I can't provide for them anymore, I'm just too beaten down. 

I've tried so hard. I've gone to all the school functions, been involved with all 14 teachers, making them healthy food, helping them learn to do laundry, getting them to/from sports and school several times a day, staying up to work on homework, etc... I've put my absolute all into this and it's torn my life apart and I am just incapable of doing it anymore. 

I don't know how to even begin finding foster homes for them and I feel like the scum of the earth. I've got health issues I can't address with all I have to do with them and no having help from anyone else it's too much. I don't know how I'll function normal with a divorce and suddenly having teenagers to manage that won't listen to me. Even before this when things were stable more than not with the kids I was breaking down, now I don't even know how to manage it. 

What do I do? I feel so guilty but I risked everything and lost my marriage, facing losing my job, and I find it hard to even want to go on but obviously I have to as the boys have no other family. I'm a dried up, worn out, shell of how I used to be and there's no way I have another 5 years of this, all it took was 3 months to get to this point. 

Tl;dr: Took in brothers 3 months ago. Facing divorce, my job performance is critically bad and I'm facing termination, and I can't do it anymore. I've tried so hard but I'm in full melt down mode after putting every ounce of time and effort into this. I feel so guilty. No idea where to start as there is zero other family alive."
"[Update] I (23F) called child protective services on my mom (46F) because I believe she is emotionally and physically abusing my little brother (8M). It did not end well, and I've given up hope.


The original post was just asking if I did the right thing by calling the child services on my mom, but I have lost any hope of getting my brother out of the situation.

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zm5f4/i_23f_called_child_protective_services_on_my_mom/

So basically, I live in Utah and I tried to call the caseworker, and that's not possible in Utah, you can only make a report over the phone. Next thing I hear, my brother has been interviewed and they close the entire case, determining that he is safe. Due to my experience, I am positive that my mom can scare him into lying. I just don't understand with all the assault charges, my statement, and my stepfather's. What the hell is wrong with Utah??

Also my stepfather was trying to file a protective order against my mom because she has hit him with her car and stalks him, etc, and she lied to a judge and said that he showed porn to my brother, and they just dropped the protective order. Now he is evicted from his house because of her stalking behavior or these allegations, or both.

I would hire a lawyer, but I'm barely able to save $100 per month. I can't afford it. Any advice would be lovely, but I just wanted to get some emotional support and say what the fuck, Utah!

**TLDR** The state of Utah ignored all of the evidence and dismissed the request to have my brother moved from an abusive home, based on one interview with my little brother. Then my mom accused my stepdad of showing porn to my little brother and had him evicted from his home and he can't file a protective order against her."

I’m 27 years old.  My wife passed away less than a year ago suddenly in a car crash.  We’d been married for four years. 

The pregnancy happened all by accident when I was 18, she was a few years older.  It turned out to be twins (twins run in my family, I myself am a twin).  At the time I wanted to marry her, I even proposed, I thought it would be the right thing to do so that I could support the kids and they could grow up in a proper home.  I wanted to be a good father unlike my own father and fully involved in my kids life, I had always swore to myself that if I ever have kids I would never let myself be an absent father like my own dad was.

At the time when I proposed, my wife rejected.  She said she wasn’t in love with me at the time, but she still let me be fully involved in the life of the kids. I was there when they were born, I juggled going through university and being the dad of two kids at the same time.  I tried to be as supportive and involved in their life as I could, we split it between us.  Over years of parenting together, despite our differences, I guess she did eventually fall in love with me (I’d always been in love with her), and we got married.  I guess all the time together and the experience of growing and raising children together really made us feel like a family and we did fall in love, and we ended up getting married.

Our married life wasn’t always easy.  We were saving up and we ended up buying a house, a nice one too, which we hoped we’d raise our family in.  However things became sort of hard after that, my wife developed a drinking problem which I didn’t even know about, and while we did many things to help her, it never fully disappeared.  She ended up having to quit her job and I was working full time and over-hours to support our family. Luckily I had a somewhat well-paying job so we still made our ends meet. Our relationship with my in-laws was never good.  Her parents and family hated me, they hated the fact that she had kids with me, she hated the fact that she ended up marrying me.  They always thought she could do better than me, they thought she had massively “settled” when she ended up marrying me and resented the fact that she ended up married to me.  I’m not a vagrant or anything, I had an education, a good job. I have no idea why they never liked me.  Both me and my wife are white, so its not like it could be a racism issue, but I have no idea why they never warmed up to me.  They loved my wife, they loved their grandkids, but they never liked me.

Well tragedy struck less than a year ago.  My wife was killed in a car accident, it still feels like it was yesterday when I received the phonecall, it was the worst day of my life, the day my life turned upside down.  For my kids, it must have been even worse.  How do children even grasp the fact that their mum is gone and never coming back? How can they understand something as severe as death when it’s the first time they’ve experienced it and with someone so close? It was so horrible, my life turned upside down and I still haven’t recovered.

After the initial shock, I decided I need to stop moping about my own life, I have two children depending on me and I must do everything in my power I can to provide for them and ensure they have the best life possible given the circumstances.

First thing I did was move out of the house.  The current house we were living in was too big for just me and two kids.  I’m renting it out, which is good, as now I have some added income.  I also sold a large amount of the furniture we had.

I moved in with my sister, she lives on her own and was more than happy to take in myself and my kids, especially after all that we’ve been through, she’s been extremely helpful and sympathetic.  I insisted on paying her rent to make it fair, but she adamantly refused, insisting that “her home is our home”, saying she could never make us pay rent when she knows I have children to take care of and when she’s financially very well off herself as it is.  I’ve made up for it by paying for groceries, toiletries, any other necessities whenever I can.

Another major decision I’ve made is to enrol my kids in a different school.  They were in a public school in the past, and while it was the cheap option, I don’t feel they were getting the best education possible.  They didn’t always get along well with the other kids, it was kind of a rough crowd at the school, and I felt the teachers there weren’t exactly what you’d call enthusiastic.

I enrolled them in a private school with the added money I have from renting out our old house, and yes while it is more expensive, I think they are much better off.  They are getting a more focused and dedicated education, they are in a better environment without bullying, I feel the teachers are better.  I know this is as very difficult time for them and I feel if they focus on school, they might be able to have an outlet and take their minds away from the horrible circumstances our family is in.

My sister, as I mentioned, has been entirely supportive of all my decisions.  She’s helped in driving them to and from school when I can’t, done the occasional baby-sitting when I have to work overtime, and she’s juggled it around her full-time work schedule.  She really loves them so so much, and they love her too.  If you saw how much she loved them, you’d think they were her own kids, and she knows that after all they’ve been through, that they need all the love and support they can get.  She says my son in particular looks exactly like me when I was a kid, and reminds her of me when we were kids, and in fact both my kids remind her of us two when we were kids, which makes sense since they’re twins and we’re twins.  But the point is, she has been incredibly incredibly unconditionally supportive.

Now there’s the issue of the in-laws.  As I said, they never really liked me.  After my wife’s tragic death, for a period we did become very close, sharing in our grief with each other.  It was almost like I was a part of their family for that period, and they were very loving and caring and supportive of my kids during that time.

However, after that, they started opposing many decisions I was making.  For example they were really angry when I started renting out the house, when I moved to another suburb, and when I moved my kids to a different school.  They were angry that I was making all these decisions on my own, they felt they too should have a say.  I told them I would always appreciate their advice but they are my children, I’m the sole legal guardian, they are my responsibility, I make the decisions. They are welcome to offer advice, but I make the decisions.

They didn’t like that.  Things got worse after that, they were trying to interfere and involve themselves, while maintaining the same cruel demeanour they had held towards me in the past.  When I asked help from them for things like watching over the kids or babysitting, they were always busy, but they just wanted to see the kids when they had free time without any responsibility and still have an equal say over decision making, which I would not accept.

Eventually relations got pretty bad and I started cutting them out more and more, not contacting them at much.  They would sometimes drop by unannounced at my sister’s house, which my sister really hated. They were always really rude and disrespectful to my sister whenever they came. Eventually my sister told them they can’t come whenever they want and she wouldn’t just open the door to them, and it ended up in a huge fight between me and them which permanently severed relations.

I still see them from time to time.  Like when I’m shopping, I occasionally see my wife’s parents, or her sister and her sister’s family.  Or for example at inter-school events, I’d see my wife’s sister, since she and her husband have kids around the same age as our kids that go to a different school.

We also see them at Church a lot.  I haven’t been to Church in a long while, I’m kind of having a crisis of faith, that’s another story though, but when I do go, they see me there and they are very judgemental towards me.  Like “oh, he hasn’t been to Church lately”.  My sister however still goes to Church every week and still takes the kids with her, she says she sees my wife’s family there but avoids them.
My sister has also frequently run into my wife’s parents or my wife’s sister when she does the shopping.  She says they are very mean to her, ask provocative questions trying to make her out to be a bad housetaker and like she’s not fit to be taking care of the kids, and they are very mean to her in general.  She says my wife’s sister in particularly has a very nasty streak towards her.

One day my sister came back home crying, I had no idea what had happened, but apparently she had run into them, and they’d had a conversation which turned into an argument and they said some very hurtful things to her and she had started crying as soon as she got back to the car.  She said at the time she felt so tiny and squashed by them but she had been determined not to cry in front of them.  I had really had enough of them at this point that they were going this far to make our lives hard, the family of their own grandchildren.

As if I don’t have enough problems in my life, very recently in the past few weeks I’ve had some really bad news.  I’ve been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and am going to need to have radiation and chemotherapy soon.  I might die, and my children might be left orphans, that terrifies me.  So far nobody else knows about my diagnosis except my sister, I haven’t told my kids, my mother, or any friends or other relatives.  

My sister has taken it really horribly, she’s been crying every night, spontaneously crying.  She hasn’t been able to eat, during dinner and meals sometimes she just spontaneously starts crying.  My kids know something is wrong and they know I’m hiding something from them, I just don’t know how to tell them.  My sister keeps saying “I don’t want you to die, I don’t want you to die”. I told her whatever happens, happens, but we’ll try our best to prevent it.  She’s an adult but she seems to be struggling to accept the concept that I might die, I don’t even know how I can break the news to my kids that their dad is sick and his life is in danger.  I’m also really worried about my sister, this is all so much for her, I really feel so sorry for her. When I see her cry, my kids cry, and I want to cry to.  I can’t stand knowing how my own disease is destroying her on the inside.  I hear her sobbing in the middle of the night and praying for me, begging and pleading with God for me not to die.  Every time I try to talk to her about it and discuss with her the issue, the tears start coming, its made our life really hard the past week.  Every time I try to discuss it with her, the tears start flowing like a tap, she starts whimpering “I don’t want you to die, I don’t want you to die” and its like she regresses into a child-like state, I can’t imagine what she’s going through.
  
So yeah, things are really difficult for me at the moment.  The purpose of this post is to ask for advice on the best way to handle the situation with my wife’s family.  How can I get them off my back and stop them bothering us and making life for us so difficult by constantly interfering with how I parent my children?  And secondly, the whole issue with me and my illness, what can I do for my sister, she’s suffering immensely from an emotional point of view, and when is the best time to explain it properly to my children?

**TLDR: Wife deceased, now living with my two kids at my sister’s house.  Wife’s family are constantly interfering in my life and with how I raise my children, making life very difficult. I also have a recent diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, its sent my sister into an emotional crisis, she’s crying all the time, and I don’t know how to explain it to my kids.  What should I do?**

Throwaway just incase he creeps on my account. 

My husband and I have been together 5 years, married for 4. We've had a pretty stellar relationship despite his insecurities. He has trust issues due to past relationships and his upbringing. During the first few months of our relationship I wasn't sure we were going to last as he would project all of his insecurities into me. I am naturally bubbly (for lack of a better term) and a social butterfly. I enjoy being around my friends whom I consider a second family (I'll explain this bit soon). He is not so much a social butterfly and prefers to be home with as little contact with humanity as possible. Because of my nature, if I could ever get him to go out with me, he would constantly accuse me of cheating, despite my being by his side the entire time we would be out. I am an open book and he has access to every single one of my social media accounts including my texts and emails. I am a tad ""flirty"" I admit but harmlessly so. I have never and would never cheat in a relationship. He knew this about me before we ever started dating and accepted it. 

On to the issue.. there is a gaming convention I have attended every year for the past 17 years. It is a HUGE part of my life. The friends that I have made because of this convention are friendships that I love and cherish. We only ever get to see each other and be in the same place at the same time this one time of the year, over a long weekend. Then it's back to our regular lives in different states and trying to keep in touch through Facebook. Because of this we treat it as a huge party and live it up for the weekend. Nothing ever too wild. We drink, we play video games, and just enjoy being with our friends. My husband has attended with me in the past but after talking with me about it, decided it wasn't for him but assured me that it was fine if I continued to attend. I have attended without him for the last 2 years. On my own accord I make sure to let him know what I'm doing and where I am within the convention at all times and I FaceTime him at night during it before I go to sleep, just to keep his mind at ease. 

This years convention we couldn't afford for me to go for the entire weekend but it's a close enough drive for me to go for a day and return home. I asked him if he would have an issue with this and he assured me he didn't, so that is what I did. I went for the last day of the event just so I could physically see the friends I had not seen in a year and hug them in real life. It was fantastic to see everyone although I left heavy hearted feeling like I didn't get to spend enough time with them. 

The day after, my husband started texting me while he was at work. Saying things like ""I'm glad you could have fun while I work my ass off for us and haven't had a vacation in 2 years."" and ""While you're off with your friends, I'm left home to take care of the kids."" He is a mud logger and gone for weeks or months at a time, while I stay home caring for the children and attempt being a full time online student to further my own career. He confused me so I tried to inquire further into what was bothering him and he finally told me. He has never been ok with my attending this convention, even with him being there with me. He just said he was ok with it in hopes that one day I would stop going. Instead (as he said) the week of the event he would be pissy and passive aggressive. He's always kind of pissy so I never really noticed. He said he hates it and can't stand that I keep returning to it. I tried to plead my case. It's not so much about the convention as it is the people. I cherish the friendships that I have made there over the last 17 years and they are all like an extended family that you only get to see once a year. It's more about the ""family reunion"" than it is the event itself. I don't know what prompted it but he told me I needed to grow up and no one has friendships like that. 

He gave me an ultimatum. Give up the convention, the 17 years worth of friendships, and remove them all from my life (as in deleting them from social media) or him. I was completely dumbfounded. I love my husband so of course I told him that I would give it up. That seemed to have made him happy but I've been a bit depressed ever since when the realization started setting in that I would never get to see my friends again and he literally asked me to throw away years and years of friendships. Am I wrong to consider changing my mind? Am I being unreasonable? 

TL;DR - husband asked me to give up something that has been a huge part of my life for 17 years including giving up the friendships I've made through it. I told him I would but now I kind of regret it and don't know what to do. "

"Guy (23M) flipped the script about our first date and I (24F) am not sure what to do!


Ok so I've been talking to this guy on Tinder very briefly and he said how he was a chef and how he makes all these fancy dinners and stuff.

He asked what my favorite meal was and I said mac &amp; cheese. So he suggested getting together tomorrow night so he could make this special, fancy mac &amp; cheese for me.

I thought it sounded so cute and was imagining him like making it in this fancy kitchen, us eating at this fancy table in his fancy apartment, maybe watching a movie afterward, something like that.

So tonight he said he made the meal already and we'll just have to heat it up tomorrow. Ok, a little bump in the plan but alright still sounds cool.

And then I said 'Oh I forgot to ask, what part of town are you living in?' so I'll know what city i'll have to drive to tomorrow. But he said he's actually like 4 hours away at the moment and he comes into the city on the weekends and usually stays at a friend's place.

So I asked 'wait where will we be eating this meal then?' and he asked if we could eat it at my place!

Cue the record scratch and I was like 'wait what?' I practically live in a frat house with 3 male roommates and I guess I wasn't expecting to be the host. Like where are we gonna eat? All we have is a kitchen island and that'd be weird sitting side-by-side on a 'first date'. And my roommates are gonna be home and they're gonna be like jokingly picking on me that I have this formal date going on with all of them around. And what are we gonna do after? I don't have a TV so we can't watch movies or anything. I guess we could go somewhere afterward and like get a drink. But ugh this just wasn't what I expected lol.

So what do I do? I kind of just want to say 'forget it' but he already made the meal! And nobody's ever done something like that for me, especially not someone who I've barely spoken to!

"Me [21M] with my ex gf [19 F] She has super conservative parents, we broke up a a long time ago but her parents just found out we had sex and her dad just messaged me. What should i do???


Hello good people of reddit, i frequent this sub a lot and i know its filled with lots of good people that gives pretty good advice. Throwaway because friends know my reddit account. Sorry in advance if it sounds rushed or anything, im kind of rushed and just wrote what i could, ill answer any questions that anyone may have.

Okaaaay, so im going to try to keep to the main essentials, I met Megan last summer and we began dating. We were both virgins at the time. I had messed around with other girls before but never had actually gone all the way before, she basically saw it as i had already lost my virginity tho. She has really conservative parents as do i, who believe that you should hold off until marriage to have sex etc. Well long story short, after dating for a while we began having sex, we always had protection and were careful.. I just want to stress the fact that she was 18 at the time we started dating and she turned 19 while we dated altho because she was held back a year she was still a senior in highschool while i was already in college. 

While we dated her dad once asked me if i had ever had sex before and i lied and told him no, she had told me to lie for us so i did and he knew where my parents worked and i guess call me paranoid but they have a history of doing rash decisions so i didnt want there to be a chance where they would try to reach out to my parents and tell them what i had done. 

We broke up in February because the relationship wasnt working, we were fighting a lot and we decided to split ways. It wasnst exactly amicable but we have talked a handful of times since and have been civil. Ive tried to push that whole relationship out of my life since and move on. 

Sooo on to the problem at hand, she texts me today out the blue telling me if anyone from her family contacts me, to NOT tell them anything or answer anything. I asked her why and she told me she told her sister she wasnt a virgin anymore and that she had sex with me and one other guy after we broke up. Her sister told her parents so she wanted to warn me before they reached out to me. I didnt really think anyone would bother contacting me so i shrugged it off and told her whatever and left it at that. Now her dad just sent me a message on FB telling me he needs to speak with me when i have a chance. I havent opened up the message as to not show the read part but i saw the little notification on my phone. 

Yes i do realize that Im 21 and if he tells my parents it shouldnt matter because im on my own and they dont really have a say in my life anymore which they dont, but they believe about waiting till marriage for sex for religious reasons and if they find out i had sex, it will really hurt them and most def make a rift in our relationship. Ive already had a rocky relationship with them and i dont want to make it worse.
  
My question is, What should i do? Should i ignore the dad? What if he contacts my parents and tells them? Should i tell him anything? I dont want to argue weather i should care if my parents find out or about religious morals, just about the situation with my exes parents. I really appreciate any advice and support you guys can offer.

  TLDR: Dated girl with strict religious parents, I have strict religious parents, I had sex with this girl, we broke up, I moved away to another state for college, she contacts me and tells me her parents found out about her having sex, and now her parents want to talk to me after months of no contact.

Update: So i have been reading all of your comments and i appreciate it everything everyone has been saying. 

I decided not to answer him and just wait it out. She texted me again telling me she was sorry but she came clean to her dad and she hopes everything works out and he doesnt take measures.... (I dont know what that means, frankly i dont really care, i agree that this is between him and her and weve been broken up for a while theres no reason why he should be looking to me for an explanation.) 

She texted me and told me not to ignore her dad because he has my parents phone number and will call them if he has to. I talked to my roommate and a few of my friends that live near my apartment and they advised me to message him back but feel out the conversation, not admit to anything and not justify anything, it is what it is and it happened, i honestly dont see what he gets out of talking to me or lecturing me or whatever he wants to do. I do hope he doesnt call my parents bc that would be a real dick thing of him to do for literally no reason at all. ugh this whole thing is such a headache that i thought was supposed to be over with. I appreciate all the input and i will update once i can/have something to update with.

Edit: Format


Update 2: WOW this has really blown up way bigger than i thought it would. Ive been reading through all of the comments and i appreciate all the advice from you guys. Soooo on to the update

I woke up this morning and my dad called me, i feared the worst but he only needed like basic tech support for his computer, and that was all he wanted. I felt relieved and went through my day. A little while ago my sister calls me and asks me what my exes dads name is, i tell her and she tells me that he called dad and left a voicemail saying he was going to try and call again today. Most of my family was there and i was on speaker phone so they asked if knew anything and i told them i wouldnt know why my exes family would try to contact them after us being broken up for such a long time. My dad said it was odd and he would wait for the call and see what was up, he figures her dad just wants advice on something so he would let me know what it its about.

I called my sister shortly after and told her why he was calling, and her response was literally bursting out in laughter. She thinks its really weird for him to do this because he gains nothing from calling us, my ex is obviously not pregnant and we both dont think he would try to pull the consent card, so we figured he just wants to ""tell on me"" basically and that would be that. My sister and my dad are hanging out all day today and she told me not to worry about it and it will be okay, she will be texting me and let me know or give me a heads up if anything happens. As soon as i get a response i will let you guys know! "
"I (28M) am a groomsman in my friends (28M) wedding. He wants a 7+ day bachelor party. My fiancé is pissed. Thoughts?


Hey reddit, just need advice. My fiancée and I are getting married in a few months, so we've been busy saving money and planning the wedding. My friend just got engaged to his girlfriend of 3 months and they are having their wedding before ours. He's a groomsman in my wedding. He asked me to be a groomsman in his and I said yes. All was well. Then he dropped the bomb on me that he wants a 7-day bachelor party!! I told him I'd think about it, but my fiancé is adamantly against the idea. He and the other groomsmen will be doing surfing/extreme sports and he wants me (the owner of a big SUV) to drive them around to different beaches across the country.

My fiancée thinks he's just using me and asked me to be a groomsman so that he could use me for my vehicle. She also thinks a week long bachelor party is insane and irresponsible to attend, especially since we are so close to our own wedding. She told me to decline his offer and tell him I can't be in the wedding. Is a week long bachelor party too much? Does my fiancée have a point? 

Tldr: asked to be a groomsman in my friends wedding. He is going on a week long bachelor party and wants me to drive him and the other groomsmen around.

Edit before people start criticizing: my fiancée does not like this guy, he has screwed me over before but I always give him chances since we go way back . She thinks this should be my wakeup call to see what kind of guy he really is. "
"I 27F own a small but very profitable business, husband 29M doesn't understand why I don't want to hire his sister and our neighbor. Saying it is my duty (???) to hire them.


I'm going to keep this short.

I own a small business that actually does very well. I've but a lot of years, money, and time into the company and it has grown 30% every year for the past 3 years. And I am doing so great. I really do love it and have a lot of pride and passion for it.

Anyways, sister in law needs a job, as well as one of our neighbors. Purely based on their resumes and not from a family/friend stand point, I wouldn't hire them. As well as their work ethic and some other factors I just wouldn't even be interested in hiring them if they had sent in their resumes as strangers.

My husband however, thinks I owe it to them to hire them. My husband works for his brother, but my husband actually went to school for his trade and does a good job. His brother didn't hire him because he was his brother. 

I've tried to explain to my husband that I don't feel comfortable hiring them, and from a business standing I really do not feel confident in how they would perform as employees for me. I do have the availability to bring on 2 new employees but I don't feel comfortable hiring them. 

How do I get this point across to my husband without sounding uptight at rude?

"A Nurse [??M] at the local hospital is making me [24F] bad when I go in for appointments.


**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your advice. I was hesitant to contact the hospital because I was a little worried that I was being overly sensitive. I wrote an email and sent it into the patient relation's department (I basically copied what I've written below). My next appointment isn't for another four weeks but I will update when I can.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Nearly three weeks ago, I broke my big toe at the gym. I had to drive/walk myself to the urgent care clinic and every step was agony. They took an xray and yep, totally broke clean through the top joint in two places. 

Because it's a toe (even though it was my big toe) they can't really set it - it needs to heal on its own. The fun part about big toes is you really need them for balance, and they're connected to a number of tendons in the foot- meaning even when I'd step only on my heel or outside of my foot, there was still pain as the tendons shifted. They recommended to me that I either get my foot/leg plaster casted or purchase an air cast to keep the foot/toe immobile to let it heal. I bought an air cast, and the emergency clinic booked an appointment with the specialist at the fracture clinic in the hospital for later that week.

Walking was still really painful for the first week. I tried to stay off it as much as possible, but I do need to walk around for my job so I couldn't completely avoid it (nor did I want to).

When I showed up at the fracture clinic, a nurse took me into see the doctor and looked me up and down and in a derisive tone of voice said ""You're wearing that boot for JUST a broken toe??"". I'm was confused so I just said ""Yes?"" and he walked away. I met with the doctor and he told me to stay off the foot, use the boot, and keep taping my toes. 

Today (2 weeks after the initial appointment) I went back for a follow-up. Same nurse. Same thing. This time I responded with ""Well, it was my big toe."" But he kinda did this snort thing and walked away.

Anyways, the more I think about it the more I'm bothered by it. The doctors at both the emergency clinic and the fracture clinic told me to use the boot. What if the nurse had made comments like that to someone else who felt guilty and decided to forgo the boot/sling/whatever and ended up injuring themselves worse?

I know it's just a toe and there are other people at the clinic with broken shoulders/arms/legs and I don't think my pain can be worse then theirs - but if walking in the boot is what makes my pain manageable, why is a nurse making me feel bad for doing so?

Anyways - I have ANOTHER appointment in a few weeks and it's already making me feel anxious to have to deal with this nurse again. 

Are his comments okay and I'm just over-reacting? Should I say something TO him? What should I say to him? Should I say something to the hospital?

"I [17F] found my boyfriends [21M] porn and am really scared.

"I [28F] am thinking of leaving my husband [36M] even though I'm pregnant.


I have always been one to say that I am willing to work through anything in a marriage unless it's cheating, but I am reaching my boiling point and I wonder if I should just leave my husband.

We have been married for 6 years and we have 2 kids, 1 on the way.

He is the most financially irresponsible person I have ever known. Ever.  We always owe somebody. We always get calls from collection agencies.  Unless it's income time, we don't have extra spending if we pay our bills.

Oh yes, paying our bills.  That is always a difficult thing to do with him. He hates paying our bills and prefers to just not pay them until it's too late.  I have like 2 repossessions on my credit because of him.  Yes, I am stupid for enabling him basically.  

I get so embarrassed because he always wants to be borrowing money from people and he is shameless.  I HATE borrowing money unless it's an absolute necessity.  And half of the time he doesn't want to pay people back.  He has basically borrowed money from every single person in my immediate family.  What's worse is that my mom is a business owner and is well off and the minute we fall into a hole, he mentions if we can borrow money from my mom.  

He is a great dad otherwise.  Our kids absolutely love him.  I do love him, but lately I can barely make myself kiss him or even have sex with him because this is an issue that makes him repulsive to me. 

I grew up with parents who were well off.  They would take us on vacations and had us in private schools and basically spoiled us.  I don't even care if I don't have an extravagant lifestyle.  I just want the basics.  I just want to NOT have bill collectors calling me.  I want to know that our light is going to be paid on time.  

He doesn't even pay for my car or my phone.  My mom does.  And she hates him because he still owes her money and is totally irresponsible.

He always pushes me to apply for installment loans, but the minute it comes to pay them, he tells me, ""Can't it wait until next week?""

If it wasn't for me, our light and internet would've been disconnected by today.

We both work full-time although he pays for child support so I make more than he does.  

Our baby is due in less than 3 months and he blew through our small savings to put a down payment for a computer and a tv that we can't afford.  This means I don't even know if I'll be able to have a decent maternity leave because I'll have to rush back to work to provide for us.


I buy groceries so that he doesn't have to buy takeout, but he still finds excuses to buy himself takeout.  Our daughter hangs out with him during the day (he is an on-call locksmith and she is 3 years old) so he uses her as an excuse even though there are ingredients to make sandwiches or a pizza in the freezer.   

I'm just getting totally fed up with all of this bullshit.  I don't even know what to do.

My mom tells me that I should take control of our finances, but when I try to, he still finds ways to spend the little money that we do have.  

I'm an enabler, right?  I just don't know how to keep the peace in our relationship while controlling our finances.  Is there even hope in this marriage?  
  
**tl;dr**: My husband is financially irresponsible and I'm fed up.  Is there hope for us?

SMALL UPDATE- so I am taking my lunch and he texts me that he already got paid and that he has to pay someone back and he is going to be left with $26. Yup. $26. 

I call him and tell him, ""this is exactly why I hate when you do that because you can't even help me pay any of the bills!!"" He could tell how pissed off I was. He said ""what do you want me to do?"" I tell him, ""you are NOT going to borrow anything or pawn anything at all. You are going to give me those $26 and I'm going to handle our money. You're going to give me every pay check you get and you're not going to touch it or borrow money from anywhere."" He did agree... I didn't give him the ultimatum yet because I felt that was something that needs to be done in person so I'll talk to him when I get home.

*******UPDATE******

I spoke with my husband and he did agree to let me control all of our finances including his paycheck... Or he would have to leave. I told him I needed stability to be happy and feel safe.

Thank you everyone who gave me good advice and for giving me the strength to stick to what I needed to say!!! 

Oh and for those saying why in the world did I marry him? Yeah, comments similar to that one aren't constructive in any way."
"My [16M] cousin [17M] made the situation go from 0-100 in 5 seconds when I was pulled over by the police. I never want to drive him again


So I have a twin sister, we are twin brother and sister in our sophomore year. My sister and I are as close as you would expect twins to be, we are going to the same university when we graduate. We never want to be to far away from each other.

After school today I asked her if she wanted a ride home. she asked me if I could pick her up from the mall later, because she was going with her best friend. I normally do drive us home, sometimes she goes somewhere with friends. I give my cousin a ride home almost everyday as well. 


So I noticed this cop was trying to get me to pull over. I pulled over and the police officer got out of his car and walked up to me. I had to show him my license and everything else. I was talking to the cop and he was about to leave. Before this everything was fine, the police officer and I were civil with each other. 

Now my cousin and I are white, but my cousin is dating an African American girl. This idiot let's out the comment "" Thank god we are not black, we would have had 100 bullets in us by now"". Long story short this lead to him calling the officer rude names, we had to get out of the car. My cousin tried to hit the cop and long story short our parents had to come. 

I the entire time was telling him to grow up. He was arrested I was  sent home with my parents. I never want to give him a ride again. not after this stunt by my Aunt and Uncle are demanding I forgive him and see it his way. The idiot could have gotten me shot  

edit: How do I handle my aunt and uncle?

tl;dr: Never want to drive my cousin again "
"My family always ridiculed me [41M] for being ""trailer park trash"" but now that my mom [70F] is behind on her mortgage, everyone's looking to ME to pony up bailout money


I was mom and dad's ""little oops"" that caused them to get married.


My dad was really old-school. He worked hard in a blue-collar job in the auto industry but eventually worked his way up to middle management. He died twenty years ago, quite young from emphysema because he chain-smoked. He was only 49. He left my mother a workable insurance policy and she got along okay.  Of course, being his wife, my mom inherited everything.


My parents had two other kids, both girls [38, 34]. My dad was a lot harder with me than with them. I had to work as a teenager whereas my sisters got an allowance.


I moved out of my parents' house when I was nineteen and in my second year of my science major. I got student loans and had my own studio apartment near campus. My dad was proud that I was ""being a man"" and making my own way in the world. I worked while in college at an IHOP and sent several hundred dollars home to my mom every month to help her and my sisters.


Soon after graduating college at twenty two, I got a job as a high school chemistry and physics teacher and that's been my job ever since. I married at thirty to a teacher [now 43] from another school and we have a three year old daughter. My wife has been on hiatus from teaching, but she intends to go back when our daughter starts kindergarten in a couple of years.


My family live in a mobile home. Not a trailer. It looks like a house because, in truth, it is a house, just one that isn't ""nailed"" into the ground with a concrete foundation and all that. Think: one of those Sears ""build-your-own"" homes from the 1930s. We live in a mobile home community filled with similar, portable houses. 


My mom won a substantial state lottery not long after my dad died worth nearly a million dollars. With that money she put my sisters through school. I didn't get any of it but I didn't ask for any, either.


I've never been especially close to my sisters, and for that matter I've never been especially close to my mom, either, which is why I kind of felt unwelcome at home and moved out when I was nineteen. It didn't stop me from sending money home dutifully, but I just didn't have an emotional connection with the women in my family in the same way I had with my father.


Anyway they always like to poke fun at my home and call me a redneck or trailer trash. They knew it made me uncomfortable but they'd still do it. They've been doing it ever since I moved into the mobile home at twenty-five. Like, whenever a picture of my house would be on something I post to Facebook, they'll say something passive aggressive about my home, or insinuate that I'm not being a good provider for my wife. My wife has never once complained about our home—which I bought long before I even met her—and she's told me numerous times that she loves it and that it's all we need.


Since we live in a mobile home that I paid off nearly ten years ago, my wife and I have saved several thousands of dollars. So, while we don't have a fancy home, my wife and I and our child have money to splurge on little goodies and vacations.


With her lottery winnings my mother gifted my sisters lots of money to put downpayments on their houses after they got married several years ago. Each of my sisters has children; the elder of my sisters has two boys [7, 4] and the younger has three [5M, 3M, 1F]. Their husbands both work white-collar professions. 
  

Anyway it seems that my mom has been mismanaging her money recently and has asked each of us for loans to cover her mortgage because she's fallen behind.


Both of my sisters and their husbands begged off saying they have no cash.


Everyone is looking at me now because they know I have money.


It's true I have money but it's for my wife and my child.


My mom is saying I should loan her a few thousand dollars ""just until she sorts out the little mess she's in.""


I personally think there's no need for a seventy year old woman to have a five bedroom house and if she's still paying it off then she ought to downsize to an apartment.


My mom says it's cruel for me to suggest that and disrespectful to my dad's memory.


Um. What?


I also told her that she ought to move in with one of her daughters, each of whom has a huge house with extra bedrooms. My own house has only two bedrooms.


My sisters tell me that I'm the oldest and a man and it's my responsibility to look after our mother.


(Funny, I thought they didn't believe I was a man so much as a redneck trailer park loser, but whatever)


And also since my wife and I sometimes post pictures of our vacations or other purchases (for example I bought a new economy car) on social media, that we must be rolling in it.


And also, that since I have only one child, I should shoulder more of the responsibility to take care of our mom.


I think my mom and sisters are being unreasonable (and SEXIST) and that they should figure out a way from this mess that doesn't involve me handing over my trailer trash money.


What say you?

 Hi Everyone,

In case you don’t want to the wall of text, David (husband) is the father. 

I received a few PM's asking for an update so I thought I would give an update to let you know how things are going. Below is the link in case you are interested... but please be kind. When I wrote that I was in shock and did not know how to react to the situation. My thoughts were all over the place and I was very conflicted. I'm not super proud of my reaction, but I was trying to be as open and honest about my thoughts as possible. Now that things have settled in my head, and we have more information, my perspective has changed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z0o1e/me_29_f_with_my_husband_32_m_together_for_6_years/ 

A few points for clarification:

- My husband was aware that I had made the post because I needed to talk to someone and he felt that reddit would be a good outlet. Since he is more private than I am, he had asked that I not talk too much about how he was feeling unless it was relevant to my own feelings, which is why it was focused on me. Also, because of the shock, I may not have portrayed him in the best light. He is very kind, empathetic, supportive and has always had my back for everything, even before we were together. He is my person and this situation has not changed that. When I said that leaving him had crossed my mind, it was the truth, but after talking to a therapist I realized that this stemmed from that fact *that I am terrified of being a parent and wasn’t even sure if deep down I really wanted kids at all*. I have diagnosed infertility issues and deep down never truly thought that I would be able to have children. There are options that we can pursue when ready, but there is no guarantee, so it was easier to just not really think about it. At the end of the day though, when I imagined having the conversation regarding divorce and how it would play out, and even **in my imagination** I couldn't say the words to him, never mind in real life. So that clarified that this was just fear talking.
 
- The title is a bit misleading regarding the math: Kid is five and a half and my husband and I have been together for a little over six years (married for a bit over three). My husband and I were actually very good friends for a few years before we began seeing each other, and were dating about three months before we had the exclusivity talk. He slept with the mother during the initial stages of our relationship, and I was fully aware at that time that  they had met online and had gone out once. Ironically enough, he told her didn't want to pursue things for her because he realized he had deep feelings for me and his guilt about sleeping with her prompted the exclusivity talk. A lot of people (including my parents) have a bit of an issue with the timing, **but he did not cheat one me**... When we started seeing each other we had said that we would always be friends first and would always be open and honest with each other, even if it's difficult and I have no reason to believe that he slept with her since that time. 

OK now on to it! 

After a lot of soul searching on David's part, he came to the conclusion that, as much as it would be easier to bury his head in the sand and pretend that this never happened, Alex is his son and at the very minimum he needs to make sure he is safe and happy, and that if he does nothing, he will think about this every single day for the rest of his life. And if we do decide to have kids, they will be an even bigger reminder of his other son. At one point it came out that when he had said that he didn't want to be involved initially *it was because that is what he thought I wanted to hear* and that if he had to pick between his son and his marriage, he was choosing his marriage, but that he didn't really know if he could move forward if it actually came to that. 

From my side of things, what I wanted was for him to make his decision independent as to what I thought and wanted, because ultimately if something happened to me, he would still to deal with the consequences of partaking in his son’s life and that he can’t undertake something of that magnitude just for me. 

The truth of the matter is though that I know my husband very well, and at the end of the day, he wouldn’t have been able to live with himself if he ignored this situation. 

When it came down to it, the reason I was having such an issue with things is because I am not a kid person, and kids scare the crap out of me and I have a hard time relating to them. I love kids, I think they are super cute and watching them just GET something is amazing and they bring a lot of joy to your life. It is also insanely cool seeing them become their own person. But kids don’t really like me very much, likely because I become super nervous around them. Also, the amount of pressure and responsibility when responsible for another human being, making sure that they grow up happy and become productive members of society.. heck even making sure they stay alive!... is overwhelming. I don’t know how parents get up in the morning.  But at the end of the day, as I said before, David is my person and we’ll get through this together. If it comes to that (more below), being parents to a five year old will be learning curve for both of us, but I will be the best step-parent that I can be and he will feel nothing but love from both us. If we have other kids in the future, Alex will be treated the exact same way. 

That was the emotional stuff.

Now onto the practical. 

We had a home DNA test and it was confirmed that my husband is the father. Not that there was any doubt in my mind. The situation is even more fucked up than I thought though.

Jessica (the mother) and David spoke on the phone and she told him a few things that were concerning:

- Alex (the son) is currently living with his father Sam (I guess stepfather would be more appropriate... but keep reading). From what we can guess, he has been living there since 2013. This raised a bunch of red flags. Children's Aid wouldn't place a child with someone they believe is abusive, and even more telling... they tend to favor the mother. So this is weird.

- Because of a complaint that Jessica lodged, in 2013 Sam was charged for assaulting Alex, but he was acquitted

- She says that in 2013, she voluntarily placed Sam in foster care because she kept passing out and thought it was dangerous as it would mean Alex was alone (… yeah, I don't know this works, but I have a hard time believing that there are no resources available for this type of situation…)

- Children's Aid is on Sam's side and, in the files, she is not portrayed in a good light at all

- She did not realize that David had moved eight hours away, she assumed we were still in the same city. 

- She has another court case soon regarding custody.

Sam knows that Alex is not his son, but is in denial and thinks that the DNA test is wrong since it is a home test. He wants to keep full custody of his son. Jessica wants to have full custody of her son, and is hoping that by throwing bio-dad into the mix, the courts will take Alex away from Sam and award him to her and that we can then have visitation (or probably more accurately, pay support and stay away). 

Yeah. It's a shit show and I feel like I am living in soap opera.

David asked that the children’s aid and court papers be sent to him so he could formulate a plan. Based on what we know, which admittedly isn’t much, it seems as though Sam is a good father. There are ton of Facebook posts of Alex building a snow fort, Alex swimming in lakes with his Dad, Alex dressing up as batman… just normal stuff you expect to see from a proud father. Jessica… not so much. Honestly, she looks high in most photos. Based on the reason as to why she gave him up temporarily, the photos, and the fact that he isn't living with her, I'm assuming it's an opiate addiction, but am just guessing.

David ultimately wants what is best for Alex, and if it means having him with us fulltime so be it, but right now it seems horrible to pull a five year old from the only home he really knows because of DNA. So we are waiting for the files, and will be talking to the caseworker to see if our impression is right. We don’t trust Jessica at all so she is not an option. If it turns out that there are issues with Sam, we will fight for full custody. If Alex is happy, well-adjusted, and Sam is a good Dad like we believe, after due diligence and a conversation with Sam to see how feels and is OK with everything, David will be signing away his rights and give Sam his medical and contact information in case it is needed. He also had the idea to write a letter to Alex explaining his actions (that he found out about him at five, but seemed like he had a good home and a great Dad and felt like what he is doing was in his best interests but that he loves him and is there for him and can reach out if and when he is ready) that Sam can give to him when Alex is older (if he wants to). Of course, it will ultimately be Sam's decision as to whether or not he wants to tell Alex about his bio-dad. 

I’m not sure if this is the right thing, but it seems horrible to make a five year old go live with complete strangers eight hours away from Mom and Dad if it can be helped. Sam is the one that has been playing with him, taking care of him when he is sick… Sam is his Dad.

We have a big battle ahead of ourselves though. I don’t really have any questions, but if anybody has any advice navigating this, opinions etc… well this is the internet so have at it ! :) 

Thanks!

*Edited for spelling and grammar

*Edit 2: We are exploring a possibility for setting up a trust for him which we will contribute to for when he is 21 or so, regardless as to how this plays out. I should have mentioned it with the letter.

  **tl;dr**: Husband is the father. Looks like Mom might be a nutjob but that Dad is actually a good guy and not abusive. Doing due diligence, but if son turns out to be fine with Dad we will stay out of it (but provide option for a relationship if he asks about bio-dad). If he is abusive, we will be fighting for full custody. "
"I [15/F] did freelancing with my friend, and ended up earning an amount of money. Now my family won't stop asking for some of it.


**Update: I really thought hard about every single comment and even re-read it a couple times. I felt bad talking to my family about it - so I let you guys do the job! I sent them this post and they realized they've been unfair and they told my siblings to stop asking and they've given them local job-flyers! thank you guys for saving me from such a weird situation and I can assure you the money won't be spent on something useless!**

For security reasons, I didn't use any personal info.
I hope you don't mind~~

Okay, so it all started a few months ago when I transferred schools. Everything was well and I met a couple of friends that had the same interests as me and we just kind of hit it off. But there was one girl I found was the closest to me (*let's call her elly*) 

Elly was really creative and she spent her time doing everything she found productive -- whether it was sewing, editing videos, cooking, or crafting. I always was around her because she seemed so bubbly and the kind of person who would inspire you to do fun stuff.

She taught me all about social media and soon enough- she even asked me to join in, seeing as this was harmless, we started blowing up on this new app. We started getting a few, then several, then a few hundred comments on our clips and slowly she drifted apart from it.

I just kept doing it because I didn't wanna desert all the editing and hard work we put into our account~ and she was supportive, every once in a while we would laugh about the positive comments we were getting and sometimes laugh too about the hateful ones.

Around a month ago, we earned a following from what we did. 
I got so many emails from so many different people offering to pay me for editing and such. Elly and I thought this was kind of like freelancing, so we occasionally did freelance but mostly we were editing videos.

We would always laugh about how this was kind of our version of lemonade stands and how we were like a pimp business. 

We had all the money that we earned in a Paypal account and we promised not to use it until it reached a 100 dollars. It reached, we screamed internally for a few hours not believing it and I still smile when I think of that day.

We kept doing it, and soon enough we both had enough money **that we earned by ourselves** to buy both of us cheap iphone 5c's 

if you're wondering the price range it's 170$-250$. 

Now the problem.

After telling my family about it, they thought it was cool but now my siblings won't stop asking me to give them some money so they could go ""hangout"" I think they can earn their own money since they're way older than me and can get a job. My parents keep pestering me to give my siblings 10% each week. If I was running this thing alone, I would've thought about it but since me and Elly are running it, I feel like the money should be for us only and should be like an emergency  account.

But it didn't stop to just my immediate family. Now several of my cousins have found out and are begging me to add them to the ""10%"" too.


Am I being bratty and selfish? I don't know what to do and day by day they keep asking more and more. Whatever response I get I'll show to my family in hopes they understand where I'm coming from.

A couple of years ago, my brother told my family that he'd been having an ongoing, year-long affair with one of his co-workers behind my sister-in-law's back. My brother and SIL had been married for 10 years and have 2 kids (8F &amp; 5F) and he finally told my SIL what was going on and that he wanted a divorce. My family was devastated to hear the news. Not only did I never believe that my brother could do something like that—he's an upstanding guy in many other ways—but I'm very close to my sister-in-law, who I'd been friends with for years before she and my brother even got together.



My sister-in-law had no idea the affair was going on (happened mostly during business trips and while “working late”) and she was completely gutted. She moved out of their condo with their kids, though they now share custody. Two years later, my brother is still with the woman he had the affair with and they're pretty serious. The GF is now divorced (she was married as well, while they were having the affair) and she's moved into the condo that my brother and SIL used to share. GF has no kids.



Our sister and her family live in Spain, so our remaining nearby family is very small, but we all live in the same township and see each other regularly. That means I can't easily avoid the GF at family functions. She expresses that she's very eager to become “part of the family” and comes along to all family events. She's nice enough, but not someone I'd choose as a friend. Which, under normal circumstances, would be enough to have a cordial and friendly relationship for the sake of family harmony. The problem is that I can't get over what she and my brother did to my SIL, especially since neither of them seem to feel guilty about it. The GF once told my dad that she was lucky to find the love of her life, and that's all that matters.



So I'm polite to the GF, but that's about it—no long conversations or extra efforts. I'm sure she senses that I don't like her. Now she's sent me a text suggesting that we do a “girl's spa weekend” to get to know each other better. I don't want to go and, to be honest, don't  feel particularly motivated to get to know her better. I feel like I found out all I needed to know when, despite also being married herself, she decided to have a year-long affair with my married brother, and still seems to feel like there was nothing wrong with what they did. I'm not an overly moralistic person but I'm having a hard time letting go of the disrespect they showed toward my SIL, who deserved much better and is still pretty shattered.



I know my brother is 100% equally to blame, and I've had difficulty with that as well, but I consider that relationship a separate/more complicated issue. So it's not that I'm just blaming the GF, but more that this particular question doesn't really involve my feelings toward my brother.



Question: Am I wrong/childish to feel this way? Should I make a stronger effort to just get over it? (i.e. Is this a “not my circus, not my monkeys” situation since it's not my marriage/affair to judge?) And how do I respond to the spa weekend suggestion? I honestly don't think I can stomach going.


**EDIT: Thanks  so much for all the insights. I feel like I have a lot to think about for how this is all going to work in the future. It does feel validating that I'm not totally out of line for feeling the way I do, so I appreciate that. I ended up texting back ""Thanks, but I'd rather not."" She texted, ""Why? Sounds fun!"" and I texted ""Let's not force anything"". Then she wrote, ""I just want us to be friends"" but I decided not to respond further. I realize that at some point I need to have a more direct conversation, but for now I'm going to respect my parents' request and stick with what I've been doing. Thanks again for everyone's thoughts. I really appreciate it.**

TL;DR: My brother had a long-term affair that crushed my SIL. Because of that, I'm having a very hard time warming up to his new GF, who he had the affair with. Now she wants us to bond on a spa weekend."
"I [23F] asked my boyfriend [25M] of 2 months to delete the nudes of his ex's off his phone. He said ""No, they're mine.""

"In an effort to lose weight, my boyfriend [22M] and I [21F] have started buying less food and making smaller meals. But it usually ends with him eating most of it.

"My [23f] fiancé [29m] wants me to give up my career and be a SAH(eventual)M and sign a pretty harsh pre-nup. I told him I'd only do one or the other, not both, and now the wedding is postponed indefinitely.

"My [16M] parents [42/44] are being sexist towards my twin sister [16F]. They keep saying I should be more dominant towards her.


I don't know what's wrong with my parents. They think I'm not taking on my responsibility as a brother to take care of my sister. They say in our relationship I should be more dominant since I'm a boy and she should listen to me more often.

We're twins, we take care of each other... equally. Whenever each one of us needs help from the other we ask and we always help each other. We talk a lot but I don't go tell her what she can or can't do... I always let her know of my opinions but she does the same with me but we don't make decisions for each other. Why should she listen to me more than I listen to her? Because I'm a little taller and have a penis? My parents think so.

Look if I was like 20 and she was 16 I would have understood that as her big brother I have more responsibilities towards her than she does towards me and she should listen to me in that case but when we're the same age what's the difference? When my parents give us an allowance they give me more money but tell me to spend it on her. We always split it in half later on though.

I think this is affecting her negatively. She's upset and thinks they don't love her as much as me and she thinks they don't trust her to make the right decisions. Everyday before school or when we're going out they remind her to listen to me. I'm upset that they do it.

How can I make her feel better and how can I get our parents to stop their sexism and just treat us the same?

  **tl;dr**: parents keep telling me to boss my sister and tell her to listen to me even though we're the same age. It's affecting her negatively and I don't know how to help her."
"My acquaintance [29F] used my camera to take pictures of an event on the understanding that I [28F] would pay her, but instead she took dozens and dozens of selfies and other pics that centered around HER, and she still wants me to pay!
