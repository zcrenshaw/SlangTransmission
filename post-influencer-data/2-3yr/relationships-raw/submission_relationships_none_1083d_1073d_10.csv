"[UPDATE] Me [30 F] with my fiance [32 M]- my friends and family keep telling me he's not good for me and I'm starting to get confused.


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54z25c/me_30_f_with_my_fiance_32_mf_my_friends_and/  

Thank you to everyone who replied.  Strange enough I think I needed to hear the advice from people I didn't know, rather than friends and family who have been hounding me for a long time.  

I guess deep down inside, I always thought I deserved better but my self esteem has been lacking for so long that I thought my fiance was the best that I could do.  

I honestly believe now that he has many priorities ahead of me.  One of you asked whether I thought he would drop everything if I ever got into an accident.  I'm not sure he would, and that scares me.  

Last night, I gathered up the courage to confront him about everything: the lack of romance, the lack of dates, the fact that he won't pay for anything or contribute any ideas to our wedding, and sadly, he didn't really react.  He just told me he couldn't discuss it now and needed to deal with something at work.  

I'm heartbroken and ended it on the spot.  While I'm sure I made the right choice, I'm still so lost.  I'm 30 and now single.  I wanted to be married by now and have kids.  Feels like I'm starting over.  Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.  

Thank you all for freeing me.  I'm just trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces.  

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Broke up with fiance for not caring about me or our relationship.  Trying to pick up the pieces.  "
"Pastor's son [22M] broke into media department office and stole my [24F] camera and related equipment. I'm expected to replace it because he ""can't afford to buy a new camera and feed his two daughters""


I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom. 

Background: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood. 

The media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. 

A couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's ""just shooting a video, not that hard"". I declined, so he asked me if I could ""shoot a music video for him"" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. 

I hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded ""Alright"". 

The following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. 

At first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. 

During the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes ""the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model"". 

Okay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was ""left open"" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. 

So I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my ""mess"" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. 

Fast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has ""two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera"" and she ""doesn't know where it is or what he did with it"". 

At this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. 


**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.

Edit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:

Among other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  

Edit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. 

I've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. 

There's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one). "
"**Update** Me [26M] with my live-in girlfriend [26F] 10 years, she has lost her sex drive due to anxiety/stress issues. I'm trying to be supportive but the lack of intimacy is killing me


Original Post: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55zq1c/me_26m_with_my_livein_girlfriend_26f_10_years_she/?st=iu45ko64&amp;sh=99d7b298

Hey guys I got some really good feedback to my post that made talking to my girlfriend a lot easier and I'm so happy so I thought I owed those posters an update!

After reading all the comments and reflecting on our relationship I decided the recent lack of sex was not the problem but just the symptom of a much greater issue, my girlfriend's stress. Like I said in the original post, I was weary to bring these issues up because I did not want to add additional stress to my girlfriend's situation, she has enough to worry about right now.

I had mentioned that weekends are her least busy times and that is when we get things done around the house and hang out with friends. Some users said we should focus less on being social and more on ourselves, and someone else suggested that I try to get more done during the week so we can relax more on the weekend. So on Thursday and Friday I got up early and did everything we needed to do this weekend, cleaned the whole house, did our meal prep (something we usually do Saturday) and got all the laundry taken care of. We're finishing our basement and this weekend was going to be the carpet, so I went to Lowe's and bought everything Thursday and banged it out alone on Friday.

She noticed the whole house being cleaned Friday night and was really relieved that we didn't have to take care of it this weekend. On Saturday we got up and that was when she realized I had taken care of the carpet and everything else. It was awesome, she was giddy with excitement because she pretty much had nothing to do all weekend. So I asked what she wanted to do and it was stereotypical Fall couple stuff; went and got pumpkins and mums for our porch, went and got some new Fall decorations and candles and then just hung around the house being lazy. While I worked out and walked the dog she did a bit of work to get ahead so she wouldn't be as busy this week. We ate dinner and since we were in a Fall mood we watched Hocus Pocus. 

On Sunday we slept in for the first time in ages... well first time for her, I sleep in all the time, don't judge me. We continued the fall theme and went apple picking. We came home and I made an apple pie. She started doing some work but after about a half hour she said screw it, went for a run and then came home and relaxed. We went to her mom's for a big Sunday dinner and when we got home I decided it was time to talk to her about her unsustainable stress situation. 

I told her I loved her and was in it for the long term but that I was worried about her and that her current situation wasn't healthy. She started crying, she thought I was sitting her down to break up with her! She knows that the way she's working isn't healthy but she didn't think it would go on this long. She kept thinking to herself ""just a few more days and I'll get into a flow...just another week..."" and before she knew it it's been 3 months and she's still pulling her hair out. I wasn't going to talk about the lack of sex but she brought it up and apologized. She said her problem isn't the lack of a sex drive/attraction but that she's just exhausted all the time. 

After we talked, I gave her a big hug, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex! woo! It's Columbus day today so we both are off and it happened again this morning, double woo!!

Some people had suggested I say we schedule some times to hang out which I was against, but my girlfriend suggested something very similar. Saturday night is now the night we make a point to have sex. It used to happen naturally a couple times a week, but with her new schedule that probably isn't going to happen. Saturday night is now our designated night to stay in and make dinner or go on a date with just the two of us and then go home and have sex haha.

So in conclusion, I'm going to take care of more of the housework so our weekends are less busy and we are going to make it a point to have sex at least once a week. We used to divide it pretty equally but I have a hell of a lot more free time during the week than she does. Also, communication communication, communication. I was thinking this was the beginning of the end, and after a few days and one honest conversation I think everything is going to be just fine. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Busted my ass last week to get all our housework/responsibilities taken care of before the weekend. Hung out and had a great weekend together. Discussed our situation Sunday night, we figured out a system that will work, and then we finally had sex! I'm going to shoulder more housework/random crap during the week so we can relax together on weekends. 

**Edit**: so I guess this post is locked so I'm sorry if I was unable to respond to you guys but I did read all the responses. Thank you for all the support I really didn't think this post would get so much attention!

To everyone who who just said congrats or gave further advice: thank you so much, your advice really helped me work this out. /r/relationships never fails me!

"I [33M] live a life away from people. My family keep insisting that I end it and come back.


About 8 years ago I decided that I don't want to live around people anymore. This isn't about something that happened or me thinking people are bad or other crazy thoughts, I just could never fit with people. I never had friends, but never felt like I needed them either. I think I might be somewhere in the autism spectrum but I don't have an official diagnosis. I'm cool and fine on my own.

I grew up in NYC and finally decided that the environment there is no good for me. I decided to move to a different state, buy some cheap land in a very small village and built a house for myself. The only people I interact with in person on a daily basis are the people at the market where I buy stuff and when something is delivered to me. To be honest, it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm much happier and more comfortable.

I have a lot of online friends. I'm a software engineer and make apps and games. I can work from the comfort of my own home and the living costs are so low that I have no stress about money. I've already made enough to last me 30 more years of living like this.

Now my family are the only people that I have some sort of emotional connection with. I have a more or less good relationship with all of them especially my younger sister who visits me quite often. The thing is, they all say they miss me. They want me to come back living in NYC, they say I should get out of my solitary life and start a family for myself. I can't do those things. And my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying.

I feel really bad when they're upset at me, it feels like everyone I know is upset so I must have done something wrong. I'm not good at communicating these feelings. I think they thinks I'm sad because I'm lonely but I'm not. It's by choice. 

First, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?

"UPDATE: I [19, M] was homeschooled, and think I am falling for my first real friend [20, M] at college.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53u1pj/i_19_m_was_homeschooled_and_think_i_am_falling/

Thank you all for your help and support with my first post. I had never had those types of conversations before. You all really helped me understand my feelings towards Gerad more clearly. 

I talked to Gerad the next day about my feelings. I told him first that I was confused about my sexuality. He was of course very awesome about this. His warmness with that helped me come out and admit my feelings for him. I told him that I had never had these kind of feelings for someone before, girl or guy, and that I was scared since he is my first major friend; I didn't want to hurt what we had. 

I know many people suggested that I not tell him the whole thing, but I saw a chance to get it all off of my chest, and I had to take it. He handled it well, and it didn't seem to have come as a surprise to him. He said that he didn't think it would be good for us at that point in our relationship, which did not feel great to hear, but was also a bit of a relief. He did hug me super close and tight. That was perfect. 

We did not talk about again until last Tuesday. Our school break has been the past week. I couldn't go home because of a hurricane and flooding, so I went with Gerad to him family's home. I am surprised my parents would let me stay at a friend's place over break, but they are busy with some flooding. I got to meet his family and friends, and we spent a lot of time alone together. He took me dancing Tuesday because I made him promise to get me out of my comfort zone. I had never been dancing before. He was extra flirty with me during the night, and we were very close all night. When we got back to his house he made a move and tried to sleep with me. This really freaked me out. 

I let him know that I had an amazing night, the best night of my life, but that I am totally not ready to have sex with anyone. Just the dancing and the kisses on the cheek we shared that night were the most intimate things I had ever done. He was really sorry for coming on so strong. I was worried that I ruined the night for him, but he assured me he still had a great night. We stayed up pretty late talking. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and let me know that we can go as slow as I need to. So, we are together now. I kissed him very quickly today, and it was the best thing ever. 

Also, everyone suggested that I look into therapy and I have had two appointments with a counselor at school. She is really helpful. Thank you for insisting on that. I think she will help me through some of my issues. 

I have not talked about this with my parents yet, and I don't plan to anytime soon. They will be cruel. I don't need that stress right now. 

TL/DR: I told my friend how I felt. We are dating now, which is wonderful. I am seeing a counselor at school.

"I think my [M29] tinder date [F34] stole one of my puppies...

"My [27F] mother [56F] wants me to take care of my grandma, who just had surgery. I'm recovering from my own surgery. We got into an argument and she sent an extremely hurtful text.


**NOTE: My mother and I usually get along well. However, she is probably the most passive-aggression person I've ever known and has a history of throwing me under the bus if it means helping someone else. She isn't a bad person, she's just not considerate of me sometimes. For example, my laptop which I use for work (graphic design) broke and I couldn't afford another one, and she knew that, and she knew I was struggling to save up for another; my uncle died and she took his new $1800 Macbook and gave it away to someone who just needed something basic for Facebook and job applications. Mom knows about laptops so it wasn't like she thought it was cheap.**


I had a mastectomy about two weeks ago (didn't actually have cancer, so chemo etc. isn't a factor in this). I'm still recovering and need to be taking it easy. Right now I'm trying to keep swelling at bay as I don't want yet another surgery and potential disfigurement, so I need to stay sedentary. I do go out for a couple of hours here and there, but I'm careful.

My grandma (66), who is my dad's mom and lives an hour away, had hand surgery today (repairing a trigger finger). My mother called me after and told me that my grandma needs help and needs someone to take care of her and basically do everything for her. My grandma is very independent, no signs of dementia or anything, and is an active person, so this was surprising to me and kind of came out of the blue. If I'd known recovery would be a big deal, I would've put surgery off until after she had recovered, but she decided to have it with almost no advance warning, and when I researched it to see if I did need to reschedule my surgery, it seemed like hers was pretty minor.

The problem is, Mom told me that she told my grandma I could take care of her (Mom and Dad work full-time, and I'm not working right now so I guess that was her logic, but I'm not working BECAUSE I JUST HAD SURGERY). I asked her why she would put me in that position and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I said she knows I'm recovering from my own surgery and she said I ""seemed fine""... I said I was, as long as I stayed home and kept ice on my chest and took it easy, and that she should've checked with me first. I pulled a childish move when she started berating me and hung up on her.

She texted me almost immediately and said, word for word: ""I guess Gram knows you better than I do! Maybe she thought you would ""feel pressured"" so didn't include you [in the group text] when asking for help. I didn't expect that at all!""

Needless to say I'm crushed. I would LOVE to take care of her, but I can't. Now I feel like everyone thinks I'm a selfish monster and am depressed to the point of feeling sick. I wrote back and told her not to talk to me right now, and I know she's going to call me when she gets out of work but I don't know what to say. :(
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I had a mastectomy two weeks ago and my grandma had a trigger finger repaired today. Mom told Gram I would take care of her. But I can't. I'm recovering from my own surgery. Mom sent a really mean text that crushed me and I don't know how to handle this.

 ---

UPDATE!!!!!

I just got off the phone with Gram!

She burst into laughter when I told her all the things Mom had said. Apparently Mom had been planning to ""surprise"" her with a $200 bidet because she was convinced Gram would have trouble cleaning herself. Gram said she found out about it accidentally and has been making fun of my mother since.

She said she doesn't need anything outside of opening fresh water bottles (she refuses to drink anything but Poland Springs) and said her neighbor already pre-loosened a bunch of them. Mom had talked to Gram's doctor and went worst-case-scenario, basically. Which is... typical, so I don't know why I didn't see that coming. Gram specifically said ""YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER. You know what she's like. Don't let her work you up. Jesus Christ, if I was going to have that much trouble I would've stayed in the goddamn hospital.""

She also said she didn't include me in the group text because I'm not a worrier and wouldn't be losing my shit wondering if she made it through surgery. She said she just updated Mom and my aunt (her daughter) and said she was fine, and that Mom was the one that went off about how she needed help. She also said ""for crying out loud, you just had surgery, you need to take care of yourself"" so she wasn't expecting me to help at all.

Gram said she'd love if we could talk more over the next few days since she'll be a little bored and asked if we could play Scrabble Online. All's good.

Now Gram and I have an inside joke about ""surprise bidets"" and I'm waiting for my mother to call in about an hour. I've gotten some awesome advice and really appreciate it; I have an idea of what to say now. (I don't want to ignore the call as that'll cause more problems. I KNOW she's going to call me, it's not a question lol)

"UPDATE: Boyfriend[23/M] has implied that he'd leave me[22/F] if I wouldn't stop playing my PS4...


Original post -- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57h7wl/boyfriend23m_has_implied_that_hed_leave_me22f_if/

We made up.

Not.

He came back home drunk at like 4AM, and I had a few things gathered together as I decided that I'm going to be staying at my parents for a while and sort things out like rent etc. Before I left for my parents he apologised in the morning at like 10AM (took the day off work because of it) , but didn't apologise for 'calling me out on my addiction.' And 'Just telling me to quit my boy habits'.

I was baffled and I asked what it is he want from this relationship (Because I was under the impression he wanted me to break up with him), and he said for me to listen to him and basically do what he says, so I told him I am listening to him, and that I didn't like what I was listening to. 

So I told him he was being sexist pig, made points of saying how often I play my PS4 and that he can use it more than me. I then rounded it up by telling him to go f*** himself and that we were done (not the most gracious thing to do, but it got the message across.) 

I'm sitting in my old bedroom receiving mixed text messages from, between ""I'm sorry baby please come back."" and ""Stop being such a b****"" You get the point reddit, I don't need that, nor deserve it. I'm a mixture of emotions, but hey -- At least I can romance MacCready or Danse on FO4. Haha.

TLDR; broke up with him, told him he was being a sexist pig and I'm at my parents, currently romancing MacCready/Danse on FO4 (Ha)."

"[Update] Me [25/F] with my Brother-in-Law [38 M], I think I want him delivering my baby


[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56jv1p/me_25f_with_my_brotherinlaw_38_m_i_think_i_want/) to the previous. 

So, I wanted to thank everyone for all of their help. I was really worried it would be awkward dropping trou for my husband's brother. It was awkward, but only for a second, and as you can now figure out, yes he's now my doctor. 

My BIL knew what Mike was going to ask him. Mike was not stealthy and asked that they talk alone. But, my BIL knew that when I got pregnant there was a chance he would be required to conduct my delivery as he works shifts like most surgeons and there was a chance I would be at that hospital and need his services as he performs many of the high-risk deliveries. 

Anyway, he went to the legal department and they confirmed that he could legally be my physician and because of the law, and the generalities of my case, he would be exempt from the treating family conditions. So, when Mike showed-up, BIL knew what he was going to ask. BIL, Mike and myself got together and discussed the situation and we talked about what would happen if things didn't ""work out"" with my pregnancy. 

I talked to Mike that night and we went back-and-forth. I think we know going in that this is risky, that I have a greater than average chance of losing the baby; but, if we don't go with BIL, he recommended another specialist more than two hours away. We still felt we'd be more comfortable with BIL and we called him, probably too late at night, and told him we'd really rather go with him. 

He booked me in for an appointment. Mike and I went and we went through all of the information. It came time and he did the exam (downstairs) and I was really impressed. He was quick, thorough but professional and incredibly gentle. I am used to my gyno doing demolition down there and was so surprised I didn't walk-out in any pain. I was embarrassed for a second, but he kept my mind on other things and by the time I realized I was still naked, it was all over. The weirdness was all on my end and it was actually not nearly as odd as I thought and I was really happy we were moving forward. 

BIL answered a million questions, always with a smile and made us feel... empowered. He let us make decisions and we talked about how we wanted the pregnancy to work. All-in-all, we both left the appointment feeling a lot better and more prepared.

I had a hard time getting a job just out of college, so I entered the workforce a year late and am beginning the third year of my career. I work for a non-profit and make about 27k a year. Obviously not a ton, but I feel my career has a lot of potential, and I love what I do. 

Dan got his associates degree in IT and entered the workforce at 20. He’s been working for nine years now and makes about 80k in the tech field. 

Lately a lot of our couple friends have been having their first and second children. Over dinner a few nights ago he remarked how “lucky” all of the women are to be able to be stay at home with their kids. I agreed that it they are fortunate to have the financial freedom to make that choice, but that personally I would hate to be a stay at home parent. He got a sad look on his face and said, “well, babe, we aren’t really going to have another option. You don’t make enough money to justify not staying home with the kids.” 

I was SHOCKED by this statement because I’ve always made it clear that I don’t ever want to be a stay at home parent. I worked as a nanny for a year after college, and although I adored the little girl, I was miserable spending all day every day watching Caiou and reading The Color Kittens 55 times in a row. Working as a caregiver reaffirmed my heart’s desire to someday have my own children, but made it even clearer that I would not be happy to make parenting my career. I LOVE what I do now and definitely would not prefer to be a caregiver 24/7 for the next 18 years.

My mom was a stay at home mom, and we’ve talked about the at home/working mom thing a lot. She hated “being stuck at home doing chores all day”, and, when I asked for her opinion, she said she thought I would feel the same way. (My real dad made her quit working when she had my little brother, because he hated doing anything domestic and also really wanted the status symbol of having a stay at home wife.)

I explained to Dan, again, why I don’t want to be a stay at home mom, but he shrugged and just kept saying that it wouldn’t make financial sense, and therefore wouldn’t be the best decision for the family. He says any “competent” nanny would be at least 50k (twice what I made as a nanny, BTW) and we would be essentially paying thousands out of his paycheck for me to have the “privilege” of working. 

We aren’t planning to have kids for several more years, at which time I fully expect to be making more money. I believe that it would be financially advantageous overall for me to stay in the workforce, which a lot of studies back up. 

I asked if he had a number in mind, if it would be “the best decision for the family” for me to stay in the workforce if I made 40k, or 50k, or 80k like him. He just rolled his eyes and accused me of only feeling this way because my mother does, which made me see red and flashes of a certain Gilmore Girls episode, but I kept my cool and kept trying to politely explain my reasoning. In the end I got so frustrated I went for a walk around the block to calm down, and when I got back (20 minutes later) he was asleep on the couch. 

Reddit, am I awful for making such a huge fuss about this? Dan has been cool to me since this came up, which I’m doubly frustrated by because I’ve always made my plans clear and he always told me to do whatever made me happy, and now he’s the one who changed his mind. Has anyone else resolved a similar situation?

Tl;dr: My fiance says I don't make enough money to justify not staying at home with our future kids, even though I very much want to stay in the workforce. Am I selfish for sticking to my guns about this?"

"My (25F) boyfriend (32M) is constantly forcing me to accept his ""help"" and then expecting gratitude. But I feel angry, not grateful.


I am having a constant helpful vs controlling problem with my boyfriend of 5 years. He will do things that seem REALLY NICE, but he does them knowing he is doing something I am explicitly opposed to. Then when I ask him to stop, please listen to me, please stop, he gets mad and says I'm ungrateful. 

I guess examples are helpful.

-I'll be getting on my bicycle to go somewhere, and he will offer me a ride. I will decline for whatever reason (I don't want to rely on a ride, I don't want to be stranded without my bike, I want the exercise, it is a lovely day and I want to ride, etc). And then we argue until I either give in or physically ride away from him to end the conversation. CONSTANTLY. 

-My brother came to visit after his birthday. My gift to him was a fun night out. I made it extremely clear that I was paying for the evening, because it was my gift to him to plan and finance a fun night. Then my boyfriend physically prevented me from paying, and made a big show of picking up the tab and repeatedly taking my bank card away from the bill and forcing it back in my hand. And then immediately did it again at breakfast the next day. Mad I didn't thank him, because I was busy trying to get him to STOP and NOT DO THAT. 

-He asked if I wanted a kitchen stand mixer. I said no, because I like the handheld one I have and I don't have room for a stand mixer in my studio apartment. He bought a really expensive one anyway, and it takes up half of my counter space. Still unused. 

-He asked if I would like to go to (vacation destination) for my birthday, and I said no, I would really rather have a low key day at home with my friends and I didn't want to have any vacation related expenses right now. He booked an extravagant vacation anyway, so I have to get time off work, appropriate clothes, pet sitter...

All of these things have the common theme of being really nice, but really unwanted and really fucking annoying. It's become such a pattern. I'm sure you can see how it sounds shitty to complain about ""My boyfriend picked up the tab at the bar, it made me really mad."" But I feel like it is controlling, and I feel like he just NEVER listens to what I want. We have had this conversation over and over and over, and it always comes back to ""I was just trying to be helpful.""

"I [24F] unfriended a few of my coworkers on Facebook. Now, one of them [36M] is furious and won’t stop bothering me asking about it


I’ve been working at my job for a bit over two years now, and while my coworkers say they’re my friends, we never talk outside the office, never hang out outside the office, and never socialize. 

Whenever I’ve suggested we get lunch or get together on the weekend, they’ve always said no or made up some excuse. They’ve actually physically hid from me to avoid talking to me about going to lunch and lied about me “forgetting” I had been invited to their “all-office” parties (I never have been).

Since my Facebook is personal, and it includes mostly updates about my personal life (selfies, posts with my fiancé, posts about things I’m going through), Ive begun the process of unfriending them, starting with the ones directly in my department.

I started the process after I went downstairs for lunch, but they tattled on me to my boss that my break was longer than 15 minutes.

A few days later, one of the coworkers noticed, and sent me about 50 messages over 24 hours, telling me, “YOU UNFRIENDED ME!” “WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME!” “HELLO!” “????” He did this to me on Facebook, via email, and via Slack. I’ve just been ignoring it.

This morning, I was in the middle of huge assignment, and he said, “I really need to talk to you” in a sarcastic tone and I told him I’m really busy. He kept insisting he doesn’t care and he cornered me until three of my bosses grabbed me to discuss something.

Basically, the question is, how do I deal with telling a coworker we’re simply not friends, and while many people keep their social networks open to non-friends, I don’t feel comfortable doing that?

TL;DR Unfriend coworker I never see outside of the office. He throws a hissy fit and keeps IMing me constantly for me to explain why, interrupting my work and getting nasty to me.

Update: He's become insubordinate to me. I technically have a higher rank than him, and he refused to send me his assignment when I was on call."

"Me [25M] and my girlfriend [25F]. She wants to go back to having protected sex (after years of unprotected) because she has a new job where she'll be out of town 5 days a week.


Me and my girlfriend Kim been together for 3 years. About 6 months in, we agreed to have unprotected sex from then on. It felt way better plus she was on birth control and we were both clean &amp; exclusive with each other.

Me and Kim met towards the end of college. After we graduated, we moved in together. I had a normal 9-5 job. She has a passion that she pursued (can't say what because it's very specific). She worked odd jobs here and there to pay her half of the bills, but otherwise worked her ass off to advance in the niche entertainment field that she's very passionate about. She recently got a job with the biggest company in her field. She's over the moon, this has been her goal her entire life. 

This job involves being on the road 4 or 5 days a week, working an extremely busy schedule, and being around her coworkers 24/7 when she's working. Again, I can't say what her job is, but she and everyone she'll be working with are all young, really good looking, and in excellent shape. They're gonna be around each other constantly and there's a HUGE hookup culture within the company. One of Kim's friends (who is in the field and aspires to work for that company one day) joked that it's basically one big orgy.

Kim doesn't start working there for another 3 or 4 weeks, but of course it's all she can talk about because she's so excited. Over the weekend she sat me down and said ""listen, we need to have a serious conversation. Straight up facts - I'm gonna out of town 5 days a week for the next 2-3 years. I would never cheat on you, and I know you would never cheat on me, but we both need to be smart. You need to start wearing condoms again. Again, I fully intend to be faithful but it's better safe than sorry. STDs are no joke. Plus I don't want an accidental pregnancy.""

I was just kind of stunned by this. I don't mind wearing a condom, that's not the problem AT ALL. It's just that after 2 and a half years of trusting each other &amp; not wearing one, she wants me to wear one because she's starting to work at this new job. And again, she's gonna be on the road 5 days a week with guys who are objectively really good looking. I didn't know how to respond to her so we dropped it for the time being but it needs to be addressed. We had sex this morning and I wore a condom to respect her wishes but I feel weird about it because of the implications of this. What do I do/say?

Just want to add that she's the perfect girl and we have NO problems otherwise in our relationship. Couldn't say a single bad thing about her, it's just this one issue.

"Me [22F] with my family who are giving me hell for dating a disabled person [22M].


This is between me and my parents.

I've had a friend who has cerebral palsy. He has movement and balance issues but other than that he's fine. We were friends for two years before he asked me out. I accepted and it was great and we started dating. I really like him. When we became physically close, he told me that he's a virgin and I'm gonna be his first. I found it so cute that he was just honest and open about it. I made his first time very special for him and he did surprisingly well, given his lack of experience and issues with movement! Anyway, we're going strong in our relationship.

So he introduced me to his family and they liked me very much. It was a great day. I loved his family. And I introduced him to my family and it was the opposite. My parents were very cold, didn't take him seriously at all. They were full of disapproval and made him feel he's not welcome.

After he left I talked to them and they told me they don't approve and ""I can do a lot better"". They told me why I am entangling myself with a disabled person when I can easily date a healthy person, as if his disability is the only definable characteristic that he has. We had a fight and left things unsolved.

I need to know what I need to do with my family, and how I'm going to apologize and make it up to my boyfriend. And in the long term how I can continue being with him without letting my family come between us.

My mother Peggy [67F] is ill and needs someone to take her in. I offered for her to come move near me, because I could get her on my insurance and pay for someone to be with her. I have a 'mother-in-law' suit above my garage so she would have her own space.

She refuses. She says she doesn't want to leave her friends. She doesn't want to leave her house. She wants me to leave my life to take care of her. I have declined and told her she will need to find alternative arrangements then [I have offered to help with a nurse to come help her in the day].

Now everyone in my family is telling me ""you need to sacrifice for Peggy, she is your mother."" Well, I am sorry, but at [32F] I don't want to give up the life I spent a decade building because she doesn't want to leave her home. I don't want to leave my home either.

I will be sure to post an update later this week after everything gets sorted out.  


Hey r/relationships!

I’ve posted here once or twice before and you guys really helped in providing me with some outside perspectives and unbiased advice, so I thought I’d post here before taking any action in my current situation.  Thanks in advance for anything you guys might have for me.


I started working for a new company back in February of this year.  I enjoy the job, nothing glamorous but it pays the bills (ha-ha, I’m an accountant, I make joke).  Anyway there is this guy, Craig, who has been way too friendly.  Craig is in his 50s, divorced, has 3 kids, rides a bike to work, wears the same 5 Family Guy shirts to work every week.  He’s a nice enough guy I guess, just kind of weird.  But hey, I like Family Guy so whatever.  For reference, Craig and I work in different departments but occasionally I have to ask him a question or interact with him in some way or another.


It started with Craig going out of his way to talk to me via our office instant messenger asking me about my personal life like what I did the past weekend, or have I tried this restaurant or that restaurant or whatever. I was kind of glad to have someone to talk to since I was new at this company and hadn’t made many friends yet, but I never told him too much personal info, and made sure to subtly mention that I had a boyfriend.  Either he didn’t get the hint, or he just ignored it.  He started telling me things like “you’re beautiful” and the usual creep-o line “Why don’t you smile more?” and things like that.  I was always polite but my responses would be things like “I know I am, thanks.” Or “Too much work to smile today.”  Anyway, he’s always saying this type of shit and nobody else really seems to be bothered by it.  The department I work in is all men except for me, so maybe they don’t realize how inappropriate Craig is being?  I don’t know.  I also don’t know if he acts this way with any of the other women in the office.


SO ON TO TODAY’S ISSUE.  I walked into work and on my way to my desk noticed someone brought in donuts for all of us.  I was in the break room, pondering my choices between maple bar and lemon filled (I went with the maple bar), and Craig walks in and starts his usual shtick “Good morning beautiful.”  I cheerfully replied “Good morning!  Can’t decide which donut I want.”  And this fuckin guy comes up behind me, rubs my back, and in a half-whispery kind of voice says “You deserve to have two.”  Now, I do not like being touched.  I don’t like hugs, I don’t really like to cuddle, I just don’t like it.  I especially don’t like being touched by older men that I don’t know and who were not invited to touch me.  I think Craig could sense that I was uncomfortable and he said “Oops, I totally just invaded your personal space.  My bad!” and then walks off.


I’m honestly kind of pissed off about the whole thing, because what a fucking douche bag, right?  I don’t need someone else to tell me I’m beautiful or tell me that I need to smile more, or any of that shit.  He could play it off as totally innocent and friendly, but it feels sinister to me.  He wouldn’t tell Bob from accounting “Good morning, handsome!”, so why would it be okay to say the exact same shit to me?  Why couldn’t he say to me “Hey, great job on that project you just finished.” Instead of constantly commenting on my looks?  It’s just gross.  I dread coming to work sometimes because I have to deal with this gross, misogynistic bullshit.  


I want to march into HR and let them know about my concerns, but I’m not sure what the aftermath would look like.  I don’t want him to get fired, I just want him to leave me alone.  Should I ask some other girls around the office if they have ever experienced this with Craig?  Should I go to HR at all?  What should I expect to happen when I do go to HR?  Has anybody else ever dealt with this, and what action did you take or not take?  Our HR rep is my direct supervisor, so we spend a considerable amount of time working together and we have a good relationship, if that matters.


Really any advice on what to say or what to expect would be so great.  I’m just not sure what to do right now.



**TLDR;  There is a dude at my office who keeps flirting with me and can’t take a hint.  He rubbed my back this morning, uninvited, and I’ve reached the end of my patience with this.  Should I go to HR and let them know what is going on?  And if I do make a complaint, what can I expect?**

"My sister's [26F] husband [34M] admitted to having feelings for me [26F]. Family get-togethers have gotten very uncomfortable.


My sister got married 4 years ago. Her husband, Dan, is not the best guy in my opinion. My parents aren't too fond of him, either. He's not abusive as far as we can tell, but he's just not a good guy. He's rude, he doesn't treat my sister with much respect. She's pregnant right now and he's constantly making ""jokes"" about how as soon as the kid is born he'll be heading to the bar every night, he won't change a single diaper, just call him when the kid is old enough to talk. Just super funny stuff, obviously.

Which isn't to say my sister is a helpless victim. She knew what he was like before she married him. And she listened to my parents, me, our brother, several friends all tell her that they didn't think it was for the best. Plus she's just such a pushover. She lets him do whatever the hell he wants and just goes with it. And they make horrible decisions. He cheated on her about a year in. So she cheated on him to get back at him. I honestly don't know what happened. My parents have one of the most respectable, loving relationships I've ever seen. And my brother and his wife are just amazing together. But I still love her. She's my twin sister. And outside of her relationship she's an amazing, smart, funny, insightful, beautiful woman.

But here's my problem. About 3 months ago, her husband admitted he was attracted to me and would pursue me if he wasn't married. He didn't tell me this, he told my sister. And of course she came bawling to me about it. Did she dump him? No, of course not. She decided she was fine with it since I would never sleep with him or anything. I told her I didn't support that decision, but whatever. She did it anyway.

In the last 3 months, every time I've seen him, it's incredibly fucking awkward. My sister and I live in the same apartment building, so that's pretty often. And our brother lives not far away, so we all get together with our SOs often. We want our sister there, and her husband is part of the deal, so he's always there, too. Plus we see our parents about once a month for dinner. My family is very close and always has been. About a month ago he got super drunk and started flirting with me very heavily. I shut it down and told my sister...her reaction consisted of scolding him and then dropping it. I just hate being in the same room as someone who is so despicable. 

I don't know what to do. I love my sister and don't want to cut her out of my life. But I can't deal with her husband. But if she comes somewhere, he comes, too. Uninviting him would drive her away, which I don't want. Does anyone have any advice that I'm missing here? I have no idea how to handle this.

"My (24F) boyfriend's (27M) crazy ex (29F) moved next door to us and won't leave us alone. It's affecting our relationship and I don't know what to do.


- A more accurate description of the situation can be found in my other posts, for reference -

Hey there. So my boyfriend (Chris) and I have been together for 2+ years. Everything is really great, besides this issue. Basically, his crazy ex stalked us and moved in next door to us and will not leave us alone. She's done it all - contacted us from 5 (or 6, I can't remember at this point) different phone numbers, violent threats, threats to break into our home and steal our dog, faked a pregnancy ... just batshit insane. We have a rather large and detailed Google doc that has every contact from her documented. She's reached out to Chris' friends, his mom, me, has threatened to sue and hurt us, it's crazy. So we filed a restraining order as soon as we could. 

We recently had our court date and it was granted, for obvious reasons. She is now claiming that the ""harassment"" (we haven't reached out to her once - she's sent me 300+ Facebook messages from a new profile because I blocked her other one) of us filing a restraining order against us has caused her to miscarry (she was never pregnant and is apparently addicted to drugs) and that she's going to sue us. Basically the whole thing is insane, I'm exhausted by having to constantly leave work early to file police reports from her violating the order and threatening us, not getting sleep because she has threatened to harm us, and just worrying about our safety and well being.

Chris has been pretty great throughout the whole ordeal. He feels awful because although it isn't his fault (he didn't prompt her or stay friends with her or anything), he's the one who dated her, not me. I'm having a really hard time with the whole situation because it's been really stressful. I've never dealt with anything like this - even though Chris dated her, he's the last person in the world I would expect to have a psycho ex. But she's relentless on tearing us apart and I hate to admit that it's kind of working.

Although it's unfair, I'm harboring a little resentment toward him. He's been extremely honest and upfront about everything - she's claimed he's cheated on me with her, that they were still hooking up when we were dating - and although he can't technically prove it's NOT true, I do believe him, especially because it's hard to take the word of a crazy person. But at the same time, she's put so many horrible thoughts into my head and caused so much drama, I can't help but get angry sometimes. Like when I walk out to my car to go to work in the morning and get screamed at - it's a bummer.

The police have been NO help, because even though she's violated the order more than once, they keep coming up with bull shit reasons to not arrest her, such as her having so many different numbers, we can't PROVE it's really her harassing us, and the fact that she's yelling at me from inside her house, doesn't mean she's yelling at me, but could just be ranting inside her house (even though she addressed me by name). He finally changed his number so it's gotten a little bit better, but she's still unstable and has been having other people contact us for her.

We're looking at moving, but I'm afraid that she's going to follow us to wherever we go next. I don't know what to do. I love him so much, but his ex hates me and has stated she wants me dead. I don't know what to do.

"I (27F) am 8 months pregnant and my fiancé (30M) just shoved me into a wall


I can't believe I'm writing this and feel pathetic that I even need to.

We've been together for 2.5 years and got engaged in the spring. I'm 8 months pregnant with his son and he just shoved me into a wall. 

Earlier in our relationship he was dealing with severe PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Because of his PTSD he would have angry outbursts. He would get set off by even the smallest thing and had a temper that was just nasty. A few times I saw a side of him that I really didn't recognize. His eyes would turn black and he would speak to me with what seemed like pure hatred. Never was he ever even close to physically harming me. I've seen him at what I thought was his angriest and never even slightly feared that he would lay a finger on me.

Regardless, I didn't want to be emotionally abused so I told him if he wanted our relationship to work he needed to see a therapist and a psychiatrist. He complied and within a few months he was like a new person. Emotionally stable, no more anger. I honestly forgot what that awful side of him looked like.

His meds started killing his libido though, so recently he talked to his psychiatrist and decided to reduce his dose. The doctor reduced it by A LOT, which I was apprehensive about, but I figured the doctor knows best.

It's been about a month since he reduced his dose and when I came home from work I just knew something was wrong because he had an awful attitude and just reeked of anger. I confronted him about his attitude and over the course of less than 5 minutes he called me a ""fat cunt"", ""bitch"", ""twat"", ""whore"" and it became pretty clear that he wAs drunk. I was trying to keep calm, but when he said ""fuck you"" in the most evil voice I've ever heard I snapped and threw my plastic cup of water down on the floor. It didn't hit him, it didn't leave a mark on the floor, it didn't break, but he claims he got splashed and therefore acted in self defense when he proceeded to chase me from behind and shove me face first into a wall. I wasn't hurt but it scared the crap out of me because immediately after I run into the bedroom and he chases me and takes off his shirt like he's preparing to beat the crap out of me. I'm sitting on the bed terrified and crying and he won't back off. He keeps getting in my face saying things like ""you think this is scary? I'll show you scary"" and ""next time I'll smash your fucking face into the mirror"".

He eventually left the room, got in his car, and drove away. I don't know where he is now or when he's coming back. I know I need to leave him but I don't know what to say to him when he comes back, which could be any second.

EDIT: I don't think this warrants calling 911. Even though he shoved me into the wall I'm not physically hurt so I don't know if the police would even be able to do anything. He also kept saying that ""I assaulted him"" by throwing my cup of water (which wasnt aimed anywhere near him and didn't touch him beside maybe a few drops of water). The only person I know who lives within 2 hours is his mom, and I'm actually debating calling her to tell her what's going.

UPDATE: Thank you so much to everyone who posted. The overwhelming consensus that this is a big deal made me realize that I was being naive in thinking otherwise. I haven't been able to make many replies, but I have read everything and some of your advice has really been life changing.

I ended up calling HIS mom since she is the only person I know nearby. She told me to come over there right away, so I did, and she actually ended up calling the cops on her own son. Seriously she is amazing and I am so thankful. They came to her house and I gave them a report and told them he was out driving drunk. They never found him or arrested him last night, but they do have the report on file now. 

I haven't spoken to him yet but know through his mother that he went back to our house to sleep it off last night. The next few weeks will be a mess and I'm embarrassed to tell my family and friends about this, but better for it to happen now than after our son is born.

Also: a couple people have asked if I have a daughter in the house because of something in my comment history. I don't. This is my first child. Before we knew the sex I referred to the baby as a girl just because I felt funny calling him ""it"".

TL;DR I'm 8 months pregnant and my fiancé just shoved me into a wall."

"Pregnant (f/29) and my boyfriend (m/27) and his family aren't compassionate to my morning sickness


I'm 11 weeks pregnant and like the title says, my boyfriend takes my morning sickness personally. I am nauseous all day and have been so exhausted I sleep most of the time I'm not at work. I finally got a prescription for the nausea and while it takes the edge of, it makes me incredibly drowsy and I still feel sick. In the last week, my nausea/drowsiness has caused me to miss 2 of his dinners with his family. The first time he sent me a text while he was at dinner asking if I hated his family. The second time, his mom said she thinks I don't like her and I'm avoiding dinners because of her.

I have explained my sickness to my boyfriend and he lives with me so he sees me unable to eat or my face after I've thrown up. I told him it has nothing to do with them and I personally think it's pretty inconsiderate and lacking compassion to make my sickness about them. I want to feel well again! They think I'm exaggerating or being too weak that I'm letting it control my life but it really is in control of my life right now. I've had some complications already with this pregnancy and stressing about their feelings and opinions of me makes me feel even worse. What do I do?

tl;dr: Boyfriend and his family are making my morning sickness about them and think I'm using it as an excuse to not be around them. It's not about them, I am so sick and don't know what to say or do about that."
"Me [28F] with my friend [26F] 5 years - walking on eggshells after having babies and getting sick of it


My friend ""Leigh"" and I had our kids very close together early this year, less than one month apart.  Both babies are totally healthy and growing like weeds.  I love being a mom and while I do look forward to going back to work eventually, for the most part I'm just enjoying myself puttering around the house and playing with my kid whilst on parental leave.

I have a million hobbies and I live for picking up new skills.  I speak 3 languages, go back to school every few years to further my career/enhance my skill sets and really enjoy creating stuff in general - I'm very driven and just like learning new things.  Several times in the past I've gotten weird comments like ""is there anything you *can't* do?"" (trust me, there's lots) so I'm very conscious of not bragging or showing off.  That being said, I do have albums on Facebook of my projects/art because I am proud of the things I make sometimes.  I do lots of creative stuff on the side even when I am working, so this extra time off has really given me the opportunity to work piecemeal on some larger projects (think sewing, painting etc - I'm like a low-rent Christine McConnell, haha).

My main problem is that Leigh, whose self-esteem is at like -9000 keeps comparing our lives/kids and has decided that mine is better and is vocally jealous.  Comments have escalated from fishing for compliments like ""I'm probably not going to be as good a mom as you"" to her straight up, repeatedly saying I make her feel inadequate.

She also fixates on how the kids compare to each other, going so far as calling her baby ""a monster"" ""shitty"" and ""garbage"" while mine is ""ideal"" and ""the smart one"" (ffs they're under 1 yr old, my baby is a happy lump that blows spit bubbles, smiles and gums on her hands.). Her husband also makes disparaging comments comparing the two kids but tries to play it off like a joke - she's not.

I have been supportive through all of this because I know how hard it really is.  Having a baby is less sunshine and rainbows than it is shitty diapers and sleep deprivation.  No matter how much I tried to reassure her, the comments weren't stopping so I took a firmer line and said straight up that she needed to stop saying things like that, that it's hard not to compare babies so close in age but it really wasn't productive and I was very uncomfortable with it.  She said she'd stop but of course that hasn't happened.

So now I feel like I can't talk to her about my kid without feeling guilty that she's comparing them, I can't talk to her about daily life without a comment of ""you're so much better than me""... I've just started to fade away and say I'm busy all the time.  Which isn't a lie, I have lots on my plate - but now the ""I had to go make other friends because I was going stir crazy since you're so buuuuuusy"" has started and I'm just so sick of all the guilt trips.

So what the heck do I do?  I turn down invitations to go to group hangout or classes because even being in public doesn't make her tone it down (at a drink &amp; paint nite she said ""why do I even bother, yours makes mine look like shit"" over and over to the point where other people started reassuring her).  The negativity and oh-poor-me attitude is just so draining and intensely uncomfortable, but I would feel bad about walking away from a friendship when she's clearly not having an easy time. 

TL;DR - I don't want to be friends with someone who consistently makes me feel bad about having a normal happy baby and a few hobbies outside of being a mom...  But our social group is pretty closely knit and I'd feel like a jerk for walking away when she's having a tough time."

EDIT2: Wow, I'm totally blown away by the variety and quality of advice I received today.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for taking the time out of your day.  I have realized a few things... 1) I have not been honest with myself about my tolerance for taking on 100% of the ""adulting"".   2) His denial of his lifelong ADD has made me not even realize that it was a possibility, and those of you suggesting it and describing it in adulthood are describing him exactly.

I think I am going to have to really think about how to approach the ADD thing so as not to trigger his complex about it, but be firm, give the ultimatum that it won't work without us taking action, that he needs to go to behavioral therapy and not necessarily medicate, perhaps we can both go, AND also needs to start spending a small percentage of time helping me with our finances.

THANK YOU! &lt;3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my husband, let me give you the disclaimer, is great at a lot of things and we work well together on most stuff.  He's extremely brilliant at building or fixing anything, or learning complex computer programs, or making people laugh, and a whole other litany of well rounded skills.

But when it comes to ""adulting"" - anything involving paying bills, doing paperwork, answering emails, even simply keeping his phone charged or opening his mail - he becomes a gibbering idiot.  

I sort of tolerated just taking over all of that stuff for the whole relationship because I'd rather just know the bills got paid, but I'm starting to feel like the line has been crossed and he shrugs me off so often with his usual flippant ""stop being a dick"" type of lines.  Calls me out for causing ""stress that isn't worth it"" and it kinda is starting to feel like either i'm getting mildly gaslighted or THIS REALLY ISNT OKAY....

The biggest incident, for example, sorry so long, but I want to make sure anyone interested actually knows its not just being late on a phone bill or whatever:

------------

In 2013 he was self employed for the first time, and we were living together.  I never noticed him doing his taxes when I was scrambling to do mine, but I'm not a hawk type of partner and can definitely be absent minded, so I shrugged it off.

Then in 2014 we got married and when i started doing our taxes i realized he had never done his 2013 taxes.  He had no idea that you didn't ""just get money back"". (I have been self employed at least part time since age 16, so I have zero understanding how someone can be in their mid 30s and so ignorant).   

Of course, he owed a ton of money and penalties to Oregon State at this point, so I told him, 
""hey, I'll do these taxes for you, I'll do all our taxes from now on.  I just need you to have ONE JOB.  You need to deal with the payment and admin for your late 2013 taxes.  Set up a payment plan and do it.""

Of course what ended up happening is although he set up the payment plan, I had to then set a google calendar alert to remind him to pay it.  I'd nag him, he'd make the payment, and I'd see a payment on the credit card I had gotten him under my name (because of course, his credit is in the toilet due to thinking that ignored problems just go away).

I even later paid 300 bucks to bail him out of bank jail so he could be added to my account SPECIFICALLY to set up auto payments for this tax debt, and me not have to remind him anymore.

Sort of all good, right?

Well suddenly last month, I see a letter to him from Oregon State tax board that looks not so fun, I open it and it's a legal order for a garnishment of nearly a thousand dollars.  He has 14 days to answer this letter.

I wave it in front of him, trying not to get upset, it must be a mistake.  He promises to deal with it.

Two weeks later a thousand dollars is taken out of my account.

""Oh, is there like, different places to pay?  Cause I just used a tax service and paid the feds..""

So he's been paying the feds the whole time and not the state that he owed money to, and now my account is empty, the feds have nearly a thousand dollars extra of ours, and nobody on the phone seemed to be able to ""access"" the info.

Husband is now back working on a music tour and I have had to nag him constantly to call as I desperately need to track down this $1000!!! I found a place for him to look into it online, but I couldn't sign up for him because I don't have his phone.  His phone wasn't charged so I had to call his road-mate to get ahold of him.

He then made fun of me for my stress levels and said he'd do it.
....
 
(oh, And this garnishment order got a $125 fee from wells fargo on top of it.

----------------

Reddit, I am literally waking up every morning fuming.  And his way of responding is to ridicule me.  Yes, he is a ridicule/jokey type of guy in general, but we have even gotten into fights about potentially having kids.. I've tried to tell him I can't have kids with someone I can't rely on like that.  That was the only time I got through to him and it seems to already have been deleted again thanks to being back on the road with the band.

Am I just a ""stressy nagger""!?!?!?!?
Am I crazy?

--------------

TL;DR: Husband can't even open mail much less pay bills or do anything responsible, and the consequences are starting to damage my life and make me want to leave.

EDIT: I want to clarify, because maybe it doesn't come through.. he does work and make money, and gives everything to me to put into the bank account. He's definitely not going out and spending irresponsibly on himself, like drinking or buying things.  **My beef with him is not that he's a dependent in terms of actual money, it's his utter mismanagement of his day-to-day.**"

"My (28F) fiance (28M) wants his ex's daughter as our flower girl (5F)


I know posts involving children can be controversial, but please hear me out.

My fiance, Corey, and I are getting married next June. We have been together two years, engaged for four months. When we met he had recently gotten out of a six year relationship, on and off. They were living together and also engaged. During one of their ""off"" times, his ex got pregnant by someone else. They called off the engagement and he moved out. They broke up for a while after that. Eventually they got back together, but they still called off the wedding and he never moved back in.  He would help out with her daughter, Nia, but Nia's father is fairly active in her life and Corey never thought he was the actual father. 

Corey does not keep in contact with Nia or her mother. In fact, I have only met the ex twice. I am familiar with Nia only because my son attends the same school as her. Nia was only two when Corey and her mom split. She knows Corey, but doesn't have a strong relationship with him. From what Corey has told me, he really only bonded with Nia when he would go to visit his ex. He did not support or provide for them. 

So, imagine my suprise when he told me last week he wanted Nia to be our flower girl. Conversation went something like this:

Me: ""I hope Destiney (my niece) comes out of her shell a bit before the wedding. She would be the cutest flower girl""

Corey: ""I thought Nia could be the flower girl""

Me: ""Your ex's daughter? Why would she be in our wedding?""

Corey: ""She has been a part of my life. It's my wedding too""

Me: ""I think thats weird. You didnt take care of her and you're not related. We have so many family members that could be a part of our wedding. We didn't even discuss inviting them""

Corey: ""I think its a kind gesture. I used to be engaged to ex. I have no ill feelings toward her or Nia. We have no reason to exclude them""

We went on and on about this. He has been in my nieces life since she was born and she is literally a part of our family. He also has nieces that he didn't suggest be a part of the ceremony. I have no problem with Nia. She is a beautiful little girl. I even told him we could invite them since he felt so strongly, but he really wants her to be the flower girl. I even thought for a minute that she may actually be his child and thats why he was so upset, but Nia is her fathers twin. 

I also thought that maybe he was just being left out of the planning, so I made sure to never make decisions without him and to have him do some planning as well. However, he was not interested in doing any of the actual leg work. 

I am totally blindsided by this. I honestly would be weirded out by the whole thing. Even if we had more than one flower girl, it would still be strange to have my husbands ex-girlfriends daughter in our wedding. I don't want to look back on pictures and be reminded of his past relationship.

Am I being insensitive? Am I minimizing the role he played in Nia's life?

***TL;DR: Fiance wants his ex-girlfriends daughter to be our flower girl even though he didn't raise her. 


EDIT: Corey loves children. He loves my son and has a good relationship with him. I have considered that he may be jealous of my son's relationship with his dad and that's maybe why he wants Nia in the wedding. My sons dad takes him to school daily and makes his lunch, he moved closer to me when I moved last year so he can continue to be actively involved and his family is also very a part of our sons life. Nia's dad lives out of state. I dont know exactly what their relationship is like, but I know he has other children that he lives with.

"My [27 F] brother's wife [33 F] is making uninformed choices and preaching about them and it's affecting my relationship with their family.


My brother married his wife, Amy, about 5 years ago. They have toddlers and live in my home state. I live across the country, so most of my interaction with them is on Facebook. I started cringing a bit when their son got the flu and Amy posted about how she gave him some essential oil and it cured him. I felt like that was indicative of a huge lack of understanding of how viral infections work, which shocked me coming from a college-educated person who is only a few years older than me. A bunch of her friends commented that they would totally use that next time their own children got sick. 


Since then, she has fanatically promoted charities that I know for fact are scams, posted The Onion articles accompanied by outraged captions, and offered terrible medical advice to anyone who posts about feeling under the weather. This week, she finally went all in and joined a pyramid scheme. She made a long post about how she ""finally made the leap to start a business"" etc and will now be embarking on a new journey in life selling exfoliants to her friends. It's too much. She obviously has the right to buy into whatever she wants, but it's incredibly hard to watch all of this unfold.


I feel like an asshole and I hate it. I have forgone visiting several times over the past few years to avoid interacting with her. I am genuinely worried that the next time I visit and she tries to get me to donate to her gofundme to get a dying child acupuncture or preaches to me about the healing power of some serum she sells I am going to lose it and explain to her that you can't just put a bunch of words together and make the thing true because you like it. 


To be clear, I have no issue with any of these practices themselves. My issue lies with doing zero unbiased research before throwing everything out the window and pontificating to everyone you know that this is the new thing everyone should embrace now because she said so, often in lieu of real medical care.


How do I handle this? I don't want to alienate myself from my brother's family but I can't talk to her and find it painful to watch her spread misinformation through her social circles and to her kids.
