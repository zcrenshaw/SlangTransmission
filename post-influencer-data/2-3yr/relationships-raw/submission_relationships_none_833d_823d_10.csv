"My (26m) girlfriend (24f) doesn't think she cheated on me because she had sex with another girl.

"Update: A girl (18/19?) from school asked me (18M) to go to an Halloween party with her. I'm short (5'4) and she is a head taller than me and I have no idea why she would randomly ask me out


[My original post:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58qbac/a_girl_1819_from_school_asked_me_18m_to_go_to_an/)
  
I (18M) took everyone's advice and gave her a call. We went to the Halloween party and had a great time. I was a construction worker which I know is lame but I had to throw something together at the last minute because I wasn't planning on going out anywhere. She was a ballerina. We had a great time and have been together ever since. Saturday was 8 months to the day of the day she asked me out.

She (18F) is 5'10 but honestly I forget about the height difference half the time when I am with her. She has never brought up my height in a negative way. I mean we both tease each other about the other's height but never in a bad way. She feels the same way about her height as I do. We are both freshman and are from the same city a few hours from here. 

All the advice and PM's from everyone was so great, I just wanted to come back and give an update. I feel so much better these days and I don't even care if people make cracks about my height. She is a great person and we have fun together. We went out on Saturday and she wore heels. She told me she hates wearing heels because of how guys reacted but she looked awesome and I told her so. She told me she was so nervous about asking me out she felt like throwing up. I told her it was a blur and I couldn't believe it happened. She has as much experience with guys as I did with girls (none) but I find that hard to believe though she says the same about me. We're enjoying being together and both of us are more confident from it. It's funny because neither of our roommates / friends believed either one of us when we said we had a date. We get along with each other's friend groups too which is nice. 

Thanks to everyone who helped!

TL;DR: I called her. We went to the Halloween party and had a blast and have been together ever since. Saturday was 8 months to the day since she gave me her number and asked me out. I have so much more confidence now.

EDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD!"

I've been with my husband for six years, married for two. We've previously discussed having children and it was always said we'd be happy with or without them. 

I'm starting to get to a point of wanting one... but I think he wouldn't be a great father. I know he'd love any child, but I honestly don't think he'd help parent. 

At times, he's incredibly childish, like he won't stop playing video games when I'm trying to have a serious talk with him. He'll pause for a minute, then start side eyeing the screen, then resume before the conversation is finished. 

He'd want to be a stay at home dad, but even if he did take care of a child all day, I know that he'd immediately turn the child over to me when I got home from work.

Children are difficult at the best of times, but I'm scared to do this and it go horribly. 


TLDR, how do I have a talk with my husband to decide if having a child with him would be a good decision or not? "

"Fiancee's [27/F] therapist has asked that I [26/M] take measures into my own hands. Not sure how I feel about this. Is this unprofessional?


My fiancee ""Lina"" constantly puts herself down, to the point where it can be tragic. Lina works at a bakery and is a very talented baker with a great company who really likes her. She's extremely good looking, she's fit, funny, smart, caring and talented. She's patient and easy going... but she hates herself. Because her father hates her. 

Lina is Hispanic and is darker than her siblings &amp; father and similar to what her mother looked like. Her mother died before I came along and her father raised her for the last few years of high school. The man is, to put it bluntly, a f*king d*ck. He likes me because I'm Caucasian and upper middle class. When I told him I wanted to marry his daughter, he apologized to me, and said ""free to a good home."" If Lina is visiting, he finds little flaws to nitpick. Despite being fit, he'll grab her stomach and say ""ohh, fatty."" He'll question whether she's showered and worst of all, comments on her skin tone. The rest of her family is very light skinned (you wouldn't necessarily know they were Hispanic) where as Lina looks a bit darker. But, who cares? She's gorgeous! Not to her father. 

Here's how things go on a daily basis. She gets up and leaves for work at about 5:30. She works until 3:00 and then comes home. She cooks an entire gourmet meal, has it ready for when I get home at around 6:30. I will study till 10:00 when we'll get into bed and cuddle/watch TV till 10:45 and then I fall asleep. ***If*** her father calls during the day: I come home and the gourmet meal is ""probably garbage"" and she's a fuck-up. She'll compulsively smell her hair and pits to make sure she doesn't offend at the table, then sits alone in the bedroom. I'll come to bed and she'll be as stiff as a rail, laying there not paying attention. She'll ""sleep"" (pace around) and then go to work. 

When we can get her mind off her father, she's fun-loving and such a total goofball. It's wild. I love those days, because it's just so fun and unguarded. We'll have passionate sex or just totally be free. 

Lina has been in therapy for 2+ years but it hasn't made a bit of difference. I even attended a few sessions at the request of the therapist. This weekend, we were at an outdoor event and Lina was having her fun-loving day. She was laughing and playing games and stuffing food into her face. Her therapist watched from a distance and made her way to me. When Lina went to the bathroom, she pulled me aside and very casually told me that I need to get her to go NC with her father. There was no other way. She said to find a way to do it and she'll manage the therapy side. She walked off and that was that. 

Thing is, she does need to go NC with her dad. She keeps in contact because it's her last vestige of her mom, whom she misses terribly. When we got engaged, she took a photo of the ring and tied it to a balloon and brought it to her grave so she could see. I feel bad helping author the break-up of her and her father, but I feel like it's ultimately the right thing to do.

On one hand, I get what's right. On the other, I feel like I'm overstepping my boundaries. If you all were in my position, would you do what the therapist asked and engineer an end to this?

"My [28/F] boyfriend [28/M] broke up with me in the most bizarre way


We've been solid for the past few months. He was the one who asked if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. We had some issues but always talked them out- he was nervous when I went overseas on vacation, has been paranoid about me cheating on him. He's been drinking a lot, and got a little obsessed with a video game, but otherwise was fine until a couple of weeks ago when his bag was stolen from his gym locker. It really hurt him, he was bummed out because he had a few sentimental items in it, and altogether it's always a violating experience to be robbed.

As per his request, I let him have his space to work it out, after comforting him/helping him do things like dropping him off at the DMV to replace his lost licence, etc. I felt a little alienated from him, but over the past week he seemed to get better, once his life was getting back to normal. I've been busy with school work, but we talked every day, hung out regularly.

This past Monday was my birthday, and he was great. He surprised me with a cake at my house, took me out for dinner yesterday, bought me three more surprise gifts. I felt close to him again, and it was wonderful. We live about an hour apart from each other and I'm in school/he works full time, so it was another couple of days until we saw each other. Last night, he went out with some friends like he usually does, I stayed in with a toothache and fell asleep early. The last text I got from him was him hanging out with buddies from work.

Today, we had plans for me to go to his place to do a goofy date where we celebrated his video game achievements, but he switched venues to mine at the last second because he had work done on his bathroom and he said he didn't want me to not have a place to shower. I was excited to see him regardless, so I said we could hang out at my place and have a cuddle night in.

He got there while I was on a run, and let himself in to hang out until I got there. When we went up to my room, he had put one of my surprise belated birthday gifts- a shirt- on top of a pile of clothes, played a little game where he asked me what was different about my room. I was really excited, and he asked me to try it on to see if it fit. After I kissed him to say thank you, he got a serious look on his face and said that he wanted to talk about something.

Out of nowhere, he said that he didn't think he could be in a relationship. We're lying on my bed at this point, I'm sweaty from my run and wearing the new shirt, completely shocked. He says that he's depressed, and that he thinks he's not over his ex- a woman who he's only described as crazy and abusive to me- she used to hit him. He talks about how he feels he's escaping into video games and drinking (which I agree with), and that he's just not happy. I immediately sit up and say that I understand- I'm hurt, but his feelings are valid and I care about him, so I listened to him vent for awhile longer, thinking about how to cope with the rest of the night.

He mentions that while he was out last night, he ran into an ex (not the one he said he was hung up on, the ""rebound""), and they started talking about why things didn't work out between them. He explained to me in detail what had happened between them- that she wanted a relationship and he didn't, and she had ended things. The detail is what got to me, the amount of thought he had put into it, how their conversation must have gone, how drunk he was...And it clicked that he probably had cheated on me. 

I knew he might, based on the heavy drinking he was doing- it felt like a time bomb until he did something destructive, and I had said as much. He started talking about all of the things he was paranoid about in our relationship, like the fact that I was still friends with my ex and his family on facebook, how he was afraid I would move away when I finished my degree, etc. He said that he wanted to cuddle with me, and that he was really hungover. He says he wishes I would hit him or get angry, and I recoil, saying I would never do that and I still cared about him, I wouldn't be angry over him not feeling like he could be in a relationship.

At this point I have no idea which end is up, aside from the fact that I didn't want him in my house anymore. We talk a little bit about the nature of break-ups, and I say I'd still be interested in being friends- which is true, he says passive-aggressively: ""until you get a new boyfriend"", I say ""yeah, or until you get a new girlfriend, that's usually how it goes"". I'm sitting up in the bed, trying to get him to move the conversation outside, and he is lying in my bed and just all over the place- talking about how he'll never meet anyone as good as me, how he's sorry, how he hasn't been good to me. I ask point blank if he cheated and he says no. He talks about the handmade gifts that were arriving soon for my birthday. I say that I'm not sure what he's doing, but I'm not interested in a boomerang relationship- my parents split up constantly as I was growing up, and it was always miserable for them both- and then I said if he had started with the issues he was having instead of saying he didn't want to be with me, it might have been a different story. I tell him I think it's best if he leaves, and he asks if we can watch a tv show that we've been watching together throughout the relationship- I say I don't think it's appropriate. I give him back a sweatshirt he left me, and we go downstairs. He says he feels like getting wasted or playing the video game, I don't say anything. He asks for a hug before he leaves, and I give him a quick, friendly one, and he stares at me for a long minute before he leaves.

I have been reeling from this. I was half-prepared for awhile now for something to happen, because of the way he was drinking, but he said he wanted to work on it, and I trusted him. The outpouring of emotions and blow hot, blow cold weirdness on his end made me feel shocked- and I still feel that way, eight hours later. I've told my friends, and my mom, I've been working on homework and doing chores, doing everything to keep my mind off of it. I blocked him on most social media. He texted me awhile ago, thanking me for being understanding, saying he felt like I knew what he was going through, apologizing for being unhappy. He says he wished he had more energy to put into being with me, and that I deserve better than him, and that he wishes he was as emotionally strong as I was. Then he said he wished the timing was perfect because I'm an amazing person.

He texted me again, saying that he still has some of my things, and he would bring them to me when my presents came in the mail so I wouldn't have to drive to pick them up. I told him no worries, that I enjoyed being with him, and that I hoped he found the happiness he was looking for. I then said we could meet up later on in the summer, that he was good to me, and that there's no bad blood on my end.

And there truly isn't, I've thought about it at length. We had a good relationship, I felt cared for, and I enjoyed spending the time that I did with him. This break up, though- his chaotic emotions, and strange behaviors- have really thrown me for a loop. I'm not sure whether he did drugs last night, or was still drunk, or cheated on me and felt guilty- maybe all three. But I just needed to get all of this out there instead of internalizing the weirdness, because I don't think there's any way to make sense of it, and dwelling on it isn't going to be productive. It's just so confusing because I haven't seen him act in such an unstable way before, and all of these issues must have been piling up for him for so long. 

So, that's my story. I'd like to start up a friendship with him after some time has passed, but I'm worried, based on his mental state, that it might not be healthy- I'd love some input on what to do next.

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all around for the wise words, helpful critiques and overall support. No contact has been implemented for the first 24 hour stretch, and I spent the day with two of my friends at the state fair, riding roller coasters and drinking lemonade and such (sometimes fun is the best mood reset button :)), who promised to come with me to get my stuff back when I'm ready in the next few weeks (I'm planning on waiting in the car). 

Coming back to see this was beyond heartwarming. I'll go through as many comments as I can before bed, and I hope that your days were as great as you helped mine to be &lt;3 "

So I've always been the least favourite child in my family. I was a below-to-average child and my sister was a goddam genius. Guess who was the pride of the family, woo-hoo!

But while I still felt that while there was blatant favouritism with my sister, I still enjoyed a semi-normal relationship with my parents. When I moved out, the transition was smooth and I never went back or asked for money.

We enjoyed semi-regular contact because we live in the same city and what have you. I thought we got along.

Then suddenly about 26ish days ago, they stopped answering my calls. I tried email, phones, mobiles, facebook, everything. They flat out ignore me, but I see my mother's constant activity and interactions with my sister and other extended members of my family.

I've tried asking uncles and aunts, and they just shrug and say 'ask them'. I called my sister, who asked my parents, and according to her they said that they're 'just busy'.

My sister found it weird that I didn't turn up to my aunt's large birthday party, and asked me why I wasn't there. It's because I wasn't invited and had no idea a party would be going on.

I went to their house, and while their car was in the driveway, their doors were locked and I couldn't see through the windows.

I'm honestly just thinking of giving up, but I keep wondering why they're doing this. There was no fight or reason that I could think of. I don't want to ask my sister to contact them for me again because I don't want her stressing out over this.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Parents (and possibly some members of my extended family) are ghosting me and excluding me from events. Is this normal? How do I deal with this?


[UPDATE: I called one of my aunts and she says she's having dinner with them tonight and will ask them directly. I have faith in her getting a proper answer because she's pushy.

My grandma said that they didn't even mention me, and another aunt says they haven't said anything about being mad at me at all. In fact, they were bragging about me a few weeks ago. So that's weird.]"

This is long but I'm at a complete loss and any advice would be incredibly helpful. But I do have to give a little background in order to express my situation appropriately:

When I was 7, my biological father (Jon) gave up his role as a father and passed them to my now step father (Carl) who instantly called me his daughter and took responsibility immediately, and he's been my dad ever since. He's a businessman and CEO of a company, and his family that I was adopted into has tremendous wealth, as well as tremendous dysfunction. My mother emotionally and verbally abused me from a kid until I was 22 (where I finally left and estranged myself from her by choice, for my mental health's sake), and Carl would avoid and ignore the abuse when it happened, even when I begged for help. Because of the chronic stress and anxiety I had throughout my childhood, I developed an autoimmune disease (I later found it was due to my completely depleted adrenal glands) and became very, very sick. It's taken four years of dedication and insanely hard work to get back to the healthy state I'm at now.

He's an on and off again addict to pills and alcohol, and used to be addicted to opiates but who knows at this stage if it's current. He got out of rehab last year and seemed to be so much better, happier, and I saw a genuine change in him when my fiancé and I visited him. We even sat down and he apologized for everything he had contributed to when I was a kid that he hadn't realized he'd done, and would do everything he could to make it up to me. It seemed to be going well this past year. 

I'm a circus artist training at a university that offers a bachelor's degree in circus arts. It's an absolute honor and dream of many (including me) to graduate and succeed through this school, and in our final year of training we get to showcase the act that we've been working on for the last three years to show to the public for the first time, and is a very well known event. It's a very, very big deal to me, and something I had been telling Carl about since 2015, and he's been saying how excited he was to be traveling here to see me perform. It's also a great chance to be able to support me. 

Last night, hours before his flight, he texts me last minute profusely apologizing about how he suddenly can't make it. He gave a list of excuses, one of them being that he has another tumor in his ear (something he had admitted to me last year was a lie, and had apologized for and blamed it on his lack of sobriety), another being ""work emergencies,"" and then an excuse about how the lease to his new apartment hasn't been signed/his agent is being difficult and he can't leave the country without doing it first (he's also moving in way too quickly with his new girlfriend). 

I reminded him that he had admitted to my fiancé and I that his ear tumors were not real, and said that unless I'm sitting in the doctor's office with him and hear it from his own mouth, to not insult my intelligence by bringing that up to me again. That's when he started deflecting, and suddenly saying that after thinking about what I had said, he's realizing that he just isn't cut out to be a father and needs to stop pretending to be someone he's not. He said it would be best if we stopped talking and that I only contact him if I need money, and that he only knows how to show he cares by financially supporting me. He also told me to not come visit him while I'm home next week (I have a flight booked for back home when my school holiday begins).

I reminded him that this is the worst possible thing someone could ever say to me, given that I've already been abandoned by Jon, yet Jon had chosen to continue being a father to my half sister Vicky. I told Carl that if he truly is about to do the same thing to me as Jon did, he better be sending these texts to my two other step/half sisters, otherwise he is doing the same EXACT thing that my dad did to me, and he is singling me out as I've always been throughout my life. His response to that was to twist my words around and say ""I refuse to read the rest of your texts after reading what you just wrote about how sad you were that Jess has to have me as a father. Please spare us both the pain and stop texting."" I told him to stop manipulating the situation in order to deflect and distract me from remembering that he completely fucked me over and broke my trust beyond repair. He keeps pretending that he hasn't read my texts and only says to contact him if I need money. I tried calling so many times because I refuse to deal with serious issues via text, but he blocked me each time. I'm at a complete loss.

I called my sister Jess, and she was shocked because apparently Carl had told her weeks ago that he was going to fly to Oregon to visit her on the same weekend he was supposed to be seeing my show. Jess also had no idea about the ear tumors. He was never planning on coming to Australia and he never had ear tumors, and I'm realizing now that he deliberately created that lie in order to manipulate me into feeling sorry for him, as I'm the ""empathetic"" sister and he knew it wouldn't work with Jess. 

When I was a kid, he convinced me that he was secretly in the CIA and I wasn't to tell a soul even through text, otherwise he could be sent to jail and they'll track him down. He went even further to try and convince me that a telescope he had bought was secretly a nuclear weapon that agents had sent to him to keep until further notice. It's been four years and it's still just sitting in his spare bedroom. He has a history of bipolar disorder so I'm assume that it's related to his illness. The terrifying part is that he is so incredibly convincing and such a good liar, I don't know what's true and what's not. I feel like an idiot for even buying into any of those stories when I was younger, but now I am just concerned. I can't tell if this ""ear tumor"" bullshit is part of his bipolarity, or if he's just a straight up fucking liar. 

I'm absolutely disgusted and heartbroken as he is the only family I have left. My mother's side of the family is just as abusive, so I refuse to let them back into my life. His family doesn't really speak to me unless I'm at a family gathering and I don't feel close enough to reach out to them about this, although I'm tempted to do it anyway since this is just absolutely insane. The only person I'm now in touch with is Carl's daughter/my step sister, who has also kept Carl at a distance because of how much he has hurt her too. 

I'm supposed to fly home next Sunday, but he told me not to go visit him. I just can't stop crying and am at a complete loss on how to handle this. I know I have to keep my distance, but I also am in a situation where I'm financially reliant on him due to being a full time student in a foreign country, and because of my health condition I haven't been able to work while juggling a full time training regimen at school. I HATE that I am financially dependent on him right now, and I vowed a long time ago to not have to be in this position once I'm hired into a company and find my feet after graduating, but that's the reality I'm in right now. It hurts so much to know that the only way he will respond is if I ask for money. I just want a dad. 


What do I even do right now? He's always had bipolar disorder, but no one ever knows to what extent since he is so good at masking it and being such a good liar, and saying how he's on medicine that keeps him in complete control. He has a history of manipulating and lying to everyone in his life, and I thought that would have gone away when he got sober, or at least he wouldn't dare do that to me after knowing what I've been through. I was very mistaken. You can't help someone who won't accept help, and I'm realizing that no matter what happens, I need to keep him at a distance from now on because I will never trust him again. But I just don't know how to handle this current situation at all... especially when my own father is acting like a child and refuses to even take my call or read a text. If anyone has any advice on how to move forward, it would be incredibly appreciated. I'm so sorry for rambling, but I'm at a loss and don't even know how to stoop to this level of dysfunction. And of course it's Father's Day today.

Edit 1: I saw a counselor. She encouraged me to try and book a flight for my fiancé to come home with me so I'm not alone. My fiancé wants to rip him a new asshole.

Edit 2: My grandmother just died. He told me via text, and continued to ignore my texts and calls. He also somehow canceled the card information I had and refuses to pay for my fiancé to come home with me. He wants to cut off any support when I come home and isolate me, and I see right through it. It's incredible to me how people reveal themselves while attempting to hide.

Edit 3: I tried to reach out to my uncle/his brother by sending a message saying I didn't know who else I felt I could turn to and was in tremendous pain. He ignored my message and immediately sent it to my step dad, who just said ""Keep complaining to my family about me and I will cut you off. Immediately. Stop this now."" I'm in a state of shock. Typical addict behavior of threatening me unless I obey. He has stooped to a new level of fucked up. 



tl;dr - My step father just told me he doesn't want to be a father to me anymore, and told me to only contact him for financial reasons.

I am an avid gardener. I take care of multiple gardens in my backyard and spent alot of time outside. I'm looking for some advice about this situation.

The neighbour's behind us (not sure if they're married) are pretty loud and obnoxious so I don't interact with them at all. They have two young children (6F, 8M ?)The husband (?) I noticed will come out when I'm outside and make it look like he is doing something even though the kids are inside and they don't have a garden to speak of. He has also started to take his shirt off and parade around the backyard (ugh.). Two of my gardens flank the fence we share and I notice he'll move to where ever I happen to be working. He is also constantly watching me even though he thinks it's not obvious.  I have no interest AT ALL. It's especially repulsive since he has two children with this woman and he is acting like this. Staying inside is not an option and talking to his wife would be fruitless ( she's extremely rude and jealous to begin with). I'm very close to just taping a sign to my face that says ""NOT INTERESTED."" 

I'm really not sure how to approach this. I go outside to be alone and relax and this is filling me with rage. He never tries to interact with me which makes it especially annoying because then I could just simply tell him to piss off."

 SO. I didn't get a crazy amount of attention on my last post but I still decided it deserved an update nonetheless. I'd like to thank you all for your comments, they really helped.

 First, I spoke to Burke that night. He came home from work and before he got too comfy I told him we needed to talk and then we sat down and spoke. I started by telling him about the start of mine and Trevors relationship because he didn't know how our friendship began. I then told him about how he confessed to being in love with me and how I have 0 feelings for him, I love Burke and only Burke and he's the man I'm going to marry.

 Burke didn't look too surprised. He said he had a feeling that something like this was going to happen because everytime Trevor, Burke and I are in the same general area Trevor always has this look on his face and seems annoyed and aggitated in general. He always assumed Trevor was salty about our relationship together. Apparently its common gossip around the workplace that ""Trevor wants a piece of Burkes woman""

 Burke also told me that he's kind of glad this happened in a way because part of him always worried that I had feelings for Trevor or was going to leave him for Trevor because Trevor is a bit closer to my age than he is.

 I messaged Trevor and told him that there was no ""choice"" and that I love Burke and I'm getting married to him next month. Trevor left me on ""read"" and removed me from FB almost immediately afterwards. I've seen him out in public a few times here and there but we never spoke, he wouldn't even look at me. 

 After about a week or two he texted me and told me that he's sorry things had to come to this, he was almost 100% certain that I still had feelings for him and that this was going to have a different ending. He told me he's kicking himself in the ass for dicking me around in the past and missing out on his chance with me, and told me if I changed my mind I know how to contact him. I never replied.

  I feel closer to my fiancee more than ever and we've both decided to try for a baby :) I've been thinking of asking Burke about starting a family for a while now but I wanted to wait until after the wedding so I wasn't trying to squeeze my pregnant belly into a wedding dress, and apparently he was having the same thoughts as I was.. I took my last BCP on Saturday and we've both been really busy putting in some last minute wedding plans and trying to make a baby.

 Thanks for your help Reddit! A piece of me still feels hollow because I just lost my best friend of 5 years and part of me wishes there was a different outcome, where I could have both my man and my bestie in my life and things could go back to the way they used to be but I know that's impossible. But I'll be okay in the end. I wish I could invite you all to the wedding but sadly we're already full. &lt;3

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Told my fiancee that my best friend confessed to being in love with me, my fiancee wasn't surprised because he had his suspicions all along. My best friend is on longer in my life, I'm upset about that but I'll be okay. I'm getting married in 3 weeks and my fiancee and I are also trying for a baby. "

"My [35F] SIL [25F] planned a birthday party for her kids on my daughter's [6F] birthday. Should I ask if we can make it my daughter's birthday too?


We have a tight knit family, at least on my husband's side, and have three cousins with birthdays within a week of each other: my daughter and her two cousins (siblings, 1 &amp; 3). A couple of years ago, the grandparents threw a joint birthday. Last year SIL didn't do anything because she was on bedrest, so only I threw a party.

This year, I had planned to ask if she wanted to do a joint party. The reason being that we have largely the same guest list and there are several family members who are elderly and it's kind of a big deal for them to travel (it's a pretty good drive). Before I had a chance to ask, though, I got an invite for her kids party. On my daughter's birthday. 

The way schedules line up this year, it's basically the only weekend we can celebrate her birthday (plus, that day is her *actual* birthday). We're faced with a situation where we're heading to a party where everyone we would've invited to *her* birthday party is going to be there. She knows it's *her* birthday. People are unquestionably going to be giving her gifts that day because they won't see her before then. But it's not her birthday party. She's singing happy birthday to someone else even though it's her birthday. Also, if we go to this party, we basically can't do a party for her because it's a weekend trip.

So what I'm thinking of doing is asking if we can make it a three way birthday. Frankly, it's the only thing that makes sense in a practical way because the alternative is staying home and eating cake and ice cream and having her question why her grandparents and all her cousins aren't there. I feel like they would also be offended if we didn't go (plus, I want to celebrate my niece/nephew's birthdays!) But the other part of me says this is such a major social faux pas that I'll never live it down. ""Hey, can we make this my daughter's birthday party too?"" just seems incredibly rude. 

What should I do?

"I [23M] unsure about the future with my fiance [23F] of 3 years [UPDATE]


[Original Post](https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6e26wc/i_23m_unsure_about_the_future_with_my_fiance_23f/)


I figured I'd do a bit of an update on my situation to vent a bit and hopefully help someone in a similar position where I was.
Thanks to everyone who posted in my original thread, got some solid advices there and the courage to do what's best for myself.

After posting I decided it was time to have another talk. I was mentally prepared for a breakup at that point. We talked about everything and told each other how we felt and what isn't right. We both decided to give it a shot, but I told her that I am not 100% and she told me to tell her once I have made up my mind.

The next few days I was fairly distant from her and she noticed that, asking me whether I had already made up my decision to break up. I still hadn't, but I was thinking about it all the time.

A few weeks later I felt like I had enough. Even though we both changed for the better, I just didn't feel the connection between us anymore. I wanted to be selfish at that time and did what was right in my opinion so I told her I want to split up.
I basically summarized it to her that it is not fair to keep her in relationship where I am so unsure about all my feelings and not being able to see us holding together for another 5 years. 

There were hurt feelings, ofcouse. She wasn't 100% agreeing on this decision either. But it had to be done. And now I feel a lot better about it - I have just moved to my own apartment and it's all going good. It's as if I can finally breathe on my own and do what I want when I want.

I have also taken advice about counceling and will be going to therapy to see why I may have changed so much during this relationship and whether my issues are related to anxiety or something totally else.

My advice is don't be in a relationship just for the status guys, you will just be prolonging the inevitable and make everyone feel way worse compared to the fact that you would've just ended it earlier. Or even worse, breaking up due to cheating. Be selfish, it's okay in situations like this.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: After original post had a discussion with my ex about us and our problems, decided to try anyways, ended the relationship a few weeks after that.

EDIT: WOW, thanks to everyone for support!! This is awesome, never expected something like this. Almost back home, I'll read through everything once there!"

"My [35F] sister [29F] is unemployed, living with me and wasting time and our parents money on a delusional career path. How do I tell her she needs to get her act together?


Hi Reddit Relationships! I want to start by saying I love my sister and my family but they've put me in a situation that straining out relationships. I'll provide some backstory. (names are changed)

My mother and father have been married for 39 years, they are amazing and supportive of all their children. I am the eldest at 35, my brother Ian is 32, my sister Ashley is 29. When I was 19 my grandmother passed away and left her house to my father who never planned to return because of a past trauma. I was given the house (legally it is my house in my name) with the agreement that I continue paying the mortgage and utility on my own, I've since finished paying it off and began remodeling. Around the time I was 24 my brother Ian moved in for a year to be closer to his job, during this time he payed rent and bought food and house supplies, it was a great year of bonding for us. He eventually moved in with his girlfriend (now wife).

So now I'm 35 living in this house and I get home one day to find Ashley unpacking in the extra room saying she was moving in. I got no notice of this, I talked to my parents about this and they said ""it's temporary while she's at college"". This flustered me because she has always been very anti-college and preaches that you don't need a degree to get a job, that it just puts you in more debt, blah blah blah. I tell them that I'm uncorfortable with this and they just brush it off saying ""Ian stayed I'd be rude not to help your sister"", the difference is that Ian is a sweetheart and Ashley is sour patch, but they agree to pay her rent and assure me it'll only be a year and I try to let it go. 

The issues started literally the next day because despite my house being closer to her school it's still to far for her and she doesn't have bus fare so she DEMANDED I take her to school. After her whining I gave in and did it only to find out its fashion school! My parent gave me the impression that she was doing something to turn her life around and finding a career, I have nothing again the fashion industry but it isn't a stable path for an unemployed nearly 30 year old woman. 

First month goes by and its bill time, I lay it out (I didn't including the remodeling fees because I didn't think was fair to charge her for it) and she flips her shit starts screaming and crying that how dare I ask for money then calls our parents and throws the phone at me and walks away. They explain that they can't afford to pay for both her college and her rent and that she's my sister and I should let it go. Not only is she living in my house, but she's eating my food (she can't by her own), and wasting my gas for this bullshit class. They now give me 200$ and month to cover gas. 

I know I must come off as a bad person trashing my sisters career path but I feel like she doesn't have a future in this and her grades reflect it. She is incredibly negative and rude to anyone who attempts to help her, this includes her former teacher who had her transferred to a different class after an incident that she won't tell me about. She's also incredibly racist and homophobic, there's many black gay men in her school who in her words are untalented and only there because ethnic and gay. I should mention that I am a lesbian and her language is beyond offensive, she won't hold back with, ni***rs this f*gs that, even when I have company over and my friend politely decline my invitations now. 

She regularly, almost daily has tantrums about how she's being discriminated against, and acts like she's more stressed than medical or law school students. She feels as though her clothing is better than the grades she's receiving, I'm not a fashion expert but I think the criticism she receives is more than fair. Her cloths are generic and look like anything you could pull of a rack at forever 21 which wouldn't be a bad thing if she didn't keep trying say it's high fashion and couture. She also thinks she is single handedly responsible for bringing back chokers, pink hair, braids, ect. 

Wow this has turned into a book, but wait there's more! Even though I don't agree with her career choice I've tried to help her with marketing by making accounts on Instagram, DePop, Etsy, and Facebook. She deleted every account once they got so much as a ""looks cheap"", then said that Gucci and Versace didn't get famous off social media. 

What do I do Reddit? What changes can be made? I don't mind her living with me but she shouldn't be able to buy her own food? Would it be rude to tell her I don't want her around when I have company? Am I just being overly judgmental?  

TL;DR: Parents moved my sister in for college, she doesn't pay for anything and eat my food, is going to a fashion college but is rude-racist-homophobic, doesn't accept help or criticism. I need to make house hold changes, how?

EDIT: I'll be making a contract this weekend with a deadline for her get her shit together. I'll also address my parents but separate. What should be added to the contract/converation? I'll be presenting it to her Sunday and I'll update how it goes. 

EDIT2: I posted this in the comments but it should also be added here. 

""I've since payed more in repairs to the house than what half of the original mortgage was. I was essentially kicked out at 19 and told I could live here and pay it or find somewhere else. 

Also my siblings got an actual inheritance, I did not, they also got 2 vintage well taken of cars amoung other things from her estate that add up to much more than half the house. 

My sister immediately spent all of this money on who knows what."""
"My mother [54F] isn't speaking to me [23F] after I realized I can't support us both and got accepted for an apartment for myself and my dog [6M].


**EDIT: I want to thank everyone who has posted so far and if anyone continues to post. I really appreciate all the kind words and congrats. It means a lot more than you guys can imagine.**

**EDIT #2: Just a few pointers. My parents had a great marriage to my sister and I's eyes. My father cut it off. My mother is TRYING to get a job, she has been for years but she just can't land one. Maybe its her fault idk. And my dog is in my post history since you guys are asking for a picture!**

I guess I'll try my best to keep this simple. 

My parents divorced in 2014 and unfortunately, my mom was unemployed in the process. 

My mom hasn't found a job since. She's slightly picky, semi-disabled (can't do labor jobs only admin work), and she's not young. 

She does have 30+ years experience in executive/administrative roles. 

EDIT: I offered to pay for her trip(s) &amp; buy her a car to move to Florida with her best friend who offered (we live in NYC) and she yelled at me and turned me down. 

So, when they divorced my mom and I got a place together. During the 2 years I was with her, even though I made good money, having to support both of us ended up racking up 20k in credit card debt and even while working 70 hours a week I couldn't handle all the bills plus trying not to ruin my credit. 

I was depressed, I was suicidal, I was trying so hard not to ruin myself, my relationship, my job, it was incredibly difficult. 

We ended up leaving the apartment (end of lease, good terms). 

Fast forward to 2016, we moved in to a bedroom in my grandmother's apartment rent free. Legally we shouldn't be here, and neither can my dog. 

NOTE: Grandmother is my father's mother so it's her mother in laws apartment. But my parents were together 40 years so my paternal grandmother views my mother as her own daughter. She actually doesn't speak much to my father/her son as he's a bit of a scumbag. I also have a little sister who's 19 and lives with my father. My mom loves my sister, we get along well. My sister and I are close. 

My mom only works a small temp job two days a week. 

I've been looking for a place and I told myself if my mother finds a full time job, she can come if she puts in her fair share of funds. I did take her to apartment showings for apartments that fit us and she always had a problem with something about it. It drove me insane. Especially if she wouldn't have a job, like I'm paying for rent. You can't tell me what to do with my damn apartment. 

So, I ended up getting an apartment for myself and my dog! Great location, close to my job, dog friendly, I'm so excited! My SO is also so proud of me. I move August 1. 

I'm also credit card debt free now. I've worked hard to get out of this. I've been going to weekly therapy, my SO and I are doing well, my dog is also very happy. 

I actually got accepted to the apartment last Sunday. My grandma was ecstatic, my SO almost cried, he's incredibly happy. I took my mom out with me to walk my dog and told her the news. She asked me the basic where/when questions followed by ""good for you.""

She hasn't spoken to me in a week and has been horribly passive aggressive. She will not acknowledge me unless I speak to her. She will be in such a good mood talking to my grandmother and sister but then to me, she gets monotone and uninterested. If I want to go out or something and I ask her to walk my dog before bed she says no. When she used to have no problem doing it before and loves him. What the flying fuck. I'm upset as hell now. What do I do?

TLDR; Got accepted for an apartment and moving in a month. Couldn't see myself supporting for my dependent mother any longer and risk my mental health and financial stability by racking up more credit card debt to support us both. I just got out of a 2 year bout of depression she caused by having me care for us both and finally paid off the 20k in credit cards I had while living with her and covering her expenses. She's being passive aggressive and won't speak to me now. Going on 7 days tomorrow. Don't know what do to. "
"Me [39 M] with my wife [35 F] of 17, don't agree on importance of alone time since birth of child


I know I’m biased and anyone reading this should know that too.  That said, I just want the input of a bunch of strangers to help me get a handle on this issue.  As I try to type this story I realize every detail warrants a caveat but I don’t know how to tell a story like that so if there’s any interest I’ll provide details upon request.

My wife of 17 years and I haven’t had any alone time/a date night since our child was born 2 years ago.  (I’m 39 and she’s 35).  For Christmas 2015 she actually bought me a movie theater gift certificate and a movie  themed  treat with a note saying we would go see a movie together.  When that didn’t happen by the end of January 2016 and I was showing signs of frustration she sent me to the movies to on my own.

Finally, earlier this year, we planned a movie night.  Her mom was on hand to watch our child and I thought she got off work at 5 PM but her schedule varies so I wasn’t sure.  To be fair, we didn’t plan ahead in great detail, we just agreed we’d go to dinner and see a movie.  Her mom showed up on time but the missus didn’t come home until after 6.  We both wanted to see the same movie and I’d found a perfect time at a favorite theater that also serves food but by the time she came home and spent a leisurely 30-60 minutes visiting with mom and toddler, we could only catch a late show after a fast food dinner.

I clarified that she did, in fact, get off work at 5 but spent another hour  talking to a co-worker (because they had to touch base – they don’t get to talk often)  and then doing a non-essential personal task that could have been done the night before or after.  To make matter worse, she got home from work so quickly the night before that I was really surprised to see her.  That night, when I asked her how she got home so fast,  she said, “Because I wanted to.”

So I was pissed.  And I’m not proud of the fact but I was angry and even swore at her.  She bluntly told me I could be angry and spoil our night or I could run with it and we could carry on.  The whole evening felt super perfunctory – just like she was taking me out to prevent a temper tantrum.  She even said as much.  And it’s true I have a history of complaining vociferously when plans change. I mean I’m not a wife beater or anything but I guess I can be childish if “I don’t get my way.”

I hate myself for this but I can’t let it go.  I'm trying to understand her commitments to work and our child and I really want to be supportive but it just pissed me off that on the one night in years we set aside for ourselves – I guess just for me – she couldn’t be bothered.  At least, that’s how I took it.

What can I do to make a future date nights positive instead of just being angry about the last one?  I feel like it’s reasonable to want time out alone together even though we have a small child but I have plenty of family and friends who don’t feel that way.  Am I being selfish?  I have a long history of holding on to petty details so, in general, any advice on not being an asshole would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I feel like my wife blew off a rare “date night” and I’m Having trouble letting go of my upset (if it’s even valid).  Part of me wants to play the “so who’s right?” card here but I mainly just want advice on how to move on and improve future circumstances.  

e: fixed typos, poor formatting, etc for clarity. 

EDIT2:  I never expected a response like this and I really want to thank you all for your thoughtful advice. It's been pretty overwhelming, and sometimes uncomfortable to read and think about but it's feels good and really helpful to see it discussed out of my head and get input from outside.  "

Hi r/relationships. I have a huge problem and I really need help. My first time posting here, English is not first language, and will take any advice given. Throwaway in case. Names have been changed and thank you for your time and help. 

Relationship background - 

I am 24/F and have been married to my husband ""Josh"" for 3 years now. We married early in our relationship because I had no where to stay or go. My immediate family cut me off when I was 18 when we all found out I was ill. I have a tumor that has not been responding to treatment. I have since developed even more health issues. Just typing this out makes me very sad. We have no kids but instead 2 amazing dogs, and I live together far, far away from my friends (over 3000 miles away). I lost my job 2 months ago but have a few thousands in savings to get me by while I am job hunting. Josh works full time. 

Relationship issues - 

Josh makes about 3x my salary. We split our bills accordingly, but I have always found myself covering for more food. I also do 90% of the chores. I buy food, cook the food, clean up. I clean the house, take care of our dogs, pay for our dogs... food, treats, toys, vet fees (they are not cheap). Those are the main things I do, and he is only in charge of vacuum (I am scared of vacuums, and if I weren't I'm sure I'd be in charge of that too) that he spends about an hour every other week doing. Even with our salary difference I have always thought of this arrangement as unfair. I have expressed wanting to cook together or clean together, or do anything together and he has refused. He comes home from work and spends time with his friends on the computer. Maybe twice a month he will come with me after begging to shopping or eating out. But he will complain and want to come home. 

Present situation - 

I am unhappy with so many things, especially myself. I am not the outgoing cheerful person who I used to be. I spend my free time lying around resting. I have so many doctor appointments, and that is the only time I leave the house (or if I am getting groceries). I have no friends or family. My health issues prevent me from doing a lot of things - I am tired so easily and cannot keep a consistent schedule. I have not eaten my preferred food in so many months. Josh does not like the food I eat, and I am far too lazy and tired to make separate meals, so I usually make him food and not eat anything for myself. Or I will end up eating cheap boxed food... I cannot even recognize myself in this body anymore. I cannot sleep or eat, anything I eat will not stay down, and I am constantly crying. 

I don't expect Josh to save me, but I cannot stay here any longer. I know I need to work on myself, but I do not have the time. Sometimes he will get mad at me and I am so scared. Once he threw a bottle at me, and my stomach was bruised for 2 weeks. Other times he has grabbed my wrists or ankles and dragged me across the room. If I make too much noise he will scream at me. I feel like a kid at times. I also believe he is interested in other people. Our sex life has taken a toll and I cannot remember the last time he has given me a hug or kiss. 

My questions now -  

Where do I go from here? I have tried therapy when my parents left me, which has helped greatly. But I moved away from my therapist, and the 3 different therapists here have not been as helpful. I do not have the funds to live by myself... my health costs are too expensive to even think about (around $11k-$15k a year) and I have no social support. I am trapped and unhappy. I don't like to put the blame on others, but I wish I had parents to fall back on. I wish I had some family who would reach out and help. I wish my husband would realize I am hurting and need his support so badly. I don't ask for much, I don't think I do. 

Is there any way to convince Josh that we need to work on our relationship? A divorce is one of the last things I would want, but I don't know if he will come around. Is there anything that I am doing wrong? Is there anything more I can do? 

What can I do for myself? I've purchased a few things to start going to the gym... I try so hard to get up every day and apply to at least 6 jobs before sundown. But I cannot help but feel like a robot at this point. Is this really what life is like after school? How can I be happy and enjoy what may be the last decades of my life with my health hanging over me? 

Please ask if I have left out any vital information. I will take ANY advice, I need help. Thank you so much again. 

TLDR: I am very sick and unhappy. I have no friends or family. I need to get my life together, but I can't seem to grasp the necessary steps. I need more options, and most importantly I want support. 

EDIT: Hi and thank you all for the responses. I have been reading them when I have a chance and have some questions. Sorry it will take a bit of time to respond. You guys are great.

Sorry this took so long to update, but because reasons the transplant process took a lot longer to happen than I thought. Long story short, because we had longer we were able to get our financial ducks in a row, save up more money to cover DH's time off work, and mobilize resources within our community and other family to help with childcare and other stuff and didn't need to ask for monetary help from the ILs. The transplant happened last month and was a complete success. DH is still not 100% recovered but doing well and getting back to work soon. 


Thanks everyone and don't forget to sign your donor cards!"
