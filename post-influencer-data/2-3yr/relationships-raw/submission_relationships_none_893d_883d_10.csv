"Me [26 M] with my GF of 3+ years [24 F] of 3+ years, will break-up with me if I'm in my best friends wedding.


I have been dating Sarah for 3 years, and we have talked about marriage, kids, etc. One of my best friends asked me to be in his wedding. I would absolutely say yes to him, but the problem is that I have slept with one of the bridesmaids or the maid of honor (I'm certain she'll be in the wedding) over a year prior to dating Sarah.


Sarah knows this, and is threatening to break off our relationship if I say yes to being a groomsmen, as she knows the bridesmaid and I would be in close proximity for the greater part of the weekend.  I really don't know what to do, and feel paralyzed by this ultimatum. I feel like I would be letting my friend down massively by not being in his wedding, but it comes at the price of my relationship.


Can someone with a little more emotional intelligence than myself offer any advice? I realize that I put myself in this situation, and take full accountability for my own actions - I wish I was never in this position, but that's life when you make poor decisions.


  **tl;dr**: Invited to be groomsmen in best friends wedding. Previously slept with a bridesmaid; current GF of 3+ years will break up with me if I say yes

**UPDATE**

I'm overwhelmed by the responses. My buddy asked me to be my best man today. Unfortunately, the other girl is the maid of honor and I will be walking up with her. I let my GF know, and I'm pretty much waiting for her to break up with me at this point. Thanks for all your words. Also to those asking if she's invited, she 100% would be but her ability to attend would depend upon if she has to work (her job doesn't allow much wiggle room for switching weekends/getting time off).

"UPDATE: My mom (50sF) won't tell me (23F) who my father is


(original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64ndrd/my_mom_50sf_wont_tell_me_23f_who_my_father_is/)

First, I want to thank everyone for their advice, especially those who shared their personal experiences. I didn't reply much, but I read every comment, and you all gave me a lot to think about. I truly appreciate it. As for the update...

I had a feeling that confronting my mom or threatening no-contact wouldn’t go over well, so I wanted it to be a last resort. So to start, I took one person's advice and decided to look around my childhood home for any clues.

I live in my hometown, so I drop by my mom’s house pretty regularly. A couple of days ago, while I was visiting, she ran to the store to pick up some things. It seemed like as good an opportunity as any.

Her bedroom seemed like the obvious choice, so I started there. I’m not proud of the snooping, but I did it anyway. Within ten minutes, I found something in a drawer by her bed: a driver’s license that expired in 1991, mixed in with a bunch of other papers.

It belonged to a man I didn’t recognize. His address was listed as our house—and as I mentioned in the original post, my mom had told me that my father lived in this house, at least for a while. I can’t know for sure that he’s my father just based on the presence of his driver’s license, but who else could he be? Why else would my mom keep that license?

So now I had a name and a date of birth. I also had the guy's next of kin (a sister), because there was some type of organ donor card attached to the back of the driver's license. It was a place to start, anyway.

Naturally, I tried looking him up on Facebook first. No luck so far. I haven't found any obituaries, so for now, I'm operating under the assumption that he's alive. I did find a record on the state department of corrections website that shows he was in prison at some point and was released in '97. (The full name matches, and so does the date of birth, so I'm pretty sure it's the same guy.) I don't know what he was in for, but apparently, you can formally request copies of records. I'm thinking about submitting a request. Beyond that, the logical next step will probably be to look for his sister.

So that's pretty much where I'm at. Even if I locate the mystery guy, I don't know if I'll ever contact him. I guess I just like the idea of it being an option. And if I do try to contact him someday, I'll probably come back here first, asking for more advice. ;)

Thanks again for all your help, everyone.

**TL;DR:** I snooped around my childhood home and found an old driver's license that I suspect belongs to my father. I haven't located him yet, but I did find out that he was in prison at one time, and I may request additional records. If I do find him someday, I don't know if I'll contact him."
"Update: My [29F] boyfriend of two years [38M] won't leave the apartment his husband died in. How do I convince him that this is no longer healthy and is stunting our relationship?


[Here's my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65xn4x/my_29f_boyfriend_of_two_years_38m_wont_leave_the/)

_______________

I took a day to come to terms with all the realities you fantastic group of people helped me see and sat down with Matthew last night. I told him, first and most importantly, that I loved him and that I wanted him to be happy and healthy and taken care of. We talked for a while about how his therapy has been going and he agreed that he needed more, and that it would be beneficial for us to go together. He also came to the conclusion himself that he needed to move out of the apartment and had been putting off doing so because he hadn't been ready to let go of Hei yet, but that I had helped him move forward and that he was ready to build a life with me.

We're going to see a therapist together starting next week and he's ready to look at apartments when his lease is up in August. We talked vaguely about marriage once I'm finished with my degree and he reiterated that he was in love with me because of me, not because Hei is gone and he's lonely. 

I just want to thank this community for the tremendous amount of compassion I was shown with my original post. I believe that we're on the right track to make healthy choices for ourselves and our relationship, and this sounding board is a large part of the reason why. Thank you again. Love and light to all of you.

tl;dr My boyfriend of two years is ready to move forward with his life, and is seeking counseling and looking at new apartments for us to share together. All was well.

Ugh this is going to be long so I apologize in advance. I have gotten myself into a HUGE mess with this guy and I don't even know where to begin to describe the shit-show. We've been together for a year now and it's been an awful year full of pain, lies, gaslighting, and emotional/financial abuse on his end. The problems started about a month in, he was wonderful at first like they all are but then I started to see the red flags popping up. Bad temper, flirting with other women, criticizing me left &amp; right, yelling at me, raging. He was addicted to porn, looking at pics &amp; videos all the time no matter where we were. I even caught him looking ta porn while we were visiting my parents once. I don't forbid porn at all, I just asked him to keep it private and not look at it right in front of me or out in the open. He was also a member of all kinds of porn and dirty adult chat groups on social media. He would flirt openly right in front of me as well, with all his female friends and any cute girl he talked to. His best friend is his ex and he tells her he loves her, calls her babe, tries to convince her to leave her husband, but then tells me I have nothing to worry about. Whenever I would try to voice my concerns about these things, he would blow up and call me insecure, too sensitive, jealous, a prude, etc. Every discussion would devolve into him yelling at me for having feelings and me apologizing for talking about them. 

Every instinct was screaming at me to get out, but I stupidly stayed, partially because he managed to convince me that I was just mentally ill, any issues I had were solely my own, and I needed to work on myself if I didn't want to feel sad and hurt all the time. So I put up with the excessive porn, the flirting, catching him talking to other women on social media, and a bunch of other BS that I can't even begin to list here. I swallowed my feelings and told myself they were just a manifestation of my ""mental illness"". I have cried more in the past year than I have in my entire life and I am a shell of the strong, confident woman I used to be. I'm so angry at myself for letting things get this bad. He's never hit me, but he gets up in my face and shouts, and once when I caught him talking to an ex and being secretive about it, he slammed on the brakes in the middle of the highway and threw his phone in  my direction screaming ""Here! This is what you want, take it!!!"" He makes ""jokes"" about how he almost bought the supplies to kill his exes and he always says stuff like ""I know you won't ever leave me, you love me too much plus anyone you dated after me would suffer"". He tracked my phone for months as well, illegally by using police software. He talks shit about my friends, my family, makes fun of my middle school-aged sister's appearance, etc. Every time I hear his car pull up outside my stomach drops and the anxiety starts up. There's just so much to tell about what a nightmare this relationship is, but you get the idea. 

I know this is abuse, no one needs to tell me. Even though he's not horrible all the time, I've been reading dozens of books on abuse over the past couple months and I KNOW this guy is dangerous and I need to leave before it escalates into physical abuse.

Problem is- I have no idea how to leave. I am terrified of him. We live together(lease is in my name, thank god), and about 4-5 months ago he asked me to marry him and I said yes cause I was too scared to say no. We combined our phone plans and finances(stupid stupid stupid I know) and I shut down my bank account. He spends so damn much money though that I can't manage to save anything. I did open my own account last week with the help of my best friend, who also helped me get a new phone that's not on my SO's plan with a number he doesn't have. I rerouted my direct deposit to my new account, and it should hit this friday so I'll at least have some money that he can't touch.

That said, when he doesn't see my paycheck in our account he's going to know that something is up and I am so, *so* scared. He's going to flip out and the shit is going to hit the fan. I'm almost crying just thinking of how angry he's going to be. He has screamed at me red-faced with spittle flying over much smaller things than this. He thinks everything is fine with us and I'm happy, probably because I just stopped talking about the things that bother me a while ago so he would stop getting mad, so the breakup is going to come as a complete surprise. I don't plan to be alone with him when it happens, but he has a key to the apartment and I'm afraid he's going to come back and trash the place and/or hurt my pets. 

I have told my friends what's going on along with a few coworkers, so I do have plenty of support. He is pretty much nuts though so I have a bad feeling he won't just let me leave him quietly. Should I lay it all out and tell him exactly why I'm leaving or should I just be out of the house and send him a breakup text? I'm so lost. Someone please tell me everything is going to be okay and I'm going to get out of this in one piece. 

TL;DR- Relationship of one year has been miserable the whole time. Dude is a possible psychopath. I'm planning to leave, I have almost everything in order to do so, but I'm terrified of his reaction. Please advise :(

**EDIT: WOW!!! I am simply blown away by all these responses. People talk a lot of shit about reddit and about this sub in particular, but you guys are seriously amazing. I'm near tears from the outpouring of support I've received here. Thank you all so much, I'll be following your advice and I will post an update when all is said and done!**"

"As a non-med school student, I [M27] am having trouble attending my GF's [F24] med school social events because all they talk about (understandably) is med school and each other


My GF of 6 years is a med school student, living about an hour away from me. I am currently working full time as an engineer. I see her most weekends and usually once during the week. I’d say we have a very strong relationship.

She is very close to her classmates because they spend all of their time in class, studying, and living together, not to mention the “shared hardship” thing of being in med school. Med school is pretty consuming, so when they hang out together socially that’s all they talk about – their classes and each other. Their conversations are either a flurry of acronyms and medical terms that I don’t understand, or gossip about people that I don’t know. The only way I can participate is to ask questions that everybody else already knows the answer to- like “What is a reticulocyte?” or “Who is “George”?”. Conversations tend to be on the larger side with 6+ participants, so any question I ask often ends up feeling like an interjection or a non-sequitur – quickly answered by somebody before the conversation moves on. 

On top of that, med students have a tendency to date each other, so there aren’t often other SO’s in the same situation. I’m usually the only non-med student. 

I have talked to her about this. Her thoughts are that she doesn’t want us to have two separate lives. That if I’m a part of her life, then I need to hang out with her friends too. “Like are you just never going to go to any of my med school/doctor functions because you’ll think it’s awkward?”

She’s been in med school for two years, and I’ve attended 100% of the events that she’s asked me to with zero complaint (overt or otherwise). I want to be a part of her life. I don’t have a problem attending events with something to do (watch a movie, go on a hike, etc.), ones with other non-med students, or smaller ones without a “group dynamic”. The events that are the hardest are those that meet all of the following criteria- (1) centered around drinking (I don’t drink), (2) no other non-med school students, and (3) 5+ people that all know each other very, very well. 

I’d like to get reddit’s input on whether or not I am being reasonable, and any advice for these situations. Thanks!

**Tl;dr**: My GF’s med school friends only talk about med school and other med students, and I (as a non-med student) am having trouble interacting with them socially.

"I [25M] was saved by an older man [50m] and have lived with him for years. Now I think I want out.


I will try to keep this as short and sweet as possible.

I came out to my parents as gay while still living with them. I live in a large city on the West Coast that widely accepts the LGBT community, but my mother and father wanted nothing to do with me. They screamed at me, belittled me, and my father beat me up. They kicked me out of the house and so I crashed with friends for a while before eventually hitting the streets.

That's when I met ""Randall."" He was 45 at the time, wore a suit, salt-and-pepper beard, decent shape. Looked like a total dad. He approached me and asked if I've eaten anything in a while. I know I looked awful - I weighted 130lbs and my clothes were torn. I told him I didn't - so he took me to a burger joint and we ate. Randall was extremely handsome, but also very kind. He seemed genuinely interested in me, my goals, past, etc. I explained to him that my family kicked me out and that I had been homeless for months. He told me that I could come crash at his place and shower up if I needed to. This was pretty much a clear sign to me that he wanted to have sex, so I politely declined and thanked him for the meal. Randall explained he wasn't looking for sex or obligations but he sincerely wanted to help out.

So I left with him. I could tell from the house he was living in (and the neighborhood) that Randall was very well off. I showered up, and ended up staying the night at his house (in my own bed).

1 night turned into 1 week, 1 week turned into 1 month, 1 month turned into 1 year, and 1 year turned into... well... I'm still here. Randall helped me out more than anyone will ever know, but also explained that he wasn't a sugar daddy and I should be getting a job. So I did. I got a retail job and actually really started enjoying it. I then started community college (which Randall helped me with) and started seeing a future for myself again. If you're wondering, my parents never contacted me. It seriously hurt me, but I found such kindness with Randall that it helped ease many things.

Fast forward to today, I've had sexual relations with Randall, and I feel like we're somewhat of a couple. We do everything together a normal couple would: grocery shopping, hiking, the movies, foot massages (aww yiss), and laundry. I feel like I am attracted to him, but the age difference is just so massive that I feel like the social stigma really puts me in a bind. This has also been my first ""real"" relationship. I feel like I'm settling down, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that - especially when I am with someone who is so much older. On top of that - I am wondering if I am somehow messed up mentally, that I'm almost being held captive by my own issues.

I'm torn. Randall has been the nicest person I have ever met, and I would hate to let that go, but on the other hand I feel like I have put myself in this 'trapped' situation. Older/Younger relationships aren't THAT uncommon in the gay community, I just didn't think I'd be in one. I know he'd let me go if I said I was ready, but I'm confused on what to do or where to go from here. I'm not expecting anyone to make a decision, but encouragement and words of advice would be wonderful.

"My [27F] boyfriend [28M] of 3 years is socially unaware and I'm feeling very isolated after our move.


I have been dating my boyfriend (hereby known as BF) for about three years. We met through a mutual hiking / outdoor / climbing club while I was in graduate school. We hit it off really well. We liked the same books, the same movies, and we shared a love of travel and outdoor activities. He's very smart and I really enjoyed discussing just about everything that I could think of with him. When I graduated, we decided to move in together. We had a very happy honeymoon phase for a while and then things started to go down hill. 

To paint a stereotyped picture of myself, I am the female Chris Traegar from Parks and Rec. I love to be outside, I love to be constantly doing things, I love, love, love to interact with people. I work in very people oriented fields and I'm still ready to hit the ground running when I get home. Superlatives that I have won in my life include ""most likely to literally kill you with kindness"" and ""most likely to put the energizer bunny out of work."" So, I acknowledge that I have my flaws and can be intense. Human interaction and physical activity are very important to me. I do require some alone time, but I'm pretty happy with only 1-2 hours alone per week. 

BF, by contrast, is introverted. He is also fairly socially awkward. The extent of this I didn't totally realize in graduate school because I had my new relationship blinders on and truthfully, I was trying to cram 80 hours of activities into my week - so I didn't notice a lot of things. My problem isn't so much that he is introverted or awkward (which are absolutely separate things) but rather how he treats my friends, my family, new acquaintances, and me as a result. This was something that was medium-aggravating when we first moved in together but it became a major problem when we moved to a new city - his home town - about a year ago. 

BF has frequently expressed that he dislikes my friends. I can't really identify a pattern because he feels this way about male friends, female friends, friends that are older than us, friends that are younger than us, you get the picture. Generally, he says they are: (1) talking down to him, (2) full of bullshit, or (3) are trying to hard to impress others. From my perspective, I have only noticed one particular friend being condescending and I called that friend on it on the spot. To BF, there is something wrong, weird, or off about seemingly every person he meets.  He particularly dislikes one friend (male friend, married to another close friend of mine) that  I made in college who happens to live where we just moved. This is particularly frustrating for me because I was excited to have two good friends in the area. BF is also an asshole towards this friend but gets very angry when I point out that he is being condescending, talking over said friend, and stuff like that. He will actually say ""you're acting like FRIEND'S NAME"" as a derogatory statement if he doesn't like something I am saying or doing. 

BF rarely meets with friends of his own since moving. He might go out once or twice a month. On the rare occasion that I am invited, I am left out of the conversation. He'll interrupt me, talk over me, and make fun of what I say or switch the topic back to something he and his friend(s) have in common that I cannot really talk about in any detail. I feel frustrated because I go out of the way to introduce him to my friends, my acquaintances, and include him in activities where we can both meet new people. I also try ridiculously hard to make sure he is included in the conversation even if I am meeting with a friend I haven't seen in six years. He doesn't do the same, even though I point it out. A couple of his friends have made efforts to make me feel included, which I truly appreciate, but BF will steer conversations back in directions that I cannot totally follow. 

When I bring BF on outings to try to meet people, he picks a fight. Every. Time. Not with the other people, just with me on the way there. It could be because the laundry wasn't done or I left a single fork in the sink - whatever. But the result is, I feel two inches tall by the time we get to wherever we're going, if we even get there. 

I've also tried to go out to meet with current friends alone. BF will complain that I'm abandoning him and excluding him. For example, a female friend group of mine goes hiking about once a month. We also sometimes have a secondary ""boyfriends / partners too"" hike. He always finds a reason not to go to the ""everyone is invited"" outing but gets really upset when I want to leave to go out with my female friends. 

We fight all the time now and it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough. When we started dating he was very free spirited and all about equality in relationships but recently I feel pressured to take on a very traditional (think 1950s) role. I can cook a bad-ass dinner but it won't matter because I somehow missed a fork in the sink. I've tried bringing up numerous times that while I'm happy to chip in and do my part - or slightly more than my part (I love cooking), it's not my responsibility to clean the entire house. This turns into an argument about ""well I make more money than you.""

We don't really have engaging discussions anymore. There are a handful of topics that he hyper-obsesses over and repeats like Adele's Hello on the radio. The information doesn't change and sometimes it just feels like he's looking to fight with me. 

Finally, he never misses an opportunity to talk about how my parent's divorce has ruined my family beyond repair. I literally cannot talk about a single negative thing happening at home (I'm the oldest in a large, large family). It's hard because I enjoy sharing about the good things happening but I feel like I can't talk to him about anything negative happening in my life. 

So r/relationships, do you have any advice? I love him but I also am aware that we can't move forward if things don't change. How can I tactfully discuss this with BF? Do you have any similar stories or words of wisdom? Thanks! 


Also, there is a stinkbug flying around my bedroom. I  wanted to share that with someone.  It has now landed on my bed and my dog is looking at it like he found God. 
  
  ---   
 TL;DR: BF finds something wrong with almost every friend of mine that he meets. BF rarely invites me out with his friends and when he does, I have to actively fight to be a part of the conversation / to participate. I feel very excluded. He gets jealous when I go out with my female friends &amp; seems to sabotage any attempt to go out to make new friends together. I'm not sure if he's socially unaware or an asshole. How do I tell? If it's lack of awareness, how do I address this?"

"My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of 1 year is obsessed with photography, and it's killing me


I've been dating this girl (let's call her Jamie) for just over a year now. Everything is great - we have matching sex drives, are both studying the same thing at school, and have a lot of other things in common. I’m quite inexperienced though – she’s my first romantic and sexual partner (while she’s had a few boyfriends and partners before me).

I really love this girl. She’s sweet, smart, kind, caring, and absolutely beautiful. However, she shows a lot of signs of anxiety, particularly having to do with photographing and recording a huge majority of her life. 

As an example, not long ago I was out with her family for Easter dinner and her birthday and the entire day she wouldn’t stop taking photos and asking other people to pose and take photos which got on almost everybody’s nerves, including mine. A few months ago, she came and stayed with me in my hometown, and the whole time she was pestering me about photos – I brought her out to a nice quiet area by the ocean and she kept yelling at me to hold poses and take photos of her which drove me insane – I couldn’t wait for her to leave. Her father is exactly like her too, constantly obsessing over photographs and making sure that they’re properly stored and safeguarded. She may have picked up this behavior from him.

Jamie is totally obsessed with photography. Shortly after I started dating her (about a few weeks in), she slowly started to reveal this behavior. I thought it was cute at first, but it got really out of hand quickly. She won’t stop taking photos on Snapchat (for example when I say “cute things”, she’ll take a photo of me and write down what I said, sometimes freaking out about writing down the “exact thing” that I said, asking me over and over to repeat exactly what I said). She’s constantly doing this 24/7, even at 3 a.m. when I’m trying to get to sleep next to her which is extremely annoying to me. 

She constantly talks about and obsesses about taking photos – with her phone, her digital camera, and her polaroid camera. She also constantly talks about posting these photos to social media – Facebook, Instagram, her Snapchat story and what caption to put on these photos. She’s super caught up with all of this, oftentimes ignoring school and other responsibilities in her life to focus on this obsession.

Overall, all of this has impacted my life quite a bit.
If she can’t record something or if she regrets not taking a photo (or taking the “wrong” photo) or posting the “wrong” photo or the “wrong” caption on a photo, she’ll break down, often to the point of tears and sometimes screams. 

In addition, she oftentimes will stay in her house all day, “working on sorting her photos”. Last time I checked her laptop, she had over 80,000 photos stored on there and I wouldn’t be surprised if her collection of photos was in the hundreds of thousands.
I’ve also been reluctant to go on dates and do exciting things with her, particularly on “important days” where I know that she’ll want to take a lot of photos. The thought of going out and doing something with her makes me feel uneasy, because I know that all she’ll want to do is go and take photos, and worry incessantly when she’s not able to do so or when she feels like she’s missed an opportunity for a photo (I’ll often hear about this for days if it occurs).

I think that she may have some form of anxiety or OCD, but she refuses to go see someone to talk about it, claiming that therapists haven’t done anything for her in the past (although she’s agreed that this behavior impacts her life at a few points). Talking to other people who know her, she’s apparently also been like this for years, and apparently it’s gotten worse over time.

I don’t know what to do about all of this. I really love Jamie, but I’m also sick of her obsession with photographs and “recording the moment” as I feel that this oftentimes prevents me from living in the moment and enjoying my time with her. When I go out on a date with her, I want to enjoy my food – I don’t want to wait 5 minutes for her to take photos of it. I don’t want to spend my nights helping her choose a filter for an Instagram post. I don’t want to be forced to post things to my Facebook and Instagram page to make her feel happy. Quite honestly, if I didn’t have any photographs of me or my past I probably wouldn’t care too much.

I don’t want to lose Jamie though – I’m very in love with her, and she’s so amazing to me in many ways. Every one of my friends and her friends think that we're a great couple. I feel like I may also be a bit possessive of her since she’s my first ever romantic partner – the thought of her being with anyone else makes me angry and for this reason I don’t want to leave her. But maybe this is because she’s my first love and I’ve got these rose-tinted glasses on or something.

What should I do? I’m clueless about what to do in this situation. I want her to change, but at the same time I know that a behavior so ingrained as this one will be difficult or impossible to change, especially as she doesn’t want to change it. I’ve tried talking to her about this and how I feel about it, and she’s broken down crying, blaming and insulting herself. I don’t know what to do!

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend won't stop taking photos and recording things, posting to Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, and worrying about not having taken a photo or not having posted the right photo. She knows she has a problem but doesn’t want to take any steps to change anything. This is seriously impacting my life in a number of ways and I don’t really know what to do about all of this.

**EDIT** I forgot to say that I'm moving away from her at the end of this month (I'm done school and she has two years left of school) so we'll be long-distance (300km one-way) for the foreseeable future. A positive outcome of this is that she'll have time to work on herself if she chooses to do so. On the other hand, maybe it would be in my best interests to move on from this relationship."
"Our (25f/27m) neighbors (40s?) keep parking in our driveway. How can we get them to stop without damaging relationship?


We just bought a house that has potential 2 back to back off street parking spaces, but most houses have on street parking and one off street spot. Our neighbors have a garage and small driveway that would fit their car, but it would be back to back, not side by side so not effective.       
         
When the house was vacate, apparently our neighbors parked in our driveway to ""make it seem like someone lived there"". I don't understand that because it's a good neighborhood where you wouldn't expect break ins and the houses are super close to each other.           
             
Our house is being completely renovated by my boyfriend. We are currently living with his parents, and he will go there from 1-3 days a week depending on work schedule to work at our house. We told our neighbors they could continue to use the spot until he started working there. He does not want to be liable for breaking their car accidentally while he's swinging things around and throwing stuff out. Or like a nail getting dropped on the drive and they get a flat tire.        
         
We also needed a huge dumpster for the old stuff in the house. He told them about a week before to stop parking there because we need the spot for the dumpster. He went to our house on that Monday, when the dumpster was arriving and they were parked there. It took several hours to contact them and a pissed of delivery guy to get them to move the car. He told them again, do not park in front of the dumpster because he will be throwing things in it and he didn't want to break their car. They continue to park there. Also, they explained that it was the wife's birthday Sunday night and they got too drunk and forgot.
             
           
The dumpster man was supposed to pick up the dumpster 3 weeks ago. It is still at our house. I believe it's because he came to pick it up and their car was in front of it. My boyfriend told them keep the car out that day but I don't believe them that they did.            
          
My boyfriend isn't sure what to do now, he does not want the neighborly relationship to be damaged by telling them off, but I'm done caring. I really don't mind telling them off but he thinks we have no ground because we have our toilets sitting in the backyard and that annoys the wife apparently. But their house is pretty trashy, one of the worst on the street. Obviously our is bad because of renovation but eventually it will be a nice middle class house, but they have a dead tree in their backyard that falls on to our yard that we don't complain about.              
             
How can we politely buy firmly get them to stop parking in our spot?        
              
**tldr** told neighbors to stop parking in our parking spot because we are renovating and they continue to park there."

Ive been casually hooking up with this girl i met on tinder for over a year now and its been strictly sex, not really friends or acquitances at all. Over the last 5 months she and I have been having a lot more sex than before. 

About a week ago I was over at her place and noticed a bunch of pictures of her and some guy. Then when her roommate came home she started freaking out that i could not be here and that i have to sneak out. So i left and have turned down hooking up with her ever since, thinking she may have a bf. Sure enough yesterday i found out for sure that she does have a boyfriend,  for at least 5 months (when she kicked our fwb into overdrive). What should i do? I dont know this kid and he doesnt even go to the same school, should i tell him somehow? Should i just step away from the whole situation?

EDIT: i texted her asking if she has a boyfriend and she replied that she just began it now...i have no proof that it began 5 months ago, it was just some clues. I really dont know how id go about contacting this dude, i dont know his first name let alone his last and she has him no where on he fb

"My [30M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years wants to instigate a weekly out-of-the-house date activity when we're already very busy.


I love my girlfriend very much. We’ve been together for 3 years, have lived together for 2 (no kids). In the last year, we’ve moved to a different city where we don’t really know anyone. We’ve attended a few Meetup groups and met a few new people, but nothing major. We both work from home, so we’re around each other a lot—but also, we don’t really go out and do things that much because we’re both pretty much workaholics. When we go out to dinner once a week, we talk about work a lot. We go on day trips when we’ve got a spare bit of time. We really enjoy travelling together and often do weekends away every other month or so.

I’m a bit of an introvert and she’s more of an extrovert, so I understand her wanting to get out and do more stuff together. We both travel a lot for work together—since January, we’ve both flown out of the state at least once or twice a month, which tends to be very exhausting.  

I’m not against us doing more things together—in fact, I think it would be great to get out of the house on a regular basis and get to know the city more. However, I’m not sure about the frequency and the types of activities. We’re both very busy and I think a weekly activity might be too much. (I should probably specify that she doesn’t want a weekly “go out to dinner and see a movie” type of date—she wants us to do more elaborate activities like rock climbing or bowling or going to shows, etc.).

What I’m trying to get at is, how often do you guys do a specific weekly activity with your SO? Planning and booking things is time-consuming and I don’t really have the imagination nor the desire to sift through Groupon and bicker about things to do. I offered we could maybe take a fitness class or something together (we've both kind of been skipping the gym lately) but she doesn't seem convinced. She’s really set on the idea that we need to do some sort of crazy fun activity every week. Am I being unreasonable in thinking that’s too much?

So basically, /r/relationships: what’s a good, regular date night routine for two people who work from home and are always busy? Should I give in to this idea of a weekly date activity? Is it sustainable? Right now we're talking about it maybe being every two weeks. (I argued that if we'll ever have kids, we won't have time to do a weekly date thing, and she replied that's exactly why she wants to do this now).

It would be great to know what other people’s date night routines are like—I don’t want her to plan all these crazy things and then be disappointed when we get too busy to do them. 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

So I posted a mini update in that thread and thanked everyone but I want to thank everyone *again* for some really helpful and really kind comments. 

Now...

I got my money today. :) But I had to really push for it. 

What happened was... just last night I got a speeding ticket while I was heading home after class. It was the only time I've *ever* been pulled over and the only time I've ever gotten a ticket, but it was a good excuse for my mom to scream at me and tell me how irresponsible I am and that she'll be driving me to and from school from now on. 

I know it's not good to get a speeding ticket. I should've definitely been paying more attention. But it felt like such an overreaction to me. Driving me to and from class because I got *one* ticket? So I put my foot down. I told her she can take me off her insurance if she wants but that I wasn't going to be treated that way when I've never done anything wrong before and that I wanted my money because clearly the car was a problem. 

First, she tried to tell me she isn't going to *give* me a car for no reason. I reminded her that that money wasn't something *she* gave me and it's mine to use as I need. 

Then I just locked myself in my room so I wouldn't get yelled at for crying. Then today I reminded her that I was serious about the money and that I wanted it. She tried to brush it off but I kept pressing. Then, she told me that I need to pay for insurance (I know) title and registration (I *know*) and that I can't pay for a car. I told her that either way I wanted the money and she told me that if I want it so bad, I can pay for everything else myself and to never ask for anything again. Pads, food, whatever. 

So. We went to the bank. It was less money after my school laptop and then she took out more for a credit card she *let me* use and had said before I didn't need to pay. 

But at least I have what's left which is about $7,600. It's not a lot, and I think I'm still going to go through with the car thing but first I want to find a job (seriously, 100% considering stripping at the local place right about now...) so I know I can pay for gas and other expenses like oil changes and basic necessities.

TL;DR: Got the money! :) Still need a job. Mom is still less than nice. "

"I [20F] didn't get the job. My boyfriend [20M] did. How do I be happy for him?


I applied for an internship that my boyfriend thought would be a good fit for me. I had looked into it before but it was a prestigious company and I'm only a sophomore. I decided to apply though, and after I did, he tells me his dad knows the guy running that department (the two work together). He said I probably had a decent shot.

My boyfriend also applied to the company under different intern positions. He got the job. I didn't. I'm really happy for him, but I'm so upset with myself. In terms of qualifications, I have him beat. I have prior work experience, letters of recommendation, better GPA, and I go to a better school. The difference? His dad sent out an email to his department asking for people to look at his son's resume. He got a call back later that month, and officially got the internship the day I found out I was rejected.

I want to be happy for him, I really do. But I'm so beat. I've applied to so many companies, slaved over my resume, and worked my ass off to make myself look more qualified. But it seems like I'm the only one without work this summer.

How do I feel happy for my boyfriend? I took him out to dinner yesterday to celebrate but I felt terrible after. Am I a bad girlfriend? Am I being too self involved?

TL;DR my boyfriend got an internship at a prestigious company because his dad is a higher up. I didn't get the internship even though I'm much more qualified. How do I be happy for him?"
"UPDATE: My (23F) boyfriend (23M) of 3.5 years put an offer on a house without talking to me


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/667xoq/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_of_35_years_put_an_offer_on/ 


So, after we had this fight, we both kind of apologized even though I was still upset and then he revealed that he was upset with me for not being excited about him putting an offer on a house, which he didn't get btw. 

Well a couple days went by and a lot of you had it right. He broke up with me. But here's how he did it. He called me earlier today while I was at work, and when I didn't answer, he decided to write me a letter which he then emailed to me. He explained why he was breaking up with me, which was mostly because neither of us can fully follow our dreams and still be together without being long distance, which I guess he doesn't want to do anymore. 

Which isn't necessarily a bad reason but here he is making decisions for both of us like he always did. And an email? after three and a half years? I mean come on. He wrote at the bottom of the letter that I could call him if I want but what do I even say? 

I'd like some closure I guess but I don't want to get overly emotional on the phone and let me him know how much he hurt me but I also feel like my relationship can't just end like that? Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? and also how to get over such a long relationship where I'm living alone in the city I moved to for him?

"I (30F) just found out that my husband (32M) created a dating app profile and messaged a woman a month before our wedding


I don't know where else to turn for some sound advice on my current situation. Yesterday, I was using my husband's phone to forward myself an email from his account (he asked me to do so, I wasn't intentionally spying or being sneaky). When I typed my email address, it auto-filled an option for someone he has contacted before. The icon picture was a risque view of some random woman which is what caught my attention. After thinking for an hour or so, I mentioned it to him. When I said the full name that popped up he immediately looked concerned. I have been with this man since I was 15 years old so I know him well enough to feel something was just off. He lied and said it was some random thing he clicked on so now it shows up on his email. I told him the only way something would pop up in his email like that is if he contacted the person. Then his story changed and it was just a harmless message. He never met her so I have nothing to be mad about, no physical contact. He even told me it was on the ""Kik"" app. Maybe he thought offering extra information would help push me along to believing his flaky story. Also claimed he already confessed this to me (laughable). I didn't really talk to him the rest of the evening. I wanted him to know I was mad especially because he tried to brush it off as nothing. I didn't want to have a huge fight about it so before we went to bed I told him my feelings were hurt and that it was a big deal to me. He said he was sorry and again assured me it was ""nothing."" I didn't reply. We went to sleep.

Side note - we have been together for about 15 years and married since October 2015. After some woman-done-wrong-gone-crazy detective work I discovered he messaged this woman in September 2015. We have one child together, he is 7 months old. We started trying to conceive in September 2015 which bothers me even more to discover the timing. He has cheated on me in the past but he fessed up to it and I figured we were over that. I trust him but always knew it was naive of me to do so. If I had any feeling he was being unfaithful I would have never married him and absolutely would not choose him as the father of my child.

About that detective work, I found out he created a Cougar Life profile. What the actual fuck? Really . . . Fucking Cougar Life?! What a joke! Seriously, if I weren't so mad I would laugh about it. I found the email chain between him and the woman. What's funny is I think he was duped by fake profile with a sexy picture. Those sites have bots and shit right? Her responses are just strange. He must have found them weird too because I only found the one conversation between them. He initiated the contact. His first message to her reads ""How you doing sexy? Send me # so I can text you rather then email."" Then he asked her for pictures to prove who she was after she replied with some nonsense on why she wouldn't provide her phone number. I feel he would have taken it further had she not acted so fishy.

Now to outline the main reasons I am upset:

1. Dishonesty - From start to finish, he has told so many lies. He truly thinks I'm stupid and he can talk his way out of it. Yeah, it was over a year ago but shit, I still feel betrayed. We were engaged and in an exclusive relationship for a LONG time. He lies so effortlessly too. It worries me how quick he will fib to avoid conflict, small and big things. Nothing happened between him and this woman so the dishonesty is what really hurts the most. And, of course, his intentions when creating the profile in the first place.

2. Time frame - A month before our wedding, the exact month I stopped taking birth control so we could start a family, WTF?! Looking back I don't feel like there were any warning signs that he would be looking to cheat. Everything seemed great. Relationships have ups and downs and I have enough sense to refrain from getting pregnant during a rough patch. 

3. Our son - My husband and I both come from divorced families. I want our son to grow up in a home with his mother and father together. No step-parents or siblings. We have been together so long and have been through so much shit. If we did not have a child, I would probably just be done with it all. At times, he is also verbally/emotionally abusive and I've just about had enough. 

4. Insecurity - 7 months out from giving birth and I am still about 30 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight. I feel like shit about myself. Everytime I look in the mirror I am disappointed. None of my clothes fit. His dating profile creation was during a time I felt pretty good about myself which is unsettling. If he wanted to cheat then I'm sure he fantasizes about it now. I feel like a fat, ugly, unappealing housewife. I am currently a stay-at-home mom so I have no income of my own.

Do I have the right to feel just as hurt as if he did this a week ago? Our lives were different when it happened (not yet married, no baby). Yes I know, he didn't technically cheat but he was well on his way to do so. I just feel so awful about the whole situation.

TL;DR: I found out my husband created a dating profile and messaged a woman a month before our wedding which was over a year ago. He lied to me about it. He did not meet her but I am confident he had intentions of doing so. Am I justified to be upset? How should I handle it? We have a 7 month old child together and I am currently an unemployed, full-time mother.

EDIT: Number list, apparently I can't count.

EDIT2: Thank you all so much for taking the time to reply to my post. I apologize I am unable to comment on each of your replies separately. I have a baby to take care of over here. I just don't have the energy necessary to handle such a high stress situation with him right now. I know I have a lot of important decisions to make. Thank you again, everyone. Your words have not fallen on deaf ears."
"My [25F] boyfriend's [26M] step brother's girlfriend acts extremely inappropriately towards my boyfriend. I don't know how to handle the disrespect anymore, after talking to the brother did absolutely nothing.


Hi Reddit. I'm a frequent poster but made a throwaway so my boyfriend can't find this post. I've had an ongoing issue in my relationship that I have pretty much kept under wraps for the last year, but it's progressing into a bigger problem lately and it's getting harder to control my emotions about it. Any help would be appreciated. 



The background: I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years. We used to live together but have been semi long distance while I'm attending a graduate program about 2 hours away. I drive to him every single weekend so we are together 3 days a week, and I am half way through my 2 year program. His step brother is his best friend.  They were raised together, have the same hobbies, and live literally next door to each other. This step brother is also a huge flake and takes advantage of my boyfriend a lot (still owes him large sums of money) but it is not my business so I am nothing but friendly to him. 



The problem starts with the step brothers girlfriend. From the second I met her a year ago, she essentially ignores all women and constantly flirts with most guys she comes into contact with. A minute or so after introducing herself to us, she was playfully touching my boyfriends arms and chest, knowing I was his girlfriend, and also in front of her own boyfriend. She makes extremely inappropriate sexual comments to my boyfriend even in front of his brother and makes it a point to come over (while I'm not there) in a bathing suit or really short shorts ""to say hi on her way to the lake"" that's down the street. 



Now... I 100% trust my boyfriend. He is very vocal about the fact that he really dislikes this girl and that she is clearly desperate for attention. He is very non-receptive to her comments and will either respond with something like ""that's awkward"" or just completely ignore her or tell her that's not appropriate. But the blatant disrespect to our relationship is driving me insane. My boyfriend is extremely introverted and his brother is basically his only friend. I don't want to ruin their relationship and he has made it extremely clear that regardless of his brothers girlfriend, he cannot lose the relationship with his brother. He basically told me that I don't have to like her, I don't even have to spend a lot of time with her, but that I have to be friendly and just put up with it for the sake of their friendship.




 Months ago, we both gently spoke to his brother about how we feel a little uncomfortable with the way his girlfriend acts around my boyfriend but he completely brushed it off, said we were overreacting, and has been slowly distancing himself from us ever since then. 


 

For the most part, I can get over the crap she does in MY presence...but while I'm at school, I'm sometimes overwhelmed with anxiety about the situation. I don't really know what I'm worried about, because I know my boyfriend wouldn't cheat on me. It's more of the idea of him being around someone who is directly disrespecting me and our relationship, even if he tells her to stop. I don't know. Last night I could barely sleep because I knew they were all hanging out. I don't know how to handle this anymore, I just know I cannot deal with another year of this until I move back home. Any advice would be great :/ 


TL;DR: Boyfriend's step brother's girlfriend is extremely inappropriate towards my boyfriend. He is not receptive to her comments at all and I trust him 100% but the disrespect is driving me insane. Don't know what to do from here. "

"I [36/F] feel a tremendous amount of guilt after my husband [35/M] gave up his dream for our family.


I met my husband “David” at a restaurant just over 10 years ago. He was a lieutenant in the Air Force. I remember the first time I saw him, he was in uniform, had a beautiful smile and gorgeous hair. I was so smitten with him. When he asked me out, it was like someone had winded me. We dated and I worked as a nurse and he flew. We got married a year and a half later, and we began moving around. He got assigned to a few different places for training or operational purposes. He was constantly learning to fly a new aircraft or a new skill, but he grew tired of the politics and didn’t re-up. 

Because of this, he very quickly landed a role with a commercial airline. He held certifications and was type rated for a few in service. He received some training and then was off. Commercial aviation was horrible. He wasn’t earning great money and was gone all of the time. His hours were longer, he was constantly under pressure and was never ever around. We have 4 kids (twins came last) all under 6 and the grind of commercial aviation wasn’t getting any better. He was flying to fabulous interesting places, but was constantly tired, was called in when he was supposed to be off and frequently was given last-minute assignments. It was starting to ruin our marriage, so he and I talked about it and he decided to go back to school, got an advanced degree in business. He recently landed a job with an airline, but in the business unit, making significantly more money than he ever made. We moved to be nearer the company recently and I am cutting back my hours so we can cut-down on other costs. 

Over the last 2 years, I’ve watched him. Sitting on the deck watching planes take off, or watching them from parking lots as we go from the car to the store. He quickly gets lost, wondering where they’re going, why they’re taking *that* route, or if there’ much chop. He’ll say: “Oh, at this point, they’ll be calling so-and-so, and making turns to head to Big Bird VOR Alpha Cats..” He was sitting with our nephew who was showing him YouTube videos about pilots and my husband was telling him what they’re doing, what it all does, etc. The passion in his voice, he talked about running your last check list, and then hearing the engines roar as you head down a runway “off on another adventure… there’s nothing like it.” 

He had always said he didn’t mind hanging it up and moving on, but more and more I feel awful for getting him to give-up flying. I asked if he wanted a little plane or to buy some flight hours, but he smiled and just said “it’s not the same.” He never says he misses it, or acts in any way upset, but I can tell just how much it meant to him. I feel horrible and just don’t know what to say or do for him. He gave up his dream to keep his family and I feel guilty.

  **tl;dr**: My husband gave-up his career as a pilot to spend more time with his family. I feel tremendous guilt for helping convince him to switch careers. It's like watching a child watch a plane, only to know you're not going to get to go back there. I feel horrible and don't know what to do or say. "

"Per doctor's orders, I [22F] am supposed to be going to the bathroom every hour. I have no idea how to explain this at work, and I'm so nervous about it.


I have a bladder disease that causes severe physical pain and trouble holding 
my bladder.  *Warning, the rest of this paragraph may be TMI.* I very rarely completely wet myself, but I have a lot of leakage, to the point where I have to wear pads. 

Because of these issues, my doctor (40s?F) wants me to do ""bladder training,"" which requires me to, as it says in the title, go to the bathroom on the hour, then gradually increase the amount of time. At the moment, I do not do this, I take as much time between bathroom trips as the next person, but as I've described above, this causes some issues.

I have not started doing this yet because I am so nervous about my coworkers (20s-50s M/F) asking questions. They know that I have an autoimmune disease, but I haven't gone into a lot of detail about it. I've had this disease for some time now, so I've gotten comfortable explaining that I need to restrict certain foods and take a lot of medication. However, it feels so awkward and embarrassing in my head though to have to explain that I need to pee every hour because I'm semi incontinent. 

I have considered wearing a depends, but I'm worried people will notice the smell and the adult diaper in the trash.

Any suggestions or support is appreciated!
