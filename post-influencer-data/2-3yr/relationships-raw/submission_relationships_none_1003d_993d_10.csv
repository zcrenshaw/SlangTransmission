"Update- My husband tried to close our accounts and kick myself and the kids out of our house.


Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us.

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone."
"UPDATE - Me [52M] As a Single Dad found out my [16F] daughter goes to Narcotics Anonymous Meetings





OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5563d5/me_52m_as_a_single_dad_found_out_my_16f_daughter/

Hi everyone! 

I am incredibly thankful for everyone’s comments and suggestions. Since my first post, things took a bit of a turn from her progress, but today she is back to 30 days sober!We have not proceeded with rehab, but here’s what has happened since then. 

2 weeks after my first post, my daughter came home from her work and asked me if she could borrow the health savings card and pick up her medication the next day. I said no, I would get it for her myself as I usually do. She protested for a minute or so but I was firm. She left it at that. 

For the rest of the night she was unusually quiet. She’s usually quite talkative with her grandparents who live with us, or myself and her sister. Not that night. This was slightly concerning, but I didn’t raise any questions. 

Fast forward to around midnight, my daughter came to me and spilled A LOT of details about her drug past. It was a lot of information to take in at one time, and finally she got to the point that she relapsed and needed the health savings card to get detoxed. After my momentary shock passed, I told her that I loved her and that I would go with her to the detox center, and that she didn’t need to hide things from me. I didn’t tell her about how I found out she’s already in meetings, I figured that could be my little secret or it can emerge when the time is right. 

After that, she got detoxed and all was well for a while before she relapsed again. She was much more straight-forward about it that time, and since that detox, everything has been going smooth. She is back into counseling and takes a 4-day a week class for getting her high school diploma. Today she is 30 days sober and is celebrating her sobriety / birthday with some friends. 

I appreciate every single comment! Thank you everyone for their kind words and advice. I feel good about the approach I took, although I would go back and change some things, she is getting the help she needs and we have a more open line of communication. She is more lively, is getting back into her passions, and is much, much happier. I’m still feeling guilty that I didn’t pick up the signs of addiction soon enough, but she assured me she has forgiven me and that I don’t need to worry about it at all. 

Happy ending! Thank you everyone!

TL;DR: 30 days sober today, and all is well after a few hiccups!"

"I (21F) set up a date between my two friends (29M/25F). Something went wrong that night and now my guy friend won't talk to me.


I met my friend Chuck (29M) about 1.5 years ago. We were both part of an online local group for single parents, and eventually met offline with other group parents. I have known Britt (25F) since high school. 

Chuck's wife died of childbirth complications the day their daughter was born, more than two years ago. Britt is a few months out of a 9-year relationship. Both of them have expressed wanting to meet other people, and I thought they'd be good for each other because of common interests and we all have kids of similar ages. 

Two days before Christmas, Chuck and Britt went out on their first date. I kept Chuck's daughter at my house so the two could have some more time together without him having to worry about the baby.

The plan was for her to spend the night (she's done it before and gets along great with my 3 year old girl), but Chuck knocked on my door at 11pm to get his daughter. He barely said a word to me and I could tell he had been crying, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. 

The next day, I asked Britt what happened. She said that they had dinner and a couple drinks, things were going excellent. She said she felt like they had great chemistry and were even getting physical at his house, but he suddenly told her to stop and to leave immediately. She swears that she has no idea what she did wrong and is really hurt by the whole thing. I believe her because she is really sweet and social, I've never seen her do anything to piss anyone off. 

I tried to talk to Chuck at the same time to get his side of the story and see what went wrong. All he said that he ""wasn't feeling it"" and didn't want to discuss it further. I didn't push it, but when I went to wish him a merry Christmas a day later, I saw he had deleted me from his social media. I texted it to him instead and asked ""you okay?"" but no response. 

I am seriously hurt and don't know what to do. Chuck has become one of my closest friends, and our daughters are the best of friends too. I am really worried that this has something to do with his wife, and I want to apologize if he felt like I was pressuring him to date after her death. At the same time, I don't want to overstep boundaries and bother him when he's having a hard time. It's been over a week and I'm worried/upset. 

**tldr: I set my two friends up on a date. Things were apparently going well until my guy friend suddenly called off the date. He has now deleted me from his social media and will not talk to me.**

**EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.**

**EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your advice, everyone. I think I will give it another week before I speak with him again. If he hasn't reached out by then, I will tell him that I am still here if he needs to talk but I will continue to give him space if he needs that, too. I am almost 100% sure that this happened because of his wife's death. Another one of my friends who is still on his Facebook saw that he had changed his cover photo several times since Christmas, and all of them were from his wedding.**

She thought that the whole renting a room thing was also going to be a friends with benefits thing. WTF!?

That was never mentioned or even implied when I agreed to let her rent.My girlfriend helped her get her room set up, she knows that I'm proposing to my girlfriend soon. Why would I need someone else to sleep with? I never flirted or anything.

She(crazy) started yelling about how she's made it obvious this whole time. Why else would she walk around in a towel? Um, because you live here? I walk around in my boxers all the time. It's normal..

After that she told me to go fuck my self and that she's moving out on Wednesday.

Three years ago we had an argument and she told me in the middle of it that she regrets not aborting me and it was the greatest mistake of her life. I was really hurt and stopped talking to her. She apologized a few weeks later in a voicemail telling me that she only said it in the heat of the moment and didn't mean it but it looked like she did. She's said similar thing in the past too, like ""if you weren't born I could have gone to college and had a good career"". I think she really meant it.

"How do I [32 MtF] say thank you to my (foster) parents for being so amazing?


I was placed with my foster parents when I was 12 because my biological mother died from an overdose when I was 5 and after she passed way and my ""father"" abused me. I have no contact with him.

I'll refer to my foster parents as mum and dad though.

I never felt right in my body but I couldn't articulate why- I preferred ""girly things"" which my dad hated and as soon as I started to hit puberty I become extremely depressed. 

I was withdrawn, anti-social and my mum didn't understand why. When I was 14 years old I figured out I was trans and tried to kill myself. My mum walked into my room just as I was trying and then I broke down and told her I was trans and gay to boot.

She held me for a very long time told me none of those things were a problem and then the both of them pretty much threw themselves into research about transitioning, what to do etc, puberty blockers, hormones and even found me a therapist who specializing in transgender children - it was and hour both ways and they'd take turns waiting in the car while I was in my session.

Mum took me shopping, taught me how to apply makeup, gave me books, dating advice, bought me a sewing machine when I expressed interest in sewing. 

Both of them fought with CPS to have me change schools when I went through an awkward non-passing teenager stage when I was bullied. Went to meetings with me, dressed down teachers and other parents who didn't understand. Financially helped me out with surgery.

Basically supported me all the way.

No matter what they did, I was depressed. But I feel like it had been anyone else, I'd be dead by now. I was depressed but I found the strength to keep going sometimes for the only reason that I didn't want to be ungrateful for all the effort they were putting in but some days, I was really hanging on by a thread.

I was pretty bad at some stages, I'd written myself of as a lost cause, and the feedback to them at that time probably wasn't encouraging. I wasn't cheerful, social, even doing that well academically, had behavioral issues and a chip on my shoulder and at one stage when I was 18 I nearly had a drug problem but somehow pulled myself back before it became a fully fledged thing.

I tested the limits of their affection a lot. 

Now I'm 32 years old, fully transitioned, starting a PhD, lecture at a uni and I've been in an amazing relationship with an amazing woman for the last 5 years. 

We're currently looking to adopt a child and as a result I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that my parents have sacrificed for a kid that originally wasn't even theirs. 

I've always thought about it but now that we are looking into the kind of sacrifice, time commitment, lifestyle change etc that having a child involves, I think about it constantly. 

They never once were obligated to do anything that they did for me. 

I was probably the reason why they didn't take on another foster child-I was a handful all by myself. I've maybe denied another kid out there who needed support from parents like these because of how difficult I was.

I want a way to thank them, I see them often (weekly) and talk to them almost everday, even just for 5 minutes and they tell me/I tell them I love you pretty much every time we talk- it's a habit I got into after I left for college and realized how much I missed them. 

But I'm looking for an over and above type thing- if that even exists - not in a money kind of way but just gratitude or something if it even exists. 

I'm not trying to ""pay them back"", I really just want to show how much I am humbled and appreciate everything they've done now that I'm starting to get even just a glimpse of what they've done for me which I wasn't mature enough to realize at the time.

"I [27m] have a flexible work schedule, and my girlfriend [26f] does not. She always pretends to be sick when I have the day off, and it's getting annoying. How do I talk to her about it?


Using a throwaway, and I'll try to keep this short.

My girlfriend Sarah and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and we currently live together. We've talked about marriage and I'm very sure that I want to get engaged in the next year or so. However, a recent issue has been cropping up and I'm not sure if it's a ""red flag"" or not. 

About 6 months ago I got a new job at a tech company in our city. It's one of your typical tech jobs — I get lots of perks, can work from home whenever I want, and I get unlimited paid time off. On top of that, they let us work flexible hours and are great about giving us company time off (on top of the unlimited PTO). In short, it's a great job and I'm very happy with it. 

Sarah works a corporate job and is has been unhappy there for awhile. Her job is the opposite of mine...she gets 2 weeks vacation, limited sick days, and I'm pretty sure her company would give her no vacation days if they could. Everyone works long hours and there's absolutely no way she could work from home. To summarize — she does not like her job. 

So, my issue: Whenever I have time off and she doesn't, or I take an actual sick day, or I work from home more than 3 days a week, Sarah always ends up ""getting sick"" and calling out of work that day. I can see right through her — she's not actually sick, but she's jealous that I get so much time off and she wants to spend time with me. *Which is fine*, I get it. 

The part that bothers me is that on top of her taking sick days, she expects me to take care of her and dote on her. She often wants me to spend all day in bed with her, or order her food, or whatever. This has become an annoying habit of hers for the past 6 months, and I'm sick of it. 

Also, to be completely honest, sometimes I would like that time for myself *without* her. I appreciate my independence and while I love her and want to spend time with her, it's not fun when she's laying in her pajamas all day and asking me to order her Indian food. Sometimes I'd like to spend that time the way I want to. 

I see a few other issues within this behavior as well:

* Sarah doesn't like her job and needs a new one, one with a flexible schedule at least. As much as I've tried to get her to apply for jobs, helped her with her resume and cover letter, she can't seem to be motivated to look for a new job. She loves complaining about her job, but seems too complacent in it to actually do anything about it. 

* With the amount of time Sarah takes off at her current job, she has a large amount of ""negative"" vacation hours and sick days. This gets in the way when we want to plan for trips, because she often isn't able to take time off because of how many negative days she's accrued. 

* I feel like she's also become complacent in our relationship, and just expects me to take care of her when she's sick. Which would be fine, if she wasn't ""sick"" every week. At this point I feel like she's making excuses, and I struggle with being that asshole boyfriend that doesn't take care of her or just tells her to get over it. 

So I guess I'm wondering, what can I do? Her behavior has been such a turn off lately, and I'm struggling with how to tell her that I know she's faking being sick and that I'm over it. I *don't* want to accuse her of faking it, but I know she is. How do I bring it up delicately and getting my point across?

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR - Girlfriend pretends to be sick every time I have a day off or take a sick day. Makes excuses and it's become a bad pattern of behavior. How do I bring this up to her gently?

"[UPDATE] How should I [22F] handle the escalating issues with my neighbors [30-40?s]?


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jv0gm/how_should_i_22f_handle_the_escalating_issues/

This did not turn out the way I expected at all, but boy do I feel good.

Now that I know everyone's names, it'll be easier to keep straight:

Ashley and Ben = the couple living in the other half of the duplex

Robert and Liz = the couple living in the house next door (closer to our half of the duplex)

Dan = our landlord

When I made the OP, I mentioned that my roommate sent an e-mail to our landlord to let him know that we were thinking of moving out. He gave her a call on the phone a few days later and said that he had heard some outlandish stories about us from Robert and Liz and that he wanted to figure out what was going on. He asked her a few questions then said that he thought we were good tenants and wanted to get to the bottom of this.

Today, he arranged for me and my roommate, Ashley and Ben, and Robert and Liz to meet up to discuss the situation. Robert and Liz did not show up, so Dan asked us to each share our concerns. Ashley started by saying that she was frustrated because we keep banging on the walls even though she has asked us to stop, and that Robert told her that we told him that we sent someone over to vandalize their Christmas decorations (which resulted in Ashley calling the cops). She said that she and her children had been terrified and had trouble sleeping at night because of the harassment.

I told her that I was incredibly sorry that she went through something so scary, but that we had absolutely nothing to do with it and I had never spoken to Robert (whose name I just learned) aside from introducing myself when he and his wife moved in. She then went on to say that Robert and Liz claimed that I had told them that I was sleeping with Ben, her husband. Reddit, I was LIVID. Ashley didn't believe that I was sleeping with her husband of course, but she was furious that I was telling the neighbors that I was. Understandable, but again I had never spoken to Robert and I just learned her husband's name thirty minutes ago.

At this point we realized that a lot of our anger stemmed from lies that Robert had told. We had never had problems with each other until Robert and Liz moved in next door. We started exchanging stories with each other. Robert would tell my roommate one thing and tell Ashley and Ben almost the complete opposite. Ashley noted that the noise she heard was always coming from the outside of the house (not our shared wall) and she believed that it was us tapping the window only because Liz said she had seen us out there; however, just last night Ashley's youngest child said that someone (who they thought was Robert) was tapping on the window while we weren't home, so she knew something was up. We also thought it was extremely telling that they didn't show up for the tenant meeting.

Another interesting point - Ben brought up that Liz and Robert would fight outside in the middle of the night so loud that they could hear it from their side of the house. My roommate and I previously thought that it was Ashley and Ben, but now that I think about it, the midnight fights didn't start until this month.

Reddit, I never believed that I would witness this level of shit-stirring. Ashley and Ben said that at one point, Liz said that she really wanted her sister to move into the neighborhood so they could be close. So the only possible motivation I could see is that maybe Robert and Liz wanted to turn us against each other until one of us moved out. If that was their plan, it almost worked! It just seems so crazy to me though.

Ben and Ashley recently set up a camera outside of their house (originally meant to catch us in the act) that Robert and Liz somehow know about. So either the camera will be enough to stop Robert or they'll catch the real culprit. Dan said that legally, there wasn't much he could do. But we all agreed that we would start calling the cops when the midnight fights start (like a redditor suggested in the last post).

Even though we still have to deal with Robert and Liz, I feel so much better now knowing the truth. Nothing made sense before, and that was the most frustrating part. Tomorrow, my roommate and I are going to bring Ashley and Ben a pie from the bakery that we work at as an olive branch.
  ---   
TLDR: We found out that the source of our problems with our neighbors was a SHIT TON of lies spread by our other neighbors. We think that they might have been trying to create a vacancy in the neighborhood. Whatever they were trying to accomplish won't work anymore since my roommate and our duplex mates have agreed to ignore them. Thanks to anyone who read either of my long posts!"

"Me [33 F]had to call social services on my Aunt (53f) for exploitation and neglect of my Grandmother (80)and now everyone in my family is mad at me


So I live 1500 miles away from my family. My Grandmother has had Alzheimer's and dementia for 10 years. My mother (50f) is my Grandmother's care taker, but not her Power of Attorney my Aunt (55f) is. 

My grandmother has gotten to the point that she is being violent, she has threatened to burn the house down and has recently gotten hurt and will not allow anyone to change the bandages eveb though she is a diabetic. My mother wants to put my Grandmother in a home but My Aunt will not allow her to do that, but also will not take care of my Grandmother herself leaving my mother to feel obligated to keep caring for her even though she is a danger to herself and others and my mom knows she cant give the proper care. 

Yesterday I am on video chat with my sister( 28f) and my mother and I heard my Grandmother telling my mother she was going to burn the house down and run away, she also hit my nephew whom is 2 and everyone laughs it off. I have experience with Alzheimer's patients and I know they can spiral out of control, so I keep advising my mom and my Aunt to put her in a home.  My Aunt has not worked for 10 years and lives off my grandmothers money,has recently bought a new car  but my Grandmother is always in jeopardy of not having electricity and no food. My mother and my sister buy food from their food stamps but My Aunt should be the one that buys the food and pay bills not my mother since my mother is care taker. My granmother gets 2000 or in ssi and pension and sees none of it. 

I notice these things yesterday AND that she has a wound as a diabetic that could easily get infected- but she wont let anyone change the bandages- and no one has thought to take her to the hospital to get it cared for. I tell my mom again yesterday that if she doesnt do anything I will. So, today when no one answered my plea and no one wanted to listen and shout over me, I called Social Services to come evaluate things. They agreed and someone will be there to look sometime in the next week. 

Anyway, that up set my Aunt whom is stealing my grandmothers money so she threatened to call the cops on my mother whom has warrants. I told her she can as my mother is a 50 year old able bodied woman and should have taken care that before so that is on her, whereas my grandmother is an 80 year old whom can not take care of herself, therefore she is my priority not my mom. So, as backlash I am getting yelled at and hated because I did the right thing. I am so mad and hurt and upset and just dont know what to do really.  I changed my number, deleted my facebook and will let the anger settle. My Aunt Has also lied and told my mother that my Grandmother makes too much for nursing homes...what?! who makes too much to be cared for? She has medicade and money, she will be accepted into a few places with no issue...I got tired of the excuses and now I feel isolated but My grandmother's life is more important to me than my family being mad at me.

  **tl;dr**: My Aunt is exploiting my grandmother,taking her money and my mom takes care of her and gets no help. I called social services on my Aunt because she is neglecting my grandmother by not providing the medical care she needs as an alzheimers and they are all mad at me because I exposed them to the state. 


[UPDATE]: Protective Services called me today. They found nothing to substatiate my claims but did insist that if I feel strongly enough about things, I could sue for guardianship of my grandmother, which I have started. If the funds allow- given that I am fighting for custody of my Daughter (we have 50/50 with wonkey holiday schedule and I want primary so it is more stable for her) I am not sure if I can even afford it. I want the best for my Grandmother and if it means that I have to make sure she gets the care she needs, then I will do that whatever it takes. As things progress, I will update on here. Thank you all so much for the kind words. I needed to hear it.

"My (24F) uncle (M51) drive drunk again, hit a guest's (27M) car. My dad (M53) stood up for him, things got bad.


Sorry for formatting or spelling guys, I'm on mobile.

So my uncle is a major alcoholic. We live in a tiny town and he lives about a mile away and tries to drive home plastered every year. Couple years back he backed into my brother's car, gave him a cash payout to fix it, year after that he hit my brother's friend's car, damage was so bad he had to file a claim with insurance since he couldn't open any of the doors on the driver's side. Couple years later it was a rainy new years and he ended up going off the driveway full speed down our tree covered hill and totaling his truck with his wife in the car. That happened and my brother and dad got in a screaming match where he threatened my brother and my uncle just stood there swaying and blinking slowly. Everyone involved was very drunk.

This year we have had it. As soon as I realised my uncle was driving I ran out but it was too late. I heard the crunch. I ran downstairs to the party and shouted who parked up the hill, everyone ran up and my sister, brother and I started screaming at my uncle, who again could barely stand up straight and blinked stupidly. My dad started taking his side and APOLOGIZING TO HIM. Poor precious baby getting yelled at, so we all started yelling at my dad for defending my uncle again (my brother recorded all of this btw) we had to physically pick up the friend's car and move it since my uncle's huge truck was wedged against it so firmly. I had grabbed the keys and my uncle kept trying to grab them back So I backed away and my dad went to try and talk to me so my sister started yelling in his face. All of us sans druncle went to the porch. My dad kept trying to express his point of view, but my sister who is crying at this point goes to run inside. I follow her and a switch flips, my dad shoved me out of the way and went to kick the door my sister was trying to pass through, I stuck my leg in the door to try and protect her and the door slammed on my leg instead of on her. My brother has to physically prevent my dad from running after my sister. I followed her upstairs and we hung out until my mom came up trying to defend my dad. We layed out what happened and she was still trying to justify his beahavoir but absolutely screamed at him when everyone was gone.

Druncle's truck was blocking everyone trying to leave and he refused to get out of the driver's seat (with an open bottle in the car) his wife finally came and picked him up. I was the only one sober so I moved his truck and hid his keys.

Now I'm upstairs the next day in my room not knowing how to interact with my usually incredibly close family, I'm going back to my home eventually, which means having to interact and get this resolved soon for the sake of my mom. I feel angry, upset and my eyes hurt from crying, my sister left last night and my brother probably won't come up from his basement today. How the hell do I handle this?

**tldr: uncle hit someone's car again (4 cars damaged now) my dad stood up for him, basically assaulted me and my sister. What do?**

EDIT: sorry I didn't mention this before: we've tried reporting him in the past. The last time we tried to report him the police took an hour to get there and the officer didn't do anything besides tell him off for trying to get behind the wheel (I wasn't there mind you, I was given this info secondhand)  the police in my small town are absolutely incompetent. When my friend's house got broken into and car stolen they never found the car or person even though she told them who did it. They don't care. "
"Someone's been pissing on the men's room floor at work and I [31/M] think I may have identified the culprit. What should I do?


Needless to say, this is absolutely disgusting. It all started about a month ago, which makes me think it's someone new at the office. There's only one urinal, and beneath it is just tons of piss. It's impossible to avoid, your soles end up all sticky and the whole room just reeks.

This morning, I was making my morning constitutional and heard someone come in and use the urinal. Right before he left, another guy came in. When I emerged from the stall, the second guy looked at me and was like, ""Dude, any idea who's been pissing on the floor?"" So I asked him who it was who left when he walked in. He replied it was the new guy in finance. 

Bingo!

Granted, the new guy doesn't seem the type, but then again, no one really seems the type. What kind of person pisses on the floor? Which leads me to believe that perhaps there's some sort of odd medical condition that may account for this: uncontrollably shaky hands perhaps or a stream that's somehow ultra-pressurized. Either way, it's made trips to the bathroom very unpleasant and I have no doubt the custodial staff shares my disgust. Obviously, I have no smoking gun evidence it's him and it would be pretty unfeasible and undoubtedly fireable to attempt to get it. What should I do?

TL;DR: I think I know who's been pissing on the men's room floor. Now what?

EDIT: Thanks to the person who commented that it could be a leaky urinal. I wouldn't have thought of that. While I don't necessarily believe it is a leak, it provided me the opening I needed to email our custodial manager without making it seem like I was accusing someone."

"Me [30 M/F] with my wife [32 M/F] of 6 years, I'm not attracted to her at all


Been together 8 years, married 6. My wife is wonderful, beautiful, smart, and is a doting wife. Sure we all have our flaws, but overall she's one of those people you would consider a catch. People love her, she's generous, no one has anything bad to say about her, she has no enemies.

That love extends to my family. My parents treat her like she's their own daughter, she's a favorite aunt, she gets along with my sisters.
All of this only makes me feel worse and more guilty. I'm not attracted to her sexually, AT ALL. In fact, she repulses me. I feel like shit.

She has a good body (not super fit, but she's not overweight), she has a beautiful face and stunning features, a killer smile...but it does nothing for me.

When she tries to initiate sex, I'm immensely turned off. I don't want to touch her. I don't want to kiss her, it's even an effort to hold her hand.

We've been going to therapy for this as of course my wife is extremely hurt and just trying to be patient with me in case this is a phase. But I know she can't go on much longer and I don't blame her. She deserves someone who's crazy about her.

I used to be crazy about her. I couldn't keep my hands off her. Our sex life was really good.

This is why I feel so guilty and crazy. It just fizzled out. I have nothing concrete to complain about. She's trying so hard with working out more, buying lingerie, taking care of herself. But I look at her and I just feel...nothing. She might as well be my sister.
To make things worse, I AM attracted to other women and want to have sex. I masturbate fantasizing to other women. I don't want to cheat on her.

If there was a magic wand, I would love to be attracted to my wife again. Divorce would upset so many things and sex is the only sore point in an otherwise great marriage. We get along so well. She makes me laugh, we like the same things, she's my best friend.
I'm really hoping there are some other long term relationship people here who have gone through something similar. Have you ever completely lost attraction for the person you were with but still powered through it? Did it come back? Is it lost forever? Is this why people open up their marriages?

I feel like a piece of shit because she's such a good person, but I'm also incredibly unhappy.

What I wouldn't give to just feel SOMETHING for her. Really hoping to find someone who understands where I'm coming from. Thanks.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Not one ounce of me is attracted to my wife, but she's a wonderful person. I feel horrible. Hoping someone can relate."

"Me [31F] with my Husband [31M], about to announce our pregnancy, my BIL [32M] keeps making negative comments about how clueless we are with kids


Hi guys,

Not sure if this is the best place to post this (long time lurker, first time posting) but I could really use your advice! Throw away because I don't want any family to find this.

Hubby and I together for 8 years, married for 2. I'm nearing on 3 months pregnant, so the 12 week scan is coming up and if everything is looking good - we'll be announcing soon to our family and friends! Exciting! Nobody else knows.

Only issue is... my BIL is extremely obnoxious and competitive, and I'm not quite sure how to deal with his behaviour, which I suspect is about to escalate.  

To paint the picture - he and his wife [30F] have twin girls [1.5F]. We were very happy for them when they fell pregnant, have babysat, done our best to give them really thoughtful gifts for birthdays and Christmas, helped entertain and watch them on family outings, and things like that. But the truth is, neither of us have felt 100% comfortable with the little ones because generally, BIL and his wife are very self entitled, judgemental and critical. It just feels like you have to walk on egg shells around them in life, and it has been this way even before their children were born. It's just this general unease, and as a result maybe we don't fuss over the girls as much as they would like.

BIL has previously been really aggressive and demanded that my husband come around and ""clean his house"" because he's done ""nothing to help since the girls came along"" (which is not true) and has made some other fairly outrageous demands which hubby has pretty much ignored due to them being ridiculous. Whilst I appreciate that being new parents and having twins is challenging and they are under a lot of stress, it was their decision to have kids, and they seem to think that everyone else should be altering their lifestyles to accommodate their kids too. And they aren't without help - the grandparents are always around assisting. They've said we're ""not ready for children"" because we ""clearly aren't interested in their kids"". They've gone around saying this to a lot of people, which is really hurtful in general, particularly as I feel neither of them have bothered to get to know me as a person and make such a claim.

BIL constantly makes comments such as, ""I can't wait until you have kids so you see how hard it is"", ""just you wait"" and ""you guys have no idea"" in a pretty nasty, condescending tone. These comments are always unprovoked. We have never commented on their parenting ability, and we are super accommodating and understanding of their routine and schedule, etc. We always do all we can to not make their lives any more complicated.

I think BIL went into their pregnancy pretty uneducated in general, and I think a lot of his frustrations stems from how unprepared he was for the lifestyle change. I think he is projecting.

Hubby and I are generally really passive people and choose to ignore it for the most part, or awkwardly laugh it off. I've spoken to him about this, but he thinks ignoring his brother's temper tantrums is for the best.

Basically, I just want some help in handling some of these comments, and the fact I think they'll escalate once the pregnancy is announced. He's been shaming us publicly for awhile in front of family and family friends for not ""understanding"" how hard it is having kids, and I'm a bit tired of feeling like a doormat. I understand his comments stem from his own frustration, but often his wife joins in, and I just find it really unnecessary and like a slap in the face given how considerate we try to be. We're pretty confident that things will turn into ""oh just imagine how hard that is with TWO"", and I feel like it is only going to get worse from here on out. It's not a competition, this is a happy time, and I'm just sick of them shitting on the both of us. I don't want this to extend into him comparing his children to ours, or worse.

Any advice on how I can shutdown these comments in a graceful way? Or is my hubby right, should we just continue to ignore their behaviour? Writing this out it just seems so petty compared to some of the other posts on this sub, but I'm tired of listening to the same comments again and again.

"My upset mother [39] wants me [20 f] to loan money for her rent but I refuse because I know she won't pay me back


Pretty much the title says it all. I'm a college student on winter break, came home for the holidays. I have money saved up for my rent. About 3 months worth. I could loan her the money if I truly wanted to but I don't. 

My mother works as a childcare provider from home and at Target. While I understand that her income may not be enough for her, her husband, 3 remaining children (10, 17 and one who is 23 and doesn't pay rent) and my uncle (who occasionally lets her use his car since she doesn't have one anymore) to live off of but there are more than enough adults living here that can contribute to this household. My older brother works but doesn't give her money and she doesn't enforce that he should. Her husband, however, contributes absolutely nothing. He doesn't work or anything. They don't have a car so they just sit around all day. Not sure how that works but if it doesn't bother her, so be it. 

Ever since we all got our first jobs, my mom has asked us for money. After loaning her money from our pockets and even from other people like family or close friends then finding out where it went (or didn't go), my family and I had come to the conclusion years ago that she is financially irresponsible. She still owes my older sister $800 for utility bills. It's not really a secret that she's not the best with money. 

So now, I go back to school in 2 weeks. She used all of her extra money to buy a bunch of gifts for my younger brother for Christmas. Gifts I didn't even know she could afford such as the Xbox One. My brother somehow tricked her into getting her card info and bought a few games which put her in the bind she's in now. Her rent was due on the first. I knew eventually she was going to ask me for money but she didn't do it immediately so I thought I was in the clear and that she, a grown woman with a husband, came up with the extra money or thought up a plan. Apparently not. 

Her landlord gives her a 5-day grace period to pay rent. When we deny her money, she calls any friend that'll listen or our father or grandparents to complain to them. My grandparents are old and tired. They only have enough energy and money to take care of themselves so they're tired of lending her money. At this point, they try to get us to give her the money so they don't have to. My father doesn't stand for it and it mostly leads to either a brawl or my dad simply hanging up on her. 

I'm the easiest one to cave in and one of the more financially responsible in the family. She usually gets really upset when we refuse to hand over the money just like a few minutes ago. We were just in the car (my uncle's car) when she says ""You're gonna have to give me some money."". When I said no, her demeanor changed entirely. She was whining how her kids never want to help her, how she's going to stop helping us and telling me she should kick my ""ugly a#!"" out the car now. I said nothing but put my headphones back in. She goes on these rants every time she doesn't get her way with us. When we got home, she slammed the door in my face before I could walk in the house. My uncle talked to me and assured me that he was going to give her the money and have my brother help out but he isn't mad that I'm standing my ground because he knows how my mom can be. 

I'm really considering staying elsewhere for the duration of my visit because I don't like the tension she's created. My mother can erupt from the smallest of things when she's upset and sometimes it can get violent so I keep my distance. But I didn't come home for all of this. I came upon the request of my mother wanting me here since I'm away at school 99% of the year. I want to take care of my parents someday but when I'm financially stable myself. Am I supposed to just give her money upon demand though? Do I just cut my break short and go back home? I know she's my mom but it's not my responsibility to make sure she's financially set when she and her husband are fully able to fend for themselves. 



Tldr: my mom wants $300, I can't just give her that because of adult things, she's pissed, this is ruining my winter break 

UPDATE: She fixed me snickerdoodles, hugged me, tried to sweet talk me into giving her the money, I stood my ground. She told me she'll never help me with anything, ""fuck you"" and she said she ALMOST wants me to leave now. I'm gonna pack my things and head to my grandparents house for the rest of my break. 

SECOND UPDATE: Packed my bags, was trying to clean guest room before I left, mom confronted me, called me disrespectful for not telling her I was leaving, told me she's going to get my dad to stop paying for college and then demanded I take my crap and get out. Somberly, my uncle and brother helped me get my things into an UBER, got to grandparents house, I'm content. Probably gonna cut my stay a tad shorter and head back home a few days earlier than planned. "

"My [34 M] brother in law is creeping me [26 F] out.


My sister [38 F] and my brother in law [34 M] have been married for 15 years.  They have 4 children together. My sister already had 1 when they met.  They met/dated/moved in together/got married in less than a year from the day they first met.  She was 23 and he was 19.  They were struggling financially when they first got married so they lived with our parents for a few years. I was 11/12 when they moved back in with us, so I grew up thinking of him as a blood brother.  My parents never have been fond of him because he has trouble keeping a job, but I never had a personal problem with him until the last year or so.  

Eventually they moved out into their own place and seemed to be doing okay until about 6 years ago when my sister got pregnant with their youngest child.  They had apparently been having major marital issues for awhile unbeknownst to us, and he left her while she was pregnant for a former high school fling he reconnected with. To say my sister was devastated was an understatement.  Long story short, they ended up reconciling about a year later.  Our parents were suspicious about him being sincere, but my sister wouldn't hear any of it.  She doesn't want anyone to bring up the separation. Ever since then it's a big taboo in our family to say anything negative about him to her.

Things have seemed okay for them but in the last year I noticed that my brother in law started aggressively liking ALL my posts on Facebook.  ALL my pics, statuses, etc.  My sister is on FB as well but he RARELY likes anything she posts.  I thought it was weird, but I didn't think much of it until a couple months ago when I used the new Instagram feature where you can make a story (kind of like on Snapchat) for the first time.  

It allows you to see who has viewed it, and I almost fell on the floor when I saw his name.  I've had Instagram for YEARS, and I had no idea he followed me on there or that he even had an account. He's never liked any of my pictures on there. My sister doesn't use IG, only Facebook.  I go to his profile, and he has no posts or even a profile pic BUT he is following over 500 people and ALL of them are porn/booty models. I KNOW my sister would NOT be okay with this considering their history. I'm the only regular person he follows and I don't post anything racy. It's mostly just selfies.  

This really creeped me out, but I was hoping that maybe it was just a coincidence or misunderstanding.  Yet EVERY time I have posted a story on IG for the last two months he is the FIRST one to view it.  I am honestly afraid and unsure of what to do.  

Should I just BLOCK him and forget about it?  Is it that serious where I need to tell my sister?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My sister's husband is liking everything I post on FB and frequently lurks my Instagram from an account that he follows nothing but porn/booty models on.

**UPDATE**  I decided to talk to my other siblings before I went to our parents.  My oldest brother basically said knowing their history, I need more concrete evidence before going to our sister.  I took screenshots of his IG page, blocked him on there, and put him on my restricted list of FB.  I hope that sends a CLEAR message not to f**k with me.  I am going to monitor the situation for the next few days/weeks and adjust if anything changes.

"I [14f] am worried about how my mom [34f] treats me now that she's remarried [47m] and now has 3 stepchildren [30ish F, 12f, 16m, I think]


tl;dr: I feel like my mom doesn't like me as much now that she has a new husband and new family. Am I just overreacting?

So, for some background, my mom and dad divorced when I was a baby. I saw him every other weekend for all of my life, and he was an active part of my life growing up. My mom has been dating this other guy (Chris) for like years. And he's sort of been following us whenever we move. Like when we move into a new apartment complex, he moves there too. I don't get it, but whatever.

He has one daughter from one marriage (Liz), and then two kids from another marriage (Emily and Eric).

I've known him and his family for years and usually get along with Emily. 

They got married in April last year. Then we moved 300 miles away from the whole rest of my family. It's a little town, like really small. In the middle of nowhere. I don't have a phone or anything so it's just skype or email if I want to contact my family in my hometown, and my dad's kind of old so he doesn't know how to work skype. So really it's just me and my mom, and that's the only family I have out here.

Anyway that's the situation I'm living in right now. And I feel like now that I'm in the middle of nowhere, stuff that used to happen (Emily and Eric stealing my things, them getting the best of everything, Chris being mean to me) is way worse.

Chris will make weird jokes to me too, like sex jokes. And I don't like it. But mom is just saying it's how he jokes. He doesn't joke like that with Emily. I came out as a lesbian and he makes constant comments about that, like my fingers and dexterity and stuff. he made one weird comment about my boobs and ive been trying to get them flattened as much as possible ever since.

When we travel, we get two double beds, and they either make me sleep on the floor or in a laz-e-boy chair if the room has it.

his kids get brand new clothes and all my stuff is from the thrift store, and looks like it.

Liz lives in the same town and she has 4 kids who are pretty young. When they come over, they steal my stuff from my room. So I put a lock on my door that I paid out of my own pockets for. It's like a latch, like for a shed. That closes over a prong where the lock goes. It's irritating to have to lock up my own room like this, but when I say ""Tina stole my body spray and emptied the whole bottle"" or ""Dan broke my CD"" my mom doesn't do anything. My dad gave me his Akatosh statue when he bought Skyrim, and they broke it.

You know, I'm just 14. I don't have like a ton of expensive things. But a CD or a game is like my whole month's chores allowance. I can't just go out and replace it.

Anyway, one day me and my mom were messing around with halloween stuff. I had an ugly wig, and did my makeup all crazy. My mom called for Chris to take a look, and he did, and laughed. Then he says, come here. I run off, i say "" no way"" and i'm laughing. joking around still, like still in the playful mood me and my mom had been. He chases after me all serious, so i get scared because he's a big guy and really strong. and why is he running at me all serious? i get to my room and i'm trying to close the door because i don't know what was goign on and i don't know what he wanted and he was just yelling at me. i tried to get the lock into the little slot but i couldnt. he pushes the door open and screams at me some more (i don't know what he was even saying it was just gibberish?) and rips the latch off the door frame??? i just stayed in my room the whole rest of the day. i don't even know what the heck that was about. I talked to my mom about it and she said he was just joking.

another time, i was walking into the kitch to get some poptarts id put in the toaster earlier. i had them on a plate and was about to walk into the tv room, when he came in. he starts going off about how I didn't put all the dishes in the dishwasher and I said, ""there was no room."" he grabbed my poptarts and threw them in my face and screams ""I MADE ROOM!"" i just went to my room. if you overstuff it the dishes don't even get clean, but i guess i'm just a dumbass. My mom says I should listen to him and do all my chores.

Oh yeah, and I'm the only one who does chores. Emily gets stuff like ""walk the dog"" which is fun. Eric doesn't have to do anything, because he's the football star and whatever.

and then when we go out to eat or anything, everyone makes comments about what I eat. I'm not fat. i'm in sports, so i'm not skinny. but it's not fat. but they all make fun of me, like even Emily, who I thought was my friend or even a sister. When I eat with them in the dining room it's the same. i try and avoid it and they all act like I'm being rude for not being around them. my mom says i'm not making enough of an effort to get along and that i'm rude to them, and i say I'm just fine. I'm not mean to them. I don't steal their things. I don't say Emily's fat or anything. All my teachers like me. I have good grades. I have friends at school. 

Sorry this got really ranty, I guess just writing it all out kind of unleashed stuff.

My mom takes my stuff and gives it to the dogs. I'll walk into the backyard and find a pillow, blanket, stuffed animal that was mine and she gave it to the dogs. She doesn't care about any of my things. I feel like she doesn't care about me.

She's also mean to my pets. I had a weiner dog-- he was the family dog but he liked me most!-- and once while we were on a trip she woke me up at 3am and said she'd given him away. so i was crying and chris yelled at me for waking up everyone else.

I also had a ferret at one point, and she picked her up out of her cage and swung her around. i told her not to do that and got pretty upset and she said I was psycho and crazy because I was upset she was hurting my pet! Who was just a baby, too!

When we moved, we had two kittens. One was mine and one was Emily's. In the temporary apartment we got, we weren't supposed to have pets at all. So Mom put a tent in the closet and then put the two kittens in there. We weren't allowed to let them out at all. We could get in the tent with them but they only wanted out. it was cruel. i was thinking of trying to give them away but i didn't know anyone. When we moved into the rental house, Mom wouldn't let them inside the house at all. One got a big cyst on his side, and then disappeared. Then the other one disappeared. I think we made them crazy. it hurts to think about how these animals have been treated by her, but her dog doesn't get this treatment.

ok so this has all been really stressful and ive been self harming. i don't have a razor, so it's mostly just bruises. mom found out i was doing this to myself. she came into my room with Chris to talk to me about it and he was laughing at me. Mom was upset, but he was laughing. She says I don't know what I'm talking about, and how he was really concerned over me. 

I just feel like she wishes I were gone so she could enjoy her new family without the old baggage. I've talked to my dad about this but he says from what my mom says, that I'm overreacting and that I'm just being a shitty teenager. He says I'm blowing things out of proportion and that if I would just get along things would be good. i feel like i'm crazy. "
