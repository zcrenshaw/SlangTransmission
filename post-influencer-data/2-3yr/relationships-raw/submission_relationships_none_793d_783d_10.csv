Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6p3gsf/i_19f_am_being_excluded_from_our_gaming_group_i/

Thank you everyone for all the advice! And thank you to those that also offered to play with me. I wasn't expecting my post to get so many replies. Unfortunately, I had some unrelated family business, so I couldn't respond to you all. However, I have read everything and have taken all your words into consideration. Some people have also asked me questions about how we can play so often, how long I've been with my boyfriend, etc., so I'll just give a brief background (skip to the next line if you don’t want to read it). 

First off, most of us are college students [18/20], either working part time or staying at home with our parents. As of right now, most of us are on summer break. We only have two older members in the group, which are R [25/M] and another guy [23/M]. The rest of us are or fall under 20. R is actually married and his wife makes good bank, so he has a ton of free time. 

Second, about my boyfriend. Surprisingly we met through the gaming group, as he was the one who advertised it, which was how I found and joined the group. That was about 2 years ago, and about a couple of months after we met, we just clicked and started dating. My boyfriend has known R for about 3 years, so they're close friends. However, R did not join the group until 6 months ago, as my boyfriend invited him because he thought it'd be fun to have him there too. I did not know much of R, other than that he was my boyfriend's friend, until he joined the group.

  ---   
So, after I posted my original post, I signed up for 2 different groups. The first one was an all-women’s group [16-20F]. They responded to me pretty quickly. They were very nice and polite, but explained that they only play once/twice a week. Unfortunately, that didn't cut it for me. The second group responded to me the next day, and I learned that they were more active but that they're also an all-men’s group [17-19M]. However, they were open to having me there. At first, I felt pretty sketched, but the oldest and most popular guy [19/M] there took me aside and explained to me that he does not tolerate any type of harassment and that he will definitely kick out any of the other guys if they were bothering me. Hearing that made me feel more comfortable and I played some games with them. I had so much fun! All the guys were really nice and friendly. No sexual remarks, no more screaming of profanity against women, etc.. It was nice being in a group of people who were happy to play with me.

After I finished my games and left, my boyfriend called and asked if we could talk. When he came over, before I could even ask or speak myself, he told me he was really sorry and that he screwed up big time, and he understands how wrong he was. He said he didn't want me to go to a new group because he feared that I would leave him too for some new guy. Then he told me that he didn't realize how hurt I was from being excluded from the group because I had never complained or voiced against it, which was true. I never complained about the exclusions, or even R’s behavior before, because I knew it would just cause more conflict. I also didn't want my boyfriend to stop playing with his friends because of me. I explained this to him, and he said he was sorry for not defending and comforting me like he should have been in the first place. 

To my surprise, he then showed me his text messages between him and R that happened a few months ago. Apparently, way before my exclusion, R had a few conversations with my boyfriend, telling him how much of a pain it was to play with me there. He wanted my boyfriend to kick me out. However, my boyfriend refused and told R that was not happening. Then, around the time when I decided to stop hanging out around R, that's when R sent a group text to everyone in the group explaining how he doesn't want to play with the group again, and he hopes everyone understands. Everyone, and to my shock, even my best friend, all agreed with him. Only my boyfriend protested, but R was really stubborn and he had the whole group to support him, so my boyfriend gave up. After showing me those texts, he told me next that he kicked R from their group earlier today. R was not allowed to play with them anymore, but my boyfriend said he'd still be willing my play with R one on one, but only like once a month. Surprisingly, R agreed, and that was that. My boyfriend said he understood if I didn't want to be with him anymore, but said that he truly does love me.

Honestly, even after all that has happened, I'm not mad at my boyfriend. This is both of ours first relationship, and we’re still learning. He's always been kind to me and I’ve never had a problem with him before this situation occurred.  I feel happy that he realized his mistakes and did apologize without me asking. This is the first time he's ever come across a situation where he has no choice but to choose a side, so I don't blame him for trying to do anything to keep the group together. He told me he would also like me to come back to our old group, but he said it's completely fine if I stay with my new group. He knows it was wrong of him to ask me not to join a new group. I told him I don't think I'll ever come back to the old group and that I will definitely be sticking with my new group from now on. However, I will always make time for him and put him first. He accepted it without any protest, and we went back to our usual fun activities. 

I feel bad that my boyfriend may have lost a close friend since I never asked him to do any of that for me. Regardless, I am happy, and lately my boyfriend and I have been spending more time together now that R isn't around as much. I have also continued playing with my new group and it's been awesome. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading this long update! Sorry for the ramble and mistakes, my mind is all over the place right now and I wanted to explain as much as I could. Thank you guys once again!

"UPDATE My [27M] little sister [16F] has many pets which she cares for AMAZINGLY! I want to offer her financial assistance- but worry that the offer could be rude


  First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qj2ho/my_27m_little_sister_16f_has_many_pets_which_she/

I want to start this off with the actual update!

My wife and I went over and offered her $500 a month plus $250 in savings. She asked for it to all be savings, which she could touch if something really bad happened, or she had a large expense. I thought this was fair, and agreed to it. Sadly yesterday her Instagram got hacked and deleted which means she has lost all her sponsorships which paid for a lot of her food and supplies... so that's kind of rough. We are thinking of making a fundraiser for her to hold an adoption event but it's tough because privacy is big for our family. We don't want whoever hacked her and sent nasty messages to know her full name and story- but a youcaring is in the works at one point..

Now to adress some common questions and concerns...

**Will she just keep accumulating animals forever?**

* NO! She rehomes almost all animals within six months. We have driven hours before to drop off animals  she only keeps special needs animals, mice, cats, certain animals  and dogs. We are also hoping to host an adoption event or SOMETHING like that soon... because yes she has many animals right now.

**I don't think your financial gift should have the obligation of taking one day off...**

* I phrased that wrong. My plan is for us to come over every weekend and stay over and take over SOME of the care for her animals. She has a binder on the care of each animal in case something were to happen to her so it's pretty simple.

**how many/what kind of animals does she have?**

She texted me a list today...

She has 

* 3 cats

* 2 dogs

* 23 mice (they just had babies)

* 5 rats

* 3 chinchillas

* 1 African grey

* 2 ball pythons

* 1 sun conure

* 2 lesser hedgehog tenrecs

* 1 hedgehog

* 2 hamsters

* 4 quinea pigs

* 2 Juliana pigs 

* 1 potbelly pig

* 3 Pygmy goats 

* 2 sugar gliders

* 3 ferrets

And a couple more LOL I just don't want the post to get too long 

So yeah I don't want the post to get too long but I'm happy to answer any more questions y'all have! I'll be checking this post often today :)

"Me [25M] with my sister in law [28F] she makes me feel uncomfortable.


My wife and I have been together for 4 years and married for one with a baby on the way. My wife's sister Laura I have never met until the wedding. She was somewhat estranged from the family, as in she lived in a different country with another man and did not speak to the family much due to other issues. She is now back and has left the guy. My wife has three other siblings. 

Anyway when I met her at the wedding she was polite and sweet. She made a comment about me being handsome but didn't think much of it. 

Well I'll get into the story. Basically everytime we have family gatherings at their house or when her sister comes over I feel as if she acts somewhat inappropriate. Hugs kind of last long, she has put her hands on my leg or arm a few times and has left it there. She makes comments about my appearence (in front of my wife). 

She finds everything I say hilarious and calls me her favorite in law. Twice she has dropped something in front of me and has bent down slowly. It just seems all pretty odd to me. 

The biggest thing that has happened was a few days ago. She came over to chat with my wife and they went shopping for baby things. When they got back she complained about her shoulders hurting and  asked if I could rub them for her. Since my wife told her I'm good at it. She asked my wife I mean if that's okay with you? My wife said she didn't mind, which surprised me.

Anyway I did it because I felt kind of put on the spot. She remarked how good it felt and when I tried to end it she said it felt really good and just a few more minutes, afterwards she said next time I could do her feet. 

She's nice and polite, but I just get a weird vibe from her. My wife is so happy she's back and the last thing I want to do is ruin their relationship. Should I just continue to ignore it?

"Me [29F] with a woman [36F] whose job I was given after covering her maternity leave, she keeps harassing me to get together.


2 years ago I was hired to cover Jenna's materity leave, when she returned I was given the job permanently and the company moved her to a completely different department entirely out of her wheelhouse hoping she would quit because she is a rude person.



This woman is manipulative, rude, self-absorbed and has no self awareness. Jenna made life a living hell for me before she went on maternity leave during my training which was crazy because she is the one who hired me and also the one who chose to have a child (it was absolutely planned). My boss and the president of our company did not want to work with her which is why I got the job. In her new role when she returned she was terrible to her co-workers, didn't do any of her work, was running a side business while on the clock, and was trying to get a package / let go from the company. Eventually she had enough and quit herself.



The career we both have is a very small niche role that is very social. There are many people in our social circle that do not know me who I meet that are automatically rude because I ""took her job"". 




I try not to burn bridges, and have not been rude to her at all. When she was still working here I went for coffee and was very nice, but smart with how I handled all conversations never giving her real information (she is a snake!). I do sympathize with her losing her job after having a baby, I will have kids in the future and would be very sad if that happened to me. However, I do think I have earned this role as I am far nicer and also more skilled. 



Closer to the end beore she quit I was politely declining meeting Jenna. She is relentless and never gives up. She is gone from the company now yet she keeps emailing me and calling me wanting to meet up. I have received 4 emails and 6 calls in the past 2 weeks which I ignored because I was on vacation. 



Jenna's side business *cough pyramid scheme* relies on new clients, she has already hit me up to buy her items but I have clearly and directly said no. 



I don't get why she wants to meet up! I do not want her in my life she is toxic.



How do I say no to meeting up with this person, or should I just ignore her? I want to keep a good reputation within our industry.

"[UPDATE] My sister[17f] and I [17m] finally found out the real reason our parents got divorced. How can we deal with the feelings of hatred we have toward our mother?


Original topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6nyg52/my_sister_17f_and_i_17m_finally_found_out_the/)

We posted here a week or so ago about the problems we were having with our parents, and things kinda have been resolved some since then, so I thought I'd update. The same day that we posted the topic we went over to our dad's house. After a lot of stalling and such we never did end up asking him about it on that day since he was extremely happy and we didn't want to ruin that. So we waited, and when we saw him again on Thursday, my sister just let it all out then.

He didn't automatically say anything at first, then he asked us how we felt. My sister told him how she was feeling, and I did as well, and then he just got up and went to make a call after that. He didn't mention anything else about it until later on that day when he took us home, and that's when our mother came out. Usually she just stays inside and we let ourselves in, and I'm pretty sure this is the first time in years they've been close to each other.

We could instantly feel the tension between them, but despite this dad still kept a cool head. All he said was, ""I would appreciate it if you wouldn't discuss those things in that way in front of our children"". There was a little back and forth between them, basically with our mother telling him to screw off, she can talk about what she wants and whatever. Then our dad left, and when we went inside all hell broke lose.

She went off on my sis for being ""nosy"" and ""intruding"" on her adult conversation, and told her to keep her mouth shut about anything she says about dad because then he'll start telling us things that aren't true. My sis was not having it that night and they yelled at each other for at least an hour. It got so bad I had to literally drag her away into her room, but unfortunately our mom followed us in there. Then that's when she said something that I think pretty much gave us our answer, ""...and so what if I wanted to keep my needs met, you'd turn out to do the same slutty thing if you aren't satisfied, so f**k off"". She rambled for a minute about human needs and sexuality and then slammed the door.

The next morning she tried to act like nothing had happened and tried to talk, but neither of us really responded. Later on that day we had to sneak over to dads as she forbid us to go. We asked him a straightfoward question which we said he didn't have to tell us if he thought it wasn't our business.

* How did you find out mom was cheating?
**Answer**: She had brought someone home apparently on the day that my sister and I were at school, and he could literally hear them having sex in the house. Afterwards she just came in his room and flat out told him she wanted a divorce, that she couldn't do this sick thing anymore. And the thing that really struck both me and my sister is that apparently after he was better and back to normal, she asked him to get back together, and he said no. I guess that may be a reason as to why she still has something against him. 

We've discovered so much and its still a lot to take in. My sister is more on the emotional side so it effects her a little more, but just like a lot of other things I know that we'll get over the hurt we feel over this eventually-however long that'll be. For our dad mostly, but also because our mother has done so much emotional damage throughout our lives (not counting this, but it does take the cake for our decision), that we're trying to decide if we even want to continue talking to her when we are older. Right now we've been staying with our dad, and we'll probably be here for awhile. 

To end this on maybe a little happier note our father did tell us that he has been with a women for a little over a year now, and he's thinking about introducing us soon. 
Thank you everyone for your advice in our previous post.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We finally told our father what we heard, and he confronted our mother about it. Mom went off on sis for ""running her mouth"" and they got into an argument, where she basically confessed. We then went to see our father again and he finally told us what happened. We now have some closure, but we're still dealing with the emotional aspects of things. We'll probably be staying with our dad for a little while."

My husband and I moved to Melbourne from Queensland for a job opportunity for me. He was very supportive of the whole thing and quit his job to move. He works in Business and actually got a high managerial role in a pretty big company when we moved here. They liked what he brought to the table. It really worked out for us both, and we've started planning for kids. That is the TLDR version of the past year for us. 

Last week my husbands car was hit by a Hoon when we were sleeping. I don't know if Hoon is a universal term, but in Australia it basically is a fucking idiot who will speed, race, drink drive, do burnouts normally in the dead of night. We have a one garage that I park in because my husband said he's fine with it. He parks on the street corner like is the norm here. A lot of people do it. His car was completely fucked in the front side of the car where the engine is. It's going to be a while before he get's it back. 

My husband needs to get the train at around 6:45 every morning because he needs to be at work at 8:00. He's in a high managerial role which causes him to have to work early, late and even at home to prepare the people under him. It's the middle of winter and the mornings are freezing. It's 1-4°C in the morning here when he leaves. I told him I would give him a ride to the train station until his car is fixed. 

How that you have my side of the story. 

My parents have come out to visit and they're being obnoxious. Every time I come home they open their mouths about how it's wrong of a man to get a ride from his wife. They're telling me how this is wrong to do this when I'm trying to get pregnant. They told me it's the mans job to do this for his wife and not the other way around. I'm losing sleep because I need to wake up at 6 and not 7 to take him to the station. We disrupt their sleeping patterns. My dad just today has started to tell me he's going to tell Muscles (Husband) that he need's to learn how to handle the cold. My husband is not home yet and I'm wondering if it's wrong of me to ask my parents to leave? I spoke to my sister and she told me to send them back to Queensland.

"I [19F] want to tell my mom [48F] that I don't want to wear the hijab any more.


Hi Reddit! I made a new account for this because my old one had too many personal details.

As some background information, my mother and I are really close. She's normally very reasonable and calm, but when it comes to religion she's kind of stubborn. My entire family is Muslim, and my parents were born and raised in a Muslim country. When I was three, we all moved to America and we've been living here ever since. 

My dad and his side of the family aren't as religious as my mom, and while none of the women on that side wear the hijab, my dad is a bit of a wild card. I have no idea how he feels on the topic, and I don't think he would be much help because we aren't very close.
To my mom, religion is the most important thing in our (read: her) life. She works for an Islamic school, all her close friends are similarly religious, and when she has free time she likes to listen to lectures from Muslim scholars. I 100% understand why she feels that way- my mom has been through some pretty heartbreaking things and god is the only thing she can count on. 

As you can probably tell, I don't really feel the same way. Don't get me wrong- I love certain aspects of Islam, and I have always felt at home within our community and religion. My mother and I do tend to argue on the stiffer points (like gay rights, tattoos, etc- all of which aren't allowed in Islam) but those arguments have always been casual debates when the topic comes up. The one thing we have never argued about is the hijab, and that's mainly due to how afraid I am to bring the topic up.

To my mom, hijab is the best way to show your devotion to god, and the topic isn't really up for debate. I started wearing it when I was REALLY young- around 10- and it was more out of a misguided attempt to please her than it was for any religious reasons. That would probably be a really good reason to explain why I don't want to wear it anymore, but it's been about ten years since and she would point out that even if my initial reasons were wrong, that doesn't mean they can't be changed. My real reasons for not wanting to wear it anymore is because I'm tired of being constantly pigeonholed into something I'm not when I wear the hijab. Everyone assumes I'm some innocent nun and that's really not the case. I've taken it off for parties and gotten drunk and high like every other teen my age and I just want to stop living this ridiculous double life. 

My real issue here is that I have no idea how to bring it up to my mom. What do I start with? What reasons can I give her? I know I mentioned a few above, but those really aren't things I feel comfortable telling my mom. When it comes to fights, we've only had one big fight (over my college major) and it was over in two days. My mom's default setting with fights is just to freeze me out until I feel horribly guilty, and then to apologize while assuming I'll do what she wants. I know it sounds horrible, but we're both the most important people to each other and in that case, I wanted to keep our relationship intact instead of doing what I wanted (which turned out fine in the end, since my career aspirations have changed). This time, I want to be able to hold my ground.

So this is what I need your help with, Reddit: how do I bring the topic up? What reasons can I give her? How do I deal with the aftermath? If anyone here has been in a similar situation, I would really appreciate your help.

TL;DR: My mom is very religious, and I'm not. I want to tell her I'm not going to wear the hijab any more, but I have no idea how to bring the topic up, or how to explain why."

Throwaway as my husband knows my reddit account. I do not speak English as my first language, so apologies for that.

 ---

I want to start with that usual statement that my husband is a very good person, otherwise I would not have married him or have a child [7F] with him. He's kind, very generous and spontaneous and the love of my life.

He just isn't the father I had hoped him to be. Now, I might be overreacting, but I come from a household where my both my parents worked but my mother still was the main caregiver for me. She did everything, from cleaning, to cooking, to the taxes and bills and caring for our pets, while my dad came home and did very little. He probably asked me ten questions about myself in my whole life, he was not a very loving person, especially not towards my mom.

I am seeing this behavior in my husband and it is incredibly upsetting. I am supposed to care for the house and child even though we share similar working hours. When I bring this up, he says his work his harder and I have it easy because I am a receptionist. The constant arguing is so tiring and I just want to sleep for a week. My sexual drive is dead and that seems to be the only thing my husband complains about.

I have sat him down so many times to ask him to take care of our daughter and he will for a time, but then he acts like some kind of hero for caring for our daughter or spending some time with her. He does this especially when our friends and family are over and they praise him like some godly father who spends roughly 30 minutes a day with her. It is so upsetting because I do not get this, even though we could be doing the same thing.

I am so done. I have no idea how to get him to turn around and my daughter is growing moody as well in between the sudden amount of love she receives from her father and then next to none. Meanwhile, my husband grows upset that she and I are much closer.

Maybe my husband isn't as great as I thought or described in the beginning, but sometimes he is and I become hopeful again before he falls back into this weird absent father role. He comes from a household where his father was the same, which may be why he becomes so fussy and angry when I try to make him to be a parent.

I am tired of being called a nag, I just want us to be a household of equality before my daughter picks up that his behavior is in any way okay.

Reddit, I have no one to speak to about this and I would love to get some help with the situation. Is there any way to fix this or are we doomed to fail?

Hey everyone. About a month ago, my husband left me for a girl he met in a bar. It was totally unexpected and my whole world seems like it's been flipped upside down. 
Since then, he's asked for a divorce, completely changed himself, and he's been really ugly to me about everything from child support to custody. He's acting really cocky and he's been basically threatening to take me to court to take our son away from me anytime I disagree wth him about something. He's also refusing to pay 20% of his income in child support because he feels that I don't need it. 
I'm paying my half of this month's rent and moving out and removing my name from the lease and he's moving his new girlfriend in with him. 
I'm having such a hard time with this. I don't want him back or anything like that, but I'm so hurt. I have so much hate and ugly feelings towards him and the new girl. I hate having these feelings and I feel like it's making it harder for me to move on. I want to not feel anything towards him or her but I know I can't just turn my emotions off. 
How can I begin the process of moving on? And how can I overcome these feeling I have towards him and her? 

TL;DR - my husband left me for a girl he met in a bar. I want to move on but I'm having a difficult time. "
"[update] Me [15F] with women whose dog I walk [?F] Had a rude reaction to my pet mouse


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6q7o48/a_woman_f_whose_dog_i_15f_care_for_had_an/

I realized that I was in the wrong. I'm really bad at reading social cues sometimes but I asked my therapist and she said that shuddering is a sign that people associate something with negativity.

I sent the woman an email and apologized and said I was simply taken by suprise but was really sorry for scaring her. 

I said I wouldn't even mention him again and that I would also make sure nothing related to my mice were in photos of her dog I sent her.

She told me that she was sorry for reacting badly but that she was just scared and didn't mean to make me feel badly at all.

So yeah. Everything is okay and I learned some stuff about fears and social cues.

Thanks for the harsh but true feedback.

"Me [47 F] with my husband [53 M] 19 years, disagreement about his sister staying in our hotel room with us on vacation.


My husband and I have been married 19 years. We recently went on a trip to Disneyland and his sister invited herself to stay with us in our hotel room. The room was expensive and with her there there wasn't any privacy or romance. I don't like his sister but I was a good sport about it.

Since that trip, when she found out about a vacation we were planning to Italy she again invited herself, took over the itinerary even determining which cities to visit and not visit and sent a list of hotels and noted we could share a room again to save on expenses. (even though she did not pay for the room at Disneyland at all). 


 So I told them both I couldn't go and suggested they go together because I know I will be unhappy sharing a single hotel room with them and not getting to go to the places in Italy I want to go to.  

Now it turns out she is going to Italy with a friend but my husband feels we can't go ourselves without inviting her to join us so as to do so would hurt her feelings. Note: She did not inform me during the planning of her upcoming trip to Italy. She may have told my husband - IDK.


I think it is weird for my sister in law to insist on sharing our hotel rooms with us and also to invite herself on our trips. My husband disagrees. I feel like my feelings are being ignored by both of them and I'm now questioning my own sanity. Do lots of married couples share a hotel room with their SIL? Also, how might I get my husband to understand my pov on this so we can take a vacation without her?

"My [35F] girlfriend is ignoring me [28M] after meeting her autistic child for the first time.



Just wanted to say that I hope this doesn't offend anyone and I'm sorry if anything said is taken rudely. I can expand on anything wrote in the comments if needed. 

My girlfriend ""Julie"" and I have been together for just over a year. We are both divorced, so we've taken things slowly, and it's worked well for us. She's wonderful, and we share similar interests, values, goals, and communication styles. 

Julie is a mother to a twelve year old low-functioning autistic child (I'm not sure if that's PC, but those are her words). It's something we've discussed, and she's shared her frustrations on occasion. She expressed early into our relationship that I wouldn't meet her child until she felt confident in our relationship being long-term. Most of our time spent together was during her child's school day, late nights, or weekends when they're with their father, so there was never even a brief introduction. 

Shortly after our first anniversary, Julie decided she was ready for her child and I to meet. Like mentioned, her son is low-functioning on the spectrum. He's nonverbal, and has a lot of behaviors I've never experienced. He spent most of our time together pacing back and forth or sitting next to Julie rocking himself. He doesn't speak, but he grunts and screams. He'd be okay and the next moment he'd be screaming and scratching or squeezing at his arms or at Julie's arms. There were a few instances where he showed aggression towards me to but Julie controlled the situation. Our visit went on like this for about an hour, but Julie was frustrated and told me they were both overwhelmed and that she'd call me later. 

She texted me that night extremely upset. She apologized, and told me this is why she doesn't date and how she'll be single until death because who could love and accept her and her child. We texted a bit and I reassured her that I loved her, but needed to head to bed and that I'd talk to her tomorrow. 

I haven't heard back from her since that night. I've made several attempts to contact her and they've all been ignored. I'm upset, but there's a small sense of relief. I don't know if this is how I want to experience parenthood for the first time. Her son's needs are a huge responsibility, and I was overwhelmed after just an hour with him. However, I love Julie tremendously, and I she's someone I can see myself growing and sharing a long-term relationship with. I just don't really know what to do now.  

TL;DR My girlfriend is a parent to an autistic child. We met for the first time after a year, and now she isn't talking to me. I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to a life of parenting an autistic child.

Edit: I didn't want to use identifying details at first but realized I made the switch from ""they"" to ""he"" eventually. Sorry. 

Edit: Also wanted to add that yes, I knew she had a child with autism. I never grasped the severity of her situation even though we'd discussed it in detail several times. It wasn't something that hit me until I was experiencing it. My only interaction with an autistic person has been a family member who was just very particular about things and had his quirks (for lack of better term). He was verbal and fairy independent."

My mother-in-law is kind, sweet, and generous, but I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by how much time I am spending with her. I work 32 hours per week, and she watches my daughter until 3:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays and until 5:30 p.m. on Wednesdays. We also get together with my in-laws on Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoon-evenings.


When I come home from work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I want to have one on one time with my daughter. But my mother-in-law lingers for an hour or two after I've come home. She also decides that ""we're going to the park"" or ""we're going to the library,"" and then I tag along, even though I might just like to spend some time at home with my daughter after I've been at work. 
  

The last thing I want to do is hurt her feelings, but I feel like we spend plenty of time together as a family. How do I tactfully explain that I just want to her to leave when I get home from work? I don't think my husband should be the one to tell her this (she's gone by the time he gets home from work). I think it should come straight from me.


EDIT ----------------


Thank you so much for all of your thoughts, comments, and suggestions. We had a nanny until the nanny had to move a few months ago. We decided to put our child in a childcare center that we love. My mother-in-law said she didn't want our daughter spending Monday through Friday in  daycare from 8:30a-3:30p, so we agreed that our daughter could stay home with her on Tuesday/Thursdays. For us, the cost is not an issue. If anything, my mother-in-law wants to watch our daughter every day.

She lives with my father-in-law, who also is sometimes at our house when I get home. Also, our time together on Tuesday/Thursday afternoons isn't adult socializing, it's just playtime. It almost feels like we're competing for my daughter's attention. I think my mother-in-law doesn't realize it -- she's just having more fun with her granddaughter who she loves more than anything. 


But it's hard for me to watch when she (seemingly) distracts my daughter from me with a new activity. Maybe she thinks I want time to relax when I get home from work. But I relax after my daughter goes to bed. I didn't negotiate a reduced work schedule to come home and watch TV while my kid plays with someone else.

(The lingering happened again last night, which is why this sounds more like I'm venting).

"My (28F) husband (31M) struggles to follow even the most basic instructions in the home.


My husband and I have been together for five years, married for one, and I'm currently 23wks pregnant. Recently, his inability to follow even basic directions around the house has been driving me mad. I'm getting to the point where I actually think there might be something diagnosable wrong with him.

I'll preface this by saying I'm not a nag with unreasonable expectations. I only work part time so I am the primary homemaker - cooking, cleaning, washing etc - so I don't expect him to do much. But the few things I do ask of him seem completely beyond his capabilities. It's almost as though he can't cement things in his memory.

A few examples: last year, our dog had to have (very expensive) surgery because she got a bread tie caught in her throat that she must've found on the floor. Last night, I walked into the kitchen after my husband had made a sandwich and the bread was laying on the table open, and the bread tie had fallen to the floor. When I told him to be more careful in future given what had happened to our dog, he just shrugged and said ""sorry, I didn't think"". This morning, after he'd left for work, I came into the kitchen to find he had done the exact same thing post-breakfast.

Our bin collection is every Tuesday morning. His only chores in the house are to sort his clothes so I can wash them, and to take the bins out. For the last three weeks we have missed bin day because he forgot. I even remind him before I go to bed on Monday night to do it, and he says he will, but within the following hour or so before he comes to bed he has already forgotten.

Our cat frequently gets herself stuck on a high shelf in our closet and cries until someone gets her down. Like, constant wailing. I'm short, so it requires me standing on a chair to do it, which is not a good idea in my pregnant state. The simple solution to this is to close the closet door. This is simply beyond my husband's ability to remember. Every single night I'm awoken by the cat's crying because my husband has left the closet open before coming to bed, and because he sleeps like a log I've had to climb up onto the chair every night. I feel that even if I fell off the chair and hurt myself trying to get the cat down he *still* wouldn't remember to close the closet the next night.

I know these aren't big ""issues"" but all the little things - and the futility of trying to get him to take even minor responsibilities seriously - is really wearing me down. How can I trust him not to just ""forget"" important stuff once our baby is born? Will he just leave chokable things around? Forget to make sure chemicals are out of reach? Forget to close the baby gate on the stairs? 

I feel as though his inability to do these things has gone beyond simple laziness. I'm worried he has something like ADHD or an actual diagnosable issue. 

I really don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** : my husband can't remember even the most basic responsibilities around the home."

"My [27M] little sister [16F] has many pets which she cares for AMAZINGLY! I want to offer her financial assistance- but worry that the offer could be rude




My sister got her first pet, a hamster, at age 8. She cared for it amazingly for two years until it died. She was heartbroken. She got another animal last year when she started working. 

My mom remembered what a good job she did with the hamster, and told her she could have any animal she wanted as long as she cared for it and paid for it. She saved for a month and got an African gray. She then got a hedgehog, then a snake.

She quickly became well known in ou neighborhood as an animal lover and an amazing caretaker. She works 40 hour a week in A exotic animal rescue during the summer, and does online school during the year and continues to work. She has really bad anxiety and has chosen online school.

She has over 15 different species of animal at this point. All are spoiled and regularly taken to the vet. She works her butt off and never complains or buys anything for herself. It all goes to the animals.

She keeps on acquiring rescues due to people in our area adopting animal, not being able to care for them, and then offering them to her. She has turned down a few that she doesn't think she could care for (for example a horse). I'm really proud of how responsible she is.

I've reached a point in life where I make a great income and am married with no plans to have kids. My wife and I would like to offer my sister $500 a month to help care for her animals. We are considering offering more- but wanted someone else's opinion on what we should offer.

The extra money would allow her to take in
More special needs animals and help care for her special needs chinchilla which frequently has to see the vet. It could also help her buy things for herself. It's for whatever she wants, basically.

The thing is she's never had any assistance with the animals. She basically lives alone because my mom is always on work trips, and has never had help financially. She's never taken more then a day trip and has told me she can't and doesn't want to because of her animals. I'm happy to babysit her animals and have told her that. But she says she doesn't want to make them anyone else's job.

She's so insistent that she doesn't mind them being solely her responsibility that it makes me hesistant to offer help. 

My mom says she would be fine with me offering help.

Would it be a nice offer? Is $500 too much or too little? Are there other better things I could offer her?

TLDR: my sister has a ton of animals and works 40
Hours a week to care for them. She's a great pet owner and her life is basically devoted to them. I want to offer her financial assistance but she's so clear that she is fine with them being her sol responsibility that i worry she may perceive it as me not thinking she's responsible enough or doesn't have enough $. What do you think? Is there something better I could offer her?

I usually ignore him or laugh it off- I don't want to date him but he's a nice guy. I see him once or twice a week or so. 



He’s told me a couple of times in passing that he’s moving back to his state mid August. Yesterday, he told me he has to move out of his house at the beginning of August. I was curious so I asked him where he’s going to stay and he said “With you or I’ll be sleeping on the streets.” I asked him if he was serious and he said “Seriously, I haven’t made any other plans.” 



Like, what? That's in a few days. He’s a nice guy, but he didn’t even ask me and now is making me feel really guilty. I like living alone. I know it’s only one week and that I don’t have roommates to deal with, but I don’t want to have to share my space. Is it out of line that I’m feeling kind of creeped out, annoyed, and angry?

"[UPDATE] Me [24 M] dating [25 F] for three months; shes moving in with an ex - am I overreacting?


Original post is [here.](https://dg.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qd4p5/me_24_m_dating_25_f_for_three_months_shes_moving/)

First, I want to thank everyone who responded. My main question was truly would this be a deal breaker for others, regardless of anxiety levels.

A lot of people brought up cheating as my main concern. That wasn't it - but again reminds me how a lot of the advice given in this subreddit is black/white and also very focused on infidelity. I'm so sorry many of us have been hurt by previous relationships.

So I sat down with her on Sunday night, both eager to have this conversation. I wrote a note so I wouldn't over talk/explain, which basically thanked her for being so up front with telling me about her living situation and stated that for me, it is a deal breaker that I wouldn't want to continue dating someone who is moving in with an ex in the next month. I let her know that I could see myself falling in love with her (which is v true, if I haven't started yet) as a way of clarifying that that is why this was really hard for me and has been something I've been trying to process/mull over for the past few weeks.


**She understood and then told me that she hadn't even signed a lease on this upcoming place. Turns out, she's just more laid back than I am (I mean heck, we are still trying to fill the 4th room in our apartment) and that she had already had plans to check out other spaces.**

I told her I didn't want her changing her plans over this, but she explained how neutral the situation with her ex was so she hadn't even considered fully how it would feel on the other side, seeing now that yeah - it would be a deal breaker for lots of folks. She respected my feelings and I respected her by letting her know it was something I wouldn't be able to get over and I wouldn't want to make either of us miserable by being uncomfortable with going to her place. Sure, she could come to my place all the time, but I explained how balance is super important to me in relationships. She agreed.

She said the choice she was making was to continue seeing me and learning about us and exploring this. I want that, too. It didn't seem like the end of the world, though she worried about losing me. She didn't lose me, nor I her, because the communication was simple and not full of all the what if's that my brain usually launches my way.

Soooooo we are still dating. She's looking at some places with other friends this week and seemed happy about some of the options, amongst all the other change going on in her life though I imagine it is hard, I will be super supportive and have asked how I can be.

The maturity she showed while handling it and being honest with me makes me like her even more. So hey. Maybe she da one ok. I'll let ya'll know if that ever happens.

**for folks who also have intense anxiety** I haven't had any anxiety about it since Sunday morning (before we talked) when i had written the note, with a line taken kindly from u/tsukiii ""Thank her for being upfront about it, and let her know that you aren't ok with it and that it's best to part ways."" I felt ready and calmer after that. And I haven't had any anxiety since the convo Sunday night :)

"My[21F] ex boyfriend[20m] went to jail because of me, his family is making me feel guilty even though what he did was wrong.


Hi Reddit. I've been going through a lot of emotional stuff this past month &amp; really needed someone to talk to about what is going on.. my friends all live far away now and my parents will kick me out if they find out what's been going on in my life.


To begin, my ex and I dated for a little over 2 years and broke up about a month and a half ago. We were generally a happy couple. We went to school together, smoked weed, played video games, lived with each other for quite some time.. I was pretty happy with how things were between us until the last few months when he started getting into drugs. That's when shit started getting really difficult.


He quit his job for almost two months leaving me the pressure to pay all our bills when I wasn't making enough at my new job. He was ordering ""research chemicals"" and was consistently getting high with a little glass pipe. Wouldn't eat or sleep for literally days. When he got angry on these drugs he would take a lot of things out on me. He did things like punch himself/walls/doors, scream in my face and said a lot of really shitty things to me. In one occasion he even swallowed all my anxiety medication when I tried to break up with him.


Anyway, our relationship was getting to a point where it was NOT healthy. The last fight we got in that ended everything was at the end of may. I stormed off into our old bathroom crying when we were fighting and he ran after me. Threw my straightener to the ground and broke it. Got in my face screaming to the point where there was spit on me &amp; I reacted by slapping him in his face, and that's when he took me to the ground and strangled me. I was truly scared for my life. I didn't feel safe. He left me in the bathroom while I was gasping and continued to break my things. The next day I was foolish and tried to see if we could work things out after I spent the night at my moms. He told me I was a stupid cunt, and to take my dog and leave... so I did. I was hysterical. I even went to his mom on several occasions for help and all she ever really had to say was that she's sorry he's fucked up, like his dad. Who is a druggie and in prison rn.


Anyway, things ended very badly. When I moved out I filed a police report sending them pictures of the bruises he left on my throat because I felt threatened, and knew that if he kept doing those drugs when we broke up that maybe he'd come after me. 


After about a month or so he contacted me once he found out I went on a date with another guy. I didn't reply to anything at first, and even blocked him. He then messaged me on Reddit and I was weak and answered. We caught up for a while and eventually I met up with him. He has been off drugs, and was looking a lot healthier. I had such a great time seeing him and hearing how much he missed and loved me that I basically forgot what he did to me. Took me on dates that I had been bugging him about when we were still together, and I really enjoyed his company.


Well yesterday night I was on my way over to his place and that's when I got a call from his mom saying he was arrested. I tried going to the police station where he was held but they wouldn't let me talk to anyone. I didn't even press charges, the police did because they were concerned. He got charged for assault and attempted murder.


His mom took me to the court house today 
To see if we could get him out and it was so damn awkward. She really doesn't give a shit about me, and is using me to get her son out of jail. Which didn't work btw. I felt stupid after I got home thinking to myself why am I trying to help him? Is he really going to change?  I just have so many mixed emotions and feelings for him still that I let it get to my head. 


I'm not really sure what I should do. He has tried calling me three different times today from the jail and I accidentally missed two of them. The third one I was just too scared to answer. I keep hoping he'll call back again and i keep my phone on me at all times waiting. Idk why I can't seem to let him go. What he did was so wrong but even if I wanted to drop the charges I wouldn't be able to because it wasn't me who did it.


His family keeps contacting me, basically telling me to lie about what he did to the court so he can be let out. But it wasn't a lie, and I don't want to go to court. Idk if I can get in trouble for communicating with him these past two weeks too. I'm really scared and I know I probably sound stupid for wanting to be with him even tho it's pretty damn near impossible. 


Do you think he'll really change? Should I go to court and lie? I care about him so much but I just don't want to make myself lie like that, and the fact that his family doesn't seem to give a fuck about what I think or even believe that he laid hands on me really bothers me. They're making me feel like I was the one in the wrong here. Sometimes I feel like I am. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to lie, even though is still care about him?

"My coworker's [25M] girlfriend [25F] threatened me [21F]


I’ve been working at my dream company in the city for about a year and two months now. We have a very small office, less than 15 full-time employees and with the exception of about 4 “higher-ups”, everyone is pretty young. There are one or two people in their 30s, but everyone else is in their early to mid-20s. The company specializes in something extremely specific, and we all like to nerd out about what we do. Couple that with the fact that most of them moved from far away for this opportunity, and don't really know people in the city outside of work, my coworkers and I became fast friends when we were interns for this company last summer. Another thing to note, without giving too much away, this company is in an extremely male-dominated industry. I’m the only girl in the office, and it’s been that way since I began as an intern. It was weird at first, but the guys were so welcoming and treat me with the same level of respect as everyone else. Since we have been working together for over a year, a group of six of us have become super close and hang out together a lot outside of work. They’re some of the best friends I’ve ever had and spending time with them is always a blast. 

One of the guys, Jack [25M], and I were very close last summer when we were interns. We sat next to each other every day at work and would get lunch sometimes. One day, he started texting me out of the blue, and this continued into the fall, when I had gone back to school. It definitely got flirty at times, and he would initiate conversations about random things for no reason at all, which made me think he was possibly interested in me. I wasn’t really looking for anything at the time, but after thinking about it, I decided if he asked me out, I definitely would’ve said yes. He was cute, had a great personality and we had a ton in common. Obviously it’s never a great idea to date coworkers, but we were interns at this point, both of us fully expecting to part ways when our internships ended, so it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. We never went on a date or anything, it was just harmless banter. 

As time went on, I kind of realized that even though he’s a great guy, there were a lot of fundamental incompatibilities between us and we would probably never work out as a couple. In addition, we both got hired full-time, so not wanting to risk this golden opportunity I was given, I stopped flirting with him. And just as well, because I started crushing on someone else (not in the company, for the record) and he started dating a girl from his hometown over the winter and pretty much stopped texting me altogether, unless it was work-related. We still continue to be great friends.

So fast forward to yesterday. One of my coworkers in our group, Sam, threw a party/BBQ at his place after work and invited our usual crew. Jack’s girlfriend, Lisa, was visiting him this weekend, so he took her along. It was mainly us sitting around, drinking and talking, while Sam grilled. Lisa and I were the only two girls there, and since she didn’t know anybody other than Jack, I struck up a conversation with her while a bunch of us were outside on the porch. She seemed really nice at first, and we were getting along. We start talking about work, and at this point, all the guys went inside to play video games, so it was just her and I outside talking. She asked about what I did, then asked how many other girls work there. I told her zero, and that I was the only one. Her face visibly dropped and she said “Really?” in a very judgmental tone. At the time, I was taken aback by the fact her demeanor just turned on a dime, so I just went on to say that it was weird at first, but they treat me like one of the guys, and we’re all friends, so it doesn’t really matter. She asked me if I had a boyfriend, which was pretty random, but I answered honestly and said no. She was silent for a second before she looked me dead in the eye and said “You better stay away from mine then.” I kind of just laughed uncomfortably, thinking she was just kidding, until she stood up and said, “No, really. If I find out you’ve been hanging out with him, I’ll ruin your goddamn life.” I was stunned. The things she was saying sounded like she was spouting lines from a badly-written movie. I didn’t really know what to say to that, so, probably not making much sense, I just said something to the effect of “I don’t know who you think you are, but you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t hang out with.” I know I shouldn’t have even engaged, but she just made me so mad, and it all came out of nowhere! She stormed back into the house. I followed her in, and just hung out with the other guys, on opposite sides of the room from her for the rest of the night. Lisa kept making eye contact with me while touching Jack, but I just tried to ignore her. Jack didn’t seem to notice a thing, and didn’t act any differently toward me for the remainder of the party.

So now I don’t know what to do. For the record, I’m not scared of this girl on a personal level. She’s clearly ridiculous and crazy possessive. She also lives in Jack’s hometown, which is about 4 hours away from us, and this is the first time in the 7 or 8 months they’ve been together that she’s come to visit him, so it’s not like she’d be around to check up on me. Jack and I never hang out one-on-one, it’s always in a group. If I stopped hanging out with them and decided to live in fear of her, I’d be letting her win, and like I said to her, she doesn’t get to keep me away from my friends. However, I am scared about what she could do to me professionally. Jack and I are on the same team at work. We sit next to each other, we work on projects together and are in constant communication throughout the day. I’m afraid she could tell Jack a rumor about me to make him uncomfortable around me at work. Or, she could make up something really bad, Jack could believe her, get the company involved and have my job be in jeopardy. I worked so hard for this job, and it’s a golden opportunity for people in our industry – I wouldn’t get the experience or opportunities anywhere else. I get the vibe that she’s done this to other girls before, since she was so quick to launch right into a threat, and I don’t want her to actually ruin my life if she has the capability.

So what should I do? Should I bring up to Jack that his girlfriend made me uncomfortable? What worries me is it’s my word against hers at this point, since no one else was outside with us, and he has no real incentive to believe me over his girlfriend, who he seems to really like. Sam and I have gotten very close over the last few months, and Sam is also very close with Jack – should I confide in Sam what happened, and maybe he can low-key bring it up to Jack? Or should I just drop it completely and try to move on with my life? Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL,DR: My coworker's girlfriend threatened to ""ruin my life"" if I continue to hang out with him."

I know this probably sounds petty, and a person has a right to their own opinion, and a person isn't defined by one belief but.. It's not like she's my lifelong best friend. Our relationship is completely over facebook. She is VERY religious. I'm bisexual, and she told me that she was SO relieved when I started dating a man. Just a few days ago, we were talking about the wedding and again she brought up that she's happy I'm with a man and said out of the blue that she would never go to my wedding otherwise, as it would be a ""celebration of sin"". 

I feel like I'm making a big deal about it because I'm getting mad about something that isn't even happening, but it honestly hurt my feelings that she wouldn't want to celebrate love with me in certain circumstances.

Am I being petty? Should I invite her?

"Me [26 F] infatuated with my 7 year old son's best friend's dad [39 M]


My son became best friends with his 1st grade classmate last year. Towards the end of the school year, I exchanged numbers during school pick up with his friend's dad so they could play over the summer. 

I always found him incredibly attractive, but never gave much thought because I was going through a divorce and under stress. The kids have played all summer long together. 

I have developed a huge crush on the dad. I get excited to see him at kid exchanges and even fantasize about us. However, our conversations are usually short and to the point, mostly about the kids. About a couple weeks ago, the dad texted me that he was sorry he is so awkward, and that he gets nervous and freezes around pretty girls. I told him I understand, and that I know the feeling. Though I wish I expressed at this time that I feel the same way with him. 

Ever since he texted me this, he hasn't come to the door. My son will just come straight out when I pull up to his house. I almost feel like he is avoiding me or something. His texts are also short. 

How do I get him to ask me out? How do I express my interest? I don't want to make things weird between us because our kids are so close-so I don't want to ruin that. I feel like he will never ask me out though. It has been months. 

tldr:; Huge crush on my son's best friend's dad. He has not asked me out, though I know he finds me attractive. He knows I was going through a divorce, but doesn't know everything is finalized now. How do I get him to ask me out or should I just go for it? I don't want to make things weird between us because our kids are best friends.  


Update: thanks all for the feedback. It helped me to work up the courage to ask him-and he feels the same way I do!"

"My GF [22] is obsessed with social media, I [29M] don't use social media and she has a problem with that.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 months. She is constantly using social media around me- Snapchat, Instagram etc (she has 13k followers etc). This doesn't bother me at all, it is just how things are now. I on the other hand deleted all my social media in early 2016 and have no ambitions to ever be involved with social media again.

She constantly asks me to reactivate my Instagram, which I always shoot down. Finally I asked her why it's so important and she said that it is so odd that someone my age doesn't use social media, and that it makes her think I'm ""talking to other girls or hiding something.""

I laughed at this but she insists it is extremely odd that I don't use social media and that she feels like she can't trust me.

This seems totally ridiculous to me. Does she have a leg to stand on here?

TL;DR- GF thinks it's weird I have no social media, says I'm hiding something, pressures me to activate IG."
"I [24f] had three nice conversations with my boyfriend's [24m] dad [50s] and now my boyfriend is really struggling to manage his jealousy. What do?


Edit: So I'm going to come across as dismissive and callous at some points. But I'm leaving the post as is. My apologies, my boyfriend agreed to having me write this post and compile answers but wanted it told pretty strictly from my perspective of what was happening at the time with perhaps some commentary on how I felt or thought he was feeling not making it in either.  I'm not in the habit of talking about my private life with strangers on reddit and am just generally awkward anyway, I'm coming from a good place and just want to know what I'm supposed to do to help my boyfriend. I know not to say things so blunt as I've put them here when I'm offering my support and would like to assure everyone that my boyfriend shares a similiar crude style of posting, a lot of the words I use are the words he introduced, and quite a few things are paraphrased from him as well, etc. Also probably relevant is that I grew up without a dad and did not have a good impression of them overall either, sorry if I seem chip on the shoulder or something. 



My boyfriend and I have been dating a little over a year and took a little vacation to visit his parents, my first time meeting them. Due to some circumstances, I ended up meeting his father alone, after he came home from work.  

We had a very pleasant conversation and discovered a few mutual interests. We ended up spending some time in his study going over his materials and a few of his collections. When I walked out of the study my boyfriend had arrived at some point and was sitting at the foot of the staircase. I immediately knew something was up from the look on his face but we didn't discuss it until later that night. His father's demeanor changed completely. He greeted my boyfriend verbally and then barely spoke or made eye contact with anyone for the rest of the night.    


The second we were alone it was a full on interrogation about what his father and I had spoken about. He was unusually flustered and seemingly irate I couldn't produce a court transcript level recollection of what I'd thought was just interesting small talk. He kept repeating that he'd heard his father laugh.  


It was very overwhelming but I finally got him to explain that his father does not talk to him, has never let him in his study, and my boyfriend isn't sure he's heard his father laugh before. The behavior I'd witnessed all night from his father was the norm, his manner in the study was aberrant.  

 
My boyfriend tried talking to his father, both alone and with me, about topics I remembered his father and I discussing and was barely acknowledged. His father was quiet whenever anyone else was around for the rest of our trip, only answering direct questions with mutters or sighs typically. We had two more pleasant conversations in which he was polite and jovial. It was very odd, he'd go from sipping his coffee and asking me questions to flipping open his newspaper and ignoring me the second someone came into the kitchen.  

My boyfriend and his siblings have brought people home before, without this effect. My boyfriend seems consumed with figuring out what triggered it and how to replicate it but I do not have any answers with him. Nothing about our conversation, that I remember or noticed, was remarkable in any way. I didn't even get the impression the man particularly liked me, I thought he was just being polite. I can tell by the look on my boyfriend's face when he's obsessing now. We keep having the same conversations, over and over. I have no idea what he gets out of it at this point, neither does he.  


**tl;dr:** Boyfriend's distant father was friendly towards me, boyfriend can't stop obsessing over how jealous this made him feel, what's the best thing to do?"
"I [22M] being stalked by my downstairs neighbors


So here's the story:

My neighbors would keep banging on my floor (his ceiling) whenever I walked around my apartment. Despite putting carpets, walking lightly, even to the point where I would avoid walking, the slightest noise would bother them.

I've previously made complaints, and this one final time my landlord made it clear to them that if I would complain again it they'd move out.

They look like a couple around 50 and the husband is always home.

So I've noticed that he would always stand outside, when my window is open and just wait there, as if he were trying to listen to my conversations.

I've noticed that when I would leave the apartment, he would as well. When I would come home from the gym, he would follow me back. When I would legit go bring out trash/recycling, he would attempt to go out for a walk. 

I know I sound paranoid, but this shit is straight out creepy. I have no idea what his intentions are, nor what he wants.

I wanted to know what I could do at this point. I can defend myself, but I'd rather go non-physical if anything happens.

Thanks!

TL;DR: My downstairs neighbor is following me, listening in my conversations when windows are open and I want to find a solution for him to stop stalking me.
