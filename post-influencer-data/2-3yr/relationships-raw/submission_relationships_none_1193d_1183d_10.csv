"UPDATE: My(25) BF(28) won't ask for my hand in marriage so my Dad(51) is staging a family boycott of my wedding. Is my BF being disconsiderate?


original post is here,
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/

The wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.

The wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.

The reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no.

He also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.

He called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous.

Coincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.

My husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives. 

   
**tl;dr**: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters.  Everyone is banned from our lives."
"[Update] My best friend [22F] of 16 years who has never shown interest in me surprises me [22M] at my graduate school apartment and seduces me into a friends with benefits relationship.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dh3b3/my_best_friend_22f_of_16_years_who_has_never/


The previous from my first post **TL;DR:** my best friend of 16 years who has never shown interest in me shows up at my college apartment one day and randomly has sex with me. She's been coming over pretty much every other day since the semester started. I've liked her for years but she won't give a definitive reason as to what this means or where it's going and it's scares me.

Despite most people including many of my closest friends telling me to just end things with her or force her into a decision, I decided to just ride it out accepting that I'd probably get tossed to the side when someone better came around for her. 

We went on to be FWB for about 4 months and those were honestly the most nerve-racking months of my life never knowing when or if it was going to end or what she was really thinking. I tried my best to play it off as if it didn't bother me but really it was a bitter-sweet time for me.

After our school semester ended we drifted a part a little bit, we both were spending time with family and friends. We both had extremely busy semesters and spent most of the time studying or with one another so it was expected. 

She ended up going on vacation with her parents to visit her grandparents in England. She did invite me to come along months ago but I already had other obligations so I couldn't go with her despite wanting to.


We did talk on the phone a few times while she was away, I actually had annual soccer tournament with my traveling team and we met this all girl's team at the tournament that I was telling her about it since she plays soccer as well. 

She seemed happy for me that I was having fun but I could tell that it was bothering her I just chalked it up to maybe I sounded like I was bragging or something.

Two weeks later she asks me if I can pick her up from the airport because she flew back early and she nearly knocks me over she hugs me so tightly. She never shown so much intimacy in public before she even tells me that she really missed me. 

It's like 8pm and we go to Starbucks she's being like really different, a lot quieter than normal and she seems a little nervous around me like she wants to say something.

Eventually she confesses that she realizes that she does like me as more than just a friend and she apologizes for her unfairness making me wait so long before giving me an answer. 

She tells me that before she left she didn't really know what she wanted, she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or if she was ready to be in one. She said that she was afraid to get into a relationship with me only to realize that she didn't want it and feared that our friendship would be never bounce back.

She told me that she experienced a lot of things in England and was sad that she wasn't able to experience them together. She talked to her older sister who lives in England who really put in some good words for me. 

So we're officially dating and everything has been awesome, couldn't be happier. Sorry if this update is bit lacking, I tried to summarize three weeks worth into this post without making it a novel. But if you have any questions about anything just let me know.

Thanks for the advice on the original post really gave me some solid perspective.

**TL;DR:** We're finally dating and everything is great. I guess it pays to be patient sometimes. We'll be celebrating our first month on the 1st of July.

"Update: My [39 M] wife [30 F] of 6 years is upset I lost weight and wants me back to before


Link to old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qfpn2/my_39_m_wife_30_f_of_6_years_is_upset_i_lost/

Thank you everyone for your posts and advice. I really appreciate it! I made a few realizations about myself and my relationship to my wife. I wasn't easing my wife into getting into a healthy lifestyle and had completely forgot that when I started out, I took it very slow. It took me 4 years to get to where I am now, and my wife was trying to keep up with my current lifestyle, which can definitely be overwhelming. 

I was trying to look for the perfect opportunity to talk about this with my wife, and to ease the mood a little, I went and bought her favorite bottle of wine and a bouquet. I went to talk to her in our bedroom after our son had gone to sleep, and she had these old photo albums. Apparently she had stopped by her parents place after work to help them with some summer cleaning, and she wanted to keep the photo album to go through their memories. I gave her the flowers and opened the wine and we looked through the pictures while we were cuddling. 

We were leafing through the pictures, and then I saw one of a strikingly handsome man in a football uniform holding a girl that looked exactly like my wife when she was 24 kissing him. My wife was so interested in the picture, and she started tearing up a bit. I asked her what was wrong, and she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her parents now. They're in their 60's, and still in love, but they have lost their shape that they had in their youth. Her dad had a really large beer gut, and her mom was overweight, but they were happy. 

She was saying that when we got married, she was hoping we would be like them. They never worried about losing faith in one another because their attractiveness faded as they grew older, but their love for one another continued to grow. She talked about her old boyfriend, who became so popular in college, and girls threw themselves at him, that he ended up straying; she was worried the same would happen to me because women in the neighborhood started to talk and say they wish their husbands worked on their bodies like I did. She was starting to feel really insecure.

Then I took that opportunity. I gave her a kiss, and then told her that she loved me when I was fat, and women like them never noticed me. She still loves me, but those women just lust. Sure, my eyes might dart, it is physically natural, but I loved her so much, valued our relationship so much, and only needed her in my bed, I couldn't even imagine laying with another woman besides her. She started crying tears of joy, and I didn't stop there. I pushed on wards. I grabbed the picture of her parents from college, the picture she had of her parents now, and a picture of when we started dating on my phone. I told her what her parents did, lose track of their health but still grow old and love each other is one way to live life. They got the chance to see their grand kids, but I know the health problems her parents have. Then I brought up my dad, and how he wasn't able to spend much time with his grandson, and how I want to have the opportunity to see my future grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids. I said I wanted her to be by my side. I took a picture of us now, and had the picture of her parents, and said, ""Why can't this be us when we're in our 40's, 50's, 60's, till we die?"" 

I told her I loved her, but because I loved her so much, I wanted her to become healthy. She doesn't need to get to her pre-baby weight, or anything drastic. I told her my story of how I just wanted to get fit, but then that developed into a desire to look good, too. She admitted that she also wanted to get back her health, and at the same time she was hoping to stick to her new years resolution to lose 20 lbs. We talked, set up a plan, so she is cutting the snacks down to two cookies a day and logging everything she eats, and portion control. That was when she brought up her monthly appointment with her psychiatrist. Apparently she had been going to talk about how she could get over her overeating habits. I felt so bad. I had neglected my wife when I was trying to become healthy, when I could have included her in my journey and it would have been so much easier to do together. We set up an exercise schedule every day, and she was joking how we should have sex every day to make sure we got our cardio in. I took the in, and we had sex the rest of the night. I haven't been as intimate with my wife like I was last night since our honeymoon. I hope to keep the momentum going tonight since we both took vacation for the long weekend ;)

I took the advice of being more intimate with my wife even outside the bedroom, and was kissing her and playing around with her while we were making breakfast today, when I hear a voice shout from upstairs ""DADDY! YOU SAID WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH GIRLS LIKE THAT!"" Ended up having the ""When a man and a woman are married, and love each other so much, it is ok to do that, because that is what leads to a baby"" conversation today. I can still see the shock in his eyes... but it had to happen so I can feel more comfortable kissing my wife and squeezing her butt in front of my son. 

I am so glad my wife does not have depression and that we were able to work together to put a plan to get back her health. She was showing me pictures of power couples, saying in a year or two she wants to take a picture like that together, so I am so glad she has that goal in mind. I also feel ashamed. When I was starting, it was to become healthy, but I liked the physical changes I saw in my body. Then for my model, I picked Leonidas from 300. But my wife, who has restarted on her fitness journey, printed out this picture of a husband and wife who are both fit. It just goes to show who loves who more, and I definitely need to work on that. 

Anyways, thank you so much for the support reddit. I really appreciate the help, and look forward to helping my wife with her journey, so that together we can live a long and wonderful life seeing our son grow older and his future kids. 



   
**tl;dr**: Got some wine, saw some pictures of healthy/fit couples, decided we can do it together. Starting a plan slow with moderate diet changes, 3x exercise a week, and lots more sex for cardio. Scarred my son for life because he knows that maybe girls don't have koodies because his role model is grabbing his mom's butt in front of him. "

"UPDATE: I (23 F) allowed my boyfriend (27 M) to have sex with other girls and I want him to stop.


Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4p11ym/i_23_f_allowed_my_boyfriend_27_m_to_have_sex_with/

So the day following the post I decided to have sex with him to avoid him running out to other girls while I decided if I wanted to continue the relationship or not. After some thinking and re-reading of the comments on my post (again, thanks so much to everyone who helped out) I decided to try and give him a firm talking to and if he still doesn't comply with my boundaries then we are over. I gave him a talk and said he was not to see any other girls besides me or fuck anyone else and that I was the only female he is to be intimate with. He agreed and took it alot better than I thought he would. We fucked later that night. I thought our relationship was okay again.

I was wrong.

The next day I turned my bf down when he wanted to fuck. The conversation went something along the lines of this:

Bf: wait baby you don't want to tonight?

Me: No babe sorry I don't feel like it &amp; I'm tired as fuck.

Bf: Are you sure babe?

Me: Yeah goodnight

BF: wait babe what am I supposed to do now? You said I can't fuck any other girls so you're supposed to keep me taken care of. Its gonna start affecting me again.

Me: You know what I am incredibly stupid I'm sorry babe. Go sleep with as many girls as you want I don't want you depressed.

BF: serious? you're the best britt

Me: (in shock that he had the audacity to say that) yeah I'm serious! But this relationship is over.

From that point I just got up, walked out and spent the night at one of my friends house. Now I just have to pick up my stuff when he's working and probably stay with my parents until I see where life takes me. It's tough after 4 years but I have no regrets. I'm happy and life is good.

Tldr; we broke up :)"
"[Update] My (31F) husband's (32M) mother (60sF) has Alzheimers. He moved her in with us and is not actively looking for a nursing home. My house is a mess and I am at my wits end


Link to the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4knk8d/my_31f_husbands_32m_mother_60sf_has_alzheimers_he/)'

Hi everyone, I wanted to post an update since so many people requested one in the first post. I know it's been quite some time, but a lot has happened and it finally calmed down enough that I could find the time to post.

Good news, husband's mom is now in an appropriate home. We were able to find a place about an hour drive from where we live that was $7k a month and that had pretty great reviews. We obviously toured it first and talked to the staff and asked extensively about activities, cleaning schedules, food, etc. Mother-in-law was moved in this week. We were really lucky, because of our location there wasn't a long waiting list and there were several openings this month alone. It also helped we had a strong referral from her long time physician (the one who actually told us about this place to begin with).

So basically what happened after that post-

I called Mike and told him we needed to talk when he got home. When he got in we sat in my study and I laid it out for him. I told him exactly how I felt about the situation, told him it was enough. I showed him some printouts of information I had on Alzheimer units surrounding us, even articles on coping with having a parent going through this. 

Long story short- we got into an argument. He accused me of being unsupportive, being selfish, etc. I refused to take it. I have been the one to stay home and babysit his increasingly sick mother all day, not him. I told him that and that if he was so dedicated to having her stay in the house, *he* could be the one to take care of her. I was at the absolute limit. 

I packed a bag and checked myself into one of the nicer hotels. I went out and bought some bath bombs and wine and for the first time in a long time I just had time for me. I was able to sit on my laptop and actually get ahead on my work. He was of course texting me and calling but it was just to continue his tirade, which I could happily ignore for the time being. I knew that he would soon be seeing things in a much different light.

It seriously took only two days. He begged me to come home. He told me he was sorry and that he didn't know just how bad it was. I told him he'd have to do better than that and to actually take her to the doctors and get that referral so we could have her moved to long-term care ASAP. Make an appointment at a home. Start prepping her for the move. Until then, I wasn't checking out of my newly found peace and quiet.

He actually came through. Her physician, a really really great guy btw who also had a parent go through this, got us fast tracked for this place. I think that paired with Mike seeing his moms actions really helped to open his eyes to the reality of the situation. She wasn't just ""a little off"". She was actually a danger to herself. 

I also talked to my husband about getting therapy. I told him it would be normal to have feelings of guilt or sadness over this and that I thought he should take the time to see someone. I offered to go with him if he wanted me to be there. He said he would think about it and I decided not to push it. I will take it up with him again though if I see he's not doing well because of it.

He cried a lot the day we had to take her in. When we got home we had a long talk about how he felt and he told me he was sorry he said I was selfish or uncaring. He said he realized how much I must have cared to do that for him for 3 months. I told him it doesn't mean someone doesn't care when they have to just admit they can't handle something. There are professionals for a reason, we're just not them. 

So that's where we're at right now. This week is more about everything settling down, him getting used to his mom being away, me getting the house back to normal and getting back into routine. I've left her belongings in the room she was occupying so he could still have that piece of her and we could bring things to her as necessary. They gave us a list of clothing items needed, but it was mostly comfortable housewear like pjs and slippers and since it's not winter yet nothing bulky like sweaters or coats. I had to have the mattress replaced in her room though because she had wet the bed often and not said anything so it was destroyed. I cleaned up her bathroom and just tidied the room up in general so it was livable again. 

I want to say thanks to everyone who weighed in. So much good advice and words I much needed to hear in that original thread. Thank you to everyone who shared their personal story and gave their suggestions on how to help husband cope. Hopefully from here on out things can be a lot more stable. It's definitely not easy and I wish that in a perfect world none of this would have to be happening, but it already feels so much better this way. 




   
**tl;dr**: My husband finally saw the light and we moved his mom to an appropriate Alzheimer unit where she will get the assistance she needs. Husband and I reconciled, I am making sure to be very supportive of him during this hard time. I put the option of therapy out there for him, but will let him decide on his own. Thank you all so much for your help. "

[The original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lv9f8/my_boyfriend_30m_of_three_years_has_a_problem/)




So I want to quickly thank everyone who shared all of their personal gaming stories with me as well as some interesting debates as to what level of gaming is considered addiction. Also sweet shout out to whoever decided to pm me and say that this was all my fault for making my boyfriend want to escape reality and play video games so much. I hope Jesus finds you before Chuck Norris does... sorry my ""sick"" burns still derive from middle school. 




So on to the update. After submitting the post I read through a lot of material on how to quell gaming addictions and help me explain my boundaries without forcing an ultimatum on my SO. So a day after I went out and bought books from a second hand store. I tried to get two copies of each. I went on Groupon and signed up for a ton of couple courses (fitness, painting, anything). I also cleaned out our refrigerator of a lot of ready to eat meals/snacks and purchased a lot of food that requires some prep ranging from 5 minutes to 30.



When he got home that night I cleared off our kitchen table and asked him if he'd sit with me, no electronics. We had a pad of paper between us and I asked him if he'd write out how much time on average he spends on certain activities during the week/weekend. Work was 40-45 hours, carpool was about 8 hours, weekday gaming 36 hours (hour before work, at least two hours cumulated at work, hour on the way home from work, and average of five hours once home into the night), misc activities an hour (chores and household or grocery shopping). Weekend numbers for gaming were more or less the same fluctuating between 40-45 (saturday, sunday, monday). I asked him to count ""quality"" time between us for the week. As in minimal electronics, cooking together, coffee dates, hiking, dog walking, engaging conversation, sex... it totaled to roughly five hours a whole week, including weekends. 


I then asked him to rank important aspects of his life. They could be in a more important first manner, or just ""here are 10 things that are all equally important to me"". I was the third thing written. His family and security (financial, home, auto are all rolled into that) were the first he thought of, but I'm ok with that. I'd rank my family first too until we are together a lot longer or married. Our dog, traveling, learning, and health also made the list. 


I showed him the list vs. how he spends his time. 


So I asked him to compare the list of things he thought were important to how he spends his time. And that's when the tears started. He asked me if this was my way of saying the relationship was over, and I told him no, but I need attention too. Living with your SO seems like an easy way to spend quality time, and I suppose it can be, but it doesn't mean you should stop ""dating"".




I asked him if there was any reason his video gaming had been increasing as five months ago he didn't play this much. He said that it started as him being a little depressed about our finances, his job being so high strung, and not being able to go out as much wanted because of the finances (traveling, expensive sushi, what have you). He also felt pressure from some of his friends to play more as this was all they did. We talked about my gaming and how he would like for me to play more but recognizes that the fun is taken out of it if he begs me to play every day and is a majority of what he talks about.  In the end the gaming just became a weird solace for him. At first he used it to escape his financial fear, but later it just became a safe space that he was used to. He described it like going to your grandmas when you're upset with your parents only to really recognize how much you love being in her home and how she comforts you... So you try and visit her as much as possible, anything that can kind of trigger sadness and it's off to grandma's. They're out of my favorite kind of chips at the vending machine? Time to play video games real quick so I feel good. 




So we made a plan. I made it clear that I don't want to feel neglected in a relationship for any reason, that I like video gaming with him but I need more stimulation from him than quality time via coop mode. I brought out the books I bought and showed him the groupons I found and we reworked our weekly schedule so that during those free hours he has other activities to try that I'll be doing too. We didn't completely cut out his gaming time but we made set amounts per day. Carpool? Play all you want or read. At work? minimize it as much as possible by reading or working on work related activities so a promotion and raise are in sight to help quell financial freak out nerves. At home? Activities as much as possible with the promise that Sunday's we play video games together for around five hours schedule permitting. 






So far there's been one hiccup. Not major, he told me immediately that he overplayed and would be deleting his apps to get rid of the temptation. He's trying some therapy to help cope and though it's early I think he really is working hard to make things better. He cooks with me and a lot more in general, we play card games, we have our own read at your pace book club (we read a book a week at this point; onto book four soon), and through our activities stay as busy as possible. On our gaming days we make pizza together and make snacks and get ready to destroy on coop mode. He likes being able to do coop more than gaming alone and says that having a big day with him and I is makes not playing as much during the week worth it. 











I'm cautiously optimistic at this point. It's great that he's throwing himself so heavily into everything else, but moderation is still key. Thank you all very much again for help and ideas. 




   
**tl;dr**: So far things are looking up. We sat down and he recognized how much time during the week he spends on video games and we're working on cutting it down. He's been fairly good thus far. Thank you!"
"UPDATE: Me [45F] with my daughters [17F &amp; 16F]. I like one more than the other and I'm having trouble not showing favouritsm.


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4msixe/me_45f_with_my_daughters17f_16f_i_like_one_more/

So I know it's only been about 3 weeks since the last post. Already a lot has happened, and there's probably a lot more work to do but I just want to thank everyone for their advice and let you know that progress has been made! (LONG)

It was clear from all the comments that there were a few issues I had to deal with. 1 was to actually involve myself more in Izzy's life and interests, and 2 was to stop letting her get away with hurting Sam so much and teach her that she can't talk down at people like she is. 3 is to ride it out as much as I can and hope that she mellows out over time like a lot of commenters said they did as they aged. 

So the first thing I did was make a list of all the films/tv shows recommended by people here to look in to, to try and find some things I can watch with Izzy to make her feel included. It was a LONG list and I think we got some really good options that will appeal to the whole family! The first thing I tried out is Steven Universe as just about everyone on here suggested it for me. Izzy actually walked in on me watching it about 5 episodes in (so much for 1 taster episode to see if it was any good)  and sort of paused in the doorway and asked ""You.. actually like steven universe?"" I said one of my coworkers had recommended it as a cute show to watch and I actually kinda love it. Oh I wish I could have taken a picture of the smile on her face. She immediately jumped onto the sofa and started quizzing me on how far along I am, who my favorites are, if I liked this show then I'll love X and started listing off other shows (a lot of which were on my list to try out). 

I told her we could try all them out, I actually already have a few, and reinstate film night - BUT under a new condition to make sure we don't run into any issues again. I purchased some dry-wipe boards and pens and proposed the following idea: During all films and tv shows, there is to be silence as I would like to watch something without it being talked over. However we write down questions/topics we want to talk about on the boards throughout the film. At the end of it, we designate a ""discussion time"" to talk all about it. Izzy agreed to it and said that was probably fair, so that was one win! We've had two film nights since then. The first one we watched was legally blonde and she was constantly scribbling on the board. The discussion after went pretty well I feel, Izzy did most of the talking about how empowering Elle Woods is but I tried to engage her so she didn't feel like I was just glazed over and ignoring it. Sam has at this point finished her exams and took up her volunteer work pretty much full-time so it was just me and Izzy doing this, which I thought gave some nice quality time. 

I tried to find some activities for us to do together that aren't hair/nails and thought she might enjoy a hike as we live pretty close to a national park here, so I suggested that one day. I was turned down but that's fine, i'm not expecting an immediate turnover. I'll just keep suggesting things every few days to let her know I do want to do things with her. We've been watching orange is the new black since that came out, along with Steven universe and sense 8 now, so I still feel like we're making progress. 

Since Sam took up the extra work she's not really in the house much anymore so her and Izzy have clashed a lot less naturally, I still took down some of the comments you guys suggested (Like how by shaming Sam for what she's wearing, Iz is doing the opposite of feminism), but Sam actually beat me to it? So far only 1 has been made when Sam wore a small playsuit out one day as it's been getting pretty warm here. Izzy said something like ""Wow, I didn't think it was possible to wear any less clothing than you normally do. Who's this for then?"" but before I could even say anything Sam went ""Me, because I look damn good in it. Maybe you should try one, it's pretty empowering looking this good"" and skipped out the door. I was stood in shock for a second as Sam has never returned fire before, and Iz kinda did the same for a second before storming off upstairs. She hasn't made another comment since then (this was shortly after my first post) and I'm not sure if it's because they just don't see each other often or Iz was genuinely shut up by one comment from Sam? So I'm in limbo waiting for that one to come around.

While taking Sam out for uni supplies one day I asked her how she feels about Izzy's behaviour, because I really don't want her to be negatively impacted by all this. She said that she gets a little upset when Iz makes the comments, but she knows that she thinks she's coming from a good place and doesn't take it to heart. She also said that Iz would probably chill out after a few years and when she goes off to uni she'll be away from it anyway, so she's ""riding out the storm"" until September.

Me and Sam aside, the new debate group I mentioned in the comments Iz just joined has now become a big thing for her which I also think has been mellowing her out a bit. She's been going to sessions quite regularly, I asked her if they had audiences and if I could come along some time and she said ""Maybe in the future, it's new right now so it's really just class debating"". She's also become really close really fast with another girl in the group (we'll call her Anna), apparently they take the same subjects but are in opposite classes so they never met before this debate group. Either Anna is at our house or Izzy is at hers every day for the last two weeks so I'm glad she's made a close friend she can talk to - she's barely been on her laptop since so there's also less of the internet/tumblr fueling her behaviour. Since Anna came along Izzy has been significantly less argumentative and rude, she's been skipping around the house in an almost dream-like state and it's making my heart melt to see her this happy. I suspect Anna might be slightly more than just a new ""friend"" but I'm not going to push anything, Izzy can talk to me whenever she wants to. 

As for her dad, his project at work is wrapping up so there's now less late nights and they're back to the political chit-chat over breakfast and seem as close as ever.

So overall, I think things are improving. I'd like to thank everyone that took the time to comment, I read through every single one. I will continue bringing up activities and shows that you've suggested over time, I have a list saved of them all on my computer to keep asking her about. Eventually maybe Izzy will let me take her on a hike or go to see a play together, I just have to keep trying. I'll also punish her where appropriate if she calls out me or Sam for what we wear or our hobbies, because it's not okay to be rude. It's a weird line to walk right now of curbing rude comments while also suddenly making more of an effort to take part in her interests but I think I'm giving it a good go. 

TLDR: I'm starting to find common ground with Izzy, she's made a close friend(?) that is mellowing her out, the debate team has taken off and Sam is standing up for herself. It's going well so far!"
"Bf (25M) deleted a lot of my (23F) favorite photos because my ex was in them, doesn't think I should be as furious as I am


This story begins with my ex, Rick and I. My family and his family are friends and he and I have been close friends since we were children, we attended the same high school and dated from 2007 to 2014. Ultimately our relationship felt like it had run it's course and we split amicably, however having many, many similar friends due to attending the same high school and university, we saw each other quite often even after our break up. Because we share such a large and similar friend group, we have many photos together of not just us alone but with all our friends and even with family. Many of those photos are captured moments of treasured memories that make up a large part of my not so long life.

My bf, Adrian and I have been together for 14 months, we don't live together but I do visit him at his place and spend nights there. Anyway a couple months ago he borrowed my laptop to fix something for me, when I got it back, that was it, I'm not someone who combs my photos often, in fact the last time I did update the photos on my laptop must have been February. I randomly felt like going through them this past weekend though and found that there were a lot of photos missing, there are photos of my ex and I alone scattered here and there but most of them are friends/family photos with many people, which happened to include my ex.


I had probably 3500+ photos and I'm down to maybe 1300 now, over two thousand photos taken over many years, mostly by me are now gone. I understand this is partly my fault because not all the photos were backed up elsewhere, maybe 300 or 400 can be recovered, at best. Naturally I called him to ask what happened to my photos because he was the only other person to have the laptop within the last few months. He said that while fixing my laptop, he found a lot of those photos and was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those. I got pretty angry because those photos weren't just about my ex, they were about everyone over a decent chunk of my life and all the memories of fun events and even random mundane times in my life. Yes my ex is in a LOT of them but we've known each other forever and our families are very close, we'd been together for 1/3 of our lives when we broke up and still saw each other a lot after things ended so obviously he'd be in a lot of those photos. It's not like I saw him in a group photo of 11+ people and would start pining or anything. I told him if he didn't like it he should have approached me and discussed it, not acted without thinking and deleted my photos. Especially since the majority of 'couple' pics of my ex and I are gone. 


He says he understands why I'm angry and he did overreact when he deleted the photos but he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this and I do love him but I don't know how to just move past this. He says the photos are in the past and our relationship should be more valuable to me as it's in the 'here and now' as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago.

I should note that he and my ex do see each other from time to time, at family gatherings and I'm friends with his **(Rick's)** cousins and sisters and he's **(Rick)** friends with some of my guy cousins and when we **(Adrian and I)** do hang out in a group with my friends, sometimes my ex is there because well, yeah, we share many similar friends. It's not like we interact a lot or anything but he admitted that since we've been together he's always felt like a large portion of our friends and family don't really like him because they're very fond of my ex. So he's felt insecure for some time and acted without thinking. I told him that my family really likes him and my friends like him as well plus they have known my ex forever so it's natural they may have more affection for him but even so, if he felt that way, he should have discussed it with me.

TL;DR Bf deleted over 2000 photos because my ex was in a lot of them, these photos included friends, family and are from times that are some of my fondest memories, doesn't think I should be angry because our relationship is in the 'here and now' and that's the past"
"I (23f) saw a facebook chat between my BF (23M) and his brother (27ishM) that was very cruel about my appearance. I just don't know what to do because it REALLY hurts.


I will try to make this is as short as possible. I'm taking summer courses and my laptop just broke. I asked my BF (Andy) to borrow his overnight so I could finish a paper. He gladly said yes. As I was procrastinating with reddit in one window the tab at the top started indicating that there was a new Facebook message. Not even realizing that actually Andy was logged into facebook I clicked on the tab, instantly realized that ooops this wasn't mine when I saw the message was from his brother. I didn't cut and paste but basically the message said ""Dude, where's horse teeth at? You're up late?!?"" (I have terrible teeth, yes, not a secret, so obviously this was about me). 

I did not answer but my curiosity got the better of me and I scrolled through their conversation. While there were lots of positive things Andy said about me (she's amazing, she's very fun, I would never cheat on her no matter what [brother was pitching pretty hard to have Andy hook up with a girl from his work], lots of compliments about my rock climbing), he also said called me things like ""NoBoobs McGee,""""Rat's nest hair"" and ""avocado nose."" He also went through a long conversation sort of at his brothers urging that I am far from the prettiest girl he's ever dated and sometimes he misses the dumb, big boobed types he dated in high school. 

Here's the thing, I know I'm not the best looking girl. I wish I was but I've come to terms with my appearance...well at least I thought I had until last night. But I REALLY love Andy. It's not like a first love, puppy dog thing either because I've had boyfriends and been in love before and this is very different. 

I don't know if I should or even could get over this...but I want to because nothing he said was untrue (I have no boobs, my nose is too big for my face and I spend all my spare time outside so my hair is a mess most of the time) and it was a private conversation I was never supposed to see. But it still hurts that Andy does not see me as even attractive compared to his other girlfriends. 

How do I approach this? Or even should I? I know he would feel horrible if he found I knew about this...I don't want that. But I feel like I need to clear the air somehow...should I?



   
**tl;dr**: I saw my BFs private Facebook conversation with his brother that included some very mean and negative things about my appearance. I'm not sure how to proceed. 

Edit: took most of the advice here and broke up with Andy. I can't even see strait I'm so broken hearted and crying so hard. He was very apologetic and said he didn't mean any of it but to the person who said ""can't unring a bell"" is what kept going through my head. I can't even begin to describe how sad I am rights now. I always kept my fair Distance from guys...keeping school, climbing (I'm a semi-pro outdoor sport climber) and my community garden as a comfortable pad between getting hurt too bad. But I am smitten with Andy, everything about me and my self protective side I turned off because my heart skips a beat when he's around me. I'm crushed, I'm broken over this. I know things will be better in time but Mein Gott...I'm sick right now."

"[UPDATE] Should I (28F) stay or should I go? Four years with fiance (36M)


So a little over a week ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o9ddh/should_i_28f_stay_or_should_i_go_four_years_with/ 
TLDR: My fiance was treating me like crap and I wasn't sure if it was just me or if the relationship was salvageable


I was super anxious, ready to be told it was all in my head like he had been telling me for years and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of people that validated my experience. The biggest eye opener for me was FeelingFascination's comment about codependency. I had only vaguely knew about the concept, and somehow always tied it to enabling your partner to be an addict, which I thought I was out of the woods for that with his coke habit being done. But I was very wrong and reading all the symptoms I was mindblown. There was an actual word for what I was experiencing.


I posted the post on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon I'd made up my mind to leave. By end of day Friday, the plan was set into motion.


My brother had booked a Uhaul and I'd booked Monday off from work, a really good friend and coworker happened to need a roommate and another coworker had just moved in with her boyfriend so she even had an extra bed for me. 


I'd planned a ninja move, all my friends came out of the woodwork to assist. I knew there was no value in having a conversation with him as nothing had ever been resolved from doing that and honestly I was scared of how we would take it, his temper has a short fuse. While he'd never been violent, I didn't know if I could take the verbal assault and the emotional abuse that would've occurred if I had to have stayed with him until I could move.


The moment I started telling people, I was shocked at the number who were totally on my side and had some sort of anecdote about how things had not seemed right. The truth of the matter was, I'd lied about my relationship to all my friends. They only saw the show, but many had felt something in their gut wasn't right but they didn't know what. When I finally made the decision, my best friend fully backed me.


I explained to her what was really happening all the things I'd kept from her about his behavior and it all pieced together. She could suddenly see how manipulative he was behind all his charm. The Sunday before the move we all had dinner together, she messaged me later that night aghast at how she had ignored the symptoms all along. That Sunday I had also kept track of all the times my decision was validated, every time he did something that made me hate myself or made me miserable, I sent her a thumbs up on facebook messenger, but the end of the day I had sent well over a two dozen.


On Monday when Jerry went to work, my brother showed up with the Uhaul. Shortly after so did my friends, we packed everything up, I divided anything we purchased together as fairly as possible, leaving him an itemized list. I left him a letter as well, I was going to talk to him later but I knew he probably wouldn't listen and I might not get my piece out, so I wanted to make sure there was no question about why I had left. I was neutral and firm, focusing on my feelings and why I needed to leave


I spoke with a lawyer that was supplied by my work to ensure the tenancy agreement was dealt with and I left him a check for my half of the rent for July so he had time to figure out what he wanted to do.


We had completely moved out by 3PM. My friends took the Uhaul to my new place and unpacked while I called up Jerry and told him what had happened. To my surprise he wasn't angry, he was shattered. He fed me every line he thought I wanted to hear, how tomorrow everything would be different, but I saw through it all now, I couldn't unsee the abuse he had put me through over the years. I remained calm and firm and when he was just repeating himself I told him I was hanging up. I told him I would block him on all fronts until the end of July, he could then reach out to me then if he wanted to talk still.


After I spoke with him and I went and saw his mom at her work. I explained what happened and watched her heart break. She completely understood, she said she had hoped he'd changed but it was clear he had not. She wished me the best of luck and told me to keep in touch.


The last week has been a whirlwind. Jerry has continually tried to reach me through different methods, even including sending texts from the office printer at work (he's the IT man). He sent $100+ arrangements of flowers (which I know he can't afford) to my work and repeatedly has reached out to my best friend in hopes of getting some info on me. He has had his mom contact me a couple times now to sort out other details.


He hasn't been going to work, but he is finally getting help for his depression. The few messages I have seen of his have all been clear baiting attempts of him saying exactly what he thinks I want to hear, but I see through it all now. I see how manipulative it is and it just proves that nothing has changed.


That all in mind, I've never been happier. I was expecting to be crushed, my other half forcefully removed from my life, I thought I would miss him, but I've been finding more and more that I do not at all.


All these behaviors I tailored around his happiness have become glaringly apparent, all the things I'd given up and just how bad he made me feel. I can't fathom how i had fallen so far, I had always been confident in who I was and getting what I deserved, but he'd worn me down to nothing. He'd made me believe I was unattractive, fat, gross, unintelligent and unworthy. That is not the case. I feel so free. 


Just an example of one of the things I noticed that I did because of him was eye contact. The Friday before I left him, I went for a drink with said friend from the first post, I told him I was planning to leave Jerry, friend (let's call him Matt), Matt told me it was the right thing to do and that he'd done the same thing at my age with his then girlfriend, he said a lot of people around the 30 mark go through something like this. He made me feel excited to be on my own again, but he also made a comment that threw me off. Matt said ""I get the feeling that you're not the kind to give a lot of eye contact"" I made a snarky comment about only to people that deserve it and we laughed it off.


Yesterday I was thinking about that comment, trying to pin down what had changed. I used to love giving eye contact, looking into people's eyes told you a lot about them, it used to be one of my favorite things. In highschool my friends and I would just look into each other's eyes and try and guess what each other was thinking. What had changed? And I realized that Jerry had caused me to devalue myself so much that, I didn't feel worthy looking into the eyes of other people, only my closest friends. I was astounded that I had been broken so much that something that been such a core of my human interactions had completely changed and I hadn't even realized it.


This last week alone has proven to me so apparently how unhappy I was. On Wednesday my coworkers all wanted to go have a couple drinks after work spontaneously, and I could go! I got to hang out with my friends and we chatted for hours and they actually cared about what I had to say and were fully engaged. They didn't get mad at me when I disagreed with them, they weren't just holding their breath waiting for me to stop talking. On Saturday I didn't feel like cooking, I had snacks instead, it was great, he would've lost his mind. 



I did the right thing, thank you Reddit for making that so clear to me


TLDR: left my codependent relationship, never have been happier

EDIT: Thank you everyone all your amazing and encouraging comments and PMs. You are all the best and we all deserve happiness and not to deal with this crap. All the love to you all &lt;3"

Thanks for all the comments and thoughts.

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

So I'm sad and newly-single. I've been going out drinking with a good buddy from work, and that has made me feel better. 

I still can't help thinking about her, but I hope that she'll be happy. I hope we both will be. :)

   
TL;DR: I broke up with her. Feeling sad for losing a long relationship, but also excited about all of the open doors."
"My (31 M) partner's (28M) grandmother passed away on Thursday, and his family left him out of the obituary because he's gay and adopted. He took care of her for 5 years.


I've been dating Kris for almost 8 years.  I know his family pretty well, and while his Mom is accepting, his extended family, not so much.   


When we first started dating, he lived with his Grandmother.  His mother was in Puerto Rico and none of her siblings really wanted to help to take care of the Grandmother, so Kris agreed to.  Mind you, the reason no one wanted to take care of her was because she was someone, who at times, was very judgmental, needy and controlling.  But there was definitely a special bond.  She genuinely loved Kris just as much (if not more) as any of the biological grandchildren.  

What I've sensed is that there may be jealousy towards Kris for their tight relationship.  After living with his grandmother for 5 years, it was time for him to move on.  He came and lived with me.  He was always on call, and since we lived in the same town, were available to help out with appointments, and whatnot.  However, since Kris was no longer there 24/7, the extended family became critical of Kris and more exclusionary.  I think they weren't happy about being inconvenienced.  They never treated him like real family, (besides his sister and his mom, who are genuinely good people), and became even worse  after he moved out.   

When she passed on Thursday afternoon, Kris was there.  He was absolutely heartbroken.  Today, I went on my Facebook account and saw that his Mom had posted a link to the obituary.  I had clicked it and was reading it when I noticed that whoever wrote it, had gone out of the way to list all 15 biological grandchildren's first name, but not Kris'. 

I was devastated for Kris.  He had put so much effort in making sure his grandmother had everything she ever needed.  He genuinely cared for this lady.  For them to leave him out pissed me off.  Big time.  These ""grandkids"" couldn't be bothered to stop in or anything when she was alive.  

Kris hasn't seen the obituary yet.  I'm sure he will once he goes on Facebook.  Should I bring this up to him? Should I hope he doesn't notice? Should I say something to his mom? I'm boiling in rage, at this point.  I want to bring it up to his family but I'm not sure if/what I'd say.  What does Reddit think I should do?"
"I [24M] found out the reason my GF [28F] keeps putting off me properly meeting her friends and I feel really low.


Sorry for the title, just want clarify I have met them a few times very briefly, but my GF always seems to want to keep that part of her life separate and tells me she prefers that our time is spent just the two of us. I thought it was odd she's keen on almost non of our time being spent in her friends company but I came to trust her reasoning and just left it alone. Been together one year now. 

Anyway, sometimes Terentia* uses my iPad if if her phone is on low battery and will often use imessage to text which she doesn't mind, we have an open policy with that stuff and we trust each other. So when she gave it back to me other night I went about browsing when a message banner appeared saying 'Why don't you just dump him?' I know snooping is wrong but I couldn't stop myself. 

There's no point reciting to whole conversation, but the gist of it is Terentia is embarrassed by the fact I'm a postman while she's a lawyer and doesn't want me mixing with the refined company she keeps. That really hurt.. I'm no bright spark but I have a history degree and i keep up with politics and general news so I'm not totally stupid, i don't think. I'm not putting my degree to use cause quite frankly I need some peace in my life, uni gave me sleepless nights and anxiety that drained me so my plan is to take it easy for some time and then start my career then. I pay for half our dates even though she says I don't need to so I'm not a mooch either. 

How do I get past this? I mean a close friend of hers thinks she should dump me. I slept on the sofa and just said I was unwell but she know's something is wrong (she can read me like a book). I don't think she knows that I know as I gave it to her straight after reading and just said I thought it was my message and didn't read it. 

How do I deal with this and work past it? I guess she's right about me. My mum has the same feeling even if she hides it.. being embarrassed of my job. I feel like shit right now.

"UPDATE to my [18f] coworker [18f] is publically harassing me to take her shift so she can attend an event I've made plans to go to


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qhv14/my_18f_coworker_18f_is_publically_harassing_me_to/

Hi everyone. Thanks for your advice, the message I got from this sub was a resounding ""SAY NO!"" and it gave me the resolve to buckle down and tell Dani I wouldn't cover for her. About an hour after I made my first post, I answered Dani's texts and told her She would have to work regardless. I didn't get a reply at all, which was weird, because in the past Dani had persistently replied with some sort of argument. 

Unfortunately the world decided to screw me over today. Let me just warn you guys, this is not a happy update and I am getting furious just typing this.  Eager as ever to get what she wanted, Dani apparently had another Girl Scout (the ""friend"" I texted to confirm the meeting) and her MOTHER call my manager and plead to let Dani come to the meeting. It was mandatory for their New York trip, Dani was in charge of so much planning, and the trip might be in jeopardy if Dani couldn't come! Bull. Shit. So Wednesday an hour before my shift my manager called and said that sadly she'd have to insist that I work until closing (8) as Dani had to leave at 6:15. Maybe I should've argued, but I didn't. I mentioned before that I work with kids, and the girl scout's younger step brother is one of our kids, so most likely my manager was afraid of losing their business. 

Work was miserable, I was fuming the entire time Dani was there and after she left and 7:30 grew closer I just got angrier. Nonetheless, I did my job. The kids are always sweet and that helped. Dani was of course chipper as can be! My manager must have either a) felt bad for me or b) seen how upset I was, because she let me leave 15 minutes early (7:45) I still missed most of my boyfriend's performance, I only got to see a song and a half and I wasn't allowed into my priority seating section because it was too late and They'd given the seat away. 

What makes me really fucking angry is that when I checked snapchat, Dani had posted a snap story at the event at 6:45, so the entire meeting must've been BS. I wish I could've seen that snap during work - I would've called her up and told her to come back and finish her shift since her ""meeting"" had ended! I also saw all of my coworkers and several of my other friends sitting with Dani. I took this really hard because I'd opened up to several of these ""friends"" about the whole situation and sitting with Dani felt like they were choosing her over me. 

So, that's the story. Call me dramatic, but I'm done with all those friends who told me to take Dani's shift and also those who sat with her. I don't even want to think about Dani. In all honesty I'm considering quitting because this was so ridiculous. The whole place is run really poorly - other than my manager, my only higher up is my boss who has made inappropriate advances to several workers, myself included. Regardless, I'm definitely going to avoid Dani from now on. 

TL;DR Dani had a GS adult call and persuade my manager into making me take her shift. I missed my bf 's performance, my friends supported Dani. Things sucked but I'll get over it. "

All the advice on the last post was read and appreciated. A lot of people said I should immediately cut this nightmare of a person out of my life. I mostly had at that point (ghosted, polite but not friendly on the fre rare occasions since the trip last year when our mutual friend group all got together), but was not completely cutting until after this was over so she wouldn't cause drama for people who didn't need it. 


What I did the day after the post was talk to Marge. She too acknowledged that Lisa is now a terrible person, but she's at a point where she'd like to remember the good times. There was a period when we were all close, and she wanted to try and recapture that, even briefly. She asked if I could please be there at the same time, since Lisa and another friend from our mutual group, let's call her Edna, would be in town around the same time. So, I agreed. This was about her comfort and happiness, not mine. 


I arranged my trip so I'd fly down to my cousin's airport, which is a bit away, stay there two days, then she'd drive me to Marge's. (That way, I at least wouldn't have to be on the same plane as Lisa there/back.) I ended up getting to Marge's on Wednesday morning and Edna arrived Wednesday afternoon. Edna, Marge, Marge's husband, Marge's sister, and I had a wonderful day and evening. 


Thursday morning, Lisa flew in. At first, she was calling for a ride from the airport. At the last second, because she didn't think to ask anyone before landing of course. Marge's husband had just left for work with his car, Marge was asleep, Marge's sister was running a quick errand for Marge with her car, and there's no car for me to use to get her. (Edna doesn't have a driver's license.) I didn't want to deal with her, so I left it to Edna. Apparently Lisa was too cheap for a taxi, but too ""afraid"" to use Uber, so she tried to guilt it. We both said no. She hung up on Edna. 


Marge's sister got back maybe 15 minutes later with two of Marge's prescriptions. Lisa called her while she was out, but she explained she needed to get the medicines back and be at the house in case Marge needed to be driven somewhere, so take a cab and she'd pay for it. 


Lisa got here. Marge's sister met her at the door, and went with her to pay for the cab. Edna and I were in the living room and waved/said hi while the two of them hugged hello. Lisa sneezed twice during this exchange, and said her allergies were really bad. Ok. I have allergies. It's summer. I understand. She and Marge's sister went to the cab and stuff. 


Now, I'm not exactly sure what happened in that span of going to the cab, paying the driver, and getting the bags, but apparently something happened to make Marge's sister realize Lisa was sick. Which, as anyone who knows is not what anyone with stage IV cancer NEEDS around them. 


There was yelling from Marge's sister, rightfully so, because a sick (maybe infectious) person just hugged someone who is one of the two primary caretakers for a very sick woman. Lisa was yelling because she paid for this trip in advance and this was probably her last time to see Marge.


Lisa acted as though she's going to walk into the house, and Edna and I both stood on the porch. We told her it WASN'T happening and Marge's sister said she needed to leave, stay in a hotel, and maybe if she's recovered before she has to fly back in a few days, she can come and see Marge. Lisa claimed she doesn't have money for a hotel, that we're being bitches, and was again being terrible. She said she wanted to see Marge and have her weigh in. We didn't let that happen and threatened to call Marge's husband if she doesn't immediately get a cab or Uber and leave. 


So, we pretty much left Lisa in the driveway. She's on her phone. Marge's sister asked us to bring her some hand sanitizer and her phone and stays outside.  


Marge's sister called Marge's husband to report what happened. Lisa's phone call wasn't to a cab company, but to wake up Marge and try and guilt her way in. Marge told her that she can't see her or let her stay with her when she's sick and possibly contagious. Marge also said she had to tell Lisa she wasn't paying for a hotel for her. 


At this point, Marge's sister was almost afraid to go back in the house. She's worried she could be contaminated, and after talking to Marge's hubby had texted to make arrangements to stay with one of Marge's husband's cousins for a few days as a precaution. Overkill? Maybe. But she's there every day caring for Marge, so better safe than sorry. We waited to be sure Lisa does get in a cab or Uber and went. (She did.) Marge's sister packed a bag while I got a cab to take me to a car rental place. 


So it turned into Edna and I visiting with Marge. Marge's sister ended up being okay. She's here all the time and deserved a three day breather anyway. 


Lisa tried texting Marge and her husband a few times. Marge's husband was handling all communications with her, so it's less stressful. Apparently she tried to say she was better over a text the day before her flight home, but wouldn't actually talk with him on the phone, so we all figured she was still unwell and knew speaking would reveal how stuffed up/scratchy her voice is.


I haven't heard from Lisa since. From what I've heard, Edna, Marge, and Marge's sister haven't either. Marge and her sister are both upset about the situation. It was a lovely trip, aside from this momentary drama though!


TL;DR: Old friend (now barely acquaintance) was terrible, selfish, and inconsiderate when we went to visiting another old friend with cancer. She wanted us to go visit together again. I did what our ill friend wanted. Nightmare old friend was still a nightmare, but didn't ruin the trip."
"Our [19F twins&amp; 21F] brother [14M] discovered out older brother [25M] body after he killed himself. Our parents are refusing to get him into therapy


**Our sorry for typo**

Hi Reddit, so this is a really touchy subject. 

My older brother Rick was a really good guy, he just made some really bad life choices. Rick got into drugs, gambling, and his life was going downhill fast no matter how much anyone tried to help him. He lived with our parents and one day our little brother Jack came home to Ricks body. He saw rick had shot himself in the bathroom and killed himself. 

Jack called 911, the police called our parents and they called us. We are all extremely sad and it hit Jack the hardest. He does not smile anymore, he has become extremely overly attached to us, to the point where he will stop us his sisters from leaving. He throws up when he sees ketchup/raw meat/blood/bones. The list goes on and we have to go back to college come the fall. We can't leave him here knowing he is in such a bad place. 

We live in the state of Ohio, so if anyone knows if there is anything legally we can do please let us know. 

We have all insisted they get him into therapy, and our parents don't want too. They think therapy is a waste of money and time. They think jack will get over this eventually. They had to move house because Jack refused to go back in there. 

tl;dr: Brother killed himself and little brother discovered the body. Parents are refusing to get him into therapy.  "

[Here's a link to my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4maa84/someone_23ish_f_messaged_me_23_f_telling_me_my/). I posted it a while ago so I'm not sure if anyone remembers but he was probably abusing me all along and I just thought he had a controlling personality. 

I've basically flip flopped on whether or not to break up with him for the past few weeks because he won't seem that bad to me and then he'll do something awful, but then he's apologetic after and has a good excuse for it and he's the perfect boyfriend again. 


I finally broke up with him because he took his sex games way too far and he hurt me badly. He's been harassing me so I moved in with a former friend with benefits and he started harassing him too and he came to his house and tried to fight him and is making all kinds of threats. It was crazy, he is such a violent person and I honestly didn't realize it before that girl messaged me. I was being so stupid before but I'm just glad she told me, that was a really nice thing to do.

"Boyfriend (M27) doesn't seem to think new roommate (M26) should pay rent UPDATE


[Click here if you want to read the first post.](https://redd.it/3zf31r)


Oh boy. A lot happened after that last post. Boyfriend started acting very ... strange. T moved in, was written onto our lease, and things were okay for a couple of days. He paid rent and helped cook and clean. T kept inviting girls over, but whatever. They didn't disrespect us, didn't make a lot of noise and mostly stayed in his room. I also told T and Boyfriend that I am moving as soon as possible.


Incident one: I was sitting on the couch next to him and got a message from a friend with a funny gif of a a cat. I smiled when I saw it. Boyfriend immediately asked who I was talking to, why was I smiling, and then demanded to know when I was moving out. 


Incident two: Boyfriend asked me who ""Christian"" is, and added that he saw that this ""Christian"" said I didn't text him back quick enough - I don't know anyone by the name of Christian and told him as much. He refused to believe that I don't know anyone with that name.


Incident three: we watched a documentary about Ukranian revolution in 2014. Afterwards I googled to find out more about the man that was stripped naked by the police and the consequences of this. Boyfriend, however, insisted that those weren't police but regular people. He got huffy, said that I *always* have to be right, and told me that I am an idiot.

Incident four: we (Boyfriend, T and I) were at a birthday party for a mutual friend. As I was nursing my beer the others were playing a game of ""I have never ..."" and ""I have never sent nudes"" came up. Boyfriend sneered under his breath that he wish I would send nudes to him instead of random dudes. I have never sent nudes to anyone. My mood was ruined, so I got my jacket, bid the host farewell and went home. Boyfriend got home later, went ""I think we should take a break"" which I countered with ""I'm too old for that bullshit"" and that was it. We broke up - or so I thought. The next day Boyfriend insisted that he thought we had patched things up. Nope.


This all happened over the course of a month. Then it happened. I found an apartment. Nice location, a bit small, but rent was reasonable and I liked it. Of course I took it. I told Boyfriend, and he panicked. ""I didn't think you'd move"", ""please stay here"", ""I don't know what to do without you!"", but what's done is done. I wanted out. 


As soon as T found out that I really was moving out, he went ""I'm out"" and moved too. I guess their friendship wasn't as strong as Boyfriend had thought it to be. 

And so I started packing my belongings. I asked around and found a few people willing to help me move, all of them big strong men because I am but a small woman with little strength in my upper body. I got myself removed from the lease and paid the deposit and first month of rent for the new place. After the moving was done we had pizza. It was great.


However ... Boyfriend soon found out that, nope, he couldn't pay the rent himself. He demanded that I helped him pay until he found another place. I said no, I have no obligation to do that and that I have been nice to him for far too long. He got pissy and unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse. I blocked his number. I am happy and care free and he can go fuck himself.




TL;DR - We are never ever getting back together. "
"Me [26M] with my ""friend"" [26F] who was interested in me but I wasn't in her


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pgvev/my26m_friend26f_with_autism_has_been_displaying/


So shit hit the fan this weekend. The Friday after I posted one of my friends (one of the same who has been asking me if I'm interested in Yasmine) texted me and said we were all gonna meet up at Chili's later. I said I'd be there, and lo and behold when I show up it's just Yasmine at a booth alone.


They fucking set me up on a surprise date.


I had no idea what to do, I was ready to walk out but I figured this  is probably gonna have to be the time to set her straight. And if shit hits the fan at max speed I can at least get some big mouth bites to go. So I go over and sit with her, and she thanks me for agreeing to go on a date with her. I take this chance to tell her my feelings as gently but firm as possible. I took a lot pf peoples' advice and said as a rule I don't date within my friend group, and that I think that we are too different to be a healthy couple. I also told her I didn't like being tricked into a date and that I felt very disrespected.


I would love to say that she understood what I was saying and where I was coming from. But like I feared she lost it. How could I lead her on and I'm just some man whore who likes to tease women. She also said that nueros like me have know idea how hard it is trying to date when you're autistic and how if she wasn't burdened by this I'd probably have taken her to bed already. She then got up and threw my drink in my face. I wish I was kidding (or had gotten water instead of tea). The entire restaurant was staring and I left without any food.


I get back home and after a while my phone starts buzzing periodically with everyone in our shared group of friends texting me asking what the hell happened or berating me for breaking her heart. Todd(roommate) came in and showed me his phone asking why was Yasmine texting him this. She sent him a text saying that I had been horribly rude and sexist on a date that night and basically told her I'm not dating you because you're autistic and asked him to give me a piece of his mind about it. 


So my worst fear came true and she was turning my entire friend group against me. I even got some texts from unknown numbers saying what a terrible person I was. However one of the unknown texters texted me ""Hey am_i_anass, so I'll make this quick. Yasmines my sister and she texted me tonight saying that you broke her heart and Gave me your number to harass you. I'm not gonna do that"". So I texted him back and it turned into a long conversation about how when Yasmine was diagnosed her parents immediately started giving her special treatment and she just turned into this raving bitch because of it. So she wasn't faking like a lot of people said but she was entitled. Her brother was such a nice guy and he really gave me a good pep talk about standing my ground. Keep in mind this all happened Friday night.

So Saturday rolls around and me and Todd are talking in the living room about what to do next. He said he backed me 100% and if we had to be the two amigos again he was ready to cut out our friend group. I go through all the messages from my friends again and thankfully not everyone was accusatory towards me but no one besides Todd and Yasmine's brother was really on my side. I ended up sending a massive group text to everyone besides Yasmine and the unknown numbers(who were blocked instantly) giving my side of the story and kinda telling them off for instantly jumping on the band wagon against me(like I said not everyone was mad but no one else came to my defense) and not thinking about what kind of person I am before condemning me. And that by just assuming I should've dated Yasmine to appease/pity her then they were the ones treating her differently because of her illness and not me. 

It's currently Monday morning and so far a couple people have texted/called me and said they agreed with me and apologized to me. None of the girls have and I'm going no contact with everyone else until they apologize. I' not going to speak to Yasmine or the female friend who set me up on the date again. 


**tl;dr**: Set up on a surprise date. Shit hit the fan with Yasmine. Friends are picking sides and luckily not everyone is choosing Yasmine."

https://redd.it/4ny50g

Not much to update besides that I decided not to do it. As most of you have said good friends are in short supply especially for someone like me and I don't want to make things awkward between us. Even if he decided to be my FWB what would happen when he wanted to date someone else? He would need to end our friendship. I need a good friend more than I need a sexual partner.

I'll just keep waiting for the right moment with the right person. It might take a few more years but that's life.

My sister wants me to keep an open mind about the idea of a sex worker. I'm still not comfortable but I'll keep an open mind. But that's all I have to update.

Again thank you for reminding me of what's really important.

"My [22F] boyfriend [24M] of 5 years has bought me a ""vanity"" engagement ring?


Hi all. 

So a few weeks ago a mysterious package arrived for my boyfriend and wouldn't tell me what was in it. I just left it as something personal. I was tidying up his shelves because he collects a lot of merchandise and it was getting dusty. We share a studio flat so space is limited and dust makes me sneeze so I have to keep it wiped down. 

I found two boxes I'd never seen before, they were white cardboard and said final fantasy on them. I opened one to see what merchandise my bf had forgotten to show me (he always shows them off) and inside one was an engagement ring. Yay right?  The issue is.. its an official final fantasy engagement ring and pendant cloned from Serahs.

Final fantasy is his favourite game in the world. I don't really like it much myself, I'll watch him play it but I won't play the single player games. I did play FFxiv for a short time but it was nothing super to me.

I looked it up and these sets were $229 each and he had bought 2. We have discussed marriage lately so I would assume he was planning to propose, why would you buy 2 if you were only buying them for merchandise?

I don't know how to react when he proposes. I feel like he's bought something special to him that has no relevance to me. I feel hurt, I don't want to look at this ring and just think about him comparing me to his favourite video game. 

What should I do? Should I tell him I found it? Shall I wait for him to propose? I don't want to hurt his feelings but I don't think he's considered me at all in his decision, he's just fanboy purchased this. 

Thanks a lot.

TLDR : Boyfriend bought me a final fantasy engagement ring because he loves the game and I don't like it myself.

Edit: ive updated some info for clarification. I'm not trying to come across as a materialistic bitch, I still wear a cheap ring he got me 4 years ago that turns my finger green. "
"My [early20s/F] sister [late twenties] is youtube/instagram famous and won't respect that I don't want any part of her videos/media presence and don't want to be in her wedding party because it will be all over it.


I'll use some fake names to make this a bit easier. I've been intentionally vague ages just because giving that information *might* make it possible to work out who my sister is and therefore who I am. 

I'm one of 4 siblings. Vanessa is the oldest and in her late twenties. Thomas is about 2-3ish years younger and then there is myself and my twin brother Matthew who are in our mid-early twenties and a couple of years younger than Thomas. 

So Vanessa is very into the whole YouTube/Instagram 'celebrity' scene and started with makeup tutorials now and has a pretty famous youtube/instagram channel with her faincee who we'll call Jeremy. In the beginning, it was just a thing Vanessa did but it really sort of took off an exploded over the last couple of years and Vanessa and Jeremy now has several hundred thousand followers with their ""daily life"" Vlog. 

Thomas and his fiancee are now getting into the whole Vlogging stuff, kinda piggybacking off the success with Vanessa and Jeremy.

Matthew and I have absolutely zero desire to be ""internet famous"". A couple of reasons. It is just not just my thing firstly, I'm someone who doesn't really like attention. I'm not only on the quiet/introverted side as is (which can come across as awkward), but I also suffer from anxiety and am quite thin skinned and wouldn't really be able to handle the 'haters' side of it. It is a big reason I don't want to be all over this.  Matthew just thinks it is all stupid. And neither of us like being bugged by their fans. Like when Vanessa tagged us in a picture (despite us asking her not to upload/tag is in pictures), I had to clear 500+ follow requests and change my instagram name.

The problem is now  

But Vanessa and Thomas want all these family events to be part of the vlog and are having trouble respecting that Matt and I do not want this. Vanessa is annoyed I don't want to be in her wedding party because she plans to vlog all the bridesmaids stuff, they are annoyed Matt and I don't want to go to a surprise party she is planning to throw for our mother's birthday because it ill be all over the internet, you get the idea and it is causing a ton of arguments and is the huge reason I am planning to move to Europe for graduate school.....I want to be away from it all. Vanessa was annoyed when I didn't want a siblings day pic uploaded on her Instagram because 'now I look like a bad sister'. All she cares about is how she looks to her followers, not how we actually feel about it. Our mother keeps encouraging us to be more 'open minded' about it because of the financial benefits to Vanessa (and hopefully Thomas, because that is what he wants) but I'm not willing to sacrifice a large part of my privacy for Vanessa's financial gain. 

The wedding thing is also become a huge issue and my parents think I should suck it up because it is Vanessa's wedding and 'her way', but the mere thought of being filmed all day makes me feel like I'm going to have a panic attack. I am worried about the long term implications for the family relationships if I don't do it. 

How can Matt and I force Vanessa (and Thomas) to stop being so self centred and make her understand that while she might be making the choice to put herself and her life out there, it doesn't mean the rest of us want to. 

**tl;dr: Sister is a youtube celebrity / instafamous but won't respect that myself and my brother don't want to be a part of it all.    how can we best enforce boundaries?**"
"My Friend(31F) had a very Disturbing Wedding Ceremony, should I say something?


I’ve known my best friend “Laney” since we were both eight years old.   We shared everything together, we were closer than sisters, her parents used to call me their third daughter, etc.    We’ve inevitably grown apart somewhat as adults, especially as I moved to a different city a few years ago, but we still talk on the phone and we hang out when I come back to visit my parents every few months.  

Laney got married two days ago.  This is her second wedding, she married her high school boyfriend first and had two kids with him but divorced him before the second was born because he’d become an alcoholic and drug addict.   From what she and everyone else had said, her new husband ""Shane"" seems like a great guy and everyone was really happy to see Laney get with him after what she went through with the ex.  He’s sober, hardworking (both Laney and Shane have the same job in the medical profession) loves Laney and is wonderful with the kids, they both just light up when he comes into a room.  

Shane proposed after they’d been dating about a year and a half.  Laney would have been just as happy to elope since she’d done it all before, but this is Shane’s first wedding and he and his family wanted a  big one, so that’s what they did.   

 They used Shane’s family minister.  

The minister opened with the quote about Eve being made from Adam’s rib as a helpmate for him, and then the ENTIRE ten-minute speech he gave was about women submitting to and obeying their husbands.  It was gross.  He even mentioned Laney having resistance to the idea during pre-martial counselling, he said they had “discussed it many times” and made it sound like he had talked her around to it.  He said something like “A lot of women have a problem with the vow to ‘obey’ because it is sometimes used to justify things that God wouldn’t approve of.  They are afraid to follow.  But you show them a godly man who they trust, who is following God’s plan to be a worthy leader in their lives, and I haven’t yet met a woman who would object to letting that man lead them”.   

That was paraphrasing since I don’t remember his exact words, but the whole mini-sermon was like that, just his ramblings on what submit and obey meant, and how the man as the provider and leader has “sacrificial love” for his family.  


 I think Laney’s dad was upset by it, because when the minister finally asked him “Who gives this woman?” he answered in a very loud voice, “Her MOTHER and I do.”    It sounded like a subtle fuck-you.  Afterwards I asked my husband if I was alone in thinking that was disturbing and he said “No, it was like she joined a fucking cult, it was that bad.”   We fist-bumped and reconfirmed that we were equal partners.    Laney’s sister came up to me during the reception, more than a little tipsy, and went on a rant about it.  Her brother joined us and agreed.  They had known Shane’s family was evangelical Christian, but hadn’t been expecting anything like this.  The only previous hint was the speech Shane’s father gave at the rehearsal dinner, when he mentioned being the head of his family and said that he knew Shane would be a great ""leader"" for Laney and her kids.  


Now I’m both disappointed in and worried about my friend.  I hate that she thinks of herself as a second-class citizen in her own home.  I can’t believe she took those vows in front of her daughter.  I wish she hadn’t set that example in front of my kids- I wouldn’t have brought them if I’d known.  A lot of people were speculating that Shane doesn’t believe this bullcrap, that he only went with it to placate his family.   But if he does it seems to point to a lot of scary thought processes.  

Laney is away on her honeymoon, how should I bring this up with her when she returns?  Or should I at all?  Her family is very low-drama and non-confrontational, I don’t know if anyone will say anything besides me.  Are my instincts even right on this?  I have a history of awkwardness, maybe I should just let it be?  If I should talk to her, how do I do it without upsetting her?


TL;DR:  My friend had a sexist and disturbing wedding ceremony, I am worried, should I say something to her?"

"My[26F] Dad[58M] wants me to apologize to his girlfriend's children [29M, 27F] for pointing out their racist comments about my own race.


Bare with me, I’ll try my very best to keep this as short as possible.

My parents split when I was 23 and my sister was 20.  They were such a poor match and I’m surprised they lasted so long, and both of us breathed a bit of a sigh of relief when they split.  Everyone was immediately happier, and since then, both of our parents have found new partners.  

I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad, albeit a bit of a strained one.  My dad is a fair bit less politically correct than I am (and I am hardly PC at all, trust me).  He calls things that are stupid or that he doesn’t like ‘gay’, he uses the word fag to describe gay people, thinks Hillary Clinton would be a bad president because ‘she’d nuke everyone on her period’ and laments that he can’t use the N word in public.  He’s the epitome of out-of-touch late 50’s lily-white guy, is what I’m saying.  I love my dad, and while these things bother me, there’s literally no changing him, so I have to just bare it when I’m hanging out with him.  And, an important note is that while my dad says some sexist, homophobic shit, he NEVER does so in public.  At the very least, he knows when to keep his opinions to himself and his family.

Recently, my dad’s been seeing this woman, let’s call her Iris.  Iris has two kids as well, 29M and 27F.  I don’t really know Iris very well, I ‘met’ her earlier this year at my dad’s place but only very briefly as I was dropping off a few things with my dad.  My sister’s never met her before, and neither of us has met her kids before.  My dad really likes this woman, so he wants all of us, both sets of kids to get to know each other and the parents so we can all ‘be a blended family’ (despite my dad’s political incorrectness he can be adorable sometimes)

So Dad invited us all out to dinner.  My sister’s known to be a bit bristly with strangers so I told her to be on her best behavior, because I want our dad to be happy and I didn’t want to offend Iris or her kids.  So we sit down and all start trying to get to know each other.

My Dad chose a Mexican restaurant to take us out to, because it’s our whole family’s favorite type of restaurant.  My mom is Mexican, and growing up we had the most bomb-ass authentic Mexican food all the time.  Since my mom and dad split, my dad has been trying to fill the hole my mom’s great cooking left in his belly, so to speak, and is a taqueria-junkie!  Also important to note; me and my sister, despite being half Mexican, have really white skin.  We have obviously Mexican features (or at least I think they’re obviously Mexican) but everyone always assumes we are of white European descent because of the color of our skin.

So we sit down with Iris and her kids, and immediately her kids start complaining.  These are grown ass adults complaining that half of the menu is in Spanish.  Next to each thing on the menu was the Spanish name and the English name, and all the descriptions were in English, so it wasn’t like an English speaker couldn’t read it!!  I am near fluent in Spanish and my sister speaks passably, and we’re both in school to become English-Second-Language teachers, but we tried to settle the hair on the backs of our necks and ignore them.  We actually manage to have a pleasant convo with them otherwise, until the waiter comes over to get our drink orders.

Iris’ son snapped at the waiter like a dog to get his attention and take his order first, and her daughter spoke in a highly condescending voice, very slowly, like this man working at a restaurant that caters to big fat white people couldn’t understand damn English!  Iris was normal, thank god, but when the waiter (bless his jolly soul he was so kind despite being treated like an idiot by those two) left, her son remarked that he didn’t expect the service to be very good, “I don’t even know if he could understand us.”  My Dad has been to this place before so he said “no, the service here is great, you’re going to love this food, I recommend (I can’t remember what exactly he recommended)!” trying to smooth things over, and then the son says “not like I could understand him either with that god awful accent!  These people need to learn English if they want to come to America!  Probably an illegal or some shit.”

Me and my sister are generally nice, kind people, but no one has ever accused us of being patient or suffering fools silently.  So, because we’re petty, we just gave each other a look and started speaking only in Spanish to one another for the rest of the night.  I felt bad, because Iris looked mortified, but it felt so good to be so petty for the next hour or so through dinner.  We of course switched to English to talk to Iris or her kids, but with each other and my Dad, who can understand it but not speak it, we spoke the most rapid fluent Spanish we could muster.  And at every opportunity my sister would try to mention that we were Mexicans and had grown up in a Hispanic household with our mom and her extended family.  

Since then, my Dad’s been texting and calling us (mostly me because I’m usually the ringleader of these sorts of things) begging for us to apologize to Iris’ kids for embarrassing them.  For embarrassing them!!  I’m sure my Dad didn’t know they were going to be so racist towards Mexicans (or else I’m sure he wouldn’t have invited them to go out for Mexican food) but I know he doesn’t even think what they said was that racist.  He’s said that ‘they could have been worse’ and ‘there was no need for you to humiliate them and Iris like that!’  I agree, Iris was lovely, I should have taken her feelings into account, and I have no problem calling or meeting her to apologize for acting so petty and childish, but damn it, I do not want to apologize to racists for pointing out and not taking their racism sitting down!  Is that so wrong?

What should I do?  Am I just being petty about this too?  I don’t want to make my Dad unhappy but I know he’s not a good judge of what is and isn’t racism, and I don’t feel like I should apologize for slapping a couple of racist adult-brats down.

TL;DR – Dad’s new girlfriend’s kids were racist against Mexicans, didn’t know sister and I are half Mexican, sister and I spoke nothing but Spanish to each other for the night to embarrass them, Dad now wants us(me) to apologize to them for embarrassing them.  What do?

"My [39 M] wife [30 F] of 6 years is upset I lost weight and wants me back to before


Throwaway. Wife follows me on Reddit...

I got married to my wife 6 years ago when she got pregnant. Ideally, we would have dated for longer than 9 months, but it is what it is, and we had our son soon after. Within the few years of our marriage, life was good. I got to learn a lot more about my wife and we got along really well, much more than when we were dating. Then my dad died of a heart attack when I was 35. My dad had just turned 59. This was a reality check, and I remember I cared so much because I had my son, and if I wanted my son to have me around when he was 35, I was at least going to have to live to 71 without keeling over from a similar health issue. 

I went and did a physical and blood work, found that I had high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I told the doctor my workout plan and diet, and set on my way. Following r/loseit was really helpful as well as r/keto. Within a year, I was down to my normal weight, and within two years I had a six pack, something I never had when I was younger. From that point, my doctor told me my health had exponentially improved, but I was thirsty for more. I wanted to look even more aesthetically pleasing, so I got a picture of the 300 cover photo and set about building my body for that Halloween. 

In that time, I think my wife and I must have grown apart. My wife used to always be fit when we dated, but after having our son, she must have been busy to go exercise. I invited her with me to workout (I saved up money and built a separate 2 car garage behind the house to build a home gym), but she would say she was tired or ""happy the way she was"". I would go for jogs with my son in the stroller, and whenever she joined us, she would insist we walk. I asked her to try jogging, and she would snap back asking if I don't find her attractive. Of course, I love my wife. I love her as the mother of my child, I love her as the daughter-in-law she is when helping my mother, and most of all I love her as my wife and how she is forever my companion. 

This became even more apparent with time. While I would be cooking chicken breast and broccoli for the week, she would say that I should start eating lasagna and fried chicken that I used to eat before. I told her that I didn't want to go back to being overweight/obese (my bmi used to be 32 and the doctor said that was classified as obese, now my bmi was 25, borderline overweight, but I am at 10% body fat) so I was careful with my food, and she got so upset. She asked if I thought she was fat, and I calmly told my wife to go ask the doctor because I thought she looked good, but I was biased. After her appointment the next week, she came back home crying. She said her doctor said she was overweight and should consider a diet plan and working out. 

I thought I would see changes in my wife's behavior, but nothing happened. Now, summer has come around, and my son is a bubbling ball of excitement and always wants to go to the pool. I take him to the community pool to play with other kids that live in our neighborhood, and my wife joins us sometimes. Last weekend, the neighborhood had a pool party, and everyone and their kids were there. My wife came, and my son and I were having fun, playing in the water and socializing with the people who came there. When we got home, after my son took a nap, my wife walked me into our bedroom, and started questioning me. She asked me if I was sleeping with X woman who was there, Y woman who was talking to me, or Z women whose kid I was helping dry off and talking too. I said I didn't know what she was talking about, and then she pulled out her phone to show me pictures she had taken from her seat. They were pictures of me smiling and talking to these women. 

I sat my wife down and told here I would **never** cheat. I have a son that she provided me, and a wife that I loved and cared so much about. She wouldn't accept that answer though. She said that I must be attracted to those women because they can look good wearing bikinis while she is heavier than them (her words, not mine). Then she changed the focus to me. She said I was getting all this attention because I was now fit compared to before, and it would cause me to waiver in my fidelity now that other women were attracted to me. 

My wife told me that she wants me back to my old self, when she didn't have to worry about other women and we could be comfortable together. She said she feels this undue pressure to become fit herself, and feels like its too stressful to maintain that lifestyle. 

Can someone please tell me what to do? I am not going to lie to my wife, but if I am being honest, I think she would be much more attractive if she tried to get back in shape. Even just **trying**. I don't know how I can tell her this without hurting her feelings or making her feel more insecure; can someone tell me how to approach that?


   
**tl;dr**: Now that I have lost weight and look fit, other women are flirting with me and my wife is starting to get jealous. She thinks that I will cheat on her in the future, and she wants me to get back to *my old self*."
"Me [18 M] randomly hooked up [17 F] and 3 days later she's pregnant.


Hey guys so I really fucked up and had a random hook up with this girl I knew very little. We had unprotected sex 😓 However I didn't cum from it, and I guess three days later she hits me up with a picture of a positive pregnancy test through snapchat. Is it possible for her to be pregnant 3 days after we had sex??? It seems way too fast.




Also she told me that a few weeks ago her and her ex had unprotected sex and she had to get Plan B, so she had a scare before. Another weird thing was that after sex she texted me that she had bleeding down there another weird thing. Am I just in denial guys or did I just really fuck up my life bad?


   
**tl;dr : hooked up with girl didn't really know had unprotected sex 3 days later she's pregnant... Wtffff




Update : You guys were a bit harsh but that is what I need. I was and am a fucking idiot for not using a condom and for almost falling for this girls bullshit. I had a weird feeling about this since she messaged and this thread really helped me out, I messaged her right now what you guys have told me that there is no way I'm the father and I would need a paternity test if she still thinks I am. I will update you guys with she says, I'm pretty sure she'll still think it's mine. Also I learned a very scary lesson I hope I am responsible enough to never be in this position again

"Me [22F] &amp; brother [22M] with childhood trauma. Boyfriend said ""he's too damaged and beyond anyone's help"". I kicked him out.


My brother and I (twins) had a nightmarish childhood. Both our parents were criminals and violent. They were angry at everything and everyone and always unleashed that on me and my brother.

When we were 16 we ran away from home. We lived on the streets for a while until we were able to rent a room together. When we were 19 our dad was killed by the police. Our mom killed herself a few months later so we got their stuff. We sold their house and bought a new one and that's where we live right now.

We focused on getting professional help, trying to heal and moving on. I've been able to do that. Now I have friends, I'm in a relationship for a year with my boyfriend and my life is pretty normal. My brother however has struggled. His progress has been much slower than mine and he still isn't in a great shape. He struggles with making friends and having relationships. Therapy helps and he's getting better but it's a long and slow process for him.

My boyfriend hasn't really been helpful to be honest. He thinks I shouldn't help my brother since I don't owe him anything and that he's and adult and responsible for his own problems. Last night we woke up because we heard my brother screaming in his sleep (it sometimes happens, though not often anymore) and I went to his room to help him calm down and go back to sleep. He has nightmares about what our parents did to us. This morning boyfriend told me that my brother is a mess and he belongs in a mental institution. I didn't like what he said so I told him that I don't need his ""expert"" psychological opinion. He continued that I should cut him lose since he'll never be a good brother for me as he's too damaged and beyond anyone's help. I became angry and told him that he should leave.

I'm very upset with the things he said. I find his comments not only out of line and insulting but also very wrong. He texted me a ""I'm sorry if I upset you"" apology. I don't know what I should do with him. 

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend called my brother ""too damaged and beyond anyone's help"". I got upset and kicked him out. He's giving me a half apology. Should I forgive him?"

"[UPDATE] Me [26F] with my husband [26M] together five years, he doesn't think it's fair for him to get a part-time job to help pay off his student loans


[Here's the OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m19w1/me_26f_with_my_husband_26m_together_five_years_he/)

First, thank you to everyone who offered advice, anecdotes, and criticism! 

When my husband and I talked about a second income, he immediately started applying to jobs and got a call shortly after. I mentioned in my later comments that my husband had just been offered an interview. It was for a research organization and his job would be making calls and collecting data. Not thrilling but in a previous life he was a canvasser and is used to talking to strangers and making a script sound natural. He had the interview and within 24 hours they offered him a job. They asked how much he makes at his current job, and are paying him about a dollar less per hour. 

The job is also 5-9 pm M-Th every other week, so he has all weekends free for sports and working every other week makes it feel less overwhelming. On nights he works I take care of stuff around the house that he would normally do in the evening, but it's allowed me to expand my days so I'm at the office longer. So now I'm not sitting around snacking when he's not home, and I get the office to myself and during my down time I can study for the GRE in silence without cats bugging me and people watching TV and doing laundry.

It's weird but he really likes his second job, he's learning a lot about the issue they're researching, says it's boring work but easy and relaxing, and it helps that he's really good at it. He got his first full paycheck last week and he'll be making almost triple a month what we initially needed! I had told him that if he really hated it he could decided whether he wanted to stay or leave, but he's enjoying it. All the money he makes is going into a separate account and his loans will be taken directly from there, so I can save my raise money and he can also start saving his own money while fully contributing to household bills. 
   
**tl;dr**: Husband wasn't sure if it was fair for him to get a job because he participates in sports he doesn't want to miss out on, and values his free time (as does anyone). Got a job immediately because he rules. He's weird and loves the second job. All is well. "

"I [21F] am going on a trip to Mexico with my sorority, my boyfriend [21M] asked me with tears in his eyes to not wear a bikini at the beach.


So my boyfriend of 3 years, Robert, and I have been together since freshman year of college. I'm in a sorority and there's a trip to Mexico we make every 4th of July (no one's required to go, but 90% of us go) for about a week. It's our sorority, a few other sororities, and some frat houses. We go to Mexico, hang out, swim, boating, etc. College kids on break kind of stuff  

So when I went at the end of freshman year, my boyfriend (whose not in a frat so he doesn't go) was just like ""alright have fun"". At the time I had a skinny-fat body (healthy weight, no muscle, looked blah in a bikini). 

At the end of sophomore year, I went again. A few months prior to the trip, one of my sorority sisters got me really into weight training &amp; nutrition. My body looked somewhat different but not exponentially. Again, boyfriend was like go have fun. 

Now at the end of my junior year, my body looks way different. I've lost fat, gained muscle, and finally got a booty (squats and donkey kicks, y'all). My sorority sisters have all commented on how my physique has changed and Robert loves it too. Time rolls around for our annual trip and I'm packing (Robert and I share an apartment near campus).  

He sees that I'm packing bikinis and says ""I need to talk to you"" and tells me with tears in his eyes that he doesn't want me to wear bikinis or anything revealing on the trip this year. He said that because my body has improved so much that other guys will be all over me and also said what is, in my opinion, the corniest line in history - ""baby, I trust you, it's all those guys I don't trust.""

I'm like ??? It's one thing if he had been super controlling and crazy about it because I would've just shut him down. But he was really sweet about it and seemed genuine. At the same time tho its not like I'm not a child and I don't like being told what I can and can't do. On top of all that, I've been with him for 3 years and love him. I don't know what I should do.

"My (30F) Fiance (32M) Passed Away


This is my first post, I apologize for the length.


The love of my life passed away 26 days ago, we were just 65 days away from our weddings (we were having two ceremonies because we come from different backgrounds). From the day we met we knew we were meant for each other and we never spent a day apart. We were together for an amazing 15 months and we were engaged for 4 of those months. We love each other so much and he was an amazing man with an amazing heart.


When my love proposed to me he promised me a very optimistic 65 years together. I always told him that 65 years is a very long time and here's hoping we get that much time together, but at the end of whatever time we actually do have I have to be the one that goes first because I never want to find out what a day without him feels like.


One month after we got engaged he became very sick, he always insisted that he was fine and that he would get better soon. Getting him to the doctor or emergency was an ordeal, he couldn't stand going there and he quickly became frustrated with all of the tests. I tried so hard to get him to go to the doctor and get tests done quickly so that they could find out what was wrong and help him faster, it hurt so much to see him so sick. My love was a stubborn man and even though he was slowly getting to the appointments and tests, it just wasn't fast enough. He unexpectedly passed away in his sleep after being sick for three months. It was a huge shock to everyone because not once did a doctor say his life was at risk. I didn't even believe it when I heard.


I feel like the day my love passed away is the day my life ended. I cannot understand the point of my existence anymore, I waited 29 years to find the love of my life and now he has been taken away from me forever. From searching online I see that this happens more often than you would think and I've read the stories that others have shared about how they lost their loves, but nobody really says what happens after.


I cannot stomach the thought of carrying on here without him, I am not suicidal, I just wouldn't mind if all of this ended and I could be with him again. I also don't know how to accept that I will be alone for the rest of my life, he promised me forever and I did the same, I don't ever want to break that promise to him. The only thing that brings me comfort is knowing that he is no longer sick and can no longer feel any pain. I also have hope that I will one day see him again.


I miss him so much and my heart hurts for him more and more each day. I'm so tired of crying. I hate how depressing I sound when people try to talk to me. I hate that my life has become so terrible that everyone is ""so sorry"" and ""can't even imagine"" what I'm going through. No, most people can't imagine and I would never want anyone to even try. It's too horrible of a feeling.


Has anyone here been through this? When does it stop hurting? Where did your life take you after such a tragedy? I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, I feel like I'm living in a nightmare.


Thank any of you in advance for your help/advice.


TL;DR; My fiance passed away, will it ever stop hurting? What usually happens to the surviving partner?"
"I [13F] feel awful my sister [15F] told me it was my fault my brothers [16M] girlfriend [16F] broke up with him because he had to come and pick me up. My sister told me that the whole family will be made if they find out


Hi, Reddit I need some adult advice because I feel really bad. I just turned 13 8 weeks ago so I am young and never used this site before. 

two weeks ago on a Sunday I was playing a local softball game with my team, it was just a fun game it was nothing competitive at all. My dad dropped me off and was suppose to come and pick me up after the game. My dad forgot because he was busy with his new girlfriend who is from Chicago I think. Dad lives with her and I live with my mom. 

He was suppose to come and pick me up at 4 in the afternoon. He was not there and I waited for an hour. I have to admit I started to feel a little scared because I was alone at this point in time. Everyone else had left with their parents. 

I called my brother and he was on a date with his girlfriend at her house. I called him and I told him dad had not showed up and he left right away to come and get me. He left while they were in the middle of their date or something. They were at her place so it's not like he left her without a ride 

He arrived 20 minutes later and took me to Red Robbin for dinner. He seemed upset but he did not tell me what was wrong. 

My sister told me she overheard my brother talking on the phone to somebody. He was telling them how his girlfriend broke up with him, he left in the middle of their date to pick me up. She wanted him to spend the night again and he told her that he couldn't. 

My sister basically blamed me for the reason our brother has been upset. She told me that if I go to my older sisters for advice or my mom that they will be angry I caused a break up. I don't know what to do. I don't want my brother, sisters and mom to hate me. 

tl;dr: My brothers girlfriend dumped him because he had to come and pick me up. My sister told me the family will hate me if they find out 

Update thing 

I am truly sorry everybody. I went and spoke to my brother as someone suggested to do. They never broke up my sister was lying to upset me. My brothers girlfriend told him to hurry up and go when I called him. My sister was lying to upset me 

the reason my brother was upset is my dad and him got into a argument earlier in the day and then dad left me which made him upset "
"Update: Me 20m with my sister 27f, I made a rude remark, and there's a shitstorm


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nh2um/me_20m_with_my_sister_27f_i_made_a_rude_remark/

While my post didn't get much attention, I want to thank the person who gave me advice. And if anyone else is reading this and in a similar or related situation, I hope this helps. 

I served my sister with eviction papers, and things got messy. I thought they would, so I called the police before, and took pictures of all my belongings the night before. She ended up breaking some stuff, and then the police forced her to leave. I heard she is living with a friend right now. I plan on suing her for all of my stuff she broke. I also decided to cut contact with my family. They chose trailer trash over me, but I expect they will come groveling back for ""favors"" and ""loans"" in a few months. 

TLDR: Always evict crazy, and don't get social media. "
"[UPDATE] My [23F] husband [26M] doesn't want my mom [47F] to stay with us when she gets out of prison.


My last post didn't get many views and everyone pretty much just downvoted me, but you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pib84/my_23f_husband_26m_doesnt_want_my_mom_47f_to_stay/). It bothers me to read a post on /r/relationships and not know what happened so I figured I'd post an update. Thanks to everyone for your input, even if I didn't want to hear it or don't agree with it. 

I talked to my husband this past weekend and we pretty much got everything figured out. I told him how frustrated I was with finding transitional housing for my mom, and showed him all of the emails from these places that basically said they didn't have room, were only for immigrants, only for men, only for woman that have children, etc. and I told him that she had pretty much been receiving the same thing back in all the letters she had sent out. He said he was sorry and that he didn't realize I had been having *that* much trouble finding a place for her. He thought I was overreacting, which he thinks I do a lot. I don't think I do that, but whatever. Not the point. 

Anyways, he is still adamant that she doesn't need to stay longer than necessary, but he has agreed to let her stay until she finds a place, and if for some reason she absolutely cannot find a place (which I hope doesn't happen) we're going to pay for a deposit + first month's rent for my mom at a shared house or something similar. We both agreed that if we can do anything about it, we will avoid her going back to my grandpa's house at all costs. There is nothing for her in the tiny city. 

We also have some ground rules for her that I have mailed out in a letter for her to look over and hopefully agree to.

 - She is to have NO visitors. She'll have her own phone so she can call anybody she wants at any time, but I do not like having people in my home that I don't know. Neither does my husband. 

 - She can go wherever she likes during the day, but I will not be dropping her off and picking her up at people's houses. I will only drop her off and pick her up if it is job or housing related. 

 - She needs to be sending out at least 15 letters/emails a day for housing. Or calling these places. This sounds reasonable to me. 

 - She needs to go to NA or AA once a week.

 - If we find out she is doing drugs again, which is unlikely she will do as she won't have any money to buy anything and won't have a way to get anywhere since my suburb doesn't have any city buses, she will be on her own. No more help at all.

 - Therapy. My mom will need to go to therapy. I'm sure she has her own demons to deal with, like we all do. She doesn't have insurance currently so I'll look into low-cost therapy options in my city for now, and then see if she can get Obamacare since she doesn't have an income.

 - Most importantly, she needs to stay busy. My mom tends to start using drugs if she gets bored. So, I think that if she stays busy it would benefit her greatly. We have a gym, a dog that loves walks and swimming, a dog park very close to us, an awesome swimming pool, etc.



So, I'm not sure everyone will agree with this, but this is the best agreement my husband and I could come to. My husband really does love my Mom, and he only wants what's best for her. He mainly didn't want to help her so much that she stopped helping herself. But I am excited to have my Mom here with me. Thanks, everyone! Communication does it again. 


Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who offered constructive advice or even criticism. To those of you who sent me nasty messages - get a life. I'm not sure why you hate drug addicts so much and feel the need to let your anger about it out on me but I hope you work past whatever issues you have. 

I've updated my list for the requirements for my mother, and I think she is going to love what I have. I'll send her out another letter as soon as I can! Thanks again everyone.

 - She is to have NO visitors.

 - She is not to use my laptop, but I will buy her a chromebook she can use and keep.

 - She is not to use my cell phone, but I will purchase her a phone she can use and keep.

 - She needs to be working on finding jobs and/or transitional housing for a least 3 hours a day. A goal of applications or phone calls would be 8-10.

 - She needs to go to NA (or another type of group) every single day. 90 in 90.

 - She needs to go to therapy. I will look into low cost therapy and see if she is eligible for Obamacare so she can go at least once a week. I will also offer to keep paying for this even after she lives with me.

 - She needs to stay busy. I will support any hobby she wants, but she needs to stay busy to keep herself out of trouble. 

 - And the most obvious, no using drugs. This is the only requirement she will automatically be kicked out for. The other things will have to be talked about between the three of us if they are broken.

"I [16F] had a super embarrassing moment with my brother [24M] and told my boyfriend [16M] of 1 year about it. He wants me to stop going to my brother's place.


This is so embarrassing.

I usually go to my brother's flat to study since it's quieter and more peaceful, ever since my older sister moved in with our parents with her two sons. It's an half an hour of running from my parent's house so I usually use that as exercise. Last week I ran there and when I arrived I went to take a shower. I came out naked (he wasn't home of course) and just played some music and sat on the couch to dry my hair. Well. I fell asleep. When I woke up I was on the couch but under a sheet and my brother was in the kitchen cooking dinner. So I freaked out and screamed and ran into the bedroom to get clothes. Later that night I asked my brother if he can forget everything that happened and he told jokingly me ""did something happen?"".

Next day I told my mom what happened and she couldn't stop laughing at me. She told me that this was a life lesson and I should count myself lucky that it happened at my brother's place not somewhere that I might have been in danger. I guess she's right. Anyway I told my boyfriend what happened and he freaked out. He said that if this happened between him and his sister he expects them to avoid each other for a very long time otherwise it's so awkward. He thinks it's unbelievable that I want to continue going to my brother's place to study as if nothing had happened.

I mean. Yeah if was embarrassing but do I have to change my life now because of it? Accidental nudity happens in most families but I don't think they would avoid each other for a long time after it happens, right? He says for a long time everytime my brother sees me the picture of me naked comes to his mind. I told him that I don't think so but he says I don't know how a guy's mind work so I should take his word on it.

So how is it? Is he being reasonable? My feeling tells me no but I need some outside opinions.

"FIL [58M] gifted us [28M&amp;F] a bed, 9 years later we gave it to my sister [21F], he demanded it back, my GF gave in, now he won’t pick it up and pretends it never happened.


Sorry for the possibly confusing title, but that’s the gist of it. I’ll try to be brief. I’m really not sure what (if anything) I should do at this point, so any input would be very welcome.

My SO and I have been together for 9 years. Her parents are divorced, and they both have new partners. Back when we first started dating, my FIL and his new wife gave us a (secondhand) bed. (Just the frame).

Three months ago, we bought a new one. My girlfriend called her father and asked if he wanted the bed back. He said no. 

Around the same time, my sister (21f) announces she’s moving in with her girlfriend. She needs a bed, we have a spare one. We promise it to her, and set a date for her to come pick it up. 

Two weeks later, her dad calls, saying he changed his mind, and he DOES want the bed back. They can use it for the a guest room in their house. My GF explains she already promised the bed to someone else at this point.

He claims he never said ‘no’ on the phone in the first place, and simply tells my girlfriend to un-gift the bed then.

At this point, I’m already angry with him. You can’t un-give something. We asked him, he said no. To demand it back, even after we already promised it to someone else, is incredibly rude.

My GF tells him my sister hasn’t picked the bed up yet, so he tells her he’ll come to pick it up next weekend. (He lives a 2 hour drive away). My SO tells my sister the news, and my sister buys herself a new bed instead.

I’m pretty steamed (and annoyed with my SO for not telling him off, to be honest), but okay. Pick up the bed, whatever, we can move on. That’s not what happened.

He comes to visit (while I’m at a family gathering, and my GF is not with me because she has to stay at home for her father), and **he doesn’t even take the bed with him**. “On second thought, I don’t know if it’ll fit in my car,” he said. “I’ll come back for it later.”

It’s been over 8 weeks. He hasn't said a word about it since. The bed is still standing in my hallway. In the way. I see it every day. 

I’m super-done with this guy at this point. I want to call him and tell him off, but I also don't want to get between my SO and her father. However, she hasn't said a word to him about it either. (As you can tell, confrontation is not her strong suit).

Next weekend he’s having a birthday party for my GF’s step-mom, and of course, we’re invited. I don’t intend on going. My SO wants to go (and me to go as well) and pretend nothing's wrong.

I don’t know what to do. I also don’t know if it’s a minor or a major gaffe. I’m perhaps more angry than is called for because it’s not the first time he's inconsiderate, and because this time, my sister is involved. 

Should I confront him about it? Should my SO do it? Should we just ignore it to ‘keep the peace’?

(Of course, I think my SO should have told him off when he first asked for the bloody thing back, but that ship has sailed.)

I don’t think he even realizes that his actions are dick-ish. He’s not a bad guy, just an incredible oaf. I’ll stop now because I can keep ranting about his inconsiderate behavior for a while. 

**tl;dr** FIL gives us a bed. 9 years later we ask him he wants it back. He says no. We promise to my sister. He changes his mind, says he does want it back. My sister buys a new bed. He never picks the thing up. Pretends it never happened and invites us for a birthday party. SO wants to go and pretend nothing happened. I don't want to, but don't want to get between my SO and father either. What should I do?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone! I thought I'd just get a few, didn't expect this to get so big! Thanks for letting me vent, a lot of the anger is gone now. I talked it over with my SO, and she's going to ask him if FIL still wants it, and if so, set a date for him to pick it up. If not, we'll donate it. I'll attend the party, and try to have a good time. This is a minor annoyance, but not a bigger deal than that. I let myself get worked up, but we talked it out, and it's all good. 

Thanks!"
