"I [28f] literally just found email after email from my fiancé [27m] to his ex girlfriend [20s/f] belittling me and making fun of me and worse. I am seriously shocked beyond belief.


Link to my update post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52r6o3/update_i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after/

My fiancé, ""Dale"", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.

Dale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.

I used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line ""Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...""

The subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. ""Jen"" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.

Rest of the subject line was ""Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?""

The email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.

Even worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like ""she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it."" And then she answered with a bunch of ""lol""s and said she felt sorry for the ""poor girl"". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. 

That is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of ""if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.""

But to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.

The emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.

Obviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses ""backdoor"". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.

I'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.

I'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now.

**tl;dr** fiancé made fun of me and sent explicit emails to his ex. Just found them. Heartbroken, angry, hurt, every emotion ever going on. Don't know if I should just ghost him and never see him again or confront him? I need nice words from Internet strangers or something right now."

"My [25/F] MIL [50s/F] walked in on my husband [28/M] and I having sex, and now she keeps directing these weird remarks at me.


We've been together three years, married three months. His family invited us to join them on a trip. Our first day there, SO and I decided to have a quickie before dinner. 

We gave his mother a spare key card to our room just in case, but we did not expect her to use it. I guess we were running late for dinner. She came up to see what was taking so long, tried to open the door, unlocked it on her own (even though we put the do not disturb thing up) and caught us. She stared for a second and then ran out embarrassed. My husband and I burst out laughing. He closed the door, we finished ~~because we're monsters~~ and went down to dinner expecting some awkward laughter and a joke or two. 

MIL usually makes the innocent sex joke here and there so we didn't expect her to be traumatized or anything. But she has really made a point to direct weird, shameful remarks at me. Implying I'm a *hussy* for fucking my husband, while conveniently ignoring the fact that she ignored all the signs and unlocked the door on her own. 

SO has tried to talk to her but she ""can't look at him"". The rest of the family has no idea what happened. 

TL;DR: on family trip. SO were having sex in our hotel room. MIL has spare key. She unlocked the door and walked in on us. Now she keeps trying to make me feel bad for having sex with my husband. "
"My [26F] husband [25M] cheated on me in our home, while he was suppose to be looking after our son [3M].


My husband and I have been together five years and we have two children 3M and 2F. Last week I was taking my daughter to the doctor and I was going to bring my son along. My husband told me not to worry about it and he would look after him. Once we were done at the doctor I went to go visit my sister for a little bit with my daughter. 

Both our children are perfectly healthy, my daughter just had this cough that kept getting worse so I took her to the doctor. She's getting better now. But last night I got a E-Mail from a woman yesterday evening. I had just put the kids to bed and I was working. 

The title read ""Concern over your son"" It caught my eye, because I was thinking who is this and why is she talking about my kid. This woman Ember [fake name] claimed to know my husband. Not only that she claimed to be sleeping with my husband and that they were in love. 

She messaged me to tell me that she was over at my house last week. The day I took my daughter to the doctor, she even mentioned this in the Email. She told me my son was wondering around while my husband and I quote ""fucked my brains out in your bed"" She told me to take my son with me when I go out so they can have some privacy. The things I wanted to do to her when I read it, hell would reserve a special section just for me. 

I was furious and I asked my husband who was watching TV who is Ember. The look on his face said it all, you could just tell his heart sank and he was shitting himself. He was stuttering, and was telling me she's nobody. A long argument later he told me to ""go fuck myself and left""

He called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason.

I don't know what to do next, I am still in shock, I'm angry, I need some guidance. I did so much for him I earned more money than him, I payed for almost anything that loser did. I work in marketing for a major company and he is unemployed mechanic

tl;dr: Husband cheated on me when son was home and has left me . I need guidance of what to do next "

"My [32F] husband [33M] doesn't want our nanny to teach our daughter Spanish. Feel like I'm seeing an ugly side of him.


My husband Eric and I have been married for 5 years. We have one child, a four-year-old little lady named Katherine. We both work busy jobs but I'm a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she's honestly become part of the family.


The other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, ""Want to hear me talk like Ella?"" And she started speaking Spanish! I'm not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn't really respond but I didn't think anything of it at the time. 


Then tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn't like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it's a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it's a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine. 


Ella has gone back to our house for the night, but I'm still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he's damaged our relationship with Ella, who's been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it's a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she'll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn't be married; that's a dealbreaker for me), but I can't see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work. 


A) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?


and B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?

"My [25F] fiance [25M] father [60'sM] sent me a dick pic and I am not sure how to proceed


I have been dating Buck for 4 years now we met in college, really amazing guy, good looking. His family mainly his sisters and mother [55F, 24F, 27F] have been really welcoming and really welcomed me and my mother &amp; sister into their family. They are a close family so we all live in the same city and they normally hang out every Saturday. I am pregnant with our first child. We both have our dream jobs and everything is fine apart from his father 

I get aggressively hit on by men when I go out, it's part of the reason why when I am in a relationship I rarely go out to bars or anything like that. If my friends want to hang out we normally go to the mall and even then some guys comes up and talks to us. I am not a cheater, I hate cheaters my father cheated on my mother and it tore my family apart. So I have gotten my fair share of unwanted dick pics is what I am trying to get at. So one thing I will never do is cheat on buck. 

Hi father and mother are divorced and 2 weeks ago I met his father for the first time. His father lives on the other side of the country in New York with his new wife. His father flew out to see his children and this was my first time meeting him in person. He seemed nice enough completely different from the rest of the family. He seemed really cold and to the point. 

We exchanged details just to you know, stay in contact because he is my fiance father. His father seemed rather closed off and he stated he hated leaving NY and hated people in general. Buck and his father are not close like he is to the rest of the family. They seem to only communicate because they are father and son. They just don't seem to really like each other. 

Over night I got a message on Facebook from him and it was a picture of him holding his dick, one flaccid and one erect. With the words after it ""You Like red?"" I have red hair so that's why he called me that. 

Buck is still sleeping and I am not sure how to address this with him and my friends will just cause a huge fucking drama, like they always do. I just need some advice please 

tl;dr: boyfriends father sent me a dick pick

"UPDATE My 27F Boyfriend 29M of 3.5 years, still hasn't reciprocated ""I love you"", feeling unloved and underappreciated

"My [23F] best friend [26F] of 10+ year's boyfriend [26M] of three years has admitted to having strong feelings for me. Previously, best friend has told me if anything like this happened she wouldn't want to know. Need help. [UPDATE]


[Here's a link to the original post!
](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/527au8/my_23f_best_friend_26f_of_10_years_boyfriend_26m/?st=it476tbn&amp;sh=6fb50c91)

Sorry, this'll probably get long!

SO, there were lots of conflicting opinions on what to do, and a lot of you had really good reasons behind those - however, there were consensus' which seemed to be that 1. This sucks and there's no ideal solution, and 2. Everyone seemed on board with the letter idea which was suggested by a few people.

The gist of it was that I should write a letter and put the screen caps, etc I took into it, and then offer the information to her again. That way, she would have some more agency to choose whether or not she wanted to know. I have to say letting her know there was something to know kind of felt like I was forcing her to choose to open it, but... well, here's what happened:

I made the envelope and went to her place while Guy was working just to hang out, pretty usual stuff. Reddit, I'm not a terrible actress but this woman knows me so well. She opened the door to let me in and immediately asked what was wrong, and to my ever lasting shame I immediately burst into tears. Super pathetic of me, and not ideal. Urgh.

After I'd composed myself I started saying what I'd been practicing in my head. Pretty much, that there was something we'd talked about a lot in our scenarios that had happened, and she had always said she wouldn't want to know, but I wanted to give her the option. I gave her the letter.

Then without even opening it she also started to cry, which made me start up again, which was kind of okay because the ridiculousness of us both just standing in her living room sobbing all over each other made us laugh a little bit.

A lot of people had guessed she had noticed or had some kind of idea of Guy's feelings, and they were absolutely right. But it's weirder than even that. I genuinely can't believe I'm explaining this, it's just... weird. I don't know.

Best Friend had thought Guy had a harmless little crush on me. The kind people in relationships just *get* sometimes. But when he didn't talk to her about it she started to feel uncomfortable, and she did something she shouldn't have, but you know how it goes. She snooped. She snooped on his laptop months ago, and found a file with my initials on it buried amongst a bunch of other stuff. She went and got his laptop and gave it to me to read while she read my letter.

Inside it were stories he had written, like fanfiction? about the three of us living like a kind of poly relationship lifestyle where we were his wives? Some of it was sexual stuff which... you know, I think I could understand it better if it had just been sexual fantasies, but there were also really long documents about our lives together. And it goes deep too, there was a whole plot line about him trying to convince me to have kids (love them, but I'm childfree and everyone around me knows it)?? There were loads of stories, all different lengths, I didn't read all of it, just kind of like skim read them with my mouth hanging open. It's so hard to explain, it was really bizarre to read about myself like that. There were newer documents Best Friend hadn't read, too.

Best Friend goes on to tell me that she hadn't minded because she was in all the stories as well, so she's reassured in his love for her, but obviously me being part of their life in that way isn't her ideal and she was disturbed by the way he'd spoken to me in the messages from the other day (and the ones he's sent since). I asked her *loads* of questions, including if she felt safe, and she said she does. I asked her what she wanted to do, and she said she wanted to leave him.

She also apologised for not telling me, and while it doesn't sit well with me that she didn't, because of what happened after this, I've basically forgiven her/put any talk of that on hold. She doesn't need that now, and I've been so relieved she wasn't mad at me for bursting her bubble, and concerned for her, that it seems very secondary. 

Of all the things I expected to happen during my visit, it was none of that. So then the conversation switched to me being worried about her safety because while he doesn't seem dangerous this is very obsessive, and he's clearly been upset by his fantasy becoming further from reality with Max in the picture, and now this. (I'm a little anxious about Max's safety, too. I can't tell if I'm being reasonable or paranoid). She assured me *ten fold* that she feels completely safe, he's never done anything other than this that's red flaggish, but that she still wants to leave, and she's very cautious by nature so she's taking some precautions. 

She got up and went to pack her bags, and started giving me typical her, business like instructions on the things she wanted me to grab from around the house. She filled up her suit cases, and I filled up a box of her personal stuff. Then, she wrote a note for Guy explaining that she didn't think they should be together anymore, and she would only talk with him about it over messages or in person a few days from now (in a public place, she assured me).

So, this is when I did something I maybe shouldn't have, I don't know. I carry a pen drive on my key chain. I told her that I wanted to take copies of the stories because if anything happens, even if she doesn't think it will, it's important that there's something we can use to prove his obsessive behaviour. She said fine, so I now have a pen drive full of fanfiction (and *playlists?!*) about myself, my best friend and her ex. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not tempted to read them. Sheer morbid curiosity. But I've resisted so far.

We went to my place first while we thought of what to do next, and her emotions were understandably all over the place. After I got a call from Max and filled him in he said to come stay with him since Guy doesn't know where he lives. Best Friend preferred to stay at a nearby hotel, which we used my card to pay for, and after I hovered over her anxiously as she settled in she eventually said she wanted to be alone (which isn't unusual for her when she's upset). I've been to visit her and she's been sending me messages the whole time, so I'm feeling pretty confident about where her head's at (sad, but coping well considering) but still just general worriedness. I'm staying with Max until things settle down.

I've gotten (and am still getting) messages from Guy. I have been since about 5pm that night, and it's been two nights since since then. They're very ""I just want to talk"" messages. Not aggressive or anything like that, I was going to block him on everything but Best Friend asked me not to because she's worried about his mental state.

As a side note: I'm not bashing poly relationships by any means in this post. That is most definitely not the thing about this I find weird and bizarre. You do you. 
  
  ---   

  **tl;dr: I gave her the option of the letter. Turns out Best Friend knew the whole time because she snooped on Guy's laptop months ago and found loads of stories he wrote of the three of us living some kind of fictional paradise where we're his wives (I know, what?). She doesn't feel unsafe but decided to leave him, and because of the weirdness of the situation she's taking the appropriate precautions. I put her up at a hotel using my card because she's not sure what Guy has access to, etc.  - she seems as good as can be expected, wants to be alone but is still talking to me over messenger about everything.**

**I'm staying at Maxs just in case. Guy is trying to talk to me and to her, but the only responses he's gotten are to read the note she left him again.**

Lastly, thank you so much to the people who commented, especially the ones who wrote a lot and gave me such good advice and just sent general good feelings my way. or PM'd me. You guys were amazing. I'm super grateful for all the comments!"
"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 5 years, is he treating me poorly or am I just too picky


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m5gwp/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_of_5_years_is_he/

This is an update to a post I made about three and a half months ago. I apologize that I am updating under a new username; I can't remember the password for the other throwaway I was using and never registered it to an email. Oops. I'm sorry it took so long to update; a lot has happened and I've done my best to keep busy.



I want to extend my thanks to everyone who took the time to read my post, especially those who replied. I guess I kind of always knew in the back of my mind that my relationship was abusive, but felt that I needed permission to leave. I know that doesn't make sense. I guess I was just feeling so beat down by that point that I didn't even feel like I had enough agency to make my own decisions.



Several of you expressed genuine fear for my safety, and a few suggested that I just up and leave while he was at work one day. That particular scenario didn't end up happening, but here's the story of what did happen.



I managed to hold out for about another week or so after my original post. It was such a big decision, I wanted to make sure that I had all my bases covered before talking to him (apartment, possessions, cat, etc). I became more and more visibly depressed with each passing day - not sadness due to leaving, but just... a sad person. He eventually ended up asking me what was wrong when we were lying in bed one night, and I told him I was not happy in this relationship and that I wanted to end things. He took it quite well at first, and we managed to have some remarkably productive and civil discussions about how to proceed with belongings/living situation/etc, but of course that didn't last. He moved out about a week after our relationship ended (he insisted he be the one to leave). I had nowhere else to go at the time, otherwise I would not have dealt with his bullshit for as long as I did after the breakup.



He spent the next couple of days after the breakup basically sobbing and trying to convince me to take him back and give him another chance, but I stood my ground and refused to do so. Then, he devolved into insulting me, harassing me, and blaming me for perceived problems in his life.



I'll spare you all of the ridiculous dramatic details, but there came a point where he was incessantly asking me to have sex with him 'one last time for closure.' I told him no, kept telling him no, and he said that if I wouldn't do it, then our breakup would no longer be civil, that I ruined that for myself, and that my decision to say no didn't deserve to be respected. I still said no. He slammed his fists down on the arms of the chair he was sitting on, and got up and came at me. We were the only two people in the house at the time, and I fled. I spent most of the night in my car in a grocery store parking lot a few towns away, only returning home when several roommates were around and awake. I feared for my safety otherwise. In retrospect, calling the cops would absolutely have been the best route to take, but I was so fucking horrified and exhausted that it didn't even cross my mind at the time. The next day was his move-out date, and I was so happy. While he was getting all of his shit out of the house, I went shopping. I bought a new bedding set, new curtains, some minor decor, and rearranged my whole bedroom as a mini fresh start. I really had a new outlook on things.



My roommates ended up kicking me out a couple weeks later so they could move him back in. He roped them in with his stories of how much he was suffering after I left him, how he was having such a hard time, how they're his only friends in the world, and how awful I am. These roommates were some of the best friends I ever had - lifelong friends, like since childhood... Having nowhere else to go, I pulled some pretty big strings and moved in with a relative in a nearby town and started to build my life back up. My ex started dating one of our mutual friends from uni about 2 weeks after we broke up - someone I was always suspicious of, but he always told me to never worry about her. So, there's that. Hope they're having fun or whatever. A mutual acquaintance has told me that he treats her the same way he always treated me.



Things are much better now. I have since saved up some money, quit my soul-sucking job, and now live and work in a different city fairly far away. It is really nice to not have to worry about running into my ex or my ex-roommates/friends. I've also started seeing someone else. He's been in a very similar situation to what I experienced. So, we are making sure to pace ourselves and we always try our best to be mindful of each others' needs and feelings, as well as our own needs and feelings. He treats me with genuine respect, and while things are still pretty new, I am optimistic about this, as well as my future in general. I'm pretty busy these days, but once I get health insurance from my new job, I am going to set up regular therapy appointments to help process all of these changes in my life, as well as my attitudes about healthy relationships and about my own self-worth.



Random internet strangers, thank you so much for being so kind and caring to a scared, tired, just plain beat-down woman. Your words gave me the boost of momentum I needed to solidify my decision to get the fuck out. I am so glad I did.



tl;dr:  Left his ass, he got dramatic and somewhat scary, after some changes in life circumstances things are really looking up!"
"I [26F] won a trip to Disney World. My cousin [30F] thinks I should take her daughter [5F] but I don't want to.


I recently won an all-expense paid trip to Disney World for four nights, for myself and three guests. I am currently planning on bringing my boyfriend [30M] , my mother [54F], and my boyfriend's mother [50sF]. I know we all aren't exactly Disney's key demographic, but it honestly means a lot to our mothers that I am inviting them. Both my boyfriend and I grew up in poorer families that could never afford expensive vacations, and this is the first trip to Disney World for all of us. I know this is probably the only opportunity our mothers will ever have to go to Disney, and for now they are both in good enough health to still enjoy the rides.


The problem is with my cousin, Jane [30F], who has been hounding me to take her 5-year-old daughter, Kelly, instead of my boyfriend's mother. I know, I know, what kind of monster am I for not wanting to bring a little girl to the place where dreams come true?! Except Jane's family has already been to Disney World twice, most recently earlier this year in February. My cousin has done very well for herself - she runs a successful photography business, and her husband is an engineer. They are definitely able to afford their own vacations. If Jane wasn't so well off, I probably would consider taking Kelly if I thought I was giving a little kid a once in a lifetime experience. But I'm not. She's already been twice and she's only five! Our mothers have been ZERO times. Jane's only rationale for wanting me to take her daughter seems to be that ""Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults."" and ""It'd be evil to not take a 5 year old to Disney if you had the chance."" 


There's also the issue of Kelly herself. She's not a completely terrible child, but she's whiny and throws tantrums regularly. I don't really want to spend a week with that. Also, what if she gets homesick, what if she gets actually sick, what if she gets lost?! I'm not a parent myself and I would have no idea what to do in those situations. I also don't want to saddle my mother with the responsibility of caring for her. I've babysat Kelly before, but only for a few hours at a time. I'm not sure why my cousin is even comfortable with the idea of me taking her child three states away.  We are in North Carolina, so it's not like Orlando is just a short drive down the road if something happens. 


I tried telling Jane I'm not comfortable bringing Kelly, and she just said this is a good opportunity to find out what being a parent is like. What?! She's almost acting like I'm not serious about not bringing Kelly, and I'm just pretending I don't want to bring her. It's really weird. Jane and I have always been very close, like we are sisters, and I'm afraid this has the potential to ruin our relationship once it comes to a head. What is the best way to tell her no without sounding like an evil child hater, or am I being selfish for not taking a kid to Disney?


TL;DR: I won a trip to Disney World, cousin wants me to bring her spoiled young daughter instead of boyfriend's mother and I don't want to."

She went to college for a degree in fashion and did a grand total of nothing with it. 


Her husband has always been spotty with employment, and my parents are always bailing him and my sister out because his own parents are dead or don’t talk to him. He’s supposed to be a professional DJ.


Anyway I have a large apartment in the city where I live with my wife [39] and daughter [4]. I own a small beach condo (two bedrooms). My family usually goes there when the weather is good.


My sister and her husband are getting thrown out of their apartment because both of them are deadbeats.


My mom and dad are I guess tired of giving them money because now my mom is telling me I should either give my sister money or let her and her husband live in my beach house rent free.


I don’t want them to live in my beach house, and told my mother as much. My mom says I’m being cruel and selfish.


What’s “cruel and selfish” I think is the fact that mom and dad live in a three bedroom house and haven’t invited sister and her husband to live with them but are putting it on me.


My wife is being nice about it and telling me to do what’s right but I can tell she will miss visiting the beach house.


Plus I think that once my sister and her worthless husband get in, they will never leave.


My parents are telling me to “man up” and be a big brother.


Looking for advice on how to best handle this in a way that doesn’t let them have my beach house, but still isn’t cruel, and is helpful.



Tl;dr: sister and her husband want to live in my beach house for free. I say no. My mom says I’m mean. I say what’s mean is them not even spotting me five bucks for gas in college when they spent at least fifty thousand on my sister’s fashion AA at FIDM.

"I [24 M] was born without my left arm, or so I thought... While housesitting for my parents (58 M and 55 F) I decided to watch some home videos. One of those videos was me with both arms as a baby...

"My sister [26] is telling family members that my husband [31] is a ""bully"" because he embarrassed her wannabe MMA-fighter boyfriend [24] after the guy tried to show off his fighting prowess at my [32F] apartment


Sister's boyfriend is an aspiring MMA fighter. I think he is a middleweight. He also is a PX90 trainer and fitness coach. Stereotypical ""bro jock.""


My husband is a science teacher and NOT a jock. Though he happens to have a black belt in judo, which he doesn't go around telling people.


Sister and her boyfriend were watching football at our apartment last weekend. Talk turned to mixed martial arts, and my sister's boyfriend starts pontificating and humble bragging about how tough it is, and by extension how tough HE is. He goes on and on about how he is ""not a huge guy but can take down anyone,"" and that he has moves that are impossible to counter.


He's about the same height as my own husband (my husband is Japanese; sister's boyfriend is Irish-American) but much more muscular. My husband is fit but very slender. Anyway my husband innocently says that no move is really impossible to counter.


So, since his jock sensibilities were threatened, sister's boyfriend offers to demonstrate an unbreakable hold on my husband. My husband doesn't talk about judo with anyone and not even my sister knows he's a high-ranking expert, so her boyfriend tries to demonstrate the hold, and my husband easily breaks it.


So, he says he was going easy on my husband, and offers to try harder. My husband consents, and this time not only breaks the hold again, but counters the move and holds sister's boyfriend in a compromising, embarrassing position, and tells him to break the hold.


Sister's boyfriend is totally humiliated and eventually ""surrenders."" He is humble about it and shakes my husband's hand. Rest of the afternoon seemed to go just fine.


But later on Facebook my sister mentions to me that my husband was being a bully to her boyfriend. In fact my mom called me later and told me to tell my husband to stop showing off, and for him to stop messing with sister's boyfriend.


One would think my husband was stealing candy from children or something.


I texted my sister back and said that her boyfriend was the one bragging endlessly about what a badass he thinks he is, and out of nowhere challenges my husband to break an ""impossible"" hold, and so my husband humors him and does exactly that.


I personally think my sister is just butthurt because she knows my meek little husband would absolutely smack the shit out of her alpha dog if they had a fight, and she's processing it all like an immature ten year old instead of moving on with her job of... Unemployed.


Then she went into a long spiel about how teachers are all corrupt (I'm a teacher too, for history) and just collecting paychecks and doing a lousy job, and how I think that now that I married a foreign person I think I'm exotic now.


Ouch. Tell me what you really think, sis!


I told her that she was acting like some of the middle school kids at mine and my husband's work. Now she's saying that I'm bullying HER by saying that.


But is it true? Was my husband being a bully? It seemed like the other guy had a sporting attitude about being beaten, so I don't get why sister is so mad.
  

I realize she's proud of her boyfriend being fit or being a cage fighter or whatever but she should know that one shouldn't go around trying to act like you're tougher than everyone else, because eventually someone will check you.

"My husband [32M] drunkenly let slip that he ""knows"" I [30F] cheated years ago and is okay with it. I never cheated.


My husband Derek and I have been married for 3 years, together for 7 total. 

Several years ago (about 6 now, I guess), I worked closely with a male coworker, Paul, that Derek was never fond of. Paul and I *never* had an inappropriate relationship. Derek's jealousy wasn't completely out of nowhere, I get why he felt that way. Those couple years were a perfect storm of relationship stress; I was working long hours, we were living apart after trying and failing to move in together, our relationship was still *fairly* new, and then you add in a handsome coworker I had to spend long hours with and saw more than my boyfriend at the time. 

Paul was the source of several fights. Again, we never did anything that wasn't completely kosher. Eventually I told Derek he needed to trust me and get over it, or we were going to have to break up. He said he would stop worrying, and for the most part things were good. When Paul transferred out of state a few months later, things were really good. There were no worries at all and our relationship has been amazingly strong ever since. 

This last weekend, my husband went out with a couple friends to some bars and a football game. When he came home, he was pretty wasted. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned how a friend of his had told him that he broke up with his girlfriend because she cheated on him. I commented on how that was a bummer and good for him for finding out before they got too serious. Derek, however, had a different take on it. He said it was a shame because they had seemed like a good couple and if they really loved each other his friend could move past the cheating, just like he had with me.

At first I thought my husband was admitting to cheating on me, and asked him what he meant. He told me he always knew that Paul and I had slept together ""at least once"" all those years ago, but he knew I was the one for him and forgave me. 

I told Derek that I had never so much as even hugged Paul (except maybe at his going away party), let alone slept with him. Derek sort of just patted me on the arm, said ""Of course"", and passed out. The next morning I asked him about the conversation and he said it was okay, he had forgiven me, it wasn't even an issue. I again stressed that I had never cheated on him with anybody and I needed him to believe me. He sort of did the same ""Of course you didn't, babe *wink*"" thing again and went to work.

Every time I've tried to talk to him since, he won't hear me out. I'm this close to losing it with him. I need him to know that I never cheated, and I'm hurt that he thinks I would do something like that. What do I do? Do I just let him have this since it's not really hurting anything, or what? I don't want my own husband to think so little of me that he thinks I would cheat. That's not who I am.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My husband is convinced that he forgave me for cheating near the beginning of our relationship. Problem is, I never cheated. I'm upset that he thinks so little of me and won't believe me when I say I didn't cheat."
"[UPDATE] My (26M) girlfriend (27F) thinks she has body dysmorphia... she's just overweight. I don't know what to do.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51gpbb/my_26m_girlfriend_27f_thinks_she_has_body/

------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, thanks to everyone who gave their opinions and advice. I really didn't expect my post to get much attention so I appreciate all the time people put in to offering me solutions to this issue.

After reading everything everyone said, and taking a few days to sleep on it, I finally decided to talk to Stephanie about the situation. A lot of people recommended that I straight up tell her she's overweight and she's not this thin person she thinks she is, but after really thinking about it, I felt that it wouldn't be beneficial to her mental health, no matter if she has BD or not, for me to do that. I felt it would be more appropriate for me to emphasize the parts of whatever is going on with her mental health that are negatively impacting our relationship and continue to push her to get help.

So that's what I did. I sat down with her Friday night and I told her that the issues she's struggling with mentally have become a barrier in our relationship. I explained to her that I felt that she sometimes stood behind her mental health problems as an excuse to not be a good partner, or to justify bad behavior that hurt me and our relationship. She wouldn't really acknowledge this at first but she eventually conceded that it's not fair to blame her behavior on any mental health issues and that she knows she uses it as a crutch because she gets embarrassed of the way she behaves. 

Then I talked to her about the BD. I explained to her that it feels to me like she is letting it define her as a person, and she lets her life revolve around it, and I don't feel that it's empowering her or helping her and I want her to get help. She told me that she feels her forum and personal research is help but I told her that this has been going on to some degree for our entire relationship and that just because she feels that she has discovered what is ""wrong"" with her doesn't mean she has fixed it. I told her that if she seriously feels that there is something wrong within her that is keeping her from being the person she wants to be, she needs to get help. 

Now, a lot of commenters felt that she didn't have BD (I'm still undecided) and that I needed to tell her she is just overweight. I was definitely not comfortable doing that. I don't think I am qualified to make a diagnosis and regardless of whether it is BD or it isn't, there is something wrong here and I am not capable of fixing it myself. 

So anyway. I told her all of that and we both cried. She told me she feels horrible for the way she has acted at times and she knows that it's not her, and this is why she brings up the BD in fights, because she doesn't want me to feel that the person she can be when we fight is who she truly is. I told her I know she isn't that person, but that since she isn't able to control herself when she gets that upset, she needs to talk to someone who can give her coping mechanisms.

We ended up looking into our county health resources for indigent people with no healthcare (her income qualifies her as indigent) and found two potential places in the area that offer low-cost mental health services to qualifying people. Stephanie texted me this morning (I'm at work) and told me she left a message for one of the facilities and she scheduled an intake appointment at another one of the facilities. The intake is free and then they discuss cost, payment plans, etc. when they make their ""treatment plan"". This suggestion from a commenter really saved our relationship, so thank you so much to everyone who suggested it.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel horrible that I came across in my post that there was nothing good about Stephanie or that I didn't respect or love her - I love her tremendously, and she is a great person who struggles with mental health issues, as many of us have in our lives. I believe she is committed to making a change, and I guess at the end of the day, whether or not she has BD isn't the biggest issue here, and making my post made me realize that. The biggest issue is that something is unwell with her mentally and she needs the proper treatment to feel better, and in turn be a better partner.

TL;DR We had a long talk and Stephanie agreed to get help. She made an appointment this morning for an intake appointment with a county resource for low-income people with no healthcare, and is going to pursue treatment. "
"UPDATE: My 28F husband 28M have been seeing a fertility doc to conceive-- just discovered that he had a vasectomy while we were trying. I am about to freak out.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46tocd/my_28f_husband_28m_have_been_seeing_a_fertility/


Hey /r/relationships, sorry it took so long for an update, it has been a long road and a lot of you PM'd to ask how I was, which I really appreciate. I'm thankful for all of the great advice you gave and to the trolls who sent me nasty messages: fuck you.


On to the update:
So I confronted him about the aftercare instructions and at first he acted like he had no idea what they were or where they came from. I swear he acted like he had never heard the term 'vasectomy' before, which supremely pissed me off. After arguing about it for about 3 hours he finally admitted that he freaked out and got snipped because he had a horrible childhood and can't shake the feeling that he is going to screw up his own child. At this point I was beyond caring and wanted a divorce, and certainly didn't believe his reasons. He cried and kept FLIP FLOPPING ABOUT WANTING KIDS during the same argument, vasectomy and all. I couldn't take it and left to stay at a friend's house. I meant to speak with him again (and update you all) but honestly I was just devastated and I didn't end up speaking to him again until the end of march (this happened in feb) when I told him I would be seeking out a divorce. I couldn't justify staying with him when (a) my one true desire in life (motherhood) cannot be fulfilled with him, nor does he apparently even want to (i don't believe his excuse), and (b) he completely went against all transparency in our relationship instead of being honest. We didn't speak again until the end of may and to be honest I didn't even speak with a lawyer during that time because other than to go to work I barely got out of bed.


At the end of may he texted me a huge long message that essentially said that he was just scared and thought if I believed he was infertile he wouldn't have to own up to it and I wouldn't leave him. He said that after much soul searching he WANTS kids and always has (and this is evidenced to me by the fact that he LOVES kids and pays random babies way more attention than I do) but that he didn't want to lose his freedom just yet, didn't want our relationship to change, and felt a crushing sense of pressure when he thought about the fact that we are going to be shaping a human being's life. I agreed to meet up with him and we spent about 5 hours discussing the whole ordeal.


My birthday is June 24 and I pretty much didn't speak to him again after that last conversation except to say that what is done is done and I simply can't stay especially now that I can't trust him. On my birthday he asked if he could take me out for lunch. I was hesitant but said yes and essentially he had the reversal procedure done after our last talk and told me about it... on MY birthday. This actually really pissed me off and made me feel like he had no respect for my feelings. He begged for a second chance and said that he had all the time in the world to think about everything and that he let his fear get the better of him... which I can understand.


I still love this man despite everything and I can have empathy for his situation, but I just can't move past the lies. He was OK with letting my heart break thinking there was something wrong with me and that I might never get to be a mother. I also question whether or not he actually wants a baby or just me. Over the summer however he has shaped into Mr. Dad and sometimes he has me convinced that he really has made up his mind. We've been to the specialist who says that he's starting to present sperm in the vas deferens (a good sign this early after the reversal) but that it could be a year or two before fertility is where it needs to be to conceive.
Its really difficult for me to make up my mind at this point and choose between a relationship that has always been extremely strong and has had ONE event of betrayal that he is trying to fix (but that I still don't trust...) and moving on to somebody else who might not be as compatible with me otherwise. There is also the issue of bringing a baby into a mix when I'm not even sure that the baby is wanted...


So yeah. That's where everything stands. Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm so over the whole thing and some of it was quite a while ago so details are fuzzy.

"My (29F) best friend (30F) and her husband (28M) visited for the weekend. My girlfriend (28F) and I don’t want him in our house ever again.


**Background:** I’ve known my best friend, Nicole, since freshmen year of college (10 years ago). She met Mike her senior year. They married two years ago and have a son together. 

Nicole is incredibly laid back, incredibly go-with-the-flow. She’s friendly, bubbly, has never been high maintenance or demanding of attention. I was initially wary of Mike because he came off as undeservedly cocky and self-centered. One of those people that walks into the room while blasting his own personal WWE entrance song in his head. But he made her happy and he was utterly devoted to her, so I figured that was good enough. We’ve lived in different cities since we’ve graduated, so I only see Nicole and Mike a few times a year.

As additional background, my girlfriend and I have been together a year, and we just got a house together. She and Nicole clicked immediately, but she has spent minimal time around Mike.

**The rest:** Nicole and Mike stayed at our house this weekend because the college football team they support was playing our local team, and they had tickets to the game. 

The gf and I were bracing for Mike’s tendency to dominate the conversation this weekend, but we weren’t anticipating just how insufferable he would become. It was a painful two days, and I was glad to see them leave this morning.

 Some examples of his behavior:

* **His football team lost, and his whiney attitude put a damper on the entire night.** I’m a football fan. I get it. I’m a bit mopey when my team loses, too, especially the way his team lost (They were highly ranked and favored and lost in a big way - if you follow college football, you can probably guess what game I’m talking about). But he pouted about it - loudly and often - the entire night. The gf and I were watching the other games on TV when Mike and Nicole got back from theirs. He stormed in the door, immediately grabbed two beers from the fridge, flopped down on the entire length of the couch and ranted about the loss for a good 15 minutes. He’d then flip between ranting about the loss during every lull in the conversation to sulking quietly while he sprawled across the couch, forcing Nicole and my gf to sit on the floor (We just moved in, so we’re still short on furniture). The conversation could never last for more than five minutes without Mike interjecting his disgust with his team’s loss. Funny enough, every time he’d leave to pout in the other room, Nicole, my gf and I would get super chatty and have a great time laughing and joking. Then he’d come back in, stamping around petulantly, interrupting whatever we had been talking about, and the general mood would immediately sour. He’d talk about how inconsolable he was each time he tipped back a new beer or smoked another bowl. He told us a half-dozen times the exact scenario that could play out for his team to still make the playoffs. He even started ranting about the game to strangers next to us at dinner. Five hours later.


* **He was abrasive towards all three of us, but most of all his own wife.** Whenever we ladies would tease each other, we'd all share in the laughter, but the moment anyone would say anything resembling teasing towards him, he'd get super loud and defensive. He'd throw a tantrum and Nicole would have to continually apologize or explain what ""we really meant"" and how it wasn't meant to be offensive. For example, Mike was raving about his peach cobbler old-fashioned at dinner - which was a welcome break from his boo-hooing about the game. I told him I'm glad he found a happy place, and Nicole mumbled something in agreement. He stared her down and said, ""BETTER? What do you MEAN I'm 'BETTER'?"" She looked a bit taken aback and clarified that she meant he must be feeling better. Later in the night, Nicole sat on Mike's lap on the couch and invited me to sit on her lap so my girlfriend could take a picture of all three of us. As I was attempting to position myself for the photo, Mike said, ""You're covering my face."" As I continued to adjust, he yelled: ""YOU'RE COVERING MY FACE!"" then shoved me off of them.



* **He made inappropriate and embarrassing comments about his and Nicole’s sex life.** The more Mike drank, the more he'd switch between making passive-aggressive comments about his sex life and feeling up on Nicole. He'd talk about blue balls and needing sex and how he wished Nicole would wear sundresses because girls look good in them. It's like he took advantage of every opening he had to make a quip about their sex life. He also took every opportunity he could to grope Nicole, even going so far as to putting his hand down her shirt collar mid-conversation. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to take out her contacts, she overheard him begging Nicole for sex in the guest bedroom. My girlfriend said the more Nicole pushed back, the whinier Mike got. 


* **He’d lash out if we didn’t react to something he said the way he wanted us to.** Whether it was a crude comment or a so-called sarcastic quip he'd make or his demand to go play Pokemon Go! the entire night (We played it to and from dinner both nights) or his inability to handle losing rounds in Cards Against Humanitiy, he'd make a scene every time something didn't go his way. He asked if we could go back to the Slushee shop we stopped at on Friday to get more alcoholic Slushees, and then added only if I ""stopped being such a *bi-atch*"" and drank with them since I didn't the night before (I declined, though I encouraged them to drink, and he still looked personally offended that I didn't want to). When we were all sharing bites of the side dishes we all ordered at dinner, he made fun of my braised kale (it was braised with bacon, for goodness sakes) and told me he'd stick with his ""shitty mac and cheese."" As if me ordering kale instead of make and cheese was a personal affront to him. 
 

* **He single-handedly smashed the weekend’s worth of beer and snacks meant for all of us.** I bought two bags of chips and a 24 pack of beer for the weekend. He slammed 18 of those beers and left nothing but crumbs from the two bags of chips. This complaint might be petty - after all, I did buy those things for our consumption - but I can’t imagine being a guest in someone’s home and cleaning out the entire weekend’s supply of snacks/drinks by myself. The cherry on top came when he he polished off his second drink at dinner (his 12th drink of the day) and suggested that I might need to go out and get some more beer because “we” were almost out. 

I realize there’s probably nothing truly damning here. He didn’t trash the house. He didn’t clean out our whole pantry - just the snacks we bought. In fact, he actually fixed a leak that sprung under the kitchen sink while the gf and I were out for a walk Saturday morning. 

But added up all together, it was an exhausting and frustrating weekend.

It got to a point on Saturday night where the gf excused herself to run to an ATM. When she had been gone a half hour, I texted her to make sure she was OK. She responded, “I can’t stand Mike. I just need a minute to myself.” For context, my girlfriend has one of the most easy-going personalities I’ve ever known. She also works in a customer service industry where she manages dozens of employees with different personality types in a high-stress environment. So it’s pretty hard to faze her. 

Last night when we laid down for bed, we agreed neither of us would be comfortable with him in our home again.

Which brings us to the crux of the situation: How do I begin to approach my best friend about this? If she wants to come visit again, how do I possibly tell her her husband is not welcome? She would come to our defense whenever he’d channel one of his micro-aggressions towards us, but it’s not like they’re getting a divorce over it. So this problem won’t be going away.

Are my girlfriend and I overreacting? We aren’t in college anymore. We’re all either 30 or approaching it. In fact, their relationship in general seems pretty unhealthy, but that’s an entirely different conversation. (Though I’d welcome advice on that, too, if it comes to that.) 

**tl;dr:** Girlfriend and I hosted my best friend and her husband this weekend. Husband acted like all of the rotten children from Willy Wonka combined. We don’t want him back in the house. Asking for advice on how to navigate what will eventually be a difficult conversation.

--------------------------------------

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, everyone. I appreciate the advice and the support. It looks like the concern here is less about addressing this weekend and more addressing this type of behavior in their relationship in general. I know from past nights of drinking with them that this wasn't a one-time behavior. He's acted like this before, only in smaller, less intense doses. 

I want to make sure she's OK and happy (if that's possible after what I observed?!). Nicole kind of opened the door when she texted me, ""Sorry Mike was so abrasive and obnoxious last night...I didn't realize he drank as much as he had,"" earlier this afternoon. My girlfriend uses reddit and has also been monitoring this thread, and we decided that I'm going to start that conversation with Nicole tomorrow morning - during work hours so I know he won't be lurking over her shoulder. 

I know that^ ^ ^ response might have seemed obvious from the get-go, but as I said to one of the commenters: Because Nicole is so laid-back, we've had a relatively breezy friendship and have never had to confront a tricky subject like this one. So as odd as it might sound, this is pretty unfamiliar territory for us.

--------------------------------------

**UPDATE:** I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to offer your thoughts and advice. I read every comment. Some of you thought my girlfriend and I could have done a better job standing up to Mike. While there were definitely some situations we could have handled better or firmer, I wanted to clarify that, overall, we didn't just let him roll over us. Every time he blatantly disrespected one of us, someone (whether it was me or Nicole) stood up to him. 

We also tried to make the weekend as inclusive for everyone as possible. I'm aware that Mike was, literally, the odd man out, so we tried to accommodate what everyone wanted to a reasonable degree. Mike wanted to get alcohol Slushees on Friday, so we got alcohol Slushees. Mike wanted to play Pokemon Go!, so we made sure to play to and from our walks to dinner both nights. Other times, he wanted to do something that no one else wanted to do (like have dinner at 4 p.m. or go back for more alcohol Slushees on Saturday), so we wouldn't. 

Also for the record, neither my girlfriend nor I hate men. It's just one man's actions in particular that rubbed us the wrong way. I got a good laugh out of that accusation, though. 

On to the update:

After spending Sunday evening talking with my gf about how to address this tactfully, I messaged Nicole this morning. I wanted to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't want to jump to any conclusions about the nature of their relationship, but I wanted to be sure Nicole knew the door would be open if she ever felt uncomfortable with the way he talks to her when he's drunk (or sober, for all I know!)

I wish I had a more interesting update, but the talk went how I thought it'd go. No earth-shattering revelations.

Like I said in my edit, Nicole had texted me the night before apologizing for Mike's behavior. So I used that as an opening.

**Me:** Sorry I didn't get back to you last night. But I just wanted you to know... You shouldn’t feel the need to apologize for Mike. I do have to admit he made both of us pretty uncomfortable this weekend, but that is not your fault nor is it something you should be apologizing for. It was important to us you both had a good time, and I hope you did. I was worried if you were happy the whole time. I want you to know you can talk to me if he ever makes you unhappy or uncomfortable because some of the things he said to you this weekend makes me worry he isn't treating you correctly. I love you and I miss seeing you, and I want you to know that the door is always open if you need to talk.

**Nicole:** What did he say that made you concerned for me?  Because I promise I couldn't be happier.  I think he just really wants you to like him, but he gets weird and awkward and tried too hard. Plus the alcohol didn't help anything.

Based on that response, I didn't see a point in belaboring the issue. Even *if* there are deeper issues in their relationship, it's clear that talk wouldn't be happening now. But hopefully, there aren't. Hopefully, she's being honest with me and herself. 

**So I said:** Well that's a relief! I guess there were a few moments where it seemed like he made you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I'm glad you are as happy as you could be. That's all I was worried about.

She went quiet for a half hour, and I feared that I had upset her. But she eventually responded.

**Nicole:** Yea there were a few times where I knew what he was saying was coming out totally offensive, so it made me cringe because he has the worst foot in mouth syndrome and doesn't realize what he's saying is coming out wrong.  I don't know why he gets so weird and feels like he needs to make jokes but it always makes things weird.  But you don't have anything to worry about with me.

I didn't want to push her, though I was tempted to say, ""If Mike was really sorry, why are you the one apologizing to us?"" But I didn't. So there you have it. We ended up exchanging ""It was good to see you!"" messages, and the convo kind of died there. 

Best case scenario, it was just a really, really bad weekend for Mike, but Nicole is otherwise happy, healthy and whole. Worst case scenario... well, at least she knows the door is open. So if it gets to that point, I hope she talks to me.

I didn't press charges because I was a bit of a party-girl and didn't think I would be believed. I honestly have no idea who the guy was, I just remember trying to push him off and being to drunk to do so. 

MY choice to not press charges. MY choice to keep the pregnancy. MY choice to adopt out. I am comfortable with these choices. They are private and personal and I am keeping most of this to myself. 

My asshole friends and co-workers have turned it into a game. I was hiding the pregnancy until I started really showing a couple weeks ago. I get that people are curious about it. It's rather surprising. But I saw a betting pool being passed around the office...THEY ARE PLACING BETS ON WHO IS THE FATHER! I was shocked and a little hurt. 

My friends are also curious. I have one close friend who basically knows everything (she's going to be in the room for the birth for me) and she's not telling anyone. So, rumors are starting. One terrible rumor is that it's my (now former) friend Karen's husband Troy's baby. Karen called me in tears. I went over to her house to tell her to her face it wasn't it possible. She demanded to know the truth. I told her it was none of her business and she blasted me on fb. 

Some friends have been really nice to my face but everything gets back to me eventually. Some people are saying that I'm a paid surrogate. I guess that one is ok. I hate that people are talking about me like this. I made ONE blanket statement on fb yesterday: ""I guess I can't hide it anymore. Yes, I am pregnant. I am giving a lovely couple the child they have tried to have for years. It's very personal and private and I ask that you all respect that."" It's got a bunch of comments but I haven't read them. I'm going to take a big break from social media. 

I don't know what else to do or say. I am uncomfortable with everyone's constant questions. I LOVE my job and usually my co-workers. It's my hope that I can suck it up and go back to normal in a few months. Weirdly, I've got great inner-peace with everything because I am so happy to be giving the adopting parents (who are the kindest men I have ever met: a kindergarten teacher and a social worker) something they could never have on their own. 

Here's what I need from the readers of this sub: What can I say that isn't a lie but will shut people up without giving out information I'm not comfortable sharing? I don't like calling her (the baby is female) an 'accident'. The two people who know the whole truth (my friend and my doctor) immediately asked me why I didn't report it. I'm ashamed and humiliated. I really don't want to say much of anything. I think a big part of why this is so hard for me and those around me is that I'm usually really talkative and social. Loud-mouthed. I'm in sales so now that I'm showing I'm also dealing with these questions from strangers too. Should I go to my manager about the pool? Laugh it off? Wait for it all to blow over?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I need to figure out what to tell people about my unplanned pregnancy in a polite but firm way that will make them stop speculating. 

**UPDATE**

Thank you so much for all the support. I'm glad I posted this. 

 I had a good cry, took an antacid (or 4) and went to the owner, Jim. I told him the truth and I told him that I really didn't want the guys to know and I needed the jokes and talk to stop because it was hurting me. He hugged me and told me he was proud of me (which made me cry again. Fucking hormones). He gathered the staff and had a quick (what he calls come to Jesus) meeting. He announced that he would fire anyone who made me uncomfortable about my pregnancy on the spot and that all the money from the pool needed to end up on my desk, pronto. He was great. He didn't share any of my personal info, he just protected me and made it quick and easy. After we disbursed, he told me I could have an additional week paid medical (I already have 2 weeks sick/vacation I haven't used). 

I am going to text/talk to my friend and tell her she can subtly let people know what happened (especially Karen). 

This baby bump is sales gold, I just landed a BIG commission *while sitting!* 

I still think, as great as Jim is, I need to get out of this town. I'll always be a trailer park slut to people around here. My mama died when I was real young and I acted out a lot after that. Everyone knows what I did and won't let me forget. Despite working my ass off to graduate, working my way up to sales lead, buying my home and fixing it up myself. I'm sick of Oklahoma. I'm thinking maybe somewhere in Oregon or Washington. Real pretty up there. 

Again, thank you for all the kind and helpful advice. I feel so much better. This has always been one of my favorite subs to lurk. Thanks. "
"I've(20M) been shunned by family for standing up for my little sister(14F)


My family has a very sad history. My parents met in high school, grew up close and were very successful in their careers. They had their first child when they were 22, their second at 25, and me at 29. When I was 5, my mother and father divorced. 

My father was broken from this, and our happy family went down the drain. I've never been close to my older brother and sister, and my father pushed me away. When I was about 7, my father met another woman, who I became close friends with. She was very kind to me, and had a healing effect on my father. She gave birth to a child, but subsequently died in childbirth. I was left to effectively raise my new sister, as my father didn't really do anything to care for her. 

It worked out OK, I guess. My birth mother and father got back together. My other two siblings were never nice to her, and my father didn't really care for any of us.  I at the end did my best to look out for her, and we're really close as a result. 

I moved out with my high school girlfriend into an apartment together near University, but I always kept up with my lil sis. However, last time I took her out to a movie with my girlfriend, I noticed she was pretty down. With enough prodding, I realized that my birth mother had been bullying her. Months of constant verbal and emotional abuse had been going on. 

I confronted my mother about it, and she brought my brother and sister into it as well. Cue a huge shouting match, them calling me akin to a blood traitor and me calling them the miserable sods that they are. I've practically been pushed away and told never to come back. 

Meanwhile, my little sister is still over there, suffering. My dad's no help, and it's affecting her health and grades. What can a guy do?

"My [40F] brother [50M] passed away and he left his two children [13F&amp;14M]. He was a very, very wealthy man and he left everything to his son and nothing to his daughter. My nephew wants to split it 50/50 with his sister but my brothers [40'sM] are against it


Hi Reddit I am hoping you can help me out. My brother passes away from cancer over the summer and they have come to live with me. I live in a small town in the midwest and they are adjusting OK. My nephew has his first little girlfriend and it's an adjustment for them. 

They grew up in the lap of luxury pretty much, I am talking private jet level wealthy. They are close and my niece and nephew really do have each others backs. My brother for some ungodly reason left his fortune and everything that comes with it to his son.

My nephew wants to split everything between him and his sister when they turn 18. He does not think it's fair that he gets everything and really neither of them will have to work a day in their lives. 

My brothers/his uncles are against the idea and they think it's wrong to go against the will. How do I get through to them 

tl;dr: Brothers are not happy because nephew wants to split his inheritance 50/50 with his sister "
"My [21M] girlfriend [22F] got drunk last night and had sex with another guy.


[deleted]"
"My wife [34F] of 10 years is completely smothering our daughter [18F] after she left for college. I [33M] can't get her to see how she's harming her daughter and herself.


So as is evident by the title, my wife had her daughter very young. The father is not in the picture. I met my wife when she was 22 and her daughter, Rachel, was 6. We got married two years later, I officially adopted Rachel, and we've been very happy ever since. 

Rachel went off to college this year. She ended up taking a few summer courses and getting involved in some organizations, so she actually moved up to school in June instead of the traditional August. Rachel was extremely excited about going off to school, and I was excited for her, too. She's going to my alma mater and those 4 years were some of the best in my life; I have no doubt she's going to be very happy there, too. Her mom was not so excited. My wife has always been a bit on the protective side, and she and Rachel are incredibly close. 

But she's taking it to all new levels lately. I personally am taking the same approach my parents took with me when I went off to school: I text Rachel 2-3 times during the week just to see what she's up to, and I call and talk to her for about 30 minutes on Friday afternoons and maybe another 10 minute call on Sunday evenings. I think this is pretty normal. Rachel is an outgoing, fun, kind young lady. I know what college is like. I call her at times when I know she won't be out partying or on dates or whatever. I try to text her at times that I think she'd just be chilling in her dorm or just walking across campus. Calls before 11 am on Saturdays or Sundays don't happen. 

My wife, on the other hand...she is constantly texting Rachel. She calls her every evening and wants to have hour long chats. She practically begs her to come home every weekend (she goes to school about 3 hours away), and when Rachel says she can't, my wife offers to come up and visit her. Rachel has come home an average of 2 weekends a month since she's been at school, and my wife has been up there for ""girls' weekends"" three other times. About a month ago we went to visit Rachel. I booked a hotel for my wife and I and told Rachel we would take her and a friend, if she wanted, out to dinner. Maybe do a bit of shopping, walk around town, but nothing too crazy. Since it was a Friday night I figured we'd be done by 8 pm so Rachel could go out with her friends, and then we could grab lunch on Saturday (after the hangover wears off, hah) before heading home. My wife brought a sleeping bag and stayed in Rachel's room, and spent all evening with her as well as all day Saturday. 

This isn't healthy for either of them. I've spoken to Rachel about it and she says she wishes she had some more freedom, but doesn't want to hurt her mom. I get that. But Rachel is a young lady and she needs to be cut loose a bit. I don't want her being that weird girl who is always going home for the weekend, or who's mom spends weekends on her floor. She can't go out, have fun, do the stuff college kids are supposed to do. She can't gain her own identity. And my wife. This is her chance to have the bit of youth she never had because she was raising a kid. She needs to learn to cope with the empty nest syndrome. Eventually Rachel isn't going to come home twice a month or for the summer. She'll actually be *gone*, living her own life. College is supposed to be that transitional period and my wife is ruining that.

How do I help my wife? How do I get her to see what she's doing isn't what's best for either of them? I've suggested therapy, but it's received a lukewarm reaction. I don't know what else to do. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My wife isn't coping well with our daughter going off to school for the first time, and as a result is smothering her. I can't get her to see that it's unhealthy and that our daughter needs the chance to form her own identity and be a college kid."
"My (26F) sister (30F) and mother (60sF) are angry at me because I'm not pregnant at the same time as my sister.


So, my big sister and I have always got along remarkably well. Aside from the dumb squabbles as kids, we have never had a real argument in the whole twenty six years I've known her...until now. 


My sis and her husband recently announced they're expecting! It was great, they invited the whole family over for dinner and told everyone. She's *just* starting to show, which explains why she's been wearing baggy sweaters in 80 degree heat lol. Anyway, this was a couple weeks ago and everything's been fine. I even went with her to look at gender neutral items and stuff and it was delightful...and then about a week ago she sat me down over lunch on my day off from work and very brazenly said, ""you need to get pregnant so our kids can grow up together."" ...wait, what?! 


At first I thought she was kidding, but from her stony face and body language I quickly became aware that she was as serious as could be. I asked what the hell she was talking about and she explained that if I wait too much longer to have a child, our kids won't be close enough in age to have a good relationship and they won't he able to grow up together and be best friends. 


I do have a boyfriend, but we've only been dating for seven months and in my personal opinion that's *way* too long to he thinking about marriage and children, but my sister doesn't think so. I said that I wasn't going to get pregnant just so our kids can have an aesthetically pleasing relationship and it developed into an argument, where I left angry. 


We just talked again for the first time two days ago. It was my aunts birthday party so a bunch of our family was there and my sis kept making passive aggressive comments about me and how I'm not supporting her and stuff. My mom came up to me and apparently agrees with my sister! She said ""you don't know how much longer I have left, I expect grandkids and they need to have each other if something happens to you or Sister."" My mom's in her 60s and healthy as far as I know, and both my sister and I are healthy. 


I don't get what their problem is. I don't know if my boyfriend is the one. It'll be years before I'm in a place where I'd be able to support a child. I usually talk to my sister every day and now we're avoiding each other and things are tense with my mother, who will surely bamboozle my dad into agreeing with her. It looks like if I don't have a baby to appease them my family will be divided. 


What do I do? 


**TL;DR: My sister and mother insist that I have a baby so my kid and my sisters kid can grow up together.**"
"My [15M] sister [17F] &amp; Her boyfriend [17M] keeps telling me I was making to much noise in my bedroom last night. I was at my Aunts place the whole night


I don't really know what's going on, to be honest with you. My sister has been giving me shit about making to much noise in my room last night. I was not home, I was at my Aunts house. My mother and my aunt are in Ohio visiting their mother. 

My sister and I have a good relationship, we do things together. Talks on a nightly basis, walk to school together. I told her on Saturday I am spending the night at our Aunts place to make sure everything was OK and I would see her at home. I did not go to school today because of my ankle. I had to go get more tests done on it (i had surgery) and that took a couple of hours. So I just went home and here I am. 

I woke up this morning and I had texts from my sister to shut up, you're making to much noise, open the door, fuck you open this door. 

I called her and she basically chewed my ass off and she was telling me how her and her boyfriend almost called the cops. She was telling me how dare I look myself in my room and not answer, she was worried. She told me to listen to her. 

I told her I have no idea what she is talking about and I was at our aunts place. She said ""The fuck you were, we heard you talking in your room to yourself"". 

I don't know if this is some sort of prank but what do I do? My sister said "" Shawn, just do something nice for me and I will forgive you. I'm not mad just do something to make up for your behaviour"" But I did not do shit, I was not home I don't know what she is talking about 

tl;dr: Sister claims to have heard me in my room. "
"My [27f] stepmom [41f] had sex with my husband [28m]. How to handle this without destroying my entire family?


[removed]"
"Me [26F] with my ex [29M]. Broke up because, apparently, I'm not supposed to like ''boy stuff.''


I grew up surrounded by vdeo games and classic rock and comics. My dad is a huge fan, and although my mom doesn't like it that much, she still enjoys some games and some of the music we listen to.

So this started at a young age, back when I was 6. My entire life I've been like this and liked the stuff that I like now. I have never, ever preached that annoying and stupid sentence ''I'm not like other giiiiiiirrrrllllllsssss'' because I find that shit so silly and dumb. Material stuff has no gender. I can like whatever I want without it meaning something. Most of my friends are girls and we all enjoy video games and this is relevant because we never looked at this shit in a oh we're so cooooool way. Never.

So, I didn't like dating. I liked hooking up and having my fun, and then I met David. We started talking because we were both wearing the same Metal Gear Solid t-shirt. Exactly the same. I thought that was awesome and during our conversation, I could see hwas trying to test my knowledge on the game. MGS is my favorite franchise and I'm honestly obsessed, so his plan went down. The reason I let it pass was because I thought it was in good fun.

We started dating soon after and he began discovering little things about me, my favorite things. He began discovering how crazy I am about anything related to Batman, how I knew even useless shit about the comics, he began to see how much I actually enjoyed playing games and at first, it wasn't bad.

We'd play together and he'd lose and be like 'ah shit', and then he just flipped one day. He caught me playing Arkham Knight and saw that I'd managed to achieve 206% in the game (this can be achieved by completing normal mode, nightmare mode and then doing all the side missions and challenges). He got visbly upset for some reason and at the time I thought it had NOTHING to do with the game. He tried to poke fun at it and say I was cheating, but I didn't care and asked him what was wrong. He said nothing.

Then, a few days later, I was playing Phantom Pain. I finally achieved 100%. He got upset again. I was irked but I still refused to believe it was because of a damn game. I went to bed, fell asleep and woke up to find him playing his own file. Fine. Went back to sleep, the next day I find out my file had been completely erased.

I called him out on it and he said he didn't do anything and I said I knew he was lying. I'm not ashamed to say I cried a little because I spent MONTHS doing EVERYTHING in the game to achieve the 100%.

He said I was overreacting but I didn't let go and then he FLIPPED.
He started saying how I was NOT supposed to be better than him at BOY STuff *roll eyes*, how I should stick with other stuff. He said he had this fantasy that I'd be bad at playing and he'd help me and I was ruining it (WHAT), and then he got even MORE crazy and brought our sex life in it. He said he always found it weird how much I liked it and the number of times I initiated it, because the girls he dated were always a little more shy about sex. He said he didn't think my behavior was good GF behavior. He said that I needed to change or we would be over and he made sure I knew he was not kidding.

I was so mad that I kept quiet and went to bed. I didn't sleep and two hours later, he climbed in bed with me, mumbled an apology and slept. I waited until I was sure he was sleeping and took all of my belongings: clothes, xbox one, and a couple of lotions I brought to his place. I textd my parents and I spent the night at their house (couple of days later I found an apartment). 

I blocked my BF on FB and instagram. I also changed the URL of my blog so he wouldn't find it anymore. I forgot to delete and block his number on my phone and I was met with OVER 100 messages in which he shows me the kind of physco he is. He apologized and then insulted me, then aplogized and insulted me some more. I didn't respond and blocked his number.

The good thing is that he has no idea where I'm living or where my parents house is (we dated for four months and no, I didn't introduce him to my parents. I was waiting until we'd hit the 6 month, so I knew it was serious), BUT he has been showing up to my work and making a fuss. I confronted him once and told him to stop coming here, to quit being an insecure little boy. He kept yelling and I walked away.

He stopped for a week and now he came back. He's harassing everyone and says I need to give him 'closure'. Ugh. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with him? I was never in this situation and I don't really know what to do. 

While I recognize that he's an ass, it still stings a bit. When my dad and my friends saw my 206% they were happy, my dad said he'd surpass me and started his own file. 

Meanwhile, the guy I used to care for and call BF just flipped out and turned into a sexist little pig.

EDIT: You guys are really awesome. Thank you for all the advice and comments. I took them to heart, sent him a message today and told him:

*This is the last time you'll ever hear from me: stop trying to contact me, stop showing up at my work and stop harassing people. Our relationship is over. If you don't stop, I WILL call the police, and you know I'm not kidding.*

Then I blocked him again and that's it. I'm still a little upset though because it's someone I liked and trusted and he just turned into one giant sexist bully. But I'll get over it, again, thank you for all the comments. &lt;3

"My [21F] best friend [21F] drunk drove and totalled her car last night, but not before burning me over text.


**EDIT this blew up more than I expected, so clarification on a few recurring comments. The text I received this morning is as follows: ""Omg I'm so awful I totalled my car drunk driving I don't even remember saying that shit I'm so sorry. Idk how I'm not arrested"".**

**I haven't responded. Her nonchalant last remark indicates to me that no police were involved - she would have mentioned it. I am very definitely cutting ties, I've given her more than enough chances. Some of these events happened over the course of years, which is why I haven't reported anything earlier. They seemed like isolated incidents. Since she turned 21, they have gotten much more common because she has access to more alcohol.**

**I appreciate every comment, even the harsh ones.**

**EDIT 2: On my way to the police station now. I'll fill y'all in when I have a full update to give.**

**UPDATE: I spoke to a police officer this morning. While he was very understanding, he stressed that they could not do anything about this incident. A police report hadn't been filed on the crash because it did not happen in our hometown. They also can't charge her with anything, as they'd need a BAC test done on-scene. There is no special ""list"" for habitual drunk drivers as I had naively hoped, but he said he'd make a call to her parents for me. He would let them know that one of their daughter's concerned friends stopped by to talk about her drinking problems, let them know that the drunk driving is a recurring event, and that the recent car crash was due to her driving while intoxicated. He then sent me on my way with some resources. Hopefully her parents (who financially support her) will finally realize how serious this issue is.**

**I also just got off the phone with a police officer in the town where the crash took place. It was no simple fender-bender. Friend drunkenly smashed into a row of parked vehicles, then left the scene of the accident. The details are fuzzy, but somehow, she got brought into the station and refused to speak with the officers. She only said that she had not been driving the car, and that some random guy that she met at the bar had been. The officer on the phone asked me for the text she sent me, word for word, as well as the time it was sent and the phone number it was sent from. According to the officer, she is only being charged with leaving the scene of an accident. They really do not want her to stick with her story of ""someone else was driving the car"" because that leads into insurance fraud, which is a much more serious deal.**

**I don't know if I'll have much more information than this, unless I hear it through the grapevine. I doubt she's allowed to have a phone anymore. It sounds like she's getting off pretty easy, considering. Hello, rock bottom.**


I use the term ""best friend"" loosely. In high school, maybe. She's done a lot of things that have pushed me away over the years; for example:

- She drove us to a party, immediately got wasted, and wouldn't let me drive her car ""because it's hers"" when it was time to go home. She convinced me she was sober (basic denial, I assumed I hadn't seen her drinking as much as I thought I had) and she drove us home without incident. A couple days later, she made a comment off-hand about how I shouldn't have let her drive because she was so drunk.

- She came to pick me up with a beer in her hand. Gave me a ""please don't fight with me"" face. I figured she couldn't possibly be that stupid, so I assumed it was her first beer. We drove to a friend's house and got lost. She blamed it on being drunk. It was not her first beer.

- Went out to a diner for food. When it came time to pay, I had cash and she had card. She took my money + my tip and charged her card. she was supposed to leave her tip + mine. She was being weirdly secretive as she signed the slip, so I went back a few hours later to ask the waiter if she left a tip (side note, she pulled some shit that night that made me very angry so I wanted to follow-up about her shady behavior from earlier). She left no tip, and used my tip to pay for a portion of her meal.

- She has the same relationship with her parents that I had with mine when I was 16 and going through a rebel phase. Her parents are good people, but she acts like they're so unreasonable for asking her to pay for her car insurance, phone bill, and to not have boys in their home when they're away.

- More on that - she decided to take a year off of school ""because she has been working so hard and deserved it"" without telling her parents, thus forcing them to support her for another year. She is 4 years through a 6 year program. She also didn't know her program was 6 years long (she thought it was 5) until halfway through her senior year.

- She failed one of her classes that is only available in the spring, so she didn't even pass her 4th year. Before she knew she failed, she just kept wondering aloud about it, and ignoring my advice to call a guidance counsellor or email her peofessor. Granted, all of that should have been done during the school year. She just waited for her diploma to come in the mail, and it never did.

- I admit I am envious of her parents completely paying for her college. I am 46000 in debt (not a huge deal, I'll have it paid off in 3 years) and she has no student debt because her father paid for it all. But it's the level of entitlement that gets me - letting her parents support her financially, and thinking she ""deserves"" time off school.


Sorry that this is rambling. There's so much more. The drunk driving thing is a pattern. She told me she got blackout at her nephews SECOND birthday party and had to get dragged home while swearing. She then said she snagged a spare pair of keys and drunk drove to her loser boyfriends house, and stayed there for a few days ignoring her parents.

I can't handle this level of emotional immaturity. I've already decided to cut ties. She got blackout last night and texted me a bunch of nasty things because I chose to go to my boyfriend of 2 years' house instead of hanging out with her. She threw in a few low blows. This morning, I woke up to an apology text telling me that she had drunk driven and totalled her car. I haven't responded.


Please, please help me figure out how to handle this. My gameplan right now is to go to the police and show them the text message of her admitting to drunk driving. I hope to get her on some kind of ""list"" so that they look out for her on the road. Can this legally get her in trouble? I'm not looking to do that, because I know her parents will have to foot the bill. Should I say something to her parents? They know about the drunk driving incident from her nephews birthday, but I don't think they know the extent of it.

Any and all advice appreciated.

TL;DR: Friend from high school is generally shitty and unreliable, has recently gotten into the habit of drinking and driving, and totalled her car. What steps should I take to protect others from her? Should her parents know all of this, some of this, or is that just mean of me?"
"My girlfriend [30] told me [26M] that we “need time apart” when I asked her to marry me. I reluctantly agreed and met someone else [28F] who I am now dating. Now girlfriend reappeared and want to get back together; what should I do?

---

I had been dating “Madeline” for about a year and a half. We met at a restaurant where I was a server and she was a customer. She left her number on her dinner check and I called her. We were boyfriend-girlfriend after a few dates.


I thought our relationship was going great. We went everywhere together. I’m more of a shy, bookish person so my social circle is different from hers. My friends are more the museum and classical music crowd, whereas hers are more the “cool kids” type.  With her, I met lots of new and interesting people. 


During our relationship I finished my degree in English and got a job as a substitute teacher. I might have finished sooner but because I was supporting myself and paying for school I sometimes had to take whole semesters off. I thought about going to graduate school to get a teaching certification and become a full-time teacher, but decided not to. Madeline was and still is a PR person for a small company. We began saying “I love you” after about four months of dating. Madeline and I both had our own apartments; I had a studio and she had a one-bedroom. Hers was nicer, and in a nicer part of the city. We’d often spend weekends at each other’s place, but since hers was larger and nicer of course her apartment was the more common weekend destination.


About sixteen months into our relationship I decided that I wanted to marry Madeline. I went and bought the nicest ring I could afford. I found one I thought she would like at a small jewelry store and paid close to a thousand dollars for it, after tax.


I asked Madeline to marry me and although she didn’t say “no” in so many words, she didn’t say yes, either. She only said that I was sweet, and reminded me that she loved me, but that she needed more time to find herself.


Well naturally I was crushed but I remained stoic and told her I understood. In the coming weeks, however, I noticed a marked decrease in her affectionate behavior. Whereas before she used to be really “hands-on” and touchy-feely, she gradually stopped doing that. We also gradually stopped spending every weekend together. She also stopped “tagging” me and uploading so many pictures of us on Facebook. It all happened gradually.


All of this “gradually” stuff took place over the course of maybe six weeks.


Eventually, after our relationship seemed to be tapering off, Madeline told me she wanted to “take a break from us.” She explained that she still loved me but that she needed time away from me. I didn’t want that, but I told her I understood. She further explained that during this break, I shouldn’t try to text her anymore, or message her on social media. In fact, in a low-key way she had changed her settings on social media so that there was no information about her relationship status at all. Well, at least she didn’t block or unfriend me. If she “limited” me, I’m not sure.


“When will the break end?”


“I don’t know.”


So, Madeline took her “break” and I tried my best to move on with my life. I know it was an impulsive move considering it was possible we might get back together, but I returned Madeline’s ring to the shop from which I bought it. They were cool about giving me back my money. The owner was actually really sympathetic. Madeline didn’t even really look at the ring when I asked her to marry me, so at least the relatively low-cost of the ring isn’t the reason for her rejection of me.


I ended up getting a job at a private school tutoring German, which I speak fluently because my parents were born there and we spoke German at home. Since it’s a private school, it doesn’t matter that I don’t have a post-graduate teaching degree. It’s also cool because the school director will pay for me to take extra units at community college, and will pay when I transfer to a four-year school to get a second degree. With my new job I’m earning more than double what I used to as a substitute teacher and waiter, even with tips. I’ve been at the new job four months. I moved into a bigger, nicer place this past August. It still isn’t as nice an apartment as Madeline’s, but it’s a lot nicer than the one I used to have, anyway.


I also met “Jean,” a fellow teacher who tutors French at our school. Jean and I started seeing each other, and we’ve been dating lightly for a month. At first just as friends, but I can tell Jean wants more. I do, too, but I’ve been trying to be loyal to Madeline. I’ve kept my relationship—what there is of it, anyway—with Jean really low key, both because we work at the same place, and because technically I’m still with Madeline.


Now, Madeline is suddenly texting me again, telling me that she’s ready to be with me again.


But now, I’m not so sure. I still have feelings for her, but I’m also feeling hurt, rejected and betrayed.


And then there’s Jean, too.


Maybe it was stupid of me to mention it, but I mentioned to Madeline that I’ve started seeing someone else. But I added the completely true detail that I haven’t slept with this person.


Madeline says that she’s hurt I’m seeing someone else and that this is a form of cheating.


I don’t know. I think that after six months of silence after she told me not to talk to her unless it was on her terms, I was starting to move in a positive direction for myself.


She says that she’s ready to get engaged and that she loves me.


If this had happened maybe after only one month of a break, I’d probably jump at the chance, but now, half a year later, and with Jean in the picture, I’m not so sure.


Asking for advice on what to do.


Tl;dr: I asked girlfriend to marry me. She said no, and that we needed a break. I consented. Several months later I met someone new, and started dating them. Now girlfriend is back and says she wants to resume our relationship. I’m not sure what to do.

So I turned 18 about a week ago and a bit has happened since my last post.


Things I've done.


1.) Moved out, my parents refused to understand me or my line of work, I haven't worked a second at the fast food restaurant, I've spent the last 3 weeks or so without any access to a computer, apparently it was my parents way of punishing me for disobeying them. Right now I'm on rocky terms with them, they don't support me moving out, and moving in with my friend who is a sophomore in college who has his own apartment.

2.) I lost about half of my reoccurring clients due to dropping off the map for 3 weeks, I'm in the process of restoring some of them, others don't want to work with me anymore, by the end of this week I should have around 75% of my original client base so I'm low on money for a bit.

3.) **I did my taxes** thanks for all that, my friend's parents were lifesavers here, took way long than I thought, but since I kept throughout records it could have been far worse. It's all been sorted out now, but glad that was pointed out to me.

So basically now my family fucking hates me. They think I abandoned my family to go off and do gods knows what. I've called my grandparents, uncles, aunts, even my cousins refuse to talk to me. As previously stated in my family, family is important, so I'm not really surprised at that. The only people who will talk to me is my brother, who _secrectly_ supports my decision, his wife and my one cousin who also was excommunicated from the family.

Right now I live at my friends apartment with another guy, I pay for 1/4th the rent and personal tutoring for their computer science courses. I started senior year _technically_. I am not going to the high school I was earlier. Turns out I only really needed to take one more class before I could graduate from my high school, I'm taking that class online now and will technically graduate in October. Its slightly convoluted, but it was enough for the college that accepted me to grand me early enterence, so I start there in January with my full ride still in tact. Like I said I lost around half my reoccuring clients, but the money is still there, I'm not nearly as busy as I was before, but I still have stuff to do. So my finacial status is alright, my family is what's killing me.


I decided to move out about a month ago and made plans with it with my friend, but only told my parents the night before. In hindsight it was a dick move, but I was afraid what might have happened if I told them earlier. When I left with my suitcase the next day, my parents physically attempted to stop me, I ended up having to leave with nothing. No clothes, no computer, no nothing. I was unable to move my stuff out. Since then my parents have refused to let me in the house to get it, I'm not sure what has happened to my stuff, most importantly my computer, luckily all of my stuff has been backed up and been restored to my new setup which is a bit more portable. 


It's tough, but I think I made the right descsion.

Oh dear I hope I formatted and linked this properly.  

I just had a wonderful night and wanted to thank all of you and give a quick update.  When I left off I had just signed a lease on an apartment.  Well, I ended up not taking the apartment and moving back in (cringe).  I don't know what I was thinking.  I contacted him about getting my things and then one thing lead to another and I was back in the condo.

That lasted for a solid month before another terrible argument.  He would come sit near me on the couch and if I didn't respond to his liking, I would get a lecture about my behaviour.  I always felt like my behaviour was under a microscope.  It was exhausting.  So one weekend, he put on a movie and I was on my computer.  He said he wanted us to both be watching the movie together so I put my computer away which angered him.  We spent 2 days arguing about that.  He made fun of me and mocked my voice and I finally just snapped.  I'm not actually proud of this part.  I told him I hated him and that I regretted marrying him and ever meeting him.  He said all sorts of hateful and hurtful things back.

So I'm done.  I left the following day with whatever could fit into my car.  If it didn't fit in my car I didn't take it.  I'm living in a house with some other professionals and students.  It's not the best place I've ever lived but it is only until April and it is dirt cheap.  It is safe and clean so I can't ask for much more than that.  I blocked his phone number and email address.   I haven't talked to him since I moved out.

For two weeks after I was a mess.  The amount of rage I felt towards him was scary.  Not that I was going to kill him or hurt him.  But I was just so angry.  Then I was sad because I just wanted someone to love me and have fun in this life.  Is that too much to ask for?  I came back and re-read all the lovely things everyone wrote.  Thank you all for your kind words.

Tonight I finally felt like my old self.  I went to a concert and I had so much fun.  It was phenomenal.  I love that I don't have to walk on egg shells where I live.  I love that I'm not constantly feeling pressured to have sex (because according to him the Bible says I can't deny him).  I'm not a slave to his dick anymore.  I love that I am free to wear whatever I want at home (he seriously says that girls need to be careful with what they wear because they don't know how guys brains work).  I honestly didn't feel comfortable wearing yoga pants at home because he would get turned on and be chasing me with his boner as I had my shoes on and out the door to go to the gym.  I feel so free and light.  I've also started therapy.

I just really want to thank everyone for getting me on the right path again.

Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51mfus/a_nurse_m_at_the_local_hospital_is_making_me_24f/)

Last Wednesday I sent my email off to the patient relations department of the hospital. Today the clinical manager for the Fracture Clinic called me personally.

The nurse in question is not actually a nurse - he is a orthopedic technologist. The manager explained to me that this means he sets casts and fits braces - and air boots. Apparently he did think I should have been wearing a smaller boot and the boot I was wearing was too much for just a broken toe. (However, seeing as how he was not the doctor who treated me initially and SPECIFICALLY assigned that size of boot...) He also *supposedly* was trying to make a joke with his comments. The manager told me she had spoken to him and told him that his comments were not perceived as sarcasm/a joke and apparently he felt bad for offending me.

I feel like the Clinic Manager did take my concerns seriously, but also now this guy totally knows I ratted on him and now I have to see him in three weeks. Still anxious about that but at least it's for different reasons now!

"My [26F] boyfriend [27M] doesn't like how I spend my money, thinks I'm wasting OUR money


**A slight update located after the first part of my post**

I’m a computer engineer and with the help of my parents, the government and scholarships, I was able to graduate with little debt.

During college and for the first two and a half years of working for a private firm, I lived at home so I was able to save what I made for the future. When I finally moved out into an apartment, I was talking to a guy (Dave) I meet from an online dating app. We went on our first date late January and it went smoothly from there.
 
A little background on Dave and his family. Dave graduated from the same college as me (he got some kind of Art/Science Degree) but he gone back to college to get a degree in Business since he couldn’t find a job that he wanted to work. He lives with three other guys and works part time at a nice steak restaurant. Dave’s parents seem nice but they’re the kind of people that try to keep up with the Joneses even if it’s out of their means. 

Fast forward about 18 months. I’ve been promoted within the company so I’m making more. Dave is still in college, living in the same place, working at the same restaurant. Not much has changed on his front. 

I don’t know what changed but Dave started getting more irritated whenever I gift my family little things or pay for family dinners. He would just make a face like he swallow a gnat and just sit unhappily.

Things came to ahead when he found out that I loaned my older sister some money to help her pay for her wedding.

I don’t remember how it started but we ended up arguing about my so call uncontrollable spending habit. Heated words were exchange, the jist of it was that he didn’t like that I was spending so much money on my family. I told him it wasn’t his place to tell me how I spent my money because it’s my money, not his. His reply was that since we’re together, it’s our money and that I was wasting it. This went on for a while until I told him to leave which he did with the slam of the door.

I haven’t talked to him since we fought which was a couple of days ago.

So I’m looking for some advice on how I should proceed with this relationship.
  ---   
**A slight update, but not yet the resolution I'm looking for..**

**Hey guys, I just wanted to say thanks to all of the comments and advice. It really put a lot of things into perspective for me. That and I talked to my sister last night during dinner about what's going on with Dave and I.** 

**There are a couple of reoccurring comments and things that I want to address. Sorry for not replying to them in the first post.**   

1) We haven't really talked about having a future together. There haven't been any talks about moving in together or getting a house or marriage, nothing. And it's on both of us because I think we're not ready for that next step. He's still in school and I just started my professional career. He's not sure where he’s gonna end up after school whether he's gonna stay in city or even in the state. I like where I work and most of my family is here so I don't see myself moving to follow him if he chooses to leave.

2) As for who pays for our dates, we don't really go out too often simple because it doesn't jive with our schedules. Dave works most weekends since it's the most profitable for him and I like to cook dinner during the weekday so I can eat the leftovers for lunch the next day. Most of the time we eat together at my place. We do go out for special occasions like birthdays and anniversary and he does pay for those (unless it’s his birthday then I pay). And if we go to see a movie (which is not too often, we usually watch stuff on Netflix), we usually split the cost, like he pays for the tickets and I pay for the drinks and snacks.

3) I realized that our relationship has taken a slight sour tone. I've started looking down on him simply because I got a good job and he's still in school. Part of that I think is because we don't spend time together. I work during the day, he goes to school and works most evenings, so that doesn't leave a lot of time for us to spend together. I think I've become a little bitter/resentful and that's bleeding into my personality.  I'm gonna stop that train of thought right now before it consumes my entire personality.

4) As for what degree Dave got before, he never talked about it, all he told me was that he messed around and choose what he thought was the easiest degree to get at the time. I never pushed him to tell me since he got that degree before we started dating. Going on the same thread, we never really talked about his parents or what his family life is like. Every once in a while, we would go to his parents’ house for dinner but he never invited me to any of his family gatherings on the holidays. I invited him to a couple of my family gatherings and he went sometimes and sometimes he was busy which was okay.

5) I have a big extended family and I love being around them. I have lots of cousins and there's usually a couple of birthdays every month. I don't get them expensive things, maybe a board game (I try to avoid buying them electronics since that can be expensive and make other family members jealous) or some nice chocolate. I enjoy spending money on them. That doesn't mean I don't spend money on him. We celebrated his birthday twice during our relationship, nice restaurant and a gift. I don't want our relationship to be based off finances, we haven't reach that stage yet.

6) We haven't talk in four days. And that made me realize we don't see each other too often because of our schedules. I work during the day and most of his classes are during the afternoon. Some evenings he goes to work so sometimes we don't see each for a couple of days. And that seemed fine until I realize how much of our relationships is based off texts.

7) **WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN FOUR DAYS.** We fought on Thursday and neither of us contacted the other. And that's on both of us. We're both acting like high schoolers, not adults and I think that reflects on how we view our relationship

After reading through the comments and talking to my sister, I realize that I really need to talk to Dave about our relationship. I contacted him this morning, asking to talk to him face to face. He hasn't responded but I'm hoping to talk to him in person rather than on the phone via call or text. I do like him and I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I don't want somebody dictating how I should live my life.

Wish me luck, hopefully we talk tomorrow (Dave doesn't work tomorrow evening). I don't want to end, if it comes to that, this relationship on a bitter note.

**Thanks again for taking the time to help.**

"Me and my fiancée [27M / 25F] cut all ties with my rude, abusive younger sister [24F] and my parents are giving us hell for not wanting her at our wedding.


So a little context to why this has happened.

I have two younger sisters [26F &amp; 24F] and the youngest one was always difficult to deal with (let's call her ""Amy""). Me and the middle one always got along great, but Amy always caused problems in the house. Growing up, she was the one who threw the fits, screamed and cried, and for some reason my parents allowed this to carry on to her adult life, maybe because they were tired, maybe because she was the baby, I don't know. But pretty quickly she found out that if she screams loud enough, she will get her way. And that shows as an adult, since she can't get any point across or have a civilized argument about anything without the volume going from 1 to 100 in a second. 

That started to wear me down as I got to 17-18. My parents would do what she wanted just so she could stop her fits, but that never worked with me, so we would be fighting all the damn time, and that really drove me away from her. She would turn into a truly nasty person when angry, saying anything she could to insult you and hurt if you went against her. For example, I was born with a lazy eye (strabismus) that got corrected with surgery when I was 17,but up until that point she would always use that to insult me when we got into a fight, calling me names like ugly, alien, cross-eyed and things like that. 

She would get physical too, as she tried to slap me and punch me several times. Once she threw a mug with burning hot coffee at my face that would've severely fucked me up had I not got out of the way. I've never laid I finger on her not even to defend myself, but that never stopped her. I didn't feel like talking to her or know anything about her life for 10 years now, just to left alone and have her not bother me. We were just two people living in the same house. My parents were always trying to be peace makers but the nasty and manipulative way she would go about when someone got in her way was disgusting to me. She knew if she started enough shit she would get what she wanted and she would take plenty advantage of it. The last time I saw her was 3 years ago when I moved out and we only talk when she picks up the phone when I call my parents house.

My fiancée can't stand her, my friends never liked coming over when she was there, my exes never liked her either. I've grown to truly dislike her as a person, and I wish her the best but I don't want anything to do with her anymore. Now I'm getting married, and we don't want her there at all. My parents are mortified over this, saying that ""she is your sister and family should stick together no matter what"", and ""how can you invite some random co-worker and not your own sister"" but that doesn't cut it for me anymore. I told them that just because we were born from the same people doen't mean that she has a free pass to be shitty to everyone for years and I should just ignore it. 

My mom's been crying ever since, bombarding me with texts and calls over this for weeks now and even saying that ""if her whole family isn't there she doesn't feel like going either"". I don't know what to say anymore. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for reading this :)


tl;dr - my younger sister was an all around horrible person to me growing up, we don't speak anymore and I'm not inviting her to my wedding, and my parents are devastated over this."

"My [25f] brother [27m] admitted he sabotaged his letter of reference for our brother [32m] and his husband's [33m] adoption because he lives with them and doesn't want them to have a kid yet. My sister [28f] thinks they deserve to know, I don't want to get involved. What should I do?


My brother Matty has lived with our older brother Chris and his husband Nils for four years. He moved in a year after they got married. 


I don't know what their agreement is per rent or timeline for Matty to move out. AllI know I'd they treat him like their kid already. They hand held him through finishing college (he dropped out twice before living with them), supported him to get back in shape, and basically had to teach him how to take care of himself. 


The rest of us learned from our parents, Matty never paid attention or followed the rules growing up, he has always been a special case because he's the troublemaker. 


Chris has always been the perfect older brother to live up to and I think he feels like Matty resented him for it. Their relationship only became really close, maybe codependent, when Chris came out as gay and our parents stopped talking to him for a couple years. 


They asked him for a reference letter a few months ago because they are ready to adopt. Matty agreed and acted really happy to be an uncle when I was around him. 


A couple nights ago at my sister Tamara's house Matty was drinking and made some really off color jokes about Chris adopting. I asked him what his deal was and he started rambling about Chris and Nils forgetting about him. He seemed really upset that Nils wouldn't have time to train with him or attend as many of Matty's meets and competitions if he had a kid. I remember him saying ""I'm kaput once they have their shiny new Benetton kid to play happy daddies with.""


He said it wasn't fair that he wasn't young or cute enough for them. I told him it was pretty weird he felt threatened because it meant ""child"" is the role he occupies space in in Chris and Nil's life. He was crying and mumbling at this point. While I was comforting him he begged me not to tell them about the letter. When I asked him what he meant he repeated ""I didn't send a good letter."" multiple times until Nils came to take him home. 


In the context I'm a 1,000% sure he meant the recommendation letter. He'd mentioned it weirdly and then abruptly changed subjects shortly before his meltdown. 


I told my sister what happened and she thinks that they deserve to know so they don't ask him for help again in the future. She also thinks they should ask Matty to move out so he doesn't go ""psycho"" if they do adopt. 


Tl;dr: I don't want to be responsible for Matty ending up on the street. I don't want to ruin everyone's relationships either. Is it really my place to tell Chris and Nils what Matty said?

"I (29M) am considering leaving my wife (30F) because we haven't had sex in 3 years


Tl;Dr haven't had sex in about 3 years

My wife and I met when I was 19. we dated and got married when I was 24. Our sex life was amazing and we'd have sex a lot. Then around 3 years ago we just stopped having sex. My wife didn't want to do anything anymore other than kiss and cuddle. I tried asking her many times what's wrong and she'd insist it was nothing. I pleaded with her to go to therapy with me and she'd say nothing is wrong. 

She's right, sort of. We don't have financial issues hanging over our heads, we both have good jobs and outside of the lack of sex she's very affectionate and kind. Which is why I feel like a massive piece of crap. I've never cheated and have no plans to cheat but I can't go on in a marriage without having sex anymore, it's frustrating. I'm 29 and my own wife hasn't wanted sex in 3 years. The last time I got a blow job was maybe a little over 2 years ago. 


2 of my best friends are trying for babies with their spouses,  another is single and living it up and I'm just here trying to make do with masturbation every now and then. I'm not unattractive and my wife isn't either, we both exercise quite a bit and are in fairly good shape. 


I really don't know what to do anymore, she'd be devastated to know the thought of divorcing her even crossed my mind but what more can I do? I hate myself because here I am, seeming like a huge dick for thinking of divorcing my wife because I'm not getting laid. 

I really don't see any other options at this point but if anyone could recommend anything that'd be great

"I [26F] went to a friend's wedding with my BF[30M] and he jokingly ran away when I caught the bouquet, I am secretly hurt by this



UPDATE: we've talked, everything's good. He told me he was only joking. He said he wont be proposing anytime soon but we could try convincing our parents to let us live together. Where I am from it is the norm to live with our parents until we get married no matter the age (for those of you who questioned). Thanks for the help and opinions!

Throwaway because BF also reddits

I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 years and I'm pretty sure he knows I'm into the 'getting married' thing, we've talked about it more than once and although he never expressed any interest in getting married to me he also has never expressed any thoughts against it. 

This past week we both went to a friend's wedding and I caught the bouquet, everyone was clapping at me but that quickly turned into laughter when my boyfriend pretended to be running away. I sort of played along and laughed.

Needless to say and as I mentioned in the tittle I am sort of hurt at his actions. We didn't talk about the wedding or his 'joke' ever since the wedding day. 

I wanted to ask him why he did that, but I'm afraid to be reading to into this? I really want to get married, and move out of my parent's home (we both still live with our parents), I'm afraid to make him angry or uncomfortable for being hurt and sad over his joke.

Am I being unfair/irrational over this? Am I sad over nothing?

"I (21F) told my boyfriend (25 M) about a fetish I was interested in exploring. He acted interested at first, and then basically ended up mocking me for it in front of other people.


My boyfriend Jack and I have been dating for a little over a year. At the start of our relationship, I was very sexually inexperienced. We've become very adventurous over the past year and have tried a lot of different things, and I have always felt that I can talk to him about anything I'm interested in trying, no matter how ""weird"" it might be. I don't expect him to always be interested in the same things I am, but I know that I can at least bring it up without him judging me.

A few weeks ago, we were talking about threesomes, and he asked me if I would ever be interested in one. I admitted that while I had no interest in a threesome, I did have a fantasy about watching another man blow him. He thought about for a second and said it sounded fun and he'd be willing to try it. I hadn't expected him to be interested in it, so I was very surprised but pleased.

We started talking about men that we might want to ask to be a part of this, and Jack suggested his best friend, Alan. Alan and Jack have been involved in threesomes with each other in the past, and Jack said he thought Alan would be interested in this. We agreed to ask him, and if he wasn't interested, no big deal, we'd just move on.

So last night, we were at a party with Alan. We had all been drinking, Jack especially, and it was obviously a terrible environment to bring up the situation with Alan, which I thought would've been common sense. However, Jack turned to Alan and said ""Wanna know what whatsthatinmyfridge's biggest fantasy is? She wants to watch you suck my cock!"" I think that Alan thought Jack was joking, and they both immediately started laughing. I was pretty embarrassed and wanted them to drop it, but they both kept teasing me about it. 

When I asked them to stop, Alan apologized and immediately stopped, telling me he'd thought it was a joke. Jack, however, brushed me off and kept lightly teasing me for the rest of the night.

When we got home, I confronted Jack, asking him what the hell he was thinking and why he thought it was ok to do that. He looked genuinely surprised and apologized, saying it was all in good fun and he meant no harm. I told him that I didn't understand why he was making fun of me for something he was interested in too, and he scoffed and said ""Gross, I would never be interested in that. I'm not going to ask Alan to blow me! That's so weird!""

I am very hurt and offended by his behavior. I think it was very disrespectful and immature. If he wasn't interested, all he had to do was say so, it wasn't like I pressured him. Am I overreacting or is this kind of behavior as bad as I think it is? 

Tldr: told my boyfriend I wanted to watch another guy blow him, boyfriend said he was into it, then made fun of me for it in public and denied ever being interested"

"My [33f] husband [29m] masturbated while touching another woman's breasts and then admitted that my small breasts ""disgust"" him. Now he wants me back. Really lost, please help.


Sorry it got so long. Nothing new here I suppose. Yet another cheating spouse. I'm just feeling so lost, disgusted, *disgusting*, and I need advice or just anything right now. Warning: I do go into some explicit detail, sorry. It's all relevant.

My husband and I have been together for 6 years and married for 4, separated for a little over a month because of what happened. We have one beautiful baby boy together, approx 1 years old.

My husband is not without fault, though neither am I. We have had to attend couples counseling in the past because my husband, ""Nate"", was *extremely* controlling. He used to be absolutely obsessed that I was cheating on him. I don't believe that a partner should have any say in what you wear or if you ""can"" or ""cannot"" go out with trusted friends, so I never backed down when he tried to restrict what I wore or how often I would go out for drinks with friends (not very often, by the way). This would result in huge blowout fights in which he would insult me pretty intensely, though never about my body until this fight.

So we have worked out most of those issues and it's been pretty much smooth sailing for the past 3 years or so. However, several weeks ago we got into a huge fight. I decided to meet up with two girlfriends and a guy friend (who I have been friends with since I was 20 years old and my husband knows well) to have a couple drinks and blow off some steam. Nothing wild, just a couple of glasses of wine and some laughs. I had texted my husband a few days prior letting him know that I would be going out with friends so I'd needed him to not make any plans so he could watch our son. He agreed, no problem.

The day comes around and after work I get home and start getting ready. It had been some time since I really put in a great deal of effort into dressing up. Mothers and fathers out there, and just anyone with a busy schedule, I'm sure you can relate to having those days where you just feel like taking the time to look good. I'm used to having my hair up in a bun for ease, wearing little to no makeup, and having some sort of baby-related stain on my work clothes. 

That night, I really put in the effort. I wore a nice dress, makeup, hair done. My husband lost his shit. He yelled at me that my dress was so short you could practically see my vagina (not true), that I was trying to dress like an 18 year old (not true), and that a clearly wanted to f**k my guy friend (not true). Then he insulted my body. He said that I looked ridiculous because my breasts are so small (they are quite small- just means I don't usually have to wear a bra- yay!) and that I look disproportionate because of them. Apparently I look disproportionate to him because I'm tall (5'11"") with an hourglass figure... up until my chest at least. He said I looked pathetic and that my breasts have ""always disgusted him"", that the only male who would ever want to touch breasts like mine is our son when he's breastfeeding.

I was obviously really hurt and I admit my reaction was not the best. I basically just told him to f**k off, he was the disgusting one, and only call me if there was an issue with our son. I said I would be back around 11:30 and I left.

I had a good time with my friends. I tried to forget about the fight but of course it was like a black cloud over my night. When I got home (on time) my husband's car wasn't parked outside. My husband and son were not inside. I panicked because of our fight and started calling him and texting him. Maybe about a half an hour later he got home with our son. He wouldn't answer me when I asked where he had been and once I put our son to bed I demanded to know why he had felt it was appropriate to take our son somewhere at that time of night without telling me. After a lot of pressure he started to cry and he told me he couldn't tell me where he'd been because I'd leave him.

Anyway, turns out that he went **with our son** to a woman's apartment that he works with. They are friends, I've met her, never thought anything about her. She does have extremely large breasts- like very, very large. He admitted that he went over there because she had asked him earlier this week if he could stop by to hang out and he was bored since I was gone so he texted her and accepted the offer. Basically, he f-ed her breasts and then masturbated while groping them until he finished on them. He said he didn't do anything else except ""a lot of groping and some sucking on them"". He then let out this string of emotions about how large breasts are his ""thing"" and mine have always disappointed him but he loved me so he never said anything. He said he'd been looking forward to getting me pregnant ""for years"" because he hoped they would become engorged and that he could get off on sucking them. But apparently they hadn't gotten large enough, it was ""really just the nipples that got large and engorged"" which was apparently ""really gross"" to him.

Fast forward over a month and here I am. I'm not in the sobbing-uncontrollably-for-hours stage anymore, more in a stage of limbo. I left him, I guess technically I asked him to leave. My son and I have been living in the house while he rented out a loft downtown. He begged for forgiveness, apologize excessively, and got himself into therapy. I hired a divorce lawyer and have been hammering out a divorce agreement so I can file soon. But after giving me a couple of weeks of no contact, Nate has been contacting me again, telling me how well therapy is going, and he seems genuinely appalled by his behavior. 

So. We have a son together, I *do* love him, and I want my family back. But... I really don't know how to forgive him. Even more hurtful than the evening he spent with that woman were the hateful and insulting things he said to me and about me. I don't know if the disgust I feel for him will ever go away. I've been seeing a therapist and it's helpful but I'm still lost. I'd really, really love to hear opinions or advice right now, Reddit.

**tl;dr** My husband has a repressed large breasts fetish that he hid from me. Nothing shameful in that, however, he masturbated on a woman's breasts and then told me that mine ""disgust"" him. I've already separated from him but now he wants me back. I do want my family together again but I don't know if I can. Lost and looking for advice or encouragement, anything.


**Edit:** I'm not afraid to be alone, but I am concerned about the effect a divorce could have on my child. I guess it's for this reason that I'm doubting my decision to file for divorce. My friends have all backed me up but my mother is putting immense pressure on me to stay. Of course, listening to her would be absurd for several reasons, one of which being that she let my father walk all over her until the day he passed away. Just wanted to clarify that my gut knows leaving is best, I guess I just wanted to hear the opinions/advice of strangers that are unbiased, I think it will be helpful in this incredibly confusing time.

**Edit again:** Just words, realized the way I put something made no sense."
"I (41F) accidentally married a mama's boy (44M) 3 years ago, who kept that fact hidden, tho I didn't think I had reason to ask if he was. Now I am raising a child (HIM) and am considering leaving. Opinions, strangers of the internet.


I met ""Alex"" at a convention.  He was seeing someone at the time but we kept in touch, the relationship he was in wasn't serious and eventually fizzled, we got together.

We dated for 2 years before getting married.  Normal relationship, save for one thing:  he lived with Mom.  Now, this isn't a case of ""gamer never grows up and lives in mom's basement"", he was her caregiver, she had cancer.  I know this as a fact, I met her many times and in a way, she felt like my family too.  I was in the room with Alex and his family when she passed (she did at home hospice).  

This is relevant because it wasn't the best situation for me to stay over at his place.  She would wake up in pain some night, have delusions and get agitated, he would have to do incontinence care, that sort of thing.  That didn't really bother me at all, I worked in a nursing home for 5 years after college, I am now a nurse myself, I'm used to death and sickness and poop, but it just wasn't the sort of situation that made an overnight houseguest ideal at all.  Alex did stay at my place, during which times his brother ""Bill"" would stay with their mom, and they did have a caregiver come in certain days of the week for a 12 hour shift.  Maybe a red flag is that Bill and his wife ""Cathy"" only lived about a mile away from Mom, but plenty of completely healthy families live close to one another.  They didn't seem overly enmeshed, and Alex and Bill are close despite being very different people.

During this time, Alex had a good job.  He was a sysadmin, and made very good money.  Some days he worked from home, when he couldn't, the caregiver or Bill came.  

Mom eventually passed, Alex and I moved in together, and got married about 6 months later.  This is also important.  Our apartment was always sort of chaotic, but between settling his mom's estate, both our jobs, and planning a smallish wedding, we didn't have tons of time to organize and stuff like we would have liked.  I was confident things would settle down after the wedding. 

Oh. How. Wrong. I. Was.

I have accidentally married a 10 year old.

He has NO household skills.  He doesn't know how to clean a bathroom.  Like *legitimately does not know how*.  Not even ""Well, it's clean, not as clean as I would like it, but still completely good enough.""  He doesn't know what cleaning products to buy or use.  When I buy them he doesn't know how to use them.  Eventually I settled on ""OK, I'll clean the bathroom.  You do the kitchen and vacuum.""  I'm a bit particular about bathrooms anyway, for some reason, the bathroom needs to be EXTRA clean because I just can't with a gross bathroom.  That's my quirk so fine - I'll clean it and I'll clean it up to my standards, he can do everything else that I'm not as picky about.

*He didn't know how to mop a floor*.  He does it now, but I had to show him how I do it - slop it once really wet, let it sit a couple minutes, then wring the mop out as you go to get it more dry and cleaner than just running a dampish mop over it.  It wasn't that he didn't know how *I* wanted it done, he *didn't know how to do it*.  

He can't cook.  I'm not asking for gourmet meals, but he *doesn't know how measuring cups/spoons and kitchen utensils work*.  

He'll do chores if I ask him to do them.  Like vacuuming the floor.  But he will ONLY do it if I ask.  He can't just see dirt, go ""this needs to be vacuumed"" and do it.  And he does such a god awful job, any reasonable person would go over it and do it again anyway.  

Other than bathrooms, I'm really not a clean freak.  I don't care if there's dust around the baseboards.  Do those once a month. Or whenever.  Maybe.  A few crumbs under the toaster?  BFD, just wipe down the cooking surfaces.  

But he needs just EVERYTHING spelled out.  If I don't ask him to do it, then show him how it's done, it doesn't GET done.  

Then there's the job.  His company downsized a year after we were married.  He is currently working for minimum wage at a Halloween supply store.  His skills are so obsolete it would be laughable to anyone in the industry.  I know nothing about computers/tech/networking but from people that do, he should have been updating his skills, taking training/classes for YEARS now and apparently he never did.  And that's rung true.  I've helped him search for jobs, I'll say ""What about this one?  You know SQL, right?""  and he'll say ""Yeah, but they want [other thing] and I don't know that"".  It's like he's fixated on doing ONE THING that's out of date, won't consider doing anything else, or going in a different direction with other skills he has.  I mean SHIT!  As I said I'm a nurse.  I currently work as a nurse.  I've been an RN for 18 years.  But during times when I moved, got laid off, had a temp contract, whatever the reason was, and couldn't get a nursing job immediately, I've done other things.  I've been a phlebotomist.  I've been a medical transcriptionist.  I've been a billing coder.  I was even a sample accessioner for a while.  Yes, I've stayed in the medical field, but I didn't say ""I am a nurse.  I am only a nurse.  Nursing Activities are the only thing I am able to do, therefore I can only work as a nurse.""  NO!  I'm sure he could parlay his skills into SOMETHING else.  Technical writing, maybe.  IDK, just anything other than a job mainly for high schoolers.

We can make it on my salary, that's not the point.  We're lucky to not have many expenses or debt, but *that's not the point*.  The point is he's content to do nothing.

I'm reaching my limit with it.  I even asked Bill, roundabout, if Alex has always been like this.  He said he's always been a little ""unmotivated"" but hell - he did go to school for his computer science degree, and was damn good at what he did.  When he lost a job or one got stagnant, he would always get headhunted for something else in very short order.  Maybe that's it?  Maybe he's so used to having everything handed to him that he can't take initiative? 

But how in HELL does a grown ass man not know how to clean a house to basic standards of hygiene?  This is both of our second marriages, maybe his ex just did it all?  Maybe this is why she's an ex?  He said they just got married too young, which I believed because that was very much my story.  I was in loooooooove at 19, and had no idea what the demands of adult life and a marriage were, nor did my then-husband.  We didn't grow together, we grew apart.  It definitely can happen.

I'm thinking about at least separating.  I feel like I'm living life for 2 people.  I feel like I'm raising a child.  I don't mind helping a partner, supporting them during rough patches, showing anyone anything if they don't know how to do it, but everything all the time?  Especially when I don't get any of that back?  Alex is a good *person*.  He's very considerate, loving, sensitive, funny, intelligent, caring, and honest.  But I just can't take on all the Real Life Responsibilities for both of us anymore.  I've brought this up to him and he's said he'll ""try"" or ""do better"" but there's never really a plan. We tried counseling, but that had pretty much the same result - I had to lead all the ""homework"" and suggestions when we got home.  

On a good day, I feel like he's a good man with some sort of social/cognitive impairment.  On a bad day, I feel taken advantage of, that he just wants the maximum benefit for the minimum amount of effort, or maybe he's playing dumb on purpose.

I never questioned it because I just assumed a man in his 40s caring for another human being was a fucking adult.  Now I have no real idea who cooked his meals or cleaned the house, come to think of it, I never SAW him do it.  Then again, I never questioned if he knew basic cooking and cleaning because I didn't think one would have to. 

I've talked, I've explained, I have on occasion screamed, that I can't take care of MY internal and external life if I'm always dragging him through life for both of us.  Just once, I'd like to come home from a bad day and have a meal ready.  Even burgers on the grill and frozen fries would be fine.  Just once, I'd like to not come home from cleaning up blood, guts, and entrails at work (did I mention I'm a trauma nurse?) to have to come home and show him how to sweep a floor. I would like to spend one weekend not searching for jobs for HIM because he ""doesn't know where to look"".  

I know the alternative is ""don't"".  Cook my own meals and leave him to figure something out.  Don't search for jobs for him.  Don't clean anything other than what is ""my"" portion of the chores.  *But he wouldn't care*.  He'd just say ""I don't know how to do that* and pretend it doesn't exist.  

Is there any help for this?  Are there any disorders he should be evaluated for?  Could this honestly be a psych/behavioral/processing deficiency or is he just a lazy user? 
  
  ---   
 tl;dr Husband has no basic life skills whatsoever.  This was camouflaged by the fact that he was his mother's end of life caregiver.  I cannot continue to drag him behind me through life.  Is he just a lazy user, or could he have a behavioral disorder?  Should we explore that before separating on a trial basis, or should I just leave, at least for a while?"

Hi Reddit, so any and all advice would be appreciated. 

2 days ago my brother killed himself, I still don't know why. There was no note, no reason as to why he would have done it, but he hung himself in his apartment. I told my mother what happened and everyone is upset. 

My mom does not want to tell my little brother and sisters, she fears Owen is going to take it the hardest because him and Daniel were like the best of friends.

I am close to my siblings and we want to be close to each other in our life. Daniel and Owen were brothers and he would always ask Dan to help him with things. 

Owen is my little brother and he idolised Daniel, just followed him around and wanted to know everything. My mother does not want to tell my sisters what happened and is threatening to disown me if I say anything. She won't even tell our step dad what is going on. 

She just left and has been staying with me, it's been almost 2 days now. I think my sisters may know because of Facebook but I don't think my brother does 

tl;dr: brother killed himself, mom is refusing to tell step dad and my siblings "

"My girlfriend [31] says that my part-time job as a barista is an embarrassment and that I [27M] should quit as soon as possible


I work as a professional editor translating books into other languages, usually from French to Russian, or Russian to Vietnamese, vice versa. I speak English too, but it is by far my weakest language.


My girlfriend of one year and two months works as a pilates and yoga instructor. She speaks English perfectly of course, but does not master any other language other than being able to somewhat understand Spanish if it is spoken very slowly.


I make easily enough money in my job but since I work on only two or three books every month, often I will finish very quickly and have nothing to do.


I am a nice person and I have friends, but nearly all work normal jobs from nine in the morning until the afternoon, so I have a lot of empty time. My girlfriend's schedule varies from week to week.


To stop from being bored I gained a part time job at a large French restaurant. They were not hiring servers at the time but had an opening in the coffee bar in their attached take-away bakery. I took the job to keep me socially active and busy.


Honestly I have a lot of fun in my part time job. It is not physically demanding and it is fun talking to people. I also like surprising people who think I cannot speak French because I do not have the air of a French person. When I tell them I am Vietnamese then it makes a lot more sense.


My girlfriend thinks that the fact that I basically work a fast-food job (I do not earn tips other than if people are generous and throw money in my jar) is shameful because I have a master's degree from a prestigious foreign university.


I don't mind and I don't think it's anyone else's business, and I'm not embarrassed of it.


I have befriended some of my coworkers and sometimes invite them to my apartment when I have a party (I have a big, three bedroom place). My girlfriend says that this too is inappropriate.


I just don't know what her problem is but she is saying that I need to stay in my class.


I was quite poor as a child so I don't really know what she's driving at. I think a friend is a friend, and a job is a job and I am grateful to have either.


My girlfriend says I should quit the barista job and find a more appropriate job.


What can be more appropriate? I have fun and am making some nice extra change, and am practicing my English.


Any advice on other jobs to get?

"My [24F] boyfriend [25M] always insists on driving around our walkable neighborhood, and gets upset and annoyed when I want to walk. He told me that it makes me look poor.


This is a really stupid problem, but I'm getting really fed up, and I'd appreciate some advice.

My boyfriend, Adam, and I are neighbors, and we live in a very walkable area. Most of what we need for day-to-day living is less than a five minute walk away. I don't really like driving, so I love it! 

Adam does like driving, and will almost always insist on taking his car when he goes out, even if he is heading somewhere really close by. The problem is, since this is such a dense area, parking can be a hassle, meaning that taking a car is often more effort than just walking. I wouldn't care if Adam just did this when he was by himself, but he also insists on driving when we are going out together, even though it often ends up being a problem. We will end up circling around looking for parking, only to end up a couple blocks away from where we were trying to go, so walking would have actually been faster and less aggravating. Adam will loudly complain about how annoying it all is, even though he was the one who insisted on driving. 

It escalated into us having two arguments about it recently. We were going to a festival that was about a ten minute walk from our apartment complex, and as usual, he said he would drive. I knew that parking was going to be a huge problem, and begged him to just walk with me. He insisted on driving, and we hit traffic shortly after we left. I tried to convince him to turn around and leave the car at home, but he kept sitting in traffic, so I got fed up and got out of the car, and walked the rest of the way. It was awhile before he was able to meet up with me, because he ended up having to park at an overflow lot and take a shuttle! He apologized, and I thought maybe he would finally learn his lesson.

However, we got in another argument, when we were going to the grocery store. The store is literally 2 blocks away. I've only ever driven my car to the store once, and that was only because I was getting a bunch of really large items that wouldn't fit in my shopping cart. (And it later occurred to me that I could have just borrowed one of the store's shopping carts, which are larger). Usually I just walk with my shopping cart (an oversized basket on wheels, like a suitcase) and sometimes a tote bag, and that's all I need, it's really easy!

I got the shopping cart ready to go, and Adam sighed and said we didn't need that, we would just take his car. I said we weren't buying enough stuff to need the car, and that it would be much faster to just walk, since we wouldn't have to deal with getting a spot in the garage. He got really pissed, and said that we can afford cars, we don't have to walk, we aren't poor, and that I didn't need to be dragging my sad little cart behind me everywhere. I told him I was going without him, and that I would beat him to the store (which I did). 

He did end up grudgingly apologizing, but it seemed like he was just trying to smooth things over, rather than changing his behavior. This is getting to be a really obnoxious problem, any advice on how to handle it?

"I (40M) received a free trip from work, and my GF (39F) of 2 years, finds it unforgivable I am going without her.


Throwaway, though I am showing this link to my GF.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years and I love her more than anything in this world.  We don't live together, but I see her as often in the week as we can, which is about 2-4x a week.

One issue that we have had, is that I am unemployed.  I've worked corporate all my life, but left my company right before we started dating.  I own my own apartment and have no issue paying my bills and paying for dates.  But I don't have money for vacations and other expensive trips costing thousands of dollars.  

When we first started dating, we took one vacation together to Dominican Republic, with her mother and 13 year old daughter (she paid for her family flight and room and I paid for my own flight and room).  Since then, I have not been able to afford another trip.

About a year ago, I started to take up photography professionally.  A magazine found me and used me to shoot a spread for them.  That soon turned into multiple spreads in each issue, to then shooting celebrities for their cover.  Now this is not a huge magazine, most of you would never have even heard of it.  They are mostly local for some major metropolitan areas.  And because they are not a big company, I did these shoots unpaid.  But what I did receive was an amazing upgrade of my portfolio, as we shoot in amazing mansions and yachts, and I have shot some major celebrities that you would definitely know.  Also, I started to get sponsored by some major companies to use their gear for these shoots, giving me $20k in new gear so far.  Finally, the magazine has been offering to give me free trips for all the hard work.

To explain about these trips, basically there are resorts, hotels, etc that want to get written about in the magazine.  So they offer free flights and resort stays to writers of the magazine to get a mention.

Since I have been at the magazine, I have been offered a 1 week stay at a spa in Italy, as well as 2 other 1 week European stays.  They only offer 1 ticket, but I was told by staff that you can usually pay a ticket for someone else, and the hotel wouldn't mind if you have a second person staying in your room.  The resorts usually have a list of activities that they provide for you during the day, but then you meet up with your loved one at night.

I've turned down all the 1 week stays as 1.) Buying a ticket for my GF to Europe was just too expensive.  2.) I didn't want to be away for a week from my GF.   I was also offered a trip of a lifetime to go to South Africa for 2 weeks, with one of the highlights of that trip being a balloon ride over the Serengeti.  This trip is something you have to pay $10,000 or more for.  Again, I turned it down.

About a month ago, they offered me a trip upstate to a bed and breakfast hotel, so I accepted that one, and made the 3 hour trip by car with my GF.  We had a great time, though afterwards, my GF said it embarrassed her that we got the dinners for free.

I also went to Canada for 3 days/2night, with the editor in chief of the magazine, to shoot the cast of a TV show, but the shoot was canceled, so the editor and I just went to all these fancy restaurants the entire time there (again, everything was free).  I gained 10lbs. 

A little over a month ago, I was offered a trip to a beautiful resort in Jamaica for 3 days.  A trip worth about $4,000 with all the activities and inclusives.  This was exciting as I haven't gone on a ""vacation"" trip in almost 2 years.  I looked up flights for that trip and it was about $500 for another ticket.  So I signed up for it.  I talked with the PR people of the resort a few times.. and then waited.. and waited.. Not hearing back from them for 1-2 weeks.  Finally, a few days ago, I get an email with the tickets!  I immediately look online, and another ticket is now $1,000!  I can't afford that, especially for a 3 day trip.

My GF is PISSED.  She finds it unforgivable that I am going on a ""vacation"" without her.  I tried to explain to her that I don't have the money to buy her an extra ticket.  That the only 2 choices I have is to:

1.) Go on this trip, which is ""payment"" for over 100 hours of work I did for the magazine
2.) Not go on this trip, and waste the tickets, because we won't both be able to enjoy it.

Her reply is that a real man wouldn't go on a trip without their GF.  That this is not normal.  I said this is like a business trip.  The resort expected me to go to the activities it is assigning me to and then write about it as well as take photos.   It is totally 10000% normal.  She said that it wasn't.  That she has broken up with every other boyfriend that has ever gone on vacation without her.  

Now something important to note.  My GF has gone on 3 vacations this year without me, with her mother and daughter.  2 trips to Florida and 1 trip 6 hours away to the lake.  She has invited me on all 3 trips, but I couldn't afford to go, so I had to decline.  She knows I couldn't go because of the cost.  Additionally, the trip to the lake was only supposed to be for 1 week, but then she kept extending it for longer and longer.

So to me, the fact that she is able to go on trips with no issue without me, but has an issue with me going without her, is really troubling.  She says no, that she invited me to go with her on her trips, it's not her fault that I couldn't pay to go.  I replied that she is 1000% invited to go with me on my trip, but there is no way for me to pay for her to go!  

I've asked her how we can solve this issue.  What does she want me to do.  She won't give me an answer.  She has no solutions.  No offers to split the cost of the trip, no offers of any kind.  Just complaints after complaints making me miserable and honestly, dreading this trip.  When she went on her vacations, I was sad and missed her, but I supported her and was 100% loving the entire time.  When she kept extending her lake trip, I was resentful that she had no issue spending more and more time away from me, but again, I never expressed that to her in any way and just told her that I missed her terribly and hoped she was having fun.

So.. r/relationships.  What should I do?  Am I in the right?  Is she in the right?  

**Update**: My GF has read what I written and said I cast her in a bad light.  I replied I am showing the exact facts.  My GF does love me, and I love to be with her. It kills me that she won't be there with me.  I will miss her the entire time and wish she was there with me.   But this argument is ridiculous.  The fact that she is being so unsupportive of me and trying to ruin my trip, while I have always supported her trips is really troubling to me.  Additionally, she is INSISTING that this is not a work trip.  My response is that while this is not a conventional work trip, where I will be sitting in meetings in an office, this is still technically one as it is provided by the company, and I will have responsibilities while there.

  **tl;dr**: Going on a work/vacation trip and my GF is upset that I am not taking her.  What should I do?"
"UPDATE: I [39F] am concerned about my husband's [40M] relationship with his coworker/subordinate [24F] at the boarding school where we all live and work.


Previous discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4raao3/i_39f_am_concerned_about_my_husbands_40m/). It didn't get tons of attention, but it was helpful to air out the issue, and anyways I know people love reading about scurrilous drama on the internet, so here we go.

School is starting back up again and faculty are reconnecting and mingling after a summer largely spent away from campus. Grace was a no-show; apparently over the summer she got another job and moved to a city several hours away. Good riddance. The apartment down the hall has been taken by a single middle-aged biology teacher with whom I've always gotten along. Awesome.

But, through a series of events as convoluted as they are boring (very long story short: someone told someone else who told me), I've learned that Chris has been not nearly as forthcoming about his relationship with Grace as I thought.

Basically, Grace and my husband sloppily made out at several faculty gatherings. He was always drunk when it happened and it it never went beyond there. The same could not be said for Grace's friend ""Amy"" who's around the same age as Grace and also teaches in their department. On one occasion drunkenly Amy and Chris sucked face in the backseat of a car with two other coworkers in front. They then made their way to Grace's apartment, where they stayed the night. Chris had told me he was going to be staying with a buddy of his so they could go hunting the next morning.

Why couldn't they go back to Amy's place, you ask? Well, because at the time Amy was living at the headmaster's house. Because she's his granddaughter.

I confronted Chris about this and he came clean right away. He said that he had enjoyed receiving attention from these younger women and had been attempting to re-live his 20s by partying with them. He said that they reminded him of a younger version of me. (Which I can see: Amy, Grace, and I are all skinny, flat-chested brunettes with shoulder-length hair.) He said he had been drinking far too much and losing control of his boundaries. He was, he claimed, too ashamed to tell me. I want to believe him.

Right now we're keeping things quiet. Boarding school politics could make this a very complicated situation, and I am still debating whether I want to stay married to Chris. I love him and we have two terrific kids to whom we're good co-parents, but I have never known him to keep things from me and I'm not sure I can trust him again. Once a cheater, always a cheater? I'm not sure.

  **tl;dr**: My husband has had sexual interactions with two female colleagues, both of whom are his subordinates. I'm processing things as best I can."
"I [15F] have really bad period pain but my parents [37F+40M] don’t believe me.


I’m not sure if this is the right place but I wasn’t really sure where else. I have been having periods since I was 13 but over the past year as they got more regular they have become really bad. They only last about about five days but the first three days are extremely painful. I think its worse then normal cramps, the pain is so bad I sometimes throw up, its similar to the pain I felt when I had to have my appendix removed. The first two or three days I can’t really get out of bed and just have to curl  up in a ball for hours. I have had to miss days of school and shifts at work because it. I have tried taking different pain killers but they don’t do very much.

I have told my mum about it but she thinks I’m making it up. She thinks I’m just trying to get days off school and the thing is I have lied about being sick to get days off in the past and its kind of like the boy who cried wolf now. I have also told my dad and he just said I was being a drama queen and need to get over myself. I have asked them to take me to a doctor (we live about an hours drive away and public transport is almost nonexistent) in case something really is wrong but they say that they aren’t going to feed into it.

 The more I bring it up the more mum refuses to talk to me about it and now she has started ignoring me completely. The other day I tried to ask talk to my dad about it and he made some pretty gross jokes in front of the whole family. It has kind of become a household joke now and its really embarrassing. 

Any advice on what to do is very welcome.

**TL;DR** I have really bad period pain and am normally unable to leave my bed for two or three days. I can’t get myself to a doctor because public transport is almost nonexistent here and my parents don’t believe me.

"(Update!) My [37M] much younger BF [24M] has a daddy kink and I'm not sure if I can go along with it


Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51suqf/my_37m_much_younger_bf_24m_has_a_daddy_kink_and/?st=iswt04nq&amp;sh=b2f8b3a1

Kind of silly to update something like this, but I figured why not - a few people asked.

I wrote out a note to my boyfriend that basically said ""I'm sorry for being an insensitive dick, I'd like to talk about your kink if you're up for it"" and passed it to him after dinner. Luckily, neither of us clammed up and we were able to talk it out.

He told me he has different wants out of the dynamic, but ultimately, he wants more praise, more physical affection, and to be taken care of (he summarized with ""daddy kink but not ageplay""). He also mentioned discipline and chores and things, but that was more of an afterthought. We'll be talking more in-depth later on this week, but so far, I'll be happy to provide what he wants and needs from me.

We also talked a bit about my age insecurity, but he assured me he loved me for me, not just because I was an older guy. Thanks to everyone for telling me the same thing haha

I'll be heading over to other communities to get help there, rather than bug you guys again, but thank you for the responses on the original post!

**tldr: who knew communication was important. boyfriend told me what he wanted, and I can provide!**"
"[22 M] Call me crazy, but I think my housemates [28 M, 28 M] are spying on me.


I chose not to use a throwaway account for this post, because, hell, maybe I *want* my roommates to see it. That is, if my fears are correct and they are actually tapping my phone and computer. 

It was brought to my attention a couple months ago, and then again this week, that my phone, computer, and all my personal and private online activity is possibly being monitored and recorded by my housemates. I need a second opinion to determine if there are any grounds to my suspicions, and if so, what my next step should be. 

I wish I could just cut to the chase and tell you exactly what I've witnessed and all the evidence I have of this occurring, but unless I paint a broad picture, it all just sounds like crazy talk.

I suppose I should start from the beginning. A year ago, I [22, M] moved into a two-bedroom apartment with two friends-of-friends [both 28, M] who are brothers. They shared a bedroom, I was in my own room. We got along great at first, and we still get along well enough face-to-face, for the most part. I pay rent on time and carry my share of the load around the house. I'm friendly and try to be considerate of other people's space. I mean, I'm sure there are *some* things I do that annoy them, the same way some petty things they do annoy me too. But other than that, I can't think of any reason they would have to conspire against me and violate my private life in such a way, other than the fact that they *can,* presumably. 

My roommates are very close brothers, so they spend a huge amount of time in their room, online, playing video games together. One of my roommates fancies himself a popular Twitch streamer, and has a huge expensive gaming rig he built, so I'm sure he knows his way around a PC. He was also good at coding in high school, so I know he's very tech savvy. Due to his heavy internet use from streaming, he offered at the beginning of the apartment lease to pay for the entirety of the internet bill. Okay, that's fair, right? 

It wasn't until about six months ago that I started noticing problems with my Android phone usually involving the Wi-Fi network at home. Connections would cut in and out, I started receiving a mild amount of popups and spam, I would come home from work and have to re-introduce my phone to the network (same router I've owned for years, same network SSID and everything). I didn't think anything sinister was happening, until **I started hearing my roommates talking about what I was doing online.** 

My roommates both have very distinct, booming voices, and the walls of our apartment aren't exactly soundproof. If I recall correctly, the first thing I overheard them talking about was my comment history of this very Reddit account. I couldn't tell if my ears were tricking me, because when you're overhearing dialogue from another room with the doors closed, you never can really be sure. But sure enough, over the next few days, I felt more and more like I was being spectated at home. I kept thinking I could hear my roommates narrating my online activity to each other, or to their Twitch stream, or whoever. I overheard vague descriptions of my Snapchats, who I was messaging, etc. One morning in bed, I started perusing the-- ahem... PG-13 side of Reddit, and I overheard my roommate immediately wake his brother up in a very excited, hushed voice, presumably to show him what gets my rocks off. 

At this point, I was pushed to the point of anger, but it wasn't like I could just confront my roommates about this very loose suspicion. I didn't want to accuse them of something I know very little about. So instead, I opened up a Google Document on my phone, titled it as my roommates' names, and wrote a brief yet direct warning /promise to move out if they continued invading my privacy. And I just left the note pinned open on my phone. That way, if they *were* to ""stumble across"" my little note, they would maybe leave me alone and take me more seriously... aaaand if they didn't see it then maybe I was wrong about them all along, no harm done. 

But after my little warning shot, either they got better at hiding it, or they stopped monitoring me altogether... ^^Or ^^they ^^were ^^never ^^doing ^^it ^^in ^^the ^^first ^^place... Because I stopped overhearing them talking about me, the Wi-Fi and data on my phone was functioning normally, etc. From then on, I stopped seeing the signs of being watched. Maybe it was all in my head after all, right?

Welp, I started seeing those signs again this week. My phone started acting up again when my roommates had one of their techy friends over, and then I was being booted off the internet *while they were streaming*. On top of that, The other night I overheard them talking about my girlfriend. I was standing right outside their goddamn door when I heard him sarcastically say he ""checked out [my girlfriend's] photo work"" among other shitty little comments about her/ our private pictures and content on her phone.  

I could try to forgive and forget about them invading my privacy for so long, maybe I deserve it for being the jackass who signed a lease with these guys. But my girlfriend doesn't even live with us, has every right to her privacy, and her only mistake was asking for the Wi-Fi password, apparently. **We just entered into our last month on the lease of the apartment**, and since we're all moving anyways, my little threat to them about moving out doesn't really pack a punch anymore. I suppose the obvious solution to this is to move out ASAP and get the hell away from my roommates and don't even bother bringing it up, but, in theory, they still hold all my information and passwords and could do a lot of damage. I don't really care so much if they're snooping on what gets me hard, or what I'm ordering on Amazon, or even how much is in my bank account, because let's face it **I have nothing to hide**. And honestly I don't hate them for it. They aren't blatantly malicious or truly bad guys. They're just total assholes with extremely twisted senses of humor. But if they can wittingly do this to me, as well as my girlfriend, who's to say they haven't been spying on our neighbors? What else are they capable of doing?

**That's why I need your help**. I mean, do I sound crazy? Paranoid? Is it possible I have just been hearing what I wanted to hear? Or could I actually be onto something? If there is any solid basis to my story then I think it's only right to confront my roommates. But in terms of tangible proof, I have none. I'm not an inflammatory kind of person who will make accusations willy-nilly with nothing to back it up. Especially when I know it will end up being a two-on-one argument. However, I still owe this last month's cut of rent. And I don't feel like being the jackass to just fork it over when I still feel so wronged by this. I just don't have the ethical or technical ability to move forward without more convincing. Because I don't know if I'm right about this.

~~Lastly, Loggy, if you're reading this, if you wanted a picture of my dick you could have just asked.~~ 

**TL;DR Started having suspicions that my two roommates were tapping into my phone/computer through the Wi-Fi. I overheard them talking about my private life on multiple occasions until I subtly let them know I knew what they were doing. Now it is our last month of living together and they ""allegedly"" started snooping again, on my girlfriend as well. I want to know if there is any grounds to my suspicion, before I make any accusations or pay them for this month's rent.**"
