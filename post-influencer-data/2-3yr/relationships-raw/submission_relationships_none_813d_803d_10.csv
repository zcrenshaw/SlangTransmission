"UPDATE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend [26M] of 3 years. He makes ""joking"" comments about my body sometimes.


[Link to original](https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6muq1a/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_3_years_he_makes/)

Okay wow! So I want to start off saying how much I appreciate all your feedback and support! I did read **every** comment in the thread! I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did but the support has helped me in many ways!

I talked to my boyfriend last night after we had settled in, ate dinner, and relaxed. I asked if I could talk to him about something and just told him ""I really don't like it when you come up to me and say things about my body like 'hey babe you need to hit the gym, when are you going to do squats, etc'. It's not very nice and I don't say things like that to you.""

I could see the gears turning in his head and he really did seem surprised it bothered me so much. He apologized profusely and told me he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thinks I am beautiful and he loves everything about me. I told him I appreciated his apology and that pretty much summed up the conversation. He apologized again a little bit later so I think it was still on his mind.

So that was that. It truly was as simple as most of you told me it should be. However this has brought my relationship with my dad to my attention and made me realize why I put up with those comments from my boyfriend for so long. I really have been conditioned to brush those things off because of the reaction I expect when I say something about them. Habits die hard I guess!

I put a lot of thought into how to handle the situation if my boyfriend did anything but apologize. I plan on using those ideas and what I have taken from my last thread to confront my dad. Next time he says something rude about me or one of my siblings I plan on asking him why he does it and telling him I don't like it. When he tells me it's a joke I will tell him it isn't funny. I will ask him if a joke is really worth damaging his relationship with his family. I have realized that I have to approach this situation differently than I have before and I hope in resonates with my dad.

I do want to say my dad is not a bad person. He is definitely an asshole sometimes but he is a product of circumstance and there is a lot going on in our lives. This is no excuse for the mean things he says but I do want you all to know that he loves his family deeply and has sacrificed all of himself to keep our heads above water. I wouldn't trade him for the world!

My boyfriend is also not a bad person. He does stupid things and so do I but we do love each other. It's always easy to demonize someone by getting only one perspective and knowing nothing about the people involved. While it will never be okay to say things like that to someone, when his comments initially started I did not properly communicate with him about how it made me feel and by laughing it off I was condoning it. I know why now, but that also doesn't excuse my poor communication with my boyfriend. I will learn from this!

I will add in that I of course expect him to follow through with this apology. Sorry only counts if your actions reflect it as well. I don't expect to encounter this problem again but I do know how I will handle it if I have to, thanks to you all!

So I do want to end with another thank you! Sometimes the psychology behind small problems can reveal large problems and it takes a lot of support to face those! All of you that take time to think critically about other's problems and type up advice are really doing something great!

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend apologized when confronted. I intend to also confront my dad in the future and have learned some lessons about communication!"

"I [24 M] have to take my father [57] off of life support today.


I posted an earlier story about the events leading to this if you are curious.

My father has been on life support since he collapsed at 12am on 7/5/17. His heart had stopped for 8-10 minutes before he was treated. The hospital did a lot of tests to determine brain death, and yesterday they told us the bad news, that he was certainly already gone and the time of death was called. 

My family and I decided, knowing my father's wonderful giving spirit, should be an organ donor. Honestly my dad would be surprised and thrilled to know some of his organs are viable. So last night we signed the documents which prepare him for the donation process. 

Today, most likely they will take him off life support to try and recover the organs they can. I understand that he is already gone and he is basically now an empty shell/cadaver which they are preserving with advanced technology. But still, I feel it may be very difficult for me today to actually say goodbye and see him with his heart beating for the last time. Now I'm trying to figure out how to cope with this.

**tl;dr:** I'm trying to figure out the best way to cope with the finality of taking my father off of life support.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your kindness, I shared this post with my family and they are floored by how much advice and sympathy we've gotten. 

I felt the urge to show you all this picture of me, my dad and my brother. It is my favorite picture of us three and I will cherish it forever. http://imgur.com/a/hb6gS"

"Problems [32M] with my GF [33F] of just under a year who just informed me she's part of an MLM program


Hi everyone!

So, I'll dive right in. My gf took me to a ""meeting"" that she said was important to her the other night. Turned out to be an MLM presentation for World Wide Dream Builders which is basically an AMO (amway motivational organization).

Basically, it's amway but they tell you that you have to earn a mentorship from them (by buying things and going to paid events) and then they will teach you to be a debt free cash flow something or other.

I was floored and shocked at what I was at and as you can probably guess, I have a less than stellar opinion of these things. This was the first I was hearing of this. She had gone to some conference a few months back and wouldn't tell me what it was because ""I would probably just google it"" and ""that's not the way I should learn about it"". 

The people speaking to the 1500+ people at this event the other night are the ones that she is trying to ""earn"" a mentorship from. She feels as though they are her best friends and some of the greatest people she's ever met and I should feel privileged to have gotten the chance to hear them speak. 

I felt dirty, not privileged when I left the event. She told me that ""these are the two best people that YOU will ever get the chance to meet in your life and you should feel privileged to even have the chance to hear them speak."" I don't want to use the term brain-washed, but I want to. 

We talked about it last night and it did not go well. I told her that if she wanted to do this, I would support her but I did not want to be an active part of it. This does not seem to be okay with her and she is ""disappointed in me."" and she will be dedicating a majority of her time to ""building this asset"" going forward. 

I would really like to make this work but I'm not really sure if that is possible.  Any suggestions or similar experiences? We are supposed to talk again tonight when she gets off work.

"How do I(24f) politely extricate myself from being witnessed to?


I have been witnessed to twice this year, once during a sale from offerup and again today at work with a coworker. The first time was super uncomfortable because it was this older man who thought I needed saving and I was just trying to buy a shelf from him. It ended up taking an hour because he spoke for so long and he also kept poking his finger super close to my chest and did make contact a few times.





Today at work a coworker I was working side by side with asked if my partner and I are the same religion and when I told her we weren't religious she was so surprised and asked me a lot of questions about what I believe(nothing) which I don't mind at all. It was harmless and she wasn't being judgemental or anything but then she talked for thirty minutes about how much she loves Jesus and how she prays and he speaks to her in her dreams and all this other stuff about atheists changing their minds and it was just so much. All I could do was make polite listening sounds and say ""wow that's crazy"" the whole time. 


 I am very shy and nonconfrontational to a fault but how can I politely tell people I don't want to be witnessed to? I don't want to be rude but I really am not going to change my mind on it and I don't really want to talk about how much someone loves Jesus for so long.




**tl;dr: I'm too shy to tell people I don't want to hear about Jesus**



edit: I've been reading through this entire thread and want to thank everyone for the advice. I definitely need to work on setting boundaries and I'll practice at home. This kind of thing happens a lot where I'm stuck in uncomfortable conversations where someone will break the politeness contract so I will try to remember that they're rude, not me."

Boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. Got into a stupid argument which escalated into a massive fight because neither of us could let it go earlier this morning. Some yelling and blaming was done on both parts but I refrained from any name calling or taking any irrelevant hurtful jabs. We were yelling and stopped for a second and stared at each other when he said to me ""You are cancer in my life."" My mom had stage 3 cancer for 4 years. He knows about it and he knows it's a word that holds a lot of emotional ammo. I cried. A lot. We fought a little more, but I was too tired and cried out to keep going and he had to head to work. He's been at work for a few hours now but ive been sitting in my bedroom just feeling kinda numb after hearing that. 

How do I deal with this? No one has ever said anything remotely this hurtful to me before. Is this forgiveable? Do I talk to him about this? 

Tl;dr: boyfriend of 2 years said im cancer to his life. Don't know how to deal with this. Advice/opinions welcome. Thank you.

"My friend/bridesmaid [28F] dropped out of the wedding/ended our friendship sent me [25F] a text months later... I'm not sure how to/if I should respond.


Diane and I had been friends for 5 years and I thought of her to be one of my closest friends. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding last year and she was supposed to be one in mine this year. 

Things seemed normal.  We work at the same company and had lunch most days, she went dress shopping with me and got her BM dress for the wedding, we got our nails done together regularly, her husband was super excited for our wedding, etc.  Nothing really felt out of the ordinary to me. 

Then in Feb, she told me she couldn't be a BM anymore.  I initially thought it was a time/money thing but then she said it was bc she didn't feel like our friendship was in a good place and that our lives were going in different directions and there was too much rivalry between us. I honestly didn't know what she was talking about. I asked her what this meant then... Were we still friends?  Was she coming to the wedding as a guest? 

She said she didn't know but still wanted to have lunch once in a while.  I told her I couldn't do that.  It felt too much like trying to stay friends with an ex.  If she felt so strongly about us then I'd rather not have a half assed friend like that. 

So I deleted her number, threw out the trinkets from her wedding and such.  It honestly felt like a romantic break up haha.  But I got over it. 

Today out of nowhere she texted me a screenshot of Facebook of a pic of my cat with a toy she bought her (hence she was tagged) 4 yrs ago.  It was one of those Facebook ""remember this?"" things and this text:

""I know you still don't want anything to do with me and that's cool but this came up on my Facebook news feed and I thought I would send it along. I almost forgot how little she was when you first got her. And happy anniversary with her because I know that was last week.""

I feel like she makes it sound like I ended our friendship for no apparent reason.  I'm not sure how to feel about this and just haven't replied.  I probably won't, but I was just feel confused and maybe just needed to vent.  What do you thing? 

tl:dr:  friend cut off friendship randomly and then randomly texted me again as if I was the one to cut her off.  Unsure how to feel. "
"Me [33 F] with my husband [32 M] of 10 years, he does more cooking and unhappy with the balance but SUPER particular about it


My husband and I have been married for 10 years, together since high school. We love each other a lot, have a ton of fun together, and we're a great team, but like a lot of couples we have the same fight CONSTANTLY.  

Ours revolves around chores, specifically cooking. Back when we first got married, we moved for his job and I did almost all of the cooking while I was looking for a job and then for a couple of years after I got a job. Over time that's shifted--my job got a lot more demanding and his got less demanding, we moved and both started working from home and he started making us lunch every day (I usually am too busy during the work day to cook, I'm happy to have leftovers or canned soup or just little snacks when I'm making my own lunch, he wants ""a real meal""), he got into cooking as a hobby and started voluntarily doing a lot of grilling, etc.  

The problem is that he now complains that I don't do enough, but when I do either cook something on my own or ESPECIALLY when I pitch in on something that he's planned, he expects everything to be done the way he would have and complains when it isn't.  So, for example, last night he had planned either salad or this zucchini, sausage, tomato sauce thing with some pasta. We don't usually eat pasta but we have 2 boxes of gluten-free stuff that he bought on accident a few weeks ago. We had just gotten back from the gym so I said I'd take care of making dinner while he went to play some video games and grab a shower. I'm a pretty good cook myself and I made a really solid dinner, used an entire box of pasta and all of the zucchini and sausage to make a huge amount so we can have leftovers and it'll take some pressure off of him for lunches. 

He haaaated it--apparently he only wanted like a quarter of the pasta in the box to be made plus all of the zucchini so he could eat mostly vegetables, started saying a bunch of stuff like, ""oh I thought about measuring out a quarter of the box for you but I figured you could handle yourself.""  I pushed back saying that if he wanted something specific he could have given specific directions and if he wants me to make dinner he can let me make dinner.  He ended up bringing it back up this morning and said I've been ""terrible help"" this entire week (there was another thing on Sunday where I threw away some extremely sad looking basil while I was cleaning the kitchen, turned out that was the GOOD basil that he had picked out of a bunch and washed up and for some reason had left laying out on a cutting board on the counter) and that I make decisions in the kitchen that are ""insane"" and that if I ""just think about things for ten seconds"" I would obviously make the same decisions that he makes.

It's basically like--he wants me to do more work in the kitchen but ONLY if I can be a clone of him or like, his employee or a robot automaton. If I do anything wrong, whether it's actually wrong or just deviates from how he would have done it in some way, he gets really grumpy and often insults me.

"My BF (24M) of over 2 years says it makes him uncomfortable when I (24F) discuss our future.


My boyfriend and I just had a massive argument. We have been together more than two years, lived together most of that time, have a dog and multiple businesses together. I was of the expectation that I could talk lightly of the future - such as when we were watching a program with spoilt children I jokingly said ""Oh god I hope our kids don't turn out like that lol"".

However today he said something like ""my children"" and then he corrected himself and said ""Oh wait I mean our children. Lol but not really - we're no where near that stage!"". I was a little taken aback. I know we are not at a stage to actually have children but I thought it was acceptable to fleetingly talk about the future?

We talk about where the businesses are going to end up in 5, 6, 7 years so why can't we discuss us? He claims that I could turn out to be a bitch in 2 years and we break up, or I could get knocked down and die etc. Well yeah - anything could happen, but that shouldn't stop you from lightly discussing what you would *like* to see happening. 

I am in no way planning kids now - I have however voiced that it's important to me to have my first child before 30. I feel it's incredibly important to discuss your long term life plans with someone you're in a relationship with so that you don't end up spending 10 years with someone who actually wants different things. In my own words I said ""I would rather know now if you, for example, wanted to wait until you're 35 to have kids, because I probably couldn't stay in the relationship. It would be wasteful to spend years in a relationship that would end anyway if we had different goals so it's better to find out if we are on the same wavelength now"". He took this to mean that the relationship is ""worthless unless you get a baby out of it"". Which just isn't true. My life long goal IS to have a family and I can understand that someone might not comprehend this, but all I wanted was to make it clear that there really isn't a point to a long term relationship in my opinion if you are going to go separate ways 10 years down the line due to separate goals. 

He said that most guys would run away from me. That I'm neurotic and still a ""girl"" and much too young to be thinking about these things. Guys, I'm almost mid 20s. Of course it's young but I'm not a fucking child. I started crying and he said I was so selfish and manipulative crying to end the conversation. I was looking at my hands as I was so upset and FELT like a kid, and he said I didn't even have the decency to look him in the eye as he was speaking. I'm just so sad.

Am I completely insane to speak of the future the odd time? He says it makes him uncomfortable but it's going to really be hard for me to never discuss my future with the person who I WANT to spend my life with. How do I voice my opinions to him when he seems to think I'm neurotic and weird?

TLDR boyfriend thinks I'm neurotic for discussing our future together"
"[UPDATE] I [27f] just ended a toxic relationship [43m/2yrs] and I needed to tell someone...


Relationships can be so hard, so understandably there tends to be a lot of sorrow in this sub. Well, here is something a little bit brighter as well as some life lessons...

[Original post here.](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ndfkk/i_27f_just_ended_a_toxic_relationship_43m2yrs_and/)

**Sometimes the hardest thing to do is also the right thing.** Note, this is coming from someone with no kids involved and no marriage. I can't tell ya what to do in that situation, I have no idea. However, I ended a horribly toxic relationship over half a year ago. Reddit, y'all were very helpful and supportive! After months of therapy, moving into my own place with some new friends in my old hometown, focusing on my hobbies/community/family/friends, I can actually say I'm doing well. I even met someone new that honestly... treats me so well that I think I could cry! I've never felt so loved and heard in my whole life!

So, I've learned a couple things:
 
* When you **close the door on people that hurt you, you make room and open doors for good people that will lift you up.**

* Also, **being alone is not the worse thing; being with the WRONG person is far worse.** Sometimes in a break up you think, *""Oh, the years I wasted!""* But that's ridiculous. Just imagine how many more years you could have wasted in that failing relationship! Relationships are work but they shouldn't be THAT hard...

* Finally, it's okay to make mistakes. **Don't let your pride and ego fool you into staying in a toxic situation.** My ex said that he didn't want to break up because he didn't want to ""seem foolish."" Breaking up is ""admitting that you made a mistake."" As if that's a good reason to stay together! Nah, get out and live your life.
  
So thanks again for all the support, and **feel free to share your experiences/advice after leaving a toxic relationship too!** Also, if you suspect that you are in an abusive/toxic relationship or that you may be with a narcissist, PLEASE reach out, even if it's just to this sub! I wish y'all the best! 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**:  Ended a ridiculously toxic relationship. Reddit, y'all were very supportive and I just want you to know that I've never felt so good. Therapy, focusing on friends and hobbies, learning from mistakes and choosing to only spend time with those that lift you up were essential. 

Again, if you suspect that you are in an abusive/toxic relationship or that you may be with a narcissist, PLEASE reach out, even if it's just to this sub! Take care of yourself!  "

"I [19M] feel like my sister's [24F] girlfriend [24F] really doesn't like me and I don't feel comfortable being around her. What can I do without coming off as rude or homophobic?


First of all, I just want to say that I've known my sister has been gay for many years, even since she was in the closet back when we were teens.  I was the first person she ever told and I was the only person who knew for 5 years before she openly came out to our family and friends.

So I'm definitely very supportive of her, and I've been supportive of her my whole life.  I definitely don't have anything against it and all I want is for her to have a happy and amazing life and find love with whomever she finds. 

I'm just saying all this so you know that I have no issue at all with LGBT relationships and I'm wholly supportive, and my discomfort does not stem from any bigotry or anything, but from this particular person and her attitude towards me.

Now, this woman who is my sister's girlfriend, my sister has been her partner for about a year now, I believe.  They have a very excellent relationship with each other, and there's no issues between them that I know of.

When I first met my sister's girlfriend, we got along close, but as time passed I always felt that she kind of really doesn't like me, and that only got worse.  I don't know why, but I've been as nice and polite I can to her, and I've tried treating her like she's my own sister and being open and friendly with her, but I still always get the feeling she doesn't want me around.

The only thing I can think of is perhaps it's some kind of jealousy.  She's jealous that since I'm my sister's little brother, I spend much more time with her than she does (my sister and I both still live at home with our parents though my sister is planning and saving up on moving out, things are just a bit expensive at the moment).  I think she's kind of envious that my sister and I have a close relationship and she wishes she could spend much more time around my sister like I do, and she get's envious of any affection my sister shows to me.  She kind of feel my sister is ""hers"", hence she gets angry at me the brother whenever my sister remotely spends any time with me.

I don't know if this is true or not, it's just my theory.  I haven't brought it up with anyone.  I've asked my sister several times if she thinks her girlfriend hates me or doesn't like it when I'm around, she says it's ""nonsense"" and that ""she thinks I'm funny"" and has no problem with me.  I can't help but feel that's not true at all.

In the past the three of us used to hang out a lot, but recently I've been trying to make an effort to avoid being with the two of them, but I kind of run out of excuses eventually.  It's little things in the girlfriend's behaviour that indicate to me she doesn't like me: for example, occasionally I catch her scowling at me or with a grimace on her face.  Whenever there's an interaction between me and my sister, or I say something or try to join a conversation or voice my opinion, she rolls her eyes or sighs.  She answers my questions abruptly like ""yep"" or ""i dunno"", never full sentences of anything.  She get's really seemingly unhappy when my sister displays any physical affection towards me, like if she hugs me, or kisses me on the cheek, or says ""I love you"", and stuff like that.  My sister is really warm and kind-hearted towards me and still treats me a bit like a child and spoils me sometimes even though I'm 19, but she does that stuff a lot to me, and her girlfriend always would like sigh loudly or fold her arms or start pacing when that happens.

Whenever I'm talking on the phone to my sister, and I know her girlfriend is with her, I kinda get the sense her girlfriend is rushing her on the other end of the phone to hang up with me and end the conversation.  I feel like her girlfriend is impatient at any time she spends with me.

My sister and her girlfriend are over at our house a lot, and I'm also there a lot, so I do inevitably run into them a lot.  And that's when we're not out at the cafe or shops together (as I said, we used to do that stuff the three of us a lot more before, but I've been trying to do it less recently to give them more time together but not piss off the girlfriend).  Unfortunately it's usually my sister who always insists I come hang out.  Her girlfriend would say stuff like ""oh, he doesn't have to come if he doesn't want to"", and my sister would say stuff like ""no, he has to leave his batcave once in a while"".  As I said, whenever we're at home, or out together, my sister always likes to be overly touchy or affectionate, always hugging me or whatever, and I feel like she's almost completely unaware how obviously pissed her girlfriend gets at this.  Like sometimes the girlfriend would loudly mutter ""oh my god"" or sigh loudly and get irritated.  She'd give me the evil eye, and ignore or give abrupt answers to my questions.

A few times it's even resulted in an open argument, between my sister and her girlfriend, and I can't help but feel I'm the cause.  Like I'd say something, and her girlfriend would either rudely shut me down or say something sorta rudeish or insulting towards me, and my sister would angrily reply ""don't talk to him like that"" and would start defending me over-aggressively, and then her girlfriend would back down.  It's really intense and it makes me feel worried that there might be something going on in their relationship that I don't know about.

Any idea what I can do?  I really want to get along with both of them, but I don't want to jeopardise the relationship between them.  I'd like to get along with my sister's girlfriend but I feel she just hates me and there's nothing I can do about it.  What should I do?

  **tl;dr**: My sister's girlfriend seemingly really doesn't like me and I get really uncomfortable around her because she's kinda mean to me.  What can I do to handle this situation without being rude and without jeopardising the relationship between her and my sister? Thanks."
"Me [22F], my sister[18F], and my cousin [16F] pulled a prank on our family, now they aren't speaking to us


My 16F cousin is visiting from another country. We were at the mall joking about how since I'm over 21, in our state I could legally be her guardian to get her a tattoo or piercing. Eventually we decided to get her a fake belly button ring, and prank our family by telling everyone that I took her to get her belly button pierced.

We're from a pretty conservative culture but our family tries very hard to be progressive and open minded, so we thought it'd be funny because they'd be horrified but try very hard not to be. Anyway, that's exactly what happened and it was hilarious. But then when we told them it was fake, they all got really really angry and haven't spoken to us since. 

They're mostly mad at me, and I can accept that since I'm the oldest. I agree that it was immature and silly, but it was perfectly harmless? We prank each other a lot in our family. I'm trying to see it from their POV and I must be missing something because I just don't think it was THAT bad. Would really like some outside perspectives.

"Friend [23F] thinks I'm [25M] being unreasonable by cutting contact with her if she gets back with her ex [24M]


I lived with my friend's ex when I was at university. He was an absolute waste of space, caused constant drama in the house by stirring the pot, which I partially blame for me ending up with depression when I was at University. It was an awful environment.

My friend started dating her ex in 2013. This is how I met her, and when I fully realised how manipulative my house mate could be. He used to make fake accounts to stalk her, while cheating on her. According to her he also hit her amongst other things. He was an abusive boyfriend and until recently she even agreed with that.

I noticed recently that she started to mention him more often. I tried to steer the conversation away from it because basically I detest the guy and would rather forget about him existing. Then she told me they went on a night out together and they're on 'speaking terms' now.

I told her that in no way will I be around this guy, and she's an absolute idiot for wanting to be in contact with someone who treated her badly. For my own mental sake (and hers really) as I want nothing to do with him, I told her that if she makes friends with him I will cut contact with her because I don't want any drama. This guy could find drama in an empty room so if he found out we still talked he would try and stir it up anyway. 

She told me that I was being way too harsh and that was it her life, not mine. I told her that yes I agree with that, but I also have the luxury of choosing who my friends are since its my life, so I basically gave her an ultimatum. I feel like I'm well within my rights to do this.

TL;DR: Friend has started talking to her abusive ex boyfriend again who was also my room mate. He abused her, and was a reason for me falling into depression. I have told her if she does properly forgive him, I will cut her off because I would not support her choice and for my own mental well being as he would likely start drama with me. She thinks I'm over reacting, I think it's a fair request considering the circumstances. What do I do?"

"I[17F] don't know how to deal with my sister[32F] or her daughter[6F].


For my graduation present back in early June my mom bought me an iPhone 7 which was a huge update from my old iPhone 5. My old iPhone 5 has all my old pictures from Junior to Senior year. The day after I got my new phone, my bratty niece stated to me that I have to clear all my items off my old iPhone 5 to give to her, bc it's gonna be her's now. 

For starters: 
1. She's 6, I don't know why she's getting a phone. Personally, I think social media is pointless for her age and she already spends countless hours on their family iPad. It's quite terrifying and sad to me. 
2. She is a brat. She constantly yells at her mom and my mom. Cries on average 3x a day over tantrums and is incredibly rude for being 6! 
3. It's my phone and I paid for it, and I don't think she deserves it with the way she's acting. 

So today, I'm in the kitchen with my mom. I'm making a sandwich and she's cooking dinner and the doorbell starts ringing repeatedly, already telling me that my sister is at the door with her child. 

I quickly try to throw my sandwich together and escape, but they're already inside. Her daughter passes by me and says, ""You need to get your phone ready, because I want it today."" And my sister walks in, totally ignoring what her daughter said to me.

Now, I'm still making my plate of food and her daughter is repeatedly yelling how she wants ""her phone"" already. My sister yells, ""________, be quiet!"" And her daughter says, ""Mommy!! I already told you 80 freaking times already!!"". At that point I was appalled. Now, I don't wanna give them the phone, because I feel like it would be ME doing THEM a favor by not creating a monster!! 

I widen my eyes and mutter, ""Holy shit.."" looking down at my food. My sister says, ""Just give her the phone already!"" At this point my anger is increasing and I say back, ""I don't think I have to give her the phone?"" Her daughter chimes in saying, ""Um, yes you do! Give me the phone, stupid ______."" Calling me stupid. At this point my sister doesn't even care what her daughter is telling me. I walk away and she's pissed saying she'll cancel my phone plan. But at the end of the day I don't have to give her my phone I PAID FOR, for free, which is what she wants. And I can easily get a new phone plan. 

What do I do without starting more problems?? 

TLDR; my sister wants me to give her bratty daughter my old phone, THAT I PAID FOR, for free. Daughter gives a nasty attitude and I don't think she even deserves it. "
"I [26 F] asked my best friend [25 F] of 15 years to watch my animals while I was away for a few days, just accidentally saw on my camera that she barely stopped by.


I go out of state for work for 3-4 days maybe about 3-4 times a year. My best friend lives only about 10 minutes away from me so I usually pay her to take care of my 2 dogs and 2 cats. Recently, however, I watched her dog for her when her family went away on vacation so she said that I didn't have to pay her this time. I said that, since I had so much more pets that are kind of difficult for her to deal with, I would at least take her out to dinner afterwards.

For my dogs, they usually stay in my backyard when no one is home, unless it gets 90+ or high 80s with me being gone for a long time, then I leave them inside. She knows this and I went over it again right before I left.

I got back a couple of days ago and I asked how they were and she said annoying as usual (jokingly). Anyway, just right now I was bored, heard something at my front door and decided to check my front door cameras motion detection history for fun. I clicked on a random day and there was nothing, which was weird, because there's usually at least me showing up from or leaving for work. Then I realized that she never showed up that day, not to feed them or check up on them or anything. It was in the high 80's for temperature and they have a big jug of water but it probably needed to be checked on to make sure there was enough water for the heat.

After seeing that I checked the day before, when it was about 92 degrees, and she stopped by for about 7 minutes one time that day, not enough time if you were letting the dogs in because things need to be situated and moved our of the way of curious dog noses. 

The other day was, thankfully, also in the 80's but she still only came by for 5 or so minutes again and when I got home late the day after they had no water.

So, unless it's only for a day or two, I don't think I'll be asking her to watch them again, but my question is, do I tell her I know? I mean it sounds pretty convoluted , that I was randomly sitting there, poking through my cameras motion history and happened to land on the day she was supposed to be there. It would seem like I was spying on her, especially because I called her out on similar stuff before I got the camera (more payment related then dog related). She knows I have the camera, but probably forgot about it.

If I should tell her, what should I say? I definitely don't want to buy her dinner now.

"I [26F] discovered messages between boyfriend [29M] of 2 years and my stepbrother [23M], questioning relationship.


Just a little background; boyfriend (let's call him Greg, obviously not his real name) and I have been together for 2 years now, living together for the past 8 months. We have a very good relationship, have not had any major issues or fights at all since we got together.

Greg popped out for a quick trip to the supermarket today, and left his phone sitting on the kitchen counter. I was making dinner and didn't really notice it there until the message tone went off and I thought it was mine. Naturally I picked it up and saw a message from my stepbrother. Greg and I value privacy and so I have never been through his phone, or really would care to do so. Ordinarily after noticing it wasn't my phone I would have put it down but I was a bit taken aback; the message said 'Can't wait to see you again, only 2 days left...'.

As far as I am aware, Greg has plans to go see a friend the next town over on Saturday, (about a two hour drive) which he has been doing about twice a month, but planned to be home the same night. i've met this friend a couple of times but don't know him well. Greg and the stepbrother have always got on well, we don't see him particularly often, just when the whole family gets together (Christmas etc). At these kind of things my stepbrother does flirt a bit with Greg, but he is very flamboyant and a little like that with everyone. i wasn't aware that they were in contact, it's never been mentioned by Greg and I'm not overly close with the stepbrother. 

He is back from the supermarket and has obviously read the message but hasn't said anything about it. I don't want to look through Greg's phone, that would be a massive breach of trust in our relationship but I am unsure how to proceed. It is strange to me that Greg has even been communicating with the stepbrother let alone seems to have plans with him this weekend that haven't been mentioned to me (also is it worth noting the message says 'see you *again*' when as far as im aware they haven't seen each other recently?).  I don't want Greg to think I was snooping through his phone and I really do trust him, but this is all very odd. If I confront him then it would imply that I don't trust him and there is potentially a normal explanation for this. Do I bring it up or wait until the weekend to see what happens?
